good,"great place to work,good people to work for,if you like the game Tetris you will love this job"
good,"Um dia muito corrido, pois tinha-mos data e hora para entrega dos nossos serviços, por isso todos os funcionários tinha que ser pontuais na execução de suas tarefas."
good,"If you have a college degree and don't know what to do, go apply at Target because you'll get a promotion pretty quick if you give off good vibes and try your best.  If you don't, however, they are very slow to promote you, it can take years to get even a minor bump up, and even then the increase in pay isn't too spectacular and the responsibilities that go with it are pretty hefty."
good,I love working fast pace with customers. I love that everything is different every day.
good,"Great company to work for.  Target cares very much about the people that make them successful.  The work/life balance is the best  you will find, in a retailer.  The expectation is that you work every-other weekend and have one day off within the middle of the week as well.  Development is a large focus of the company and leads to great promotional opportunities.  I worked for Target for six years and very highly recommend the company as a great place to grow as a person and a leader."
good,Target is a great company that provides stability and opportunity for young professionals to develop their careers.
good,"I worked Backroom over night at Target for a couple of months. "
good,Target was a easy going job besides the holiday rush which was torcher its pretty much laid back. The pay isn't all that great you get raises based on what management thinks of you so if your not in one's favor your raise will reflect that.
good,"Overall Target was an enjoyable place to work; however, during the economic downturn team members had to do much more with much less and ultimately affected morale."
good,"We get to work head back to the warehouse part of Target then get on the line which includes you taking furniture or boxes of all sizes off the line fast then placing them on the pallets. Pallets can only be built to certain height and width. After pallets full you get pallet jack move it to the floor, or sometimes I would get in the semi and push boxes out to go down the line. After truck unload you go to the floor and work it all out."
good,"The boss is very understanding an easy going at all times! The other co-workers were also easy to get along with, which made your job somewhere you wanted to be each day! I enjoyed helping guests out each day that came into the store an working with my co-workers."
good,"I love working for the Target Company. Unfortunately, I have found that moving up within the company is not very easy to do and I am now forced to look for so elsewhere. On a typical day, my day consists of running Guest Services (returns, sales, complaints, compliments, reshop sorting)  and/ or managing the front lanes (cashiers, guest service authorizations, setting planograms, etc.). I am fun, goal driven, and strive to get the job done effectively and efficiently."
good,Supervising workflow and efficiency of team members. Personal interaction with customers on a daily basis.
good,"Unloading trucks, stocking shelves, stocking stockroom. Learned how to stock! Management was good to work with. Co-workers were good to get along with. Hardest part is working graveyard shift and holidays. Enjoyed working with co-workers and dealing with people and customers to help everyone out."
good,"This job had a few ups and a few downs. Half hour lunch break with one paid 15 minute break that you need to use very wisely on days you work a full shift. The thing that bugged me the most was that, as a backroom associate, you literally have to stop and drop what you're doing in order to pull an item (which should be stocked by the floor associates) for a customer, while you only have an hour to pull items from the outs list and have them loaded on carts (also for the floor associates to stock) and then we usually had to stock the carts we loaded and have it done by the next hour for the outs list for every department to fill, between 12 and 6 pm. because I was hired on as seasonal it was like the people who worked there didn't want to make friends with you because you're supposed to be temporary. Management was nice, but very needy and unwilling to do any work themselves."
good,was very busy all the time which made the day go by faster the people where fun to work with management was always fair and understanding
good,I enjoyed my time there. I learned a lot of new things and I really enjoyed assisting the customers to find products.
good,Its okay. Lots of people working there but sometimes its not all about team work
good,"It is a great job if you do not plan on taking days off.  If you do not ride the back of the management about taking a day off, it wont happen."
good,"Very busy, need to stay on your feet and service with a smile."
good,A typical work day as a target cashier is standing at the register talking to customers and making sure their experience is great and giving them what they need out of their shopping time. I've learned to be fast and accurate. The management is very flexible and easy to deal with. Co-workers are very nice. The hardest part of the job i would say is having to stand the whole shift. The most enjoyable part is getting to interact with all different kinds of people.
good,Target is a great company that I have enjoyed working for more than 20 years.  I want to expand my career and life balance.
good,a great experience in learning about how a big box store is put together
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Target as Pharmacy Technician and front cashier. I like the hours i was given the only little problem is that no employee could go over their 40 hours. I feel i did alot of work for so little of pay, sometimes I worked from open to close. It really wouldnt bother me working this much for 7.50 as long as i am able to go over my 40 if its possible but other then that I really enjoyed working at Target. I would like to find a job that i will be able to go over if i am able to. I enjoyed working with my co-workers it was a very outgoing, social working environment. I was a main employee that was always depended on when needed. I went in most of my days off when I was needed. I trained other cashiers, and when i worked cashier in the front and the pharmacy got backed up i would help the pharmacist catch back up then go back to cashier. When i would work in the pharmacy and they would get backed up in the front i would go help them catch up in the front and then return back to the pharmacy. I was need in many positions at target i worked at the customer service desk as well. I would dedicate my time into this company and was greatful to have an experience like this one. I learned that if I push myself to do the best I canI will be respected and seen by others. I would just like to show how much of an asset i can be towards your company and guarantee that whoever is concerned i wont dissapoint."
good,"The daily job for Target was great because it required me to do physical work by lifting and moving packages at a fast pace. I caught on very quick and learned how to run a conveyor belts, machine software, and studied policy and procedures for the company. I worked great with employees and enjoyed the active job. The hardest job unloading trailers in the heat because it was 20 degrees hotter inside the trailers than what was recorded on the daily forecast. I rate management  a 2 because there was poor judgment on decisions. Plus there was no sympathy on the employees that were injured in the trailers, taking breaks. Sadly I completed my job assignment here for the temp agency named Adecco."
good,A great place to work if you like to work long hours and get your work week over with quickly.  Management is fair.  Work is not difficult.  Must be in good shape physically.
good,"When you work for Target its like working with your family.  You fight, argue, laugh, cry but mostly you work hard.  I left Target because after five years I could no longer ""grow"" with the company.  With out a Bachelors degree you are unable to move up past a supervisor.  The management and training is great and the company takes the time to their team members."
good,"Amazing company, very structured and progressive company"
good,You get to talk to people. It's a very social job. It's better then being behind doors all the time.
good,"My typical day of work would consist of a morning meeting. I would be answering the phones and transfer the calls to the department customers were looking for or our managers if need be. If I could answer there questions or see if an item was in stock I would do so myself. I would also work the fitting room, which I would make sure the customer was taking the limit aloud to try on in the fitting room, also would put away the items they do not want. If I would be needed at the registers one day because there was not enough people for that day I would do that as well. My co-workers were always willing to help each other if we could not get a task done that day. The hardest part of my job was dealing with unsatisfied customers, but still having a smile on my face."
good,a typical night at target consist of pulling orders to replenish the store. i learned how to be a team player if someone wasnt felling good if i finised my pulls i would help them so we could meet the pull time target was a fastand friendly place that is there signature and they live by it
good,"My job requires me to make sure that we have product in, on our shelves, and my team is completing this task. I work with vendors to set areas in the store where both of us can maximize sales and hold a good presentation of product.  I also am part of the hiring/firing process which can be challenging, but also very exciting.  I learn new things every time I work in this constantly changing environment.  Every day is another challenge, I cannot wait to accomplish with myself and my team."
good,great company to work for moved up fast after being hired after 9months
good,Overcoming obstacles by making right decisions at the time. Thinking 10 steps ahead. Learning something new each day. Partnering with my peers in different areas when they need my team's help so our guest can have a fantastic overall shopping experience.
good,"i would recommend anyone to work there.  "
good,On a day to day basis I was responsible for checking out Guest in a timely manner and treating them as if the are the only one that matters. I learned I Love dealing with the public and I do well with finding task to keep busy. I have built  lasting friendships with my co-workers. There wasn't really any hard parts of the job. I believe that everyday brought it's own challenges. Best part of working there is meeting new people and helping them have pleasant shopping experience.
good,cashiered and helped customers questions and stocked shelves.
good,working with target was a good experience for me. helped me a lot with my costumer services and people skills.
good,its fun and a good place to work its productive and u get to work with great people
good,"The working experience at target is fast, fun and friendly. You meet and deal with different people on a daily basis. Work is fast paced never really a slow moment.  Management is friendly and so are my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with varying hours from week to week based upon sales.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the different functions that Target has and the way they provide for the community."
good,there is a lot of opportunity in the company if you stay focused and make it known that your looking for growth
good,proper utilization of manpower & machinery. gating  responsibility & chance of proof my self.
good,Targets offers a great work/life balance with their flexible scheduling. Fellow team members are fun and friendly.
good,"While working at Target really helped me turn into a Versatile employee because I never really had one assigned job there. I was a cashier, backroom stock, customer service, and day time stock."
good,"Working hard to create access for new employees in Canada.  I have learned a new data base that is extremely technical.  Management is experienced and very helpful.  The hardest part of this job is the Monotony, the most enjoyable part is the creativity it brings."
good,"Expect the Best. At Target, we have a vision to become the best, the best culture and brand, the best place for growth and the company with the best reputation. Target offers an inclusive, collaborative, and energetic work environment that rewards those who perform. Target delivers an engaging, innovative an on-trend experiences for our team member and our guests. Target invests in team members' futures by developing leaders and providing a breadth of opportunities for professional development."
good,"Enjoyed it but was seasonal employee."
good,"Very fun work environment but without college experience you wont go far, however its fast and fun and very friendly work environment"
good,lots of customer interaction.friendly coworkers. management appreciates hard work.
good,"If you are looking for a entry-level job in retail that doesn't involve monotonous behavior and for the most part does not require you to work nights, planogram is for you. This job requires you to merchandise product according the corporate office's plans, set aisles and displays, pull and push product, revise aisles and planograms, as well as the usual things that come along with working at a department store.  With a good management team the job isn't that difficult, as long as your willing to work hard.  Hours can range from 46 hours (seldom ever happens UNLESS and almost ONLY if that work week has a time-and-a-half holiday in it) to maybe working only one or two days in a week that there is not a lot of workload.  Average hours of a planogram team member range from 30-39 hours a week."
good,Target was very flexible with my schedule while I was going to school. It was a store with many departments to work in. I worked in Starbucks which is a high pace stressful job. The job overall was enjoyable but you had to have tough skin because the guest can be a handful.
good,"Good place to work with good coworker, and good work atmosphere."
good,"A typical day at work consist of executing planograms as directed, assisting customers with questions, helping fellow team members with product lifting and pushing, and responding to the front lanes when needed."
good,"It gets pretty boring, nut you get use to it fast unfortunately, but you can move up in the company"
good,"Answer phones, assist guest, take orders, production, bake pastries, write on cakes, assist in the deli with slicing meats, assist in produce with production of fruits and vegetables out on the sales floor."
good,Typical day you would handle returns and exchanges for customer while also packaging salvages and also you handled customer complaints. I learned how to enter the world of customer service in a face to face atmosphere. Management was great and always willing to help. Co- Workers were nice and extremely helpful. The hardest part of the job was being face to face with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part was working with nice and friendly people.
good,My days consist of working four hours stocking the shelves. I learned about speed and consistency while working. Management is very friendly and so are my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is working early hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people while working.
good,"Loved working there had not issues always busy"
good,"Review Merchandise, run cash register, help a guest in need of finding a product whether in our store our in another location. Management very understanding with family emergencies. Co workers were easy to get along with. Hardest part was remerchandising. Enojoyable was the ability to work around family life."
good,Challenging and rewarding job within a major retailer.  As an executive team leader you are given responsibilities within the store of managing a specific workcenter and also running day to day business needs.
good,"I usually only work a couple of hours, I'm working part-time. I have learned plenty of things in retail from working at Target. I have learned how to zone areas, put back items, look up items for guests, and I'm still learning new things everyday. My management and co-workers are very easy to get along with and I can talk to them about any situation or if I am having difficulty with a project. The best part about working with Target is that the work schedule is flexible and I am able to work on times and days that do not interrupt time with my family."
good,"Enjoyed working with Target. My day usually consisted of stocking shelves and pulling stock from the backroom. I learned different strategies of getting my job done efficiently and very accurately. The management were very professional and polite, whenever I had a question they were quick with providing me with an answer. My co-workers were also very professional and we all worked together great as a team. The hardest part for me was working at 3am everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was working in the refridgerator and freezer."
good,Target was a great place to work they had a great environment and were really willing to work with me as I was going to school. A typical day at work consisted of making sure my area was stocked and constantly helping customers with any questions they had about our products or in store locations. Working at target taught me to be more outgoing with people and to trust management. The hardest part of the job was the variation in hours every week. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers and my fellow co workers.
good,"My day consisted of working as a cashier then within weeks I was promoted to a guest service associate where I assisted customers in returns/exchanges. I sorted the returned items and then communicated within each department to pick-up assigned carts when these were full. I also trained new employees on how to best assist customers at the guest service counter."
good,"A typical day starts with vibing with your customers, filling the floor and making sales. Development is key to be able to promote up if your not willing to change and learn Target is not a place for you. Management and your peers are your key to going to an enjoyable place to work daily. The hardest part of your job is when you don't give it your all, having fun and enjoying what you do is the best way to get by."
good,Many opportunities.  Great culture. Positive approach to feedback and improvement.
good,"I enjoyed working there  it is a nice company to work for management  they are nice people to work with  also the team worker are friendly people to work with. My work are a typical day at work, for me I don't let any thing get me down I always kept going I  always look at the bright side . I don't see any hard part I enjoyed my job that the best part."
good,"For the most part the managers and supervisors are actually very down to earth, and fun people. They get serious when they need to be. Sometimes the work is hectic, sometimes it's not. It's retail so it really depends on what time of the year it is. Cross training is available and encouraged. Great hours. Pay sucks :/"
good,As a team member you are pushed to strive for your personal best in a friendly enviroment. Target team members have a common goal: to provide our guests with the best shopping experience possible.
good,Woking at Target was a good experience for a seasonal position. Everyone who worked there was friendly and outgoing. Management was really organized and willing to help with any concern or question. I really enjoyed working with people and providing good customer service.
good,"Would walk the store restocking and helping customers find products. Worked with and trained many of the floor staff. Co-workers  were enjoyable but sometimes lazy. Management used a soft touch and put a lot of trust in the employees to complete tasks which led to a low stress environment with high moral. Learned about and worked in every department in the store, cleaning and stocking heavy objects, also cashier skills were used daily. Was often depended upon for product information and customer relations. Was one of the few full-time employees."
good,loved working for target. it was fast paced but no one was left behind. management was easy to talk to and always available.
good,met a lot of great people here. management was easy to get along with. great customer base.
good,"I handled a team of 10, doing various activities. My work included ensuring that the defined SLA's were met, Helping the team through the work, Providing guidance and career path to the team members, working with new people managers, etc.,"
good,Target is geared towards team work and the guests that shop at the store.  What is learned is how to get along with other team members to accomplish tasks that are given to each department.
good,This job taught me how to take responsibility because if you don't pull your weight then you will definitely know about it. Pay isn't very great but usually the team you work with are composed of friendly people.
good,"management distributes work evenly. good co-workers. no point system for attendance. pay could be higher. nice hours, very much a team effort."
good,"Target is a great 1st-timer's job. It definitely wouldn't be a company to have a career in. Working your way up is easy if you set your mind to it, yet the raises are little to nothing. I met a lot of great friends there and had a lot of fun memories, but probably would not go back to work for them, even if the pay was decent. "
good,"Great place to work, but be ready to put in the hours. Management is all right, but starts and stops initiatives before the organization has a grasp on them. "
good,During my years at Target i've worked in several departments under several different types of management and have myself managed a small team. It provided me with a great learning experience and look into the world of retail and customer service. The company provides few advancement opportunities for persons like myself who have not obtained a college degree so advancement can be limited unless you are willing to switch departments. Company benefits are better than a lot of other local employment opportunities but hours fluctuate alongside company sales so when sales go down hours get cut. The company is very flexible with scheduling in most departments and makes it very easy to work while attending college.
good,"I had a break in-between my semesters so I picked up this on a job on the side.  It's pretty good, you're not in for any surprises.  You can pick your hours and switch positions if you had any "
good,"Very accommodating with school schedules, which is great when you're in college. Great discounts, what's not to like."
good,"Target strives to hire team members that are fast, fun and friendly.  This type of environment allows comfort for people to be themselves. "
good,"not a terrible place to work. very flexible work schedules once you specify your availability. some leaders are not the greatest, others are phenomenal! can be a hostile, somewhat immature work environment at times. good work experience."
good,for the line of work there we should have been paid more then $11.00
good,"Target is a good company to work if you are where you want to be within management. I believe that Target could pay their team leader, who aren't executives, more. My peers are great to work with and Target really commits to their values of being fast, fun, and friendly."
good,"Positive work environment that always kept me engaged."
good,"Dealing with guests is a hassle, but you learn to be patient and understanding and stand your ground. Management has always been helpful for me and understanding. They are always very good with me going away to school and I'd take educational leaves during the semester. I always returned for holidays, winter and summer break."
good,Team oriented & great learning environment.  They help you to understand your leadership strengths and opportunities and then develop a plan to address them.
good,"Management was very caring and appreciated the quality of your work."
good,"Great people, fun environment and a nice discount. Lots of learning and growth opportunities in terms of skill development."
good,"Its a nice place to work, the coworkers are nice and energetic. and the supervisors supervise."
good,I worked here winter seasonal and I loved it. Overtime is constantly available and the pay is ok.
good,"a typical day morning at Target starts around 430am. I would go to the shipping & receiving area and start unloading the freight truck. That would take about 45 minutes to an hour. After unloading the truck I would then go out to the sales floor and 'bowl' out the merchandise to their proper aisles until the whole store was bowled out. After that I would begin restocking the shelves. This whole process would have to done in 4, 4 1/2 hours. I learned to be a more effective team member in a fast paced working environment. I also learned how a major corporation works from the inside. All the co-workers i worked with were really friendly. The management staff was also friendly, as long as were on schedule. Once we got off schedule, they would be all over us. The hardest part of the job would be days when we had double freights. "
good,I loved working here when I was a teenager! They center a lot on team work and there are many departments to move up in.
good,Poor pay for a really repetitive and menial job. The group of employees there are generally kind and easy going.
good,we put carts out so we can separate the merchandise off the pallets and then put the clothes on the sales floor when done we help out in other departments. the hardest part about this job is i wish we got more hours.the job itself is pretty easy .
good,Customer Service was a typical day at work.  Learned how to handle unpleasant customers.  Management provided additional training and education for employees.  All departments worked will together to complete daily tasks.  Meeting deadlines during the busy seasons were challenging.  Seeing customers enjoy shopping at Target and receiving opportunities to grow and development for promotions.  
good,its a very laid back place to work. Team members are always happy and we always had a strong team.
good,Managed over 50 TMs daily. had to ensure process where in place to drive sales.
good,"Greet and assist customers, total customers purchases, restock shelves, assist at the customer service desk with store exchanges and returns, ensure my draw it totaled and secure end of my shift, assist guests in signing up for store credit cards (Target Credit Cards), process checks and handle various amounts of cash. "
good,"great comapny to work for,happy workers,great staff,management,etc"
good,It was a job to make it through school.  I learned to work with the public and work as a team.
good,"Constant movement, always busy, helping customers doing research."
good,"nice job but pay wasn't really competitive, advancement wasn't really that easy to obtain either"
good,"I have worked 12 hour weekend daytime shifts for two years now. Being a trainer allowed me to train team members or choose which function role I wanted to participate in per shift. Outbound is an extremely physical department with heavy workloads. But it is a job that never follows you home and offers voluntary over time. Target pays their employees a nice wage, but the work involved is extremely taxing on the body."
good,Decent compensation. Great management. Excellent schedule. Opportunities for advancement.
good,Target is a good place to work. They value their employees and customers and they constantly show it. Sometimes the team lead can be a little  bit abrasive but overall the environment is warm and welcoming.
good,"Physical demanding job in which i was able to learn and adjust extremely fast and well. A major thing i learned is that its not always about speed,it is better to work accurate and speed will come with time. I thought mangement did a great job overall, but needs to come up with more opportunities for employees to advance. I have good co-workers that enjoy working. The hardest part of the job is when i have to stock a pallet of cans,i love the challenge tho.The most enjoyable part of the job is when i have to unload the truck,i think it is fun and i enjoy the workout."
good,"Co workers were good team members and really tried their best"
good,"I worked as a market team member. I made sure the open market section was fresh and full, provided friendly and fast guest service, and made sure the market aisles were clean and full. The hardest part of the job was getting all of the task done in the allowed time. The best part of the job was the flexibility in getting time off. "
good,"Apesar de não oferecer benefícios, aprendi muito trabalhando nesta empresa."
good,"A typical day at work"
good,"Management is great. Great peers who are willing to help you in whatever you need. However, some Store Managers don't know what they are doing. Hardest part of the job was working the long hours. Sometimes it is fun and sometimes it is not."
good,Work with pharmacy team in a fun paced environment. May get busy and may work with very difficult people. Working at a pharmacy takes a resilient personality.
good,"Average of ~100-200 prescriptions a day, with a steady flow of work. We put our guests above everything else, always greeting them first even if we are busy counting or typing. We are different from other pharmacies because we call insurance companies if a guest doesn't bring their insurance card or if there is any insurance problem. The guests at Target are much more mellow, patient, and understanding than guests I have experienced in the past at other pharmacies."
good,A typical day at working included walking into the backroom and being greeted by all the happy faces on my way to punch in. I would then pick u my equipment and check the board and with my team lead for my tasks for the day. Everyone at work was so friendly and breaks were very relaxing with movies or a tv show always on and surprise treats for the team. The hardest part of the job was knowing the location of every item in the store in order to assist a guest; however the equipment and team members were always there to help. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the guests; you could learn so much from people by helping them shop. I learned to step out of my shell and have fun at work.
good,"Manage the day-to-day operations of Target Café, Starbucks, Guest Service and Sales Floor teams."
good,"I work at Target on a set schedule, Monday through Friday, 1pm to 9pm. I clock in, grab equipment, and walk through the store to the back room. In the backroom, the morning team leader is walks me through the backroom just so I know what is what, what's a priority, what's not, etc."
good,"A normal day would consist of a fast past environment working both in Starbucks as a Barista and as a Target Cashier. In those two different fields you learn how to maintain a fast working pace with the best positive attitude to show your customers. The managers are always there for your needs and always make sure that you are keeping the work environment clean and customer friendly. One thing that is always enjoyable to see is, the happiness that we can offer to our customers by just giving a positive and friendly attitude. It lets them know that they are being well taken care of by employees they can trust."
good,Target has a focus on driving personal development through feedback.
good,I have enjoyed working as a Senior Team Leader for 8 years. I love that Teamwork is very important
good,Worked as a stockroom overnight employee. Learned to use all machinery necessary for job and order of logistics in the warehouse. Management was fantastic. co-workers had great personalities.
good,A typical day at work consists of ensuring guest satisfaction while captaining different responsibilities that contribute to our overall success. Upper management's role is executed by a more task oriented approach by checking in with Team Leads. My co-workers are dependable in both their ownership of their captainships and their opportunities. The hardest part of my job is executing positive REDcard results to team members who do not have the skills (despite our training) to execute the proper results. The most enjoyable part of my job is when at the end of the day I am both successful in my task and my guest service part of my day while delivering a positive trend of REDcard results.
good,This was my first managment position and I feel as though I did a pretty great job. I was lucky enough to have a good team and supportive upper managment to help me when I needed it. My location was extreamly competitave with the other two Idaho locations. We always drove each other to do better and push further.
good,"At a typical day of work, I would work directly with the customers to ensure their satisfaction. I observed the management team and learned a lot about the qualities of a great leader. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping guests with questions or anything else."
good,"Working at Target was very fast paced and as a manager there are very long hours. However, it is a very fun environment where the team can really work together to get the job done. Providing great service to customers is a major factor in success and Target is probably the leader in great service. There is a plethora of employee benefits, more than just compensation. Target is very focused on rewarding the team as well, whether it be fun events, recognition, or pizza parties, etc."
good,Target is a great place to work and grow as an individual. I learned many qualities about the business and about myself as a business professional. Only downside was there was not the best work life balance.
good,Typical day is unloading a truck and stocking shevles at a fast pace.
good,Each day came as a funfilled day with new challenges. The most important value that I acquired from Target is the importance of routine maintenance. Target strives on developing each individual team member as well as the relationships between management and their team. Target also strives on the importance of working together as a team while maintaining a positive culture. The only opportunity that I encountered during my years with Target would have been the training process for new team members. A positive work environment always makes day to day task much easier to accomplish..
good,Target is a great place to work. Everyone is friendly and always willing to help you if you are in need even if they are from a different department.
good,"Target keeps their employees motivated and challenged. This is a great opportunity for new graduates to get a comprehnsive look at a business in all aspects. Hardest part is the hours and schedule, also, if you are not one to be motivated and engaged by constant communication this may seem difficult as well. Most enjoyable part is being part of a large team, constantly communicating, being challenged to reach difficult goals and dealines. The people are the best part of Target. Definitely a company that knows how to build a great team!"
good,A typical day consists of fellow team members helping when needed in a fast pace work environment. Giving great customer service allows for better better business and good reviews of the store.
good,"A typical day, is spent, smiling at customers and helping them out as best you can. Everyone helped with every department. And management was very kind when small mistakes were made, or needing to take off due to an emergency."
good,its ok...great benifits but if you are not seeking advancement go to school and leave..
good,After punching in we unloaded the truck as a team and sorted out the boxes and put them on pallets. From there we would take them out to the floor and stock the shelves. All in all it was good fun. The team members were amazing and they helped making coming into work a good time.
good,The hardest part of the job would be the lack of work/ life balance.
good,I learned a lot about a tracker and trailer's as well as DOT requirements for our loads.
good,"A typical day working at target is about great customer service. Making sure you meet your customers needs making sure they found everything they were looking for and if they need help with anything else. While working at target I've learned that once you have a happy customers you will have happy employees. Target rewards you for doing a great job, so it makes you want to continue to make progress. The managers don't only care about the customers but they care about their employees. If you're having a bad day they get to the bottom of it and do what they can to make it better. Target is a team job, you and your co-worker are as one. If you need a day off they have no problem with working that day for you and everyone is trained in every area so when back up is needed there's always someone there to help. The hardest part about working at target is standing on your feet for 8 hours of the day sometimes more, but there is always an upside; making your customers happy. to see your customer walk away with a smile and knowing you have help them with everything they need and making them smile was the best part of my day!"
good,"A typical day at work includes arriving at 6 am to unload a truck for about an hour, depending on the size of the truck and perfomance of workers. I learned how to stack boxes properly on a pallet and how to do it at a fast pace. My co-workers are are good people but there's a few people who look like they work hard but they don't. There's a few people who work slower than most while unloading but i dont mind sliding over to anybody who needs help. I'm enjoy being fast and limber enough to work any part of the unload at any time. The most enjoyable part is unloading the truck."
good,"A typical work place that tries to promote a fast,fun and friendly environment."
good,At target it was my job to help people find what they need in the store
good,I enjoyed working at target. I got a chance to meet many new people and also here about there culture nd traditions.
good,Manager of shipping department
good,Target makes the team member feels wanted. I always have fun with they different events managment plans for the team members.
good,"I picked up a seasonal position at one store, and I really enjoyed it. The management was accessible, knowledgable, and very easy to work with. My coworkers were happy and productive, which made for a very positive work environment. I actually looked forward to clocking in on days I had work, and always agreed to stay when i was asked, not because I needed the hours, but because I felt like I was being taken care of. Even though I wanted to stay after my 90 days and they wanted to keep me, there weren't enough hours allotted to be able to keep me on. However, I was encouraged by management to seek more permanent employment at a different store in the are. Those stores were a NIGHTMARE. Management was slow and inefficient. The employees were not happy and didn't treat the guests very well. As a prospective team member, I was treated poorly as well. Nobody listened to me very well, I had to repeat myself, I waited for over an hour on a very slow day just to speak with a manager, And I was told contradicting things depending on which manager I spoke to. All around, Target is a great place to work, but make sure you trust and respect the management at the particular store you want to work at."
good,The working experience gave me a great opportunity at Target. The stafff was awesome except my manager she was a little hostile at times and i did not like that. It was such a fast pace job one minute i could be cleaning up and putting away clothes in my department then next thing you know i will be needed in the front to help out at the cashier because it would be so crowded.
good,"Target is a great company to work for. I learned how to operate a Wave lifting machine and how Target's backroom operates. My co workers and management are always very kind and always are willing to help with any questions that arise. The hardest part of this job for me was it forced me to leave my comfort zone and go up to guests and ask if they needed help with anything. The most enjoyable part of this job by far was the satisfaction of being able to successfully help a guest find what they need, and know that they are leaving happy."
good,-Very busy
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are just out of high school looking for a job that could become a career. They are flexible in scheduling, allowing for you to go to college while working. Training and utilization of technology are two of the areas where Target leads their competition. They offer fair and competitive wages, with many different positions through out their stores and warehouses."
good,"Low pay, fabulous bus pass, great teamwork. Guest Service is able to provide fabulous returns for most items. The store is busy and it's nice to see so many people every day."
good,"This job has been physically demanding,you are on your feet all day. Pushing, pulling, lifting items up to 50lbs or more. My coworkers are awesome we all work as a team to complete our goal. We are timed by howmany pieces are on the truck, how long it should take to unload, etc. We are audited in our work areas for accurate placement of items on the shelves. The management staff are role models for how to get things done. They help us if we are short staffed instead of just barking orders. Overall it is a fun place to work, the people are super nice and it makes it fun to come to work everyday."
good,• Operated the cash register
good,"A typical day at work was basically helping guests, being friendly, cleaning up, and stocking aisles, at times. I learned more customer service skills and how to stock shelves and organize items. Management was good, well taken care of. My co-workers were nice, we were all friendly. The hardest thing was dealing with customers who found something they didn't like and they take their anger out on you. I love to work with people."
good,"I always say that Target is a great place to work if just out of high school. However, the raises and ability to be promoted are fairly poor even if your constantly noticed as a top performer and one of the best employees at customer service."
good,"when i was first hired on at target it was reasonably busy for Christmas time but when Christmas drew closer we would run out of carts faster and wouldn't have any to replace them because they were all in use, the cashiers and sales floor people could understand how busy it was but the supervisors always seemed to think there were more carts outside when there were none at all"
good,I enjoy with with target only cause we are a Family and we work as a Team and everyone does their Jobs
good,"I organize all the clothes in my individual departments, and help guests with any questions. I learned that keeping your store presentable and always being prepared to help out your guests will always keep them coming back. The management is good we have one for every department. They are out on the floor working with the team so if anybody needs help they will be out and ready to help. My coworkers are great everyone helps out everyone with there selected departments of the day. This helps other coworkers who know wont be able to finish there department in time be finished. The hardest part of the job would be making sure that everything is with the right price label. There are some departments where things don't match up, so organizing everything to match with the price label in a given amount of time presents more of a challenge. I enjoy working with the guests and coworkers on the floor. I also enjoy making the clothes presentable, and taking any clothes that need to be put back out on the floor in there proper places."
good,you gewt to meet new people everyday the management is great to get along with they are willing to work around second jobs or anytime off
good,"A typical day at work starts by me clocking at the team member time clock and then proceeded to call one of the managers to assist me in retrieving the necessary equipment to perform that days tasks. I would then walk to the backroom and participate in completing the ""hourly pulls"", which take place between the hours of 11 am and 7 pm. At some point in during that time frame I would take my mandatory half an hour lunch and my two fifteen minute breaks."
good,"A typical day at work was being productive by doing pulls, pog's, salesplans, helping the lanes and cross training in many different departments. I had learned that you need to be fast, fun and friendly while working at any job. I also got to meet a lot of new but great people! The hardest yet rewarding part of my job is being able to be cross trained in many other areas. Also, not only get more hours but to really get to know your daily customers not only by face but also by name. You know that you are doing a good job when customers start to know you as well in the same way. The most enjoyable part of my job were all the great customers I got to serve and help. They really made my every day schedule feel like no ordinary job."
good,Management is well informed of all task at hand on a daily basis.
good,Unload the trucks of merchandise and send them out to the sales floor. Than stock the shelves with the merchandise. It it hard work but very rewarding in the end. Make sure that all merchandise is off the sales floor by a certain time and in the back of the store. Management is very friendly and easy to communicate with.
good,Fast -paced workplace
good,"it was an okay job very simple not too hard or easy , backroom was my favorite position to work i absolutely loved it especially if you dont like working with customers i recommend this job to anyone who's young around my age 21 and is going to school , the management wasnt bad it was ok , the hardest part of the job was probably picking up the pace because someone usually called in so you're left backstocking a lot of items with a few backroom employeesbut other then that it was cool"
good,loved the comradery between employees and how they all got along.
good,This was my first real introduction to customer service. Starting out on the sales floor was very difficult. There were many duties that needed to be done in a certain amount of time.
good,"People always say that working in retail is pretty bad and boring, but I think it depends on who you work with. Our store is a high traffic store so on a daily basis we are busy. My co-workers are great and we all get along well. I've learned most about communication elements while working with guests and trying to help them solve an issue they have had."
good,"I love my job. I am good at it. I have worked for my job 2 1/2 years and have received amazing raises. Started making $7.50 and now earn over $10 an hour. I am only interested in leaving because I would like to learn something new. I work third shift logistics and have learned to be an amazing leader, work with heavy equipment, and work at a fast paste. My managers love me and calls me the example employee. I work well with my co-workers, and often they bring their problems to my attention. I am a strong leader with an wonderful connection with people. The hardest part of the job is when team members are absent. It increases the individuals duties for the day. The day seems to go by fast with a great fast team, which is the best part of the job."
good,"For the first month or two it was great, but then the management changed up front and there was a conflict of interest."
good,"build a great partnership and communication, learning how to be organize and build the right path."
good,A great place to work if you love interacting with different people everyday as well as working in a team focused enviroment.
good,"I love working at target, it is a great place to start work experience."
good,"This was a fun seasonal job, however I'm not sure who my supervisor was."
good,"Overall great place to work, the experience gained is invaluable when it comes to leading a team, and driving for sales"
good,"Typical day at work was helping out customers, back up cashiering, back room certification. The hardest part of the job was making time for various duties. The most enjoyed part of the job was learning skills that could be used at other companies."
good,"A happy worker is a hard worker, with that being sad Target has a very positive attitude and helps build relations with fellow Team Members. Fun place to work . The hardest part was being understaffed while trying to stay committed to one area . At my store you were expected to be very flexible and learn different skills for different departments which translated to becoming a ""Global Team Member"" . It was a lot of hard work but it helps you become a diverse player and able to handle multiple situations at once. The best part is the relationships developed between Guest and Team Member giving everyone a different perspective !"
good,"Unload a truck full of merchandise, stock merchandise, back stock excessive merchandise, and clear the floor. I learned how to understand the process of the Target company. I enjoyed working with everybody in this job. The hardest part about this job is making sure everything was stocked correctly and displayed correctly within the time quota. I did enjoy unloading trucks. Great workout"
good,They really are a great company. Everyone was friendly. ɔther than thatˌ the job is exactly what youˈd expect.
good,Working with this company was very easy. Everything was fast to learn. A typical day would always be fast paced and packed but went smoothly and well organized. Co-workers were always on point with their task and friendly. The hardest part of the job was goin on break on time because of the volume of customers but the most enjoyable part was having a smooth day surrounded by a good environment.
good,"Working at Starbucks in a Target store is stressful. You have to follow Starbucks guidelines and Target guidelines at the same time. For example, you cannot have a tip jar because of target guidelines, and you cannot show piercings and tattoos because of starbucks guidelines. So you work in this irritating job because of too many guidelines, on top of having to attend a boat load of customers, who are rude quite a few times. The only positive thing is you can move up the corporate ladder quick within years of working there. Target itself moves workers fairly quickly from different departments including starbucks."
good,seasonal job great pay i learned allot about customer service working there. Hard work in short amount of time
good,"Store by store management is different some stores have amazing people in management and other stores have people who should not be in management. Depending on area you work the work load can be very heavy or very light, Co-workers vary just like the management, have learned a lot about all the different aspects of retail but if it wasn't for this company I would never have found the passion for what I want to do as a career now."
good,worked with a lot of different people co workers were great and manager was great
good,Target is very focused on childhood education and giving back to the community. This is a great place to work to do good for others.
good,Opening a store was the best experience I've ever had and was never bored or felt tired of starting a new day. Definitely my favorite job and only left due to a better opportunity with higher pay.
good,"This was a nice place toi work. They were flexible with their scheduling, but never scheduled enough people."
good,i work 4-5 days a week for 4-5 hours. satisfing customers my mane goal. i also unload freight truck. organize stock off the assembly line.
good,target was fun and colorful place to work everyone was friendly and new what to do and we all got along
good,"started when i was 15, worked till i was 17. Made more there then i do now!"
good,It is always fast paced to keep up with the ever-busy store.
good,"* Typical day at work would be push merchandise out on the floor to fill the shelf's. Walk my department (cosmetics) for any charge back, strays, go through my checklist for cleaning my department. Guest service guest when they need it."
good,"Speed is life. Management is good, the employees are all fun fast and friendly. The hardest part of the job is unloading a truck with few people."
good,Great cultured company.
good,Usually target has less employs for given task so it increased alot of work pressure. No place to grow
good,"A typical work day depends on whether you are a opener or a closer. An opener is responsible for baking all the breads, making sure the dishes are done, and filling the floor all in a timely manner. If you are a closer you have to get counts and have the breakout ready for the following morning all while cleaning and filling floor. You must also greet every guest you are within ear shot of. Hand out cookies to all our younger guests with permission from the parents of course. The only hard part is if a person calls off from work, then you have to do double the work. The most enjoyable part of the job are the friends I have made as well as the interaction with the guests to help by making suggestions for items they may be interested in."
good,"Study work through entire shift. Constant awareness of safety of fellow coworkers, equipment, and products. A healthy dose of meeting deadlines and time brackets as needed to make production goals. After shift stretching and briefing, the ""fun"" begins. Establishing a rhythm was essential to being successful. Communication with Team Lead was vital in deciding if your truck needed assistance. Quality before quantity was the preferred way of conducting business. Break time was respected so that you could rejuvinate. Meetings were held only when necessary."
good,Target is a great company to work for but it will always be a retail job being an Executive Team Leader. I have learned a lot about myself so far while working at Target. The hardest part of the job on a daily basis is that you never know what is going to happen next. I think I will do better in something with more stability. The most enjoyable part of the job is making guests and team members smile.
good,Working at Target is a good place to work with good co-workers building friendships. I have learned a lot from working at Target. Good leadership abilities. The management is different from store to store that you go to. Some managers are really good and helpful and do their best to help you out. Some they are not so helpful. The hardest part of my job is seeing some people move up the ladder that aren't that experienced more than those that are experienced. I am a hands on person so I like to be involved with my team members and work along side them I feel like I have gained a lot of respect doing this. It is easier to get a higher position at Target if you come right out of college. For those who have a degree but are in the the store already it is a lot harder to move up in the company.
good,The culture is great. Very team focussed. Management moves fast if someone is not making the cut. Hours are long and its hard to disconnect when you leave.
good,Learned so much on good practices and policies at work. Really fun and challenging working with talented and energitic brains.
good,"This Target store located in Waterfront, Homestead of Pittsburgh, PA is in the center of a highly populated shopping center with restaurants, theaters, bars, and a water park also minute away from an amusement park. So you can imagine how busy it can get. The management was nice and flexible, product inventory was always fully stocked and other employees were friendly. The staff made a great team and was always rewarded for hard work with ice cream or hoagie days, etc. When first employed you are introduced with a great benefits package."
good,Working at Target has been a great opportunity. I began this role while in college and appreciated the flexibility it offered while trying to balance school and other activities.
good,I worked with Target as a seasonal employee and I enjoyed every minute of it. They recognize hard working employees.
good,My typical day at work is fast friendly customer service.Keeping my customers happy and safe is my #1 priority.I love the enviroment and people i communicate with.My coworkers can be a bit moody but are easy to to get along with .I am very organized and love do whatever my job requires and beyond .I love to do everything and anything as long as l am being productive.
good,I worked at this Target 2 different times and each time I enjoyed it pretty well.
good,The employee's are very pleasant & respectful. The customer's are plesant also.
good,Had to quit because I moved. The job had great co workers and I learned the basics of being a server while working on the job
good,"I work in the night on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday and most of the time the work schedule depends on the work load for the week."
good,A typical day at work was to break down pallets organize merchandise by department and then to move everything into their respective areas so other coworkers or myself can begin to stock items. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I got to learn many different things for example setting planograms and new merchandise.
good,Your usual retail environment where a work life balance is non existent. A great company to work for if you're looking for job security and a fun place to work!
good,"Target is great at making affordable benefits available to all of its employees. However, the metrics that they use to measure how employees are performing are flawed, and actually keep people that are worse at their job than others in their job. Management is okay, but you have to play the game that they want you to play. I left because I did not want to become a person that gets stuck in a call center for the rest my life."
good,"Great team culture. The team as a whole feel valued, and enjoy a safe and fun working enviornment."
good,"As my very first experience in retail, this was an eye-opener: I first started out working on the sales floor in the Hardlines Department (Toys, Home Goods, etc.) I then moved on to become a front line cashier and from there, I was promoted to the Electronics Department. Basically, I learned the ins and outs of retail in general. The management was tough, but fair. My coworkers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of working there was having to close on some nights, sometimes not knowing what time I would leave. The most enjoyable part was being able to help the customers find what they need."
good,Early mornings - can be a negative if you're not a morning person
good,"on a typical day I would do daily inventory counts, cash counts, emails, daily logs, sales, filing, scheduling and any ordering needed to complete daily procedures. I learned alot as far as working with att and verizon accounts. I was the manager so I did the scheduling and ran a team between two location. The hardest part of a day was learning to overcome objectives. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and assisting everyone either throughout target or at my kiosk with their phones"
good,They alway have somehing new to role out. A fast pace enviroment thatdevelopes thier managment staff very well.
good,Work Is THe Same Daily. You Learn Lot At Target. They Do Much More Than Most Places As Far As Training. I Took Alot Of Things I Learned From Target And Used In My Other Jobs. Their Managment is Good. The Hardest Part Is Waking Up And WOrking This Overnight Position. The Most Enjoyable Part Is Working With The Co-Workers.
good,"Work/Life balance is my only issue and I know that this is in big part to the area that I'm in. I'm also getting sick of the commute, which plays into the work/life balance component... and with the impending move to an outskirt suburb (from downtown Minneapolis) it won't be getting any better."
good,the hardest part of the job was when i received order from two manager. i didn't know what to do at the end. i almost always end up with one of them angry at me because i did the other manager job instead.
good,"I arrived at work around 4am and unloaded trucks and restocked merchandise accordingly in a production based manner. After the store opened, I stocked back stock and helped customers with all their shopping concerns. I was an occasional cashier if the workflow became too busy."
good,"Working here isn't really like work. I am currently a sales floor team member. I rotate between softlines and hardlines, depending on shift needs. This is nice because right when you get burned out in one area, they switch you to another. I basically make sure my assigned area looks nice and I put away re-shop. I'm always asking guests if I can help them with anything and if so, it's usually showing them where something is located in the store. There really isn't anything that's ""hard"" to do. It seems like I'm always learning something new, which is great. Management is pretty relatable and friendly. I love the flexibility in scheduling. My co-workers are pretty helpful and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fun and relaxed atmosphere and seeing new people and new merchandise all of the time. Although the pay isn't what I want, I started out at $7.50/hr, gotten 2 raises and a small promotion and I haven't even been there a year yet. The catch 22 of the job is really getting to know and like some of the employees and then they move up in rank and move on to a different store. I would say my biggest peeve is a few employees who are lazy and try to get by doing the bare minimum and are not team players or who call off a lot and receive no repercussions. I think management could do a better job of weeding out these types of employees. Other than that, I LOVE Target!"
good,"My day at work began with reading emails for manager up dates. Surveying my work area for completed tasks. Opening of the department and setting up for food prep and ordering/receiving of shipments. Delegating tasks to other team members. Safety inspection of dated onhand product. Customer service, food item rotation. Cleaning duties, coaching for performance management of the team. Training for new product roll-out, maintaining all temperature, waste, and cleaning logs for a strong focus on quality, freshness of product and providing great customer service."
good,"Started at 6:00 am prepped the front end cash registers for morning opening. I work station was the jewelry boat. I was the jewelry boat specialist. Learned how to work an LRT, set plannograms, stock shelves, learned a lot about the stockroom. There were quite a few turnovers with management so it was hard to keep up with all the changes each time there were new managers. Loved my co-workers and the benefits. The hardest part was the continuous reshop. The most enjoyable part of the job was it was very busy."
good,"I first started working at Target in 2003, though that was only a seasonal position, but my most solid time came between 2006 and 2011 which was split between two different stores in two different states. The experience was vastly different."
good,I got target as a second job and loved working there. I really miss it and shop there all the time. I loved helping guests although it was sometimes hard to deal with rude guests. My fellow team members were great and we were all really close! The hardest part was working through the holidays and the most enjoyable part was being able to help a guest that was truly appreciative.
good,Great company to work for and there are opportunities to advance in the workplace
good,"A typical day at Target goes by quickly. Everybody gets along and there is a lot of communication among team members and managers. The hardest part of the job is trying to fulfill the managers goals. At many times, manager will give you impossible goals to complete in very little time. What I enjoy more about Target is the everything is done in teams pretty much."
good,It was one the best company's to work for.I was treated as family not just a worker.
good,"Working as a overnight stock person at Target was one of my favorite jobs. The pay was really good, the job wasn't too hard, understandable bosses, and fun co workers made time go by fast."
good,"On a typical day the work is streneous in Target. One has to lift,sort and place a variety of goods on the sales floor. You learn best practices on how to safely lift heavy objects as well as how to do your job in a efficient and safe manner. The managers keep the workers informed and always try to supply there needs and care for their concerns. This job is really enjoyable because one gets to work in an environment where there is a variety of ethnicities and we tend to learn alot from each other."
good,"You have to be able to lead a team to meet goals. The tools and training are definitely in place, then it is up to you for execution. You can not do this job by yourself, you must be able to get your team members to perform at their potential."
good,"Working in retail at any store is a lot of hard work and can at times be hectic, but having a caring hard working team with a team leader that is also hard working and keeps an open door policy makes it a great working environment. My co-workers all work together as one to make sure the days work load gets accomplished. I have learned a whole new world when it comes to a stores replenishment a lot happens behind the scenes that I never knew. I also learned the values of working as a team and also the personal goals of working independently. I feel that the management of my department trained me in other ways besides my basic day to day job, they've trained me to also better my independent decision making skills and confidence when I do have to work independently. The management team gets you ready to succeed if you do wish to take on a management role of your own which is one of the enjoyable parts of working at the company."
good,"Overall great company to work for. Fast, Fun, and Friendly environment with opportunity for growth within the company."
good,"Overall great Place to work, I had excellent management and co-workers, learned something new everyday, and enjoyed everything about my position"
good,Productive and fast pace work environment. The job required packing boxes for the different store locations within the company. I learned to work together in team. We worked together to accomplished the goal for that day.
good,"If you work you will be rewarded with a chance for non management advancement. Pay was market for Tallahassee. It can be fast paced but the management was fair and friendly. Started with receiving, then back room then cash office and service desk. When I left I was training for the office position relief. Employee discount was nice."
good,"Very good overall company, the benefits could be less exspensive and if you are able to handle management in which five different people are telling you to complete multiple task at the same time, you will be fine."
good,"In charge of the frontend: cashiers, food ave. star bucks, restrooms, cart attendant,photo lab, and guest service. Training/ coaching employees.order supplies, planos."
good,"a typical day would be getting everything setting and finshed for the next person that has to come in. Such as making sure pizza, and pastas were done. the cooler was filled with fresh salads and sandwhiches. Nothing expired. Hotdogs on the grill and everthing ready and avaiable for a guest."
good,"I really liked Target. I was recognized for my achievement. I had a fantastic management team, I had a fantastic team memberrs. The hardest part of my job was to get customers to sign up for a Red-card. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to do more than one task at a time and when i could cover my bosses 30 minute break."
good,"Good work life, by the book good training good for advancement"
good,I work as a target Protection Specialist and my job was to deter theft of merchandise by my presence at the exit. worked cameras for the plain close officer on the floor. assisted in apprehension.
good,A typical day at work as an Operator/Fitting Room Attendant consisted of:
good,"I worked the 3rd shift t start, the team members helped unload the truck, then stocked the floor. The back stock was the last thing we did before leaving. I transfered to 2nd shift when I went back to college at Levelland, Texas. I worked the backroom, back stocking and relocating items when needed. We used a radio to talk to floor personal, and took merchandise to the floor, when they were out of stock."
good,a typical day at work
good,"Although I was on the seasonal team, I greatly enjoyed my time there."
good,stocked merchandise..i learned how to do add setup and pricing..loved the overnight crew..was a fast paced job just too many cancelled trucks so not too many hours..loved how fast we had to work
good,"I learned a lot while working here, the most difficult part of my job was making sure everything was organized before leaving. The employees there were very nice, but the pay was really low for the amount of work you needed to do. I worked on the sales floor and organized the Apparel."
good,coming early to unload the turck and stock. Managment was understanding co workers were easy to deal with and it was fun to go to work and get a work out at the same time. It was hard to get up early in the morning but it was ok.
good,"Typical day at work is I clock in grab a pda and get started on the pulls for the night. Then after I finshed that then we take a 15 min. break and get started on the backstock of the truck. Then do that for a hour or two depending on how much merchandise from the truck. Then last get the backstock from the floor whats left over that can't fit on the floor we backstock that. That's pretty much the typical day at work for that department. I also know how to setup pog's in other words. Reset the departments by different seasons and holidays of the year. Putting up backup paper resetting the display on how target wants it for that moment and so on and so on. Plus also know how to stock shelves of course thats where I started at first before I got switch over to backroom. The managers I get alone with great they have no problems with me. Co-workers some of them are ok, but at any job you know the have a hand full thats a problem. The most enjoyable part is free meals sometime."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at target... great management team, great company philosophy, overall great place to work."

good,"Target was a great place to work and the staff were great "
good,"A typical work day would be me clocking in on time, Cleaning up my area, organizing clothes and stocking up  on clothes, putting everything were it belonged."
good,"The general workflow was really nice. In most positions you would be given freedom to focus on your work without constant oversight from supervisors. If you had any questions, the supervisors would gladly help and answer any questions you had. While there may have been a couple bad apples co-worker wise, the vastly larger majority of people were very kind and made the entire environment feel very friendly."
good,"It was a very good place to work at, making it very difficult to want to leave. from the team members to the guest it wasn't that bad. being that my job was at the bottom, it grew frustrating when I couldn't get my position changed even though I was trained in it."

Once completed the cash office report to Customers Service to assist Guest with check out, returns, baby registry, online pick-up, and drive ups.  The hardest part of the job is our drive ups.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making the guest happy."
good,"Target is a cool place to work, as long as you are doing your job its very easy. Not sure about having a long future like most of the leaders I work with simply because this  is not in my career field but its OK, something to get me by"
good,"I found myself constantly on the move be it stocking shelves, rushing to help on registers when the store became congested, or even scouring the back room for that toy that a family wanted to surprise their child with. Though strenuous at times it quickly became one of the most rewarding feelings to offer great customer service and see the customer with a sense of relief and joy that the experience they went through was a positive one.  Truly enjoyed the experience and would gladly take another fast paced customer service based position"

good,"""Fast, fun, and friendly"" - was the first motto we were taught when working for Target. It was defiantly a customer-centered business with the focus being on having customers return as repeating shoppers. The energy levels you must have are high and you must be ready to improvise and deal with any surprises. I had a good relationship with my managers enough to be able to work with a flexible schedule that allowed me to go to school during weekdays; this is what I am most grateful for. It's a good place for young people, or high energy older adults to start their sales career."
good,"Target is a good workplace for people in high school and in college. They are flexible in hours, they understand that you need to be off at a certain time and they don't question it. Diverse workplace as well, also the hardest thing on the job would be the seasonal time but it gets easier as it goes on. Enjoyable part of the job is connecting with the guest and employees."

good,"Working was easy, got along great with co-workers from all departments,  management can be a handful at times, especially if they had no prior experience on the floor."
good,"It was a good experience when you are starting out in the retail business, but when i had foot surgery they would not allow me to sit down at the register and check the guests out, i had to take a 2 week leave, when i came back from the leave I checked the schedule and my name was not there so they failed to call me about my seasonal shift being over.  Other than that it was a great experience when starting out in the retail business."
good,Target has great benefits for their employees. BUT they don’t hire smart.  Many of their employees are lazy. You would end up having to pick up the lack from the overnight crew and etc.
good,"They gave hours if you wanted hours, and made okay hourly pay. They have since raised their minimum pay and give less hours, as well as raise work load for employees."
good,Most days were normal and usually during the weekend it got pretty busy. Everything was usually under control and other workers would offer help if needed.
good,"Loved working there. Moved up twice and always had a leader that wanted to help me. My last boss was awesome and helped me get my current job. Wanted what was best for me as a person and didn't limit my future growth on only Target, though they did try to counter when I left."

good,I say the people because the people is what makes that place so fun and interesting to be at!! And when you are having trouble they are always there to guide you in the right path.
good,Every employee was very friendly and helpful to both fellow employees and guests who needed aid. Some of the longer working employees were more than happy to give me tips on being the most efficient worker I can be.

good,Typical cashier duties in department chain store. Work is fairly boring and nothing very exciting. Pays the bills so no complaints. No problems working here and would work here again.

good,"Usually, an evening at Target was full of energy, fun, and surprises.  I learned that every customer should be treated with the same energy, fun, and excitement the prior customer received.  The customer is always right, and to always listen first, was a key to providing the customer good, customer service.  The workplace culture is Esprit de Corp and a family, oriented company.  Every day was enjoyable, even when it became extremely busy, it was fun."
good,the environment was fast paced yet easy to establish a good raport with your fellow workers and leadership. it was easy to get into the daily work life and being able to find your footing.
good,"One of the best work environments I've been in so far. Everyone was nice, we all got along so well. But the amount of labor they expect you to do during your shift is just too much. And a lot of those items come in big, heavy boxes, and they expect you to unpack and stock those heavy items quickly, but that's not possible with the size and weight of those items. and the 15-minute breaks they give you every two hours is not enough. And the 30-minute lunch break needs to be longer too, honestly. All the breaks need to be longer compared to all the physical activity you're doing while you're there."
good,"I enjoy working at Target. There is some micro managing when it comes to completing tasks/daily objectives, there is a lot of routines that keep you busy. The pay is very well and management is supportive"

good,"It is a great working environment. I worked seasonally and they were swift with the training, making sure you were able to keep up with the holiday shopping increase."
good,Target had a good and welcoming culture but was a slow-paced job. Management was always around to help. The hours were not enough to sustain a good financial standing at the time of my employment.
good,"Working at target was a very enjoyable experience, the job I had was very time-sensitive and required quite a bit of physical activity . managment was awesome."
good,I really enjoyed my time working at target it was fun and there was always something to do ! There was never a dull moment and management was very supportive.

good,This company offers a great pay. The employees are very friendly and helpful. The place is always clean. You can learn lots of new skills. There's plenty of opportunities.

good,"Some of the employees had an attitude and made working there a little stressful but management were very understanding, patient and frendly i really liked working there and there was a small chance they would keep me  but they didnt, they did say i could come back when work picked up again so we ended on good terms."

good,"This Target can be very busy and may seem like everything is going by fast. Overall, things, especially in the management portion of this job can be very confusing. I was only seasonal, but, I wasn't taken care of like other employees. They would not tell me who I could directly go to with any problems, questions, etc. However, other than this I really enjoyed working here. It gave me a great amount of experience."
good,Flexible schedules and good environment to work. Complete different tasks each day. Leave with a feeling of accomplishment. Room to move up in the company.
good,It is very busy at time so you must be good at multi-tasking. There is a lot of foot traffic so there must always be a very good attitude towards guests.
good,I have really enjoyed working at Target but me and my family are about to relocate to a different state and environment and different city due to personal reasons I just hope I can find a job where we are relocating to that fits alot of targets cons

good,"honestly i love working for target. Management changes have not been the best but, it is still a grerat place to work. I have worked there since 2017 and i have enjoyed my time there"
good,I work with great people. It's a different experience every day. I learn a lot about various cultures. My managers work with us to make sure that we understand everyone and everything.
good,Nice place to work. Good people . I don't like how it seems like it's all about the quantity and not the quality.Like how you can wear jeans. Walkie talkies are fun as well.
good,"Great place to work"
good,"There are somethings that target does differently."
good,Depending on your position there could be a variety of stuff to do. But you will always have a guest to help out. Whether it's to look for an item or help check them out.

good,"The environment at my target store is amazing. People are friendly, nice and understanding. They work with my school schedule and give me the amount of hours that i want."
good,Company works you very hard for you paycheck.. They work around the hours you ask for when required.  Mostly you are trained but not completely due to being seasonal.  Seasonal employees are treated different than the full time regular employees.  Most manager you have to earn there respect as a hard worker more than you do if you are hired on as a permanent employee.
good,Its ok I’m disappointed they didn’t keep me after seasonal was over but that’s life for you I mean as long as u communicate with them they’re pretty flexible and East to work with you get great pay good hours
good,it was very cool that is all I have to say but it is making me type more so I am just going to keep typing till it is saying I have reached the minimum
good,It was an awesome job as I was always challenged to be a better worker. My co-workers helped push me as well. Any issues we had we all felt safe and comfortable enough to talk about it. Management did not tolerate poor performance or tardiness. I especially enjoyed helping customers; it gave me a sense of purpose.
good,"Everything was ready when I walked in to work, from what register I would work from, to the scheduled breaks, lunch period, and check out.  The managers were close by for any questions and they would quickly find things for us to do if the number of customers was down, such as stocking."
good,"I like the job, but the temporary ended and I didn’t apply through the official company, it was tiring but the pay was good, I felt like I had a future there"

good,All my managers were great to work for and I learned a lot from them. The work enviroment was nice to work in I never felt pressured or talked down to everyone was great

good,friendly faces and nice management good pay they give hours based of sale so do not look for 40 hours every week but overall a good work environment and i love working here
good,"Going into work can be very different for the type of position you have. If your on the floor you can be slow, in the back its usually fast paced and upfront where the cashiers are it has its in betweens."
good,"I enjoyed doing this job because it was always fast-paced, which I liked. I was never standing around doing nothing; I was always helping a customer or completing tasks that needed to be done.

good,"Target is a fun place to work, most of the people are very friendly, very flexible with my schedule, I’m just not sure I’m happy in my position anymore"
good,Target is a workplace that works to help give back the community and maximize employee happiness. Team leaders of each target store take time to help employees with their jobs and give vocal and hands on experience needed to work productively and proficiently. Unlike other places I worked target puts employees on top of their priority and help them grow and care for their happiness and well being. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with team leaders in my workplace than rather working at a store where the manager tells you to go do something and you do it alone where at target there are many team leaders who always put themselves out there and give there all to the store and make sure there employees are well trained and experienced for the job. The hardest and best part of the job is when the workload and customer trafficking increases to where your on your toes pushing yourself to get thing done fast as possible professionally as possible. every morning and night where I go into work I am always greeted by smiles and warm welcomes from all the managers and team member who appreciate the fact the I come in to do my best and put myself out there showing them what I am made of and what I can do to make the workplace better everyday.
good,Not a terrible company. Management could have more managers and definitely more security hired. Style team needs more help with putting away clothes and cleaning up sections. Coworkers are overall friendly.
good,"Its been an okay ride at Target, sure it wasnt what I was expecting when i first started working there but after a while i got used to the work asked by me and it became enjoyable."
good,The work was simple and honest. Fellow employees as well as managers and supervisors were very supportive. They provided the tools to get the job done properly.

good,"I was looking for a job with stability and paid decently for someone who didn't need anything but a high school diploma. "
good,They are a good company to work for. There are times of the year your hours will go down but than when they do get busier it a great feeling. You can learn a great deal ask questions. Talk to your leaders they like when you want to learn more about the company.
good,"Overall a good place to work. They work with your schedule so you can go to school, take care of family, etc. Good experience for pretty much every field you may want to end up working in."
good,"Working sales floor and cashier when lines got busy. Pretty good business to work for, did not really complain about anything.employees are friendly and will help when needed"
good,Great job very diverse but a lot of things can be improved team leader are okay but management and HR aren’t the best they should learn how to respect there employers and that not every person is the same so you can’t talk to people any kind of way and expect them to take it and especially embrassing a employee in front of staff and guess.
good,A typical day at target consist in assisting guest in whatever assistance they need. We stock the sales floor with product. Work on go backs when we finish stocking. Back up the front lanes when the stores experiences rush hours. Lastly we leave a great zone for the opener tomorrow.
good,"i’ve learned many things from this company, definitely a place i’d recommend to others. they’re very understanding and help you with any problems to fit your needs"
good,"Picking/Packing online orders, in store pickup and drive up orders"
good,"I liked working there. They were like one big family. the pay was good. it was just a seasonal job. The best part of the job was woe6king with the public. I always did what i was suppose to,  after i was done i had helped the other workers weather it was stocking sheleves or folding clothes, or putting things where they should be."
good,The managers are excellent they’ve always treated me well and really worked with my around my schedule and the birth of my son. The job is a retail job so it comes with the standard issues
good,The best part about working a Target is the satisfaction you get from putting a smile on the guest face after finding an item they have been searching for.
good,"Job experience greatly depends on the store you work at, and on how well you interact with your co-workers and managers. I had a great experience in my first store, and a less enjoyable experience at my second store but the job was great nonetheless."
good,Good job I never late my attendance for OnPoint overall it's a great environment I enjoy working with customers also enjoyed working in all the positions I worked in wish I would have continued working for them but had to move
good,"When I got hired, they were well informed for most part on orientation. They spaced it well to where new team members don't get overwhelmed with new information.  Workplace's attitude is very positive and outgoing."
good,"When working are target, you are always kept busy. You will encounter customers with respect and no respect. But when working in target you should know how to approach any kind of customer. Working in target made me improve my patience, and interact with people of many different kind. It is a fun work place and you will adapt to your surroundings in no time."
good,"I had my hours, always 40/hr, family-oriented and friendly, but after the remodel everything went downhill, our were getting cut left and right, struggling to get good hours."
good,"It's a really nice place to work. My location paid over the minimum wage, which was great. My friend got raises after working there for 1-2 years. Ideal for high school or college students."
good,At target you choose your hours they are friendly and efficient and they also understand your needs. a typical work day is fast passed because a lot of costumer bring furniture and clothes and fruits. i have learned to organize chemicals with other food products and how to deal with temperamental attitude and last i am friendly with other costumers
good,"My experience at Target was satisfying. I was able to maintain while employees there. I was more than happy when I got confirmation of the job. Luckily with my past experiences, I was able to fit in quickly."
good,"Interaction with guests is interesting. Learning different things like devices functions. Management have open door policy and very helpful. The culture is professional and making the guests happy. Standing for long hours is the downside. I enjoy working with my colleagues and management, great group of people."
good,": Assisting to customers, cashier, have two different breaks during shift"
good,"With being a guest service attendant you have to make sure you're engaged with everyone, which was a good way to get your customer/ people skills in a good area."
good,I work for Target seasonal temporary job it was pleasant it was also during Christmas season very busy fast pace I enjoyed it team was present I would work for them again
good,"As a checkout advocate I was able to learn cashiering, self checkout, guest services, and target cafe. Being a checkout advocate keeps you on your toes and lets you learn a lot about the front end."
good,Working at target has a cashier was really easy and people there were great . Yes you would get the nit picky customers but there will always be those. The only thing was that you had to be ready to stand up for long period of times. I would then pick up shift and do a 10 hrs shift was painful on my feet but all worth it at the end
good,"Set schedule, job stability. also working with live customers was a big plus that it being i am a ""people person"". One of the ongoing issues was not having enough product to fill shelf's."
good,While working at Target very clean and organize company managing very helpful and listen and understanding staff very helpful in accommodating I love the area of the customers they were very pleasant when they came in and considerable...
good,Overall it was okay working there . I think the gstl people could of been a little more helpful An nice.  An being more involved with the employers as well .
good,My typical day at target was dealing with theft and safety in the store. I do security walks and safety walks daily to make sure the team and guest are safe. I would do walks and watch computer camera's to look for theft. Deal with angry guest and help them with what they need.
good,Honestly one of the best targets Ive ever been at. The people do their jobs right and its a clean nice place to work. Management isnt always breathing down your neck and are very understanding.
good,"I have been working at Target full-time for more than 3 years"
good,"True definition of a FAST, FUN, AND FRIENDLY TEAM. Customer service driven company. Focused on making every shopping experience count. They believe in their team members and empower them often to make the right decisions to support their mission."
good,It’s a good place to work at and I use to love working their.    Managers are great love the working environment; love the guest how everyone feels like family.
good,Working for target has been a pretty good experience. The managers have been good and the working hours have been flexible to my needs. The culture is great if things are getting done.
good,"A typical day at work was you had to come in clock in, and for me either I went to cashier or I had to do cart attendant. Some days I did both but the work was never hard."
good,"I started as a seasonal General Merchandise Expert (although it was still called Hardlines when I started) and was kept on the team afterwards. I am a student and worked part time, and for the most part the hours accommodated that well. Overall the work isn't difficult, but it can be a lot to manage sometimes, especially on the weekends if you work at a Super Target like I did. GM (General Merchandise) includes stocking shelves, helping guests locate items on the floor or get items from the back for them, making sure the sales floor and shelves are clean and organized, and occasionally backing up in areas that need it (the check lanes, for the most part). The more I worked and proved myself, the more hours I was able to work, and the more areas I was able to expand to. While I was primarily a GM Team Member, I frequently had shifts in Order Fulfillment, Cashiering, Guest Service, Electronics, Food and Beverage, etc. If you're willing to train in other areas they can accommodate you! The pay is pretty nice: $13/hour currently, soon to be $15/hour, but a natural part of having more pay is that hours can be really inconsistent. I could be scheduled around 35 hours one week and 14 the next. I'd recommend taking advantage of swapping/taking shifts with coworkers if you need more hours: all the more reason to train in as many areas as you can. Inconsistent hours didn't hurt me personally too much as I was a part time employee and a student, but some employees who worked full time, usually some of the hardest workers in the store, suffered from cut hours, even if they had done nothing"
good,I enjoyed working at Target. My typical day started with clocking in and reporting to a supervisor on where I would start for the day. My typical schedules were part time and I was always on the move from Customer service to warehouse work and back to apparel service in the women's department. Hardest part of my job was answering the phones and most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and learning about all the wonderful products the store has to offer. The workplace culture seemed fair but i could tell who the favorite people are and who are not.
good,"Every morning I clock in , I go right to the truck line and grab the first flat of merchandise I see for my area. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything done on time"
good,"I loved it here until they hired new management from outside of target. After that things got a little rocky. With the right management team, the store and team members run smoothly."
good,I would clock in and get my shift started by looking at the grid in what department I was in and then I would start pushing out the merchandise and then back stocking what didn't fit.
good,Target has a lot of room for one to grow if your willing to learn they offer good benefits and flexible scheduling. However I do not believe the pay is truly fair all the work put in.
good,It was a good place to work just didn’t get paid for the amount of work they wanted you to do but it was a good environment to get to know people and learn different things
good,I would go out a clear the parking lot of carts and other things that were put out side. I would also clean the bath rooms and other areas of the store if need and I would help the front end if need.
good,"It's a great place to work! you learn a lot, not only about the job but yourself. Management varies at each location. Target is all about being a team."
good,The work at Target was doable. Guest service in any capacity can be difficult but it wasn't too bad here.  I worked in softlines and basically put clothes away and worked fitting room.  They started cutting hours due to a new thing called modernization.  Th problem is that they cut hours so each person has large areas of the store to cover by themselves and the workload is almost impossible to complete.  I hated to see this happen but sadly its not the best place anymore. So many people have quit.
good,It is a good place to work. The employees discount could be better.  They have good benefits and good people to work with. It is a good place whether it's short-term it long-term.
good,"Great company to work for, team work is always valued and prioritized but it’s not guaranteed that you’ll keep the job if you’re there for seasonal even if you comply everything they want and you do your work"
good,Very happy working at target in the beginning. Seemed as if what I did didn’t matter. Employees were very close and you could tell their were biases between team leaders and certain associates.
good,Family friendly company with a lot of wonderful employees. A very diverse and inclusive environment. Enjoyable compay with good benefits and pay based on other similar jobs
good,"Target was a great place to work. With flexible hours and friendly team members, I never dreaded going into work. Also, the hourly rate for all employees went up by $1 about every 6 months, so that was nice."
good,"Great place and good pay, physically strong is a must due to a very fast-pace job. Otherwise, it's is a really good place to work for. Work with various kinds of forklifts, high tech of convey belt systems."
good,"Best place to work in retail, but not a place to ""sleep while you work"".  You are expected to work and keep moving.  It helps with this to stay in shape, and the culture is different.  I enjoy working at Target because it's stressful, fast-paced, and keeps me moving every day.  The people are a pleasure to work with, and management is friendly and are helpful."
good,Was an employee for 23 years. Was able to advance and move up in the company. Earned paid vacation and holidays. Great place to work career wise. Would recommend.
good,"For a first job, Target is a great choice. It IS stressful sometimes, but it's fun, has a great minimum wage,  and lets you feel in charge of what you do. My biggest issues: Low Hours and the fact I don't want to work here forever. "
good,"the work place culture was surprisingly fun, everyone got along great there was never a problem that I was aware of. The managers work with you about schedules."
good,Good experience good coworkers good manager store benefits schedule was great learned a lot of things and loved the seasonal store commotions definitely miss
good,The job is okay. You are moving at all times. Helping the guest.Backstocking.ILiked my job. Liked the people who I worked with. Licked the guest who came
good,the day was always busy never nonstop work. it was fun though. the workers treated me like i was family. the constantly checked up on me. i would not mind working another busy job
good,"Target , Target was a wonderful place to work . They trained on professionalism,great team work and how to protect assets and gross  marginal profitable sales and services. I enjoyed every minute of it. The Police were always there after we apprehended subjects great support from them it just was an great overall experience."
good,"I worked there as truck unloader and organizing the products on the shelfs "
good,Great company with excellent benefits.  Must be adaptable and ready for change as they do often.  You do get every other weekend off as an Executive which is a great perk and they do value work/like balance.  Would recommend.
good,"Target has been a good company for, but it isn't rewarding like working in a group home setting. It wasn't an easy decision to seek other employment, but I don't get as much out of and satisfaction as I do with helping clients reach his/her goals."
good,In this job i learn how to stack and organized  product on the backroom as well how to distribute product to the sale associated to provide customer qualidy.
good,"High paced work environment, trained to be able to work in your own department, good discounts, great customer service training, flexible with work hours to compensate school/life."
good,"Good pay, respectable employees. Poor training, poor management, and requesting days off was close to impossible. Your time there depends on what department youre assigned to."
good,Target was a great place to work. Unfortunately for myself I couldn't keep 2 full time jobs and try to go to school. It gets a little crazy around the holidays but nothing extreme.
good,Overall Target was a good place for me to learn and develop long lasting relationships with co workers and managers. I learned how to to improve on my communication skills while problem solving and executing my task on a professional level.
good,It's a great place to work if you put yourself to it I enjoyed it very easy and was a happy place to serve customers just a bit dramatic with the management
good,great  environment  to working. excellent personnel management. with great other services. the always room the room for growth. encourage  job seeker to apply there.
good,Working at Target is a fun job. All my coworkers are uplifting and appreciative. I have the best boss to ever exist. The hours are hit or miss depending on the time of the year.
good,Managers were nice and understanding except on holidays. Most weekdays for front of store attendants are easy paced. sometimes it does get swamped and managers are on top of keeping you hydrated.
good,"The job requires lots of standing/walking, and almost constant movement. The management was okay, though some of them don't take too well to being told when they are wrong or have made a mistake. Most of the associates are very helpful, so if you have questions they are always willing to help. The pay is excellent and the benefits are above average, including medical, vision and dental."
good,"It's a good job, they just tend to hire too many people. Which translates to not giving enough hours to anyone unless they have a higher position like shift lead."
good,I liked working at Target. I was just seasonal. The people were nice. The store is one of the largest in our are area. I save alot of money shopping at Target.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, my experience with the supervisors and co-workers left me with a sense of gratitude. The only issue there was in my opinion was not enough time to display my strengths."
good,"Very friendly environment, fun place to work, fast paced, customers always first, neat and clean environment. Great staff. Enjoyed working for Target!"
good,I really enjoyed working here. It was a fun experience for one of my first jobs. The pay is really good and hours were nice. I would recommend this job.
good,"I love target . It's not stressful. But is part time for most employees "
good,i  love working for target.  they treated you well.  the problem is they open way to many stores at onnce. that is why i think they closed. i love working for the public.
good,I worked @ Target for many years and enjoyed my experience. I knew a lot about the company by working there for so long. The only downside was some of the new ETLs/STLs that came through that had no clue of what they were doing but still trying to call shots.
good,Target is a nice place to work. All of management are vary nice and willing to help you. You learn new things to better yourself with your customers.I have really enjoyed my time at Target and wish them all the best.
good,Fun place to work at and you will meet a lot of wonderful guests.. Every day at work is a learning day. We learn something new every day. I enjoy my time at target ( bossier city ) and I also work for a target company ( mervyn's ) for 14 years also. This is a very good company to work for..Thanks for the great opportunities. Thanks!!!!
good,"Company has amazing benefits for full time and part-time employees. They promote within a lot so good chance of moving up. However, I work the night shift so not really much promotion for those employees.  Can be repetitive after two months, but it can be fun at times. "
good,"I worked at Target for two years. Whilst working there, I met some of the people I love most in the world. Everyone they hire is so kind and full of personality and I'll never regret working here. The management at my location is what drove me away."
good,"Very busy, lots of varried tasks but still has an element of routine. You will be interacting with a lot of people, both customers and other workers. Management tends to be helpful but busy. Like I said, it's retail."
good,"Fast paced working in the back, as well as getting all the product out on the sales floor. Hardest part was meeting the deadline because some people would call off and we'd be short handed."
good,"I loved working at target, but as I was a senior in highschool I couldn’t keep up with all the assignments and the job. Target cares for their employees and it’s just a really great job for everyone."
good,"Management on the corporate level needs adjustments,entry level workers are 100% on with the culture and management at lower levels very professional. Most leads are very well trained unfortunately some are young and lack accountability and experience but always great store managers and HR department..wonderful comapany to work for "
good,"Target provided a work friendly environment which made the transition when I first started very easy. I recommend target to anyone looking for a job, it’s a great experience and work friendly."
good,Leaders in department were not familiar with or have a working knowlege of the department.Turnover of leaders too frequent.Rules andregulationsin constant turmoil.
good,There is never a typical day at work. Everything changes from day to day. Our job is to balance task with service as our first job is to create a seamless and friction-less experience for every guest that walks through the front door. The most rewarding part of the job is when you make a guest happier than when they came in.
good,"Target is a really good place to work at, it pays better than the minimum wage jobs like McDonald's, and you are doing just about the same thing, standing on your two feet the whole time while serving people."
good,"Try your best, always, and great/treat guests with respect, they're priority when it comes to the work environment. Make sure you are prepared to be in a social environment and interacting with all kinds of guest."
good,"Working at Target you rely heavily on the entire store team, not just your department.  There are constant opportunities to think out side of the box and to problem solve.  It is fast paced and it's important to remember that there will always be work to be done, sometimes you might not be able to finish your task before your shift is over."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, the people are fun and the job is easy once you get a grasp on the work. It's very time based for most of the positions, so if you like fast paced work, its good."
good,Working at Target for the past three years has been in all pretty fun. The managers get to know the Team members and are willing to work with you if you have school or if this is a second job they will do anything to keep you there if you are a valuable asset to them.
good,"It’s an easy going company with friendly coworkers. Difficulty depends on which position you are, but most of them is simple enough, no complexity at all. It’s a great place for a first job."
good,Learned all the routes while working at target. A great experience to gain customer service and retail experience. There are a few ups and downs as being a retail worker because you deal with different types of guest who shop at target. Got to be strong.
good,"It was a pretty laid back experience, especially once you got used to it and found an area you liked. The stocking was easy for me, you'd just go along stocking shelves in each aisle. Shift was usually short, about 4AM to 11AM."
good,I enjoyed my time at target. I enjoyed helping people out as much as I could. Met a lot of new people. I would recommend this job to other people as well
good,Pretty cool company to work for.  The enviroment was always up beat.  A great team with great leaders   was one big happy family for the most part.  Holidays where a bit cr=azy
good,Target was a fun place to work for. Constantly busy. Customers were great. My most enjoyable experience was getting to help customers out and be at the register.
good,"It is very fast paced, but cool meeting people. I learned how to deal with angry customers. My coworkers are extremely helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult people."
good,"I enjoyed my time at target but it was time to move on,I loved working with my field partners and co-workers. My boss from dispute resolution was great, she helped develop me as a person."
good,I have really enjoyed the time that I have been working at Target.  I have learned a lot about myself and I have been able to develop relationships with some great people.
good,there was A lot to be done in one day at times it can be so overwhelming you have to put up picks sometimes when you do picks it leaves you to zone for only 2 hours and it not enough time to zone the right way
good,"good start and few hours, nice people good atmosphere , fast pace be friendly and always treat guests very nicely, its alway busy and most of the time people don't come up for backup"
good,Good company to work for. Company Takes care of employees. It was a great experience I learned a lot I was to able to use previous skills to do my job well.
good,"Target appreciates and recognizes hard work and definitely looks to promote top talent. You are rewarded for your hard work but if you have a family, don't plan to see them much, especially if you are in a managerial role."
good,Target is fast paced.Job is sensonal when first hired in but if you make cut they hire you in.I would recommend working at target distribution centers.
good,"Insure effective computer systems to track, progress, for regularly evaluation of components/products sold. Establish communication between customers and management. Strive to succeed company’s daily goals in sales.  Orderly maintain the main control desk in the back room to keep orders up to date for efficient records. Built relationships with other venders to keep shipments of targets products a constant flow with the company. Used procedures learned through training to access lifts and other machinery to ingress more product through the store. Problem solve and review any sales that have not been packaged or shipped by the end of ones shift."
good,It is a very fast placed environment to work in . You have to have  experience in this type of jobs to overcome the obstacles that it come with and you might face.
good,"I worked a seasonal position, so I didn't get a real feel of the place, but it seemed like a fun, collaborative environment. Be warned though, Target is a large chain store, and you will likely be very busy your entire shifts."
good,fast pasted  you have to learn how to talk to people deal with guest if you are not a people person than target is not for you because it comes with a lot of responsibility
good,I'm a very hard working person  who likes to get the job done and to see a smile on our customers face and target was the perfect place to work I just hope I could get some more experience with my peers
good,A good place to work or begin work for teens. It has flexible scheduling with great hourly pay. Training is thorough and easy to comprehend. Variety of jobs are offered.
good,Team members were very friendly and helpful. Clean and well organized workplace.  Learned some techniques to help me work smarter and not harder.  Overall my experience was pretty good :)
good,Worked as customer fulfillment from Sept to Dec 2016 and it was nice. You're literally shopping for other people's online orders so it was easy. Nice hours as well.
good,Target treated me well and all of my co-workers were very friendly and helpful. Transfered to a different Target and I received the same warm welcome.
good,"learned various ways of sales "
good,"40% physical labor, 30% Customer service, 20% Cashiering 10% Food prep and cooking. I like Target. Management was friendly, understanding, and helpful. Youthful, friendly, inclusive, diverse work environment. Hardest part of the job is rude customers, and physical strain. The most enjoyable part of the job? IT'S TARGET!"
good,"I worked at two locations and for the most part, they are very much the same. The culture is of inclusion and personally, you are given opportunities to be accountable for your work."
good,"I mostly liked my last job position, which was doing those early morning shifts that can start as early as 4am. It was quiet and I got to work in the back mostly. Closing can be a real challenge. It will generally start to pick up around 3pm and abandons can be overwhelming. Getting paid vacation time approved was hard or impossible. I wasn't the only one who lost out on a lot of hours when leaving. (You can't receive pay in lieu of using it). But generally, it was my first job so it wasn't bad. I was there for 3 and a half years."
good,I was working as a TPS at the Harlem target location but had to relocate to Lexington Kentucky for educational advancements. target is a great place to find a career.
good,I love target. I just wish they would give me fulltime hours but since they are not I'm looking to leave and get a job that will give me fulltime hours. If they were to give me fulltime ide stay.
good,"A typical day depending on the department employed under, as a market member were first ensure fresh product is still edible and quality is up to standard, then we unload the freight, and stock all merchandise while assisting customers"
good,"It pays good, the hours are not very fun. The warehouse is huge and it is always hot. They don’t care if you’re sick or pretty much anything about you."
good,"A typical day at work consist of making sure your department is clean for the guests. If you see the department messy clean it so the guest can be able to shop. The better your department looks, the better the sales."
good,"Always let your managers know your situation or what is going on with home problems because either they’ll help or understand..also always smile,and stay positive"
good,"It's been a long time, but it was pretty decent job to start with. I started as a cart attendant, then went on sales floor to be a stocker, casher, or a bike builder. If you're focusing on hourly jobs, they'll offer many other positions when you worked a bit longer, or if you ask to have another position."
good,"It was a decent job. Paid very well. Had 12 hr days m-f. It was just really hard in the winter time because the degrees gets really low in the back of the trucks. Also, the amount of trucks you have to load differ from 8-15."
good,"Target was my first actual job. I grew a lot during this period and worked areas of the store that I didn't think I would ever work in. It helped me expand my knowledge of a retail store and how they run. Throughout my years at Target, I had an amazing manager. One who pushed me because she knew my capabilities, but was also sympathetic if I had a rough time at any point. The atmosphere made the job such a great experience."
good,"Depending on your position your responsibilities would be different. For P-Fresh, you are in charge of the produce and freezers. Making sure the food on the floor is not expired and the ones on the floor have expiration tags. Truck comes 6 days a week and there is always a P-Fresh truck."
good,The overall environment was safe fun and really friendly. there was a good amount of opportunities for boding and advancement in the workplace. A great take away as far as future experiences.
good,Great Company to work for. Each store differs so much from what the company's vision is overall. Management is the key to what it will be like working for Target. If you have a great manager and those above him you'll love working for Target.
good,"This was my very first job. I liked it! But i was a freshman in college and the hours weren't as flexible as i had wished and i got sick alot during peak season which prevented me at times to come into work. I had to quit but i was only a seasonal member so it didn't really matter. Either way, i think target is great!"
good,When I worked here it was a good environment. I liked working here the pay was okay the management was good. The only thing that I didn’t like was I didn’t get enough hours that I needed to.
good,"I had worked at Target as a summer job, and it was exactly what I was looking for. I was searching for a position that I could take while at home from college and it gave me the hours and salary I needed."
good,"It is a good company to work for, guest driven and benefits are pretty good medical dental 401k. management communication needs work every one is on a different page when it comes to management but the end goal is there. Some of the management needs to take things a bit more serious like incident reports."
good,Management encourages advancement to qualified employees.  They truly want to see you succeed. The hardest part of the job was getting customers to sign up for the RED CARD program.
good,"It was overall a good experience."
good,"My typical day consisted of making food, helping customers, processing payments and making drinks. I learned how to make most of the drinks at Starbucks. Management was okay, some problems in scheduling but other than that no complaints. The hardest part of the job is time management but once you get that down its okay."
good,"Target was my first job, it has shown me how to be in a workplace environment as well as interacting with new people. Not only did it take me out my comfort zone but it also made me work driven."
good,"Very flexible with hours, fun work environment. Management cares about employees and are always there to help. Great first job for younger kids to start with."
good,"Good place to work. Various positions always available.  Open seven days a week, great opportunities for working parents to have a steady income.  Flexible schedule."
good,I've worked at Target seasonal work several years ago and I've been trying to get rehired for a cashier position but never been contacted. The work was steady the people was pleasant n my supervisor awesome. The benefit package was ok just want to be a part of the team again.
good,Working here allows a person to learn enough in multiple work centers to excel within or outside of the company. Finding the time to train and the hours to work are the only things to balance
good,"The Job Itself Is A Good Job, although Guests Get Nasty And Catch Attitudes When You Ask them to Provide You With Their Receipt. Management Is Inconsistent And The Security specialists Are Under paid For The Hassle They Go through."
good,"It was a fairly easy job, but with some hiccups. Like anywhere in the world some people are different and rude but that never cared me away from work."
good,The work is exactly what you'd expect of Target. Keep your head down and pocket your check. It's not for everyone but it was something I appreciated. The work is as good as you make it.
good,Very relaxing and a very friendly environment. We would get busy during the peak season. There would be times where we could get OT and work 60 hours A week.
good,"good, fair, honest, friendly good staff"
good,"the job pays very well, but sometimes they give too many hours that you cant focus on other important things in your life. the people that work there are nice"
good,"Easy work environment, kind co-workers and willing to take the time to properly teach you how the job is done. Management was kind and caring and work hours were generous."
good,"Easy work if you pay attention though management is a little too hands off. Can be some gossip but if you stick to your work it is an okay place. You can be moved around when understaffed, but you will be trained."
good,"Productive and fast-paced retail environment"
good,My job allows me to work with guests in a fast-paced environment. All target team members are happy to help to provide the best possible experience for the guests.
good,hard work in a  warehouse setting. Pick and pull and stock. Operated the a forklift. Work third shift. Overall  a good company- 10% discount at stores with working at the warehouse. NOT REALLY SURE WHY YOU ARE WANTING ME TO WRITE  AREVIEW THREE YEARS AFTER I STOPPED WORKING
good,"A typical day at target was pretty relaxed and fixed, I would walk in and already know what needed to be done and how. My co workers were great and so were the managers, they made my job even better."
good,I actually enjoyed working for target. I left because after seasonal I was only work 4 hour days and getting 16 hours a week. You cannot live off of that.
good,Target is a great parttime job.Flexible schedule and interaction with great customers. Management willing  to assist with various issues one might have.
good,"I organized, retrieved and maintained product shipment from distribution centers in retail center as backroom team member. As a cashier and sales floor member, I assisted customers with purchasing and providing information of the different products that Target sold, i.e. Target brand items, Target debit and credit cards, etc."
good,It's a great place to work its fast paced and a friendly environment friendly co workers and lots of teamwork going on plus independent work too its enjoyable
good,Target was a good company and now owned by CVS. The training was different but similar. Staff was nice and helpful. I learned a lot of everyone and in different ways.
good,A typical day at Target as a flow member consisted of pulling carts for your designated section and stocking shelves. After 3/4 hours you get a paid 15 minute break and after 6 you get a 30 minute lunch
good,Good friendly place to work. It still has a lot of room for improvement such as management. I feel as though target should choose their management team wisely. I feel like this is what is holding back from major improvement.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of processing and receiving with little time, this made it both the most easy and difficult part of the job because knowing what to expect is calming however the amount and time frame is difficult. I learned how to create productive shortcuts that better grouped like packaged items and management was very hands on in teaching"
good,Target has a relaxed atmosphere for guests and workers alike although it can sometime be daunting due to negligent supervisors especially if you are in the front end.
good,I really enjoyed working for Target got to learn new things being part of there team. Everyone makes sure they train you the best always there to help everyone out treats customers great and treats there workers great.
good,Great coworkers and  culture. Management is supportive and knowledgeable.  Respectful of employees and team members. Cafeteria is excellent and reasonably priced
good,"I'll say that Target has an amazing culture! People are friendly, willing to help, and are generally great. The management team is enganged and typically right along side the team members to accomplish goals."
good,I worked in Food Ave and had a blast with everyone I worked with. We all genuinely loved helping customers and making food amazing. I was so sad when target chose to get rid of them. Happy to still have those memories
good,It was an awesome place to work. The managers are always available to help and the hours were very flexible. You also have many opportunities for advancement in a short period of time.
good,"Target was a seasonal job for me, during the holiday season.  I was a stock associate and stocked the shelves of items that were needed.  Target was a good company to work for."
good,Some of the managers were super rude there and would usually just yell at the cashiers for doing nothing even when there was nothing to do. It was a good starter job for a teenager
good,I would recommend anyone to work there if they are interested in getting some retail experiences.  There was room for me to grow as a person and professionally.
good,"Working at target was an amazing experience, although I was seasonal it really taught me the importance of a fast pace job and through customer interaction the importance being warm and inviting is not only beneficial to the customer but also with management"
good,"Target was one of the most fast-paced jobs I have ever had. The work in the market area was very detail oriented and most of the  Market shifts started before the store opened. The culture was very friendly and fun, the team had to be working together on all fronts in order to make sure everything got done. The most enjoyable part for me was the interactions with the guests and the sense of accomplishment when everything was done."
good,"I really enjoyed working there "
good,During my time at Target I’ve learned a lot of things. Working with other help me a lot. It taught me a how to be a team player. My people skills went up a lot by helping the guests.
good,"This was a typical retail environment, so you can expect to work days as well as nights and weekends.  There is a lot of structure, which is good, and management was friendly."
good,I got a lot of good experience. It's a good work environment. The hardest part of the job is multi tasking. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co workers.
good,A typical day at work is fast pace. I was required to look for products in the back room and on sales floor. Once items were picked we have to pack the items on time for FedEx to pick up the packages. F
good,It was a great place to work at. You always met new people. Stayed busy and a very great experience. The point of my job was to make sure everyone was happy and make them come back.
good,This company strives to develop employees who seek to learn and improved themselves. Team rapport is very obvious. Great long term job security. Great company for new entry level executives seeking for training and learning in the RETAIL world.
good,"Customer Service"
good,ok place to work but after Dec 26th till Easter hours take a major drop other than that it's a ok place to work but you don't get much time off and full time is hardly given
good,"It’s either college kids or depressed 40 year olds, it was ok for the most part tho. Management is ok, but they recently added OPU (order pick ups) for lazy people who don’t want to go in the store to get their orders and some people literally order 30 items and you only get 30 minutes to gather their entire order. Not fun"
good,"Very helpful, the work was never too strenuous and the managers, higher help was always friendly. I never felt like I was too clustered or over worked."
good,My co workers were over all friendly. my managers were strict but very helpful and nice. the hours were flexible. and it was a safe and friendly place to work.
good,They treat workers like family. It was really nice working there and the work ain’t that hard and you also learn quickly. You get a 10% discount is not that good but not bad either. Loved working there
good,Overall store managment  was great at my store.  But you work non direct  which is cool. As an asset protection lead be carefull follow the  directives. NPIs will get you fired if you still under probation thats how they terminated me. I got what I thought was my first apprhension.Ended up getting a non productive app meaning no merchandise on the person was found even though I saw them conceal. I was gone in three days It was 6-11-2019 when it happened and you get the point. Again managment was great loved my store. but policy is what I had the issue with. Nothing in the directives states termination or in handbook. but hey just make sure you follow every step if you want to susceed no room for mistakes cut and clear...I'm just sharing my experience but dont look at this being negative. I'm glad to have been there . FOLLOW YOUR DIRECTIVES
good,"I enjoyed my time with Target, very friendly place relaxed. Good benefits and great pay. Understanding and patient for new employers. Good opportunities to grow."
good,"Not a bad place to work, it can be stressful but that just comes with being in management. I would have stayed if I wasn't moving. They did attempt to do everything they could to transfer me but the position just wasn't open and I didn't want to step down to a Team Member."
good,I had so much fun interacting with guests and helping my team complete tasks. I was busy and efficiency is key when doing your part! I made a lot of lasting friends and learned valuable skills working on the sales floor.
good,Target is a great place to work with a fun company culture. It is a competitive process to move up in the company because there are a lot of great candidates
good,"Basic customer service, fixing many issues throughout the work day. Inconsistent with hours and continuous changing policies. Great place to work fresh out of school or going to school."
good,"I typically worked at Starbucks I made all the coffee's warmer the pastries. I cleaned all the machines and closed down. I started training at the front counter, the check out area."
good,"This was a seasonal job for the christmas season of that year, it was a good job while i had it i wish i could have stayed. It was also convenient that it was in the mall."
good,"Expect to work standard retail schedule.  If you are a generally happy person and like to interact with customers you will enjoy working at Target.  Forward thinking and structured.  Be prepared for critical feedback, but if you are self accountable, you already are."
good,"Target is a great company to work for, I wouldn't mind going back to Target as a manager. Many different departments where you can grow your career. Good people."
good,"Started off as a cashier then moved into the Photo department at the time. Learned alot there. Then, moved to the Customer Service and it went well. Leaned enough to be considered for a Supervisor Assistant role."
good,"Learned plenty in my short time employed. This was a great experience to prepare me for employment elsewhere. "
good,"great work place, closing shift is hard since there are times where there aren't enough employees to help. workplace culture is interesting, I want to say management has their favorites"
good,"Great place for a first job. Most employee’s are really friendly and make you feel at home. You get cross trained. As a cashier it’s encouraged that you sell red cards. Like most places, part time work is probably what you’ll get unless your a manager. Though it is possible to volunteer for shifts on the job board. When I started out in food ave. The hours weren’t the best, but they made improvements around the time I left. It’s either really slow or really busy, very rarely is it steady. You are given an hour to prep the store in the morning or an hour at night depending on your shift. That’s generally enough time, especially once you get experience behind you."
good,The majority of my work was on the register on a daily basis. As long as you can handle that smoothly you'll be fine. lines never got too long or busy so even a beginner on the register should be fine.
good,Managers worked well and thought me many tips. Nice people around but very few ways to advance if you don't know anyone In the company. Its a great starter job.
good,"Fun place to work for. Always have something to do. Pay scale is great. Target is always improving store layout, employees benefit, safety and guest satisfaction."
good,"Its a good job. Easy. Depending on if you can handle a lot of responsibility and if you can keep up a god pace. If that's not you, you won't like target."
good,"Great job taught me alot , i learned customer service, learn how to work in retail, i became good at working multiple departments, but it was a seasonal job"
good,Target employees really are a team and work together. Management is easy to talk to and there is always some tasks to complete during the day. Weekends can be very busy which was good.
good,"The environment was nice, loved working there but I had to relocate to another job being that the transfer to another store took long to occur. It was a good first job."
good,Fun and clean place to work but managers are not on the same page. Great flexible schedule and good pay. Good team members and staff that shows recognition for excellent performance.
good,I liked working there because it was fun and relaxed at the same time. Unfortunately I had to go to college which is why I don’t work at target anymore.
good,"Target is good, despite not always obtaining 40 working hours every week. The work is easy, and the climate controlled environment makes for good working conditions."
good,"great work environment "
good,"Great place to get started with management as well as learning to deal with all types of people in all situations. Given free reign to find solutions and partner across different levels of the company. Hard work, for the most part, is rewarded."
good,"Target holds themselves high when it comes to their customers. They proudly serve them to their very needs. Working very well with teamwork and collaboration, target has a good network."
good,"The position allowed me to meet the customers and advise of the ""red card"" promotion so each customer I had to be engaged and speak to them.  "
good,"I guess my most typical day would be assisting guest in locating items, answer and directing incoming phone calls, product restocking, weekly price changes, daily audits, daily pulls and sometimes providing cashier and Guest Services backup assistance."
good,Ive learned alot from my time at target and have since used that knowledge to build apon in other stores. They teach you how to be asset protection the correct way.
good,"It's a good way to jump start your career and gain some basic skills in customer service and security. They help you with all the basic needs and provide flexible workhorse. Often times, district management will hold high expectations, not realizing how unrealistic some goals may be."
good,"Target is another good company that have a culture of respect and equal opportunity for all races, religion and are very keen on sexual or any kind of harassment. I love Target."
good,"There was always something to be done. I never got bored on the job. I learned many skills, especially with working in customer service. I also learned how to work fast."
good,Super friendly good team. Work day healty and and the hours are good the people are very freindly place t to work if you like working at a fast past this job is good for yu
good,nice environment fast pace good place to work enjoy the time I work there while I was working on planogram nice and easy work nothing too hard for you to figure out
good,"Availability was my main issue  overall it's a great place to work at if you can work at anytime, very friendly place to work at team members are super nice!"
good,"Its a fast paced kind work. Very strict about they’re rules. You will enjoy they’re benefits too. They don’t always provide what you need, so you have to bring your own supplies."
good,I have worked for Target since 2015 and don't plan on leaving any time soon. Great place to work and good pay! Able to cross train on other areas of store and able to work with a flexible schedule.
good,"This job is full of exciting news and projects as soon as you walk in for your shift. The management team here is great and they're more than willing to answer and help with anything at any time, and the same goes for general employees. I do wish the hours were more consistent though instead of sporadically scheduled. That's what makes it hardest for me to plan my daily, weekly, or monthly schedule/life events, etc. I do enjoy seeing regulars here and helping customers as often as I can. I love being able to provide positive and helpful customer service and reassurance."
good,I've been at Target for almost nine years and I still enjoyed working here.I gained a lot of friends here.It helps me to boost my confidence in dealing with other people.
good,"Target is not a bad place to start but for those who went to school and start a career with Target, it is not the best. If you can pick something else then do it."
good,Target gave me a broad range of learning new positions and the tools to get the job done.Their inventory management system and how their stores are set up with everything having its place and the ability to find it should be something and retail store should have.
good,"A day at work isn't bad at all. We have a good amount of breaks, they provided food for the workers, the management is very respectful. The workplace was safe and respectful. Love to work at the target again."
good,"New shift to making target even more of a corporate company (which isn't entirely bad). Depending how hard you work, you'll reap the rewards with given priority for hours and overall praise from the company."
good,I learned a lot from Target and it has helped me grow in experience with multi-tasking and customer service. I learned to get more interactive with other workers along with customers.
good,Target was a great company that cared very much for the wellness of its employees. It was a very professional job that was a great entry level employment opportunity.
good,The setting is very friendly and the hours are flexable. The work paste is resonable and suitable for me. I enjoyed doing the work especially guest service because I enjoyed working with other and solving any problems the customers might of had.
good,It was ok I might go back over the summer. Sometimes guest are rude yet you always have to smile and do your best to please them. The holidays pick up heavy and hours are nice
good,A great work environment with respectful team members. Good managers and helpful co workers. A good learning experience and responsibilities to keep the store at a good pace.
good,A typical day at target consists of constant guest engagement. The comfort of the guests are viewed as top priority to enhance the shopping experience. There are also numerous tasks which are required to be performed within a specific time frame. These aspects combined establish advanced communication skills and enhanced agility in performing tasks.
good,"unpacking boxes, I learned how to stock the food and put them in the correct spots. the managers were nice and I liked them a lot. it was peaceful not too stressful. hardest part was making sure the items were in the right spot. most enjoyable part was making new friends."
good,Nice place to work strong management team caring an they invest time into training you . work is fast paced but once you catch on you will be good to go
good,Everyone that works here is pretty nice for the most part. Work load is never really too much. Solid job rotation. The management seems to change pretty often but other than that its a laid back job.
good,"Overall, this was a very pleasant if a bit challenging work experience. The holidays certainly brought a fast pace with them but the managers and coworkers were all very friendly and willing to help. Their scheduling was a bit odd but other than that I cannot complain."
good,The best I ever work would love to go back if offered a oppunity. A normal day at work hard but laid and worth the time. Target rocks. nothing bad a all.
good,It's a good place to work. Bit stressful but where isn't? As long as you pay attention and ask questions. Never be afraid to ask questions. You arent expected to know everything.
good,People were friendly and they helped a lot but not much training was provided. Much of the stuff they required you to do you basically had to learn on your own or have to repeatedly ask for help. But after a while you get used to it. Most of the time you are alone so if you prefer being by yourself then this is a good job for you.
good,my experience at target was good and I was able to up my skills also there was great training offered. If you needed help there was always an employee or manager willing to help you
good,"For a small store busy on the holidays and potentially stressful, co-workers and managers are understanding and extremely personable. Employees are encouraging to each other and are willing to help if they are able to. "
good,"--> you only get a 10% discount, which can only be applied if you have a target credit/debit card or cash. "
good,"There's not a whole lot to say, really. It was a good job, paid well, the co-workers and management were understanding and nice. It was close enough to home to make commutes easy, and paid well enough to support me."
good,It could be better. I just wished they would pay me more because I know how to do varies departments. The people I work with are nice and understandable.
good,Target is a nice place to work but you always have to come prepared to work. Most of all the team there is amazing to be around in and out the workplace.
good,I say it was relaxed because even when a job is busy i tend to stay very calm on the inside. Good energy and they make a concerted attempt to hire people who bring forth good energy.
good,"Fast-paced, move. move. move."
good,"El ambiente es agradable el area de comida y banos es limpio y el espacio de trabajo es armonico, casi ningun ruido."
good,It is a place with a lot of work and people work joyfully
good,"Managed team and problem solved in retail store setting."
good,"I worked during the winter holiday in store support and customer-facing roles. Thrived within busy, high-volume environment requiring the ability to prioritize and provide exceptional customer service. I demonstrated fast learning capacity, flexibility and versatile skill-set. Worked on the sale floor (Women’s Wear/Domestics), in the customer service desk and as a front-end cashier."
good,"Target was a nice place to work.  The people were very nice and the customers were pleasant. "
good,Working at target was a good experience for me. It teaches you how to deal with customers and I learned how to use a cash register. The hardest part of the job is you are not allowed to sit down and must stand up for long periods of time.
good,"Working at Target for my first job was great. High pay for my position, caring managers and a good experience. Expectations and rules vary between each manager, some with big differences. For instance, no drinks of any type. They were all very helpful and patient however, even after mistakes. Left on a positive note and would work there again."
good,Great place to work mangers some are great some are ok the only problem is the Corp higher ups they come in the make change there all not on the same page
good,i loved working for target i learned so much and had to be quick and correct it tough me that i was able to mutuality task i loved keeping busy there was never a slow movement are not at lest for me i would go over and beyond my duties and i didn't mind.
good,A typical day was really fun. Everyone was really happy and we all helped each other with our jobs. There was hardly any conflict. The guests were also very nice.
good,"I was always satisfied with instruction and assistance from the management team on both the sales floor and the backroom of the store. Was never given unsubstantial tools to succeed and I enjoyed the fast paced, but also very comfortable working environment. Never had any issues with any task, fellow employee, or supervisor."
good,"Always more to do, never enough time to do it all."
good,I was a beauty team member for less than a year but I meet some life long friends and made tons of memories. Target really truly made me grow as a person in all aspects. I got retail and sales experience at the same time. I did anything and everything over the 9 months that I was there and loved almost every minute of it. Most guests were nice the only problems I had with guests was when I would be backup on register. Some co-workers and higher ups were very understanding about being sick and needing time off. But other than that it was an amazing experience and wish I could go back.
good,Target is a good place to work. It was sometimes hard to complete the assignment because lack of hours.There was a lack of communication between upper management and store employees
good,"I worked at a couple of Targets. One had a higher volume than the other meaning it was busier, but generally both ran the same just at different tempos. Flexible schedule if notified ahead of time."
good,I really enjoyed working there. It was my first job. I learned how to deal with the register and all that good stuff. And standing there talking to people all day helped with my social skills lol
good,"Environment is good and co workers are great.  Worked there for 10 years Management is ok, regulations change often Must be flexible with schedule...."
good,"Stocking overnight and unloading the trucks taking the products to the right location, stocking the shelves picking up the boxes and the trash, sweeping the floor"
good,"With this being my first ever job being in high school, it helped me with what I needed back then. I'm unsure if it will be something to build a life off of as an adult."
good,Easy place to work. They paid well and had opportunity for raises. Not stressful unless working the holidays. You are by yourself for the most part doing small projects and keeping the space tidy.
good,The supervisors were great at managing the cashier era. There was only one person who lack respect which was calrica but peter and dee dee were very comforting and respectful in the work place.
good,Loved working with Target was onsite with them for over a couple of years until contract was terminated. Target believed they made the right decision to terminate contract to save money instead of top talent
good,"Worked at Target while I was a full-time student in college. They were great, super flexible.  Could easily pick-up hours when needed.  Managers were great and very supportive."
good,"I think it really depends on what target your at that will ultimately define your experience. Thankfully the managers at my target were very chill in how they approached things compared to other targets near me. However, all targets have a constant push for red cards and having to do this makes the job feel like a drag."
good,Target is doing great with its minimum pay increase and in 2020 it will be st $15 an hour.  Target promotes from within and strives to better their teammates.  I love the customer interaction driven sales floor.  Target matches my 401k benefits up to 5% and is flexible with schedule.
good,It was a great gig while it lasted but they hire so many seasonal people it's hard to get a definite position at the end of it all. Training was easy and work could sometimes be fun. Discounts at the Starbucks were nice. All in all a great experience
good,Fun coworkers and good job.  No unexpected issues with a retail job.  Management pushes for to much at times but that's the nature of retail.  No issues with anything else.
good,Great company to work for if you are a college student. Flexible for your school schedule and are able to accommodate and work with your schedule.Great place to work
good,"I worked as a cart attendant, I got free food occasionally, and the pay was above minimum wage. The employers, and employees were all great people...."
good,Good job nice having the weekends off.  The work amount is unrealistic at times can make things stressful.  The pay is pretty good and they treat you pretty good just require you too work hard.
good,Working here was fun! The pace was so quick time always seemed to fly by. The managers had everything organized. The rules were always followed and there was always room for advancement
good,"Good store, good people good pricing, lots of advancement, made new friends, equal rights and equal positions, everyone helpful. Recognizes your performance equally."
good,Pretty decent job as long as you work and learn managers. The job is always evolving and blowing out competition. They also hand out a lot of seasonal job opportunities.
good,"A typical day at work had me in various places in the store as needed.  Often times I'd be in electronics, due to being highly knowledgeable in them.  As needed I would cover other areas of the store as well as run a cash register.  Often I would work a closing shift, which would entail cleaning/straightening up the store before punching out."
good,I have had the chance to grow my leadership and interpersonal skills through this position. It has given me more confidence in public speaking and a deeper knowledge of social interactions.
good,"Customers are pleasant and upbeat, most spend time to shop for a variety of products and expect quality customer service. I have learned to give 100 percent of quality service with the skills I have obtained over the years working with the public. Management is a great resource when it comes to reinforcing your skills and commitment to the company. The hardest part of the job may be standing on your feet for long periods of time, this is why employees are required to take their breaks. The   most enjoyable part of the day is all day, because we are requested to cover various areas to keep the diversity so that you never get board."
good,Target was fast paced and you kept busy when the store was crowded.it was ok as a secondary job. I enjoyed it .I would recommend it . They catered a lot to college students in helping with work during breaks from school
good,My first two years here were wonderful I got all the hours that I needed and my pay was reasonable currently I am getting less than 10 hours a week and need to find other employment for personal reasons I would recommend this job as a part-time job or a supplementary income not as a primary form of income
good,"enjoyed it kept me busy, very friendly staff members who were kind and generous, customers were easy going and gentle. manager was a lovely lady who was helpful and understanding"
good,"Great place to work, great people to work with. Flexible work hours and good pay. Teamwork based work experience. Very understanding about sick and personal time off."
good,Working at Target was a great experience! I've learned many ways as to how I can improve in my job role. The management was ver polite and always provided me with help when needed. The people that worked in Target all accepted everyone for who they were. The most difficult part of the job in my opinion would be scanning and bagging peoples items and standing all day. What I found most enjoyable was being able to get a raise when promoting a Target red card.
good,"I build (assemble) bikes. If help is needed it is given, example: I need a bicycle that is in the steel, I tell s manager what I need and someone gets it down. I can operate most of the equipment, forrklifts, waves etc. But they are limited. It's easier to let someone who already has a key do that job"
good,Target has been a great place to work. I have grown as a leader and person . Target has plenty of room to grow and learn new things everyday . The company is very wide spread and fastly growing every year focusing on customer service .
good,"I work for target before it sold to CVS. Target Pharmacy was a great place to work, just sad it sold the pharmacy place and didnt give us notice. But great place"
good,Target was a good place to work. Many job advancements. I worked from high school until I finished college. Target help pay for my college. I left Target to use my degree I earned in college and get a normal M-F work schedule. Target was a great place to work until I got married and needed to be home in the evenings.
good,"Plenty of benefits and decent pay. Management was pretty good, but the store could be short staffed at times. The overall culture was caring. Schedule changes tended to be a hassle at times, but often was resolved."
good,"My Overall experience with Target was a great one. I started off as a flow team member, then to signing specialist, sales floor team lead and finally presentation team lead. My store had a hiccup in upper leadership and tried pointing the blame on lower management which lead to my unfortunate departure from the company."
good,"Great company, management is great in certain locations, not so great in others, pay is decent, alright discount on everything (10%), there are plenty of opportunities to move up if you work hard enough"
good,The people at Target were friendly and always willing to help. They worked with my schedule if I ever needed time off. Very understanding and compassionate
good,"Working at target was a good job. It was very consistent and busy on weekend days, but working as a cashier it helped time go by. I learned how to be a cashier at Target, learned how to handle and count money, how to sell products to people (the RedCard), and communication with employees. Hardest part of the job was getting customers to get a RedCard when most people who want one, already have it, or people are completely against them but we still have to ask."
good,"I liked working at Target. It's a big group of people, and there are many departments to work for depending on what you want. Flexible hours. Good experience overall."
good,This target store has a wonderful staff that treats all employees like family. The customers can get pretty rude at times but other than that its a wonderful place to work
good,If you going to work there you better get to know the people who work there fast. They talk about people to much and down play racism within the group.
good,We brought merchandise to department areas for customers and helpfulness was provided for customers. The emphasis is to have customers knowledgeable about availability and prices of merchandise and sales floor locations with the helpfulness of employees.
good,"Staff are helpful, management is just okay. They are very unorganized at times. They, the Management,  have their favorites so unless you are liked not much work is give to you. You may get called off your shift."
good,"Work in a fast pace no matter witch department you are working in, Sofelines are also floaters, they work in different department to help out if any extra help is needed. Softlines are also needed at the front line with the registers. Make sure to keep the fitting rooms clean check for any stolen items. Restock and stocking merchandise if needed. Help with set ups and always remember to do your best."
good,start of the day unloading the truck with other co-works and pushing the items and i learn to work with others and be a better team member and management is alright and the most enjoyable part is helping the customer
good,"Target was a great seasonal job. Very busy but the team members and management made it feel like you were part of the family. A lot of students work here part-time and it's a great job for them. If you do well doing the seasonal probabtion, chances are you will be hired after the season ends."
good,Productive and great customers it was fun and reliable.  Great services and good teamwork. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out where things go. The most enjoyable was interacting with the customers and getting to meet new people.
good,"a typical day at work consists of me putting things back where they go and zoning the store. i learned that you can make any environment a fin environment, they are very diverse, the hardest part of the job is at night when we have to make sure that the store is clean and reset for the next day"
good,"worked at Target years ago - would go back if the opportunity is right! lots of open positions right now, most at TNC for IT positions.  culture has changed"
good,"Is a very nice place to work and good management. The key to having hours is been good employed and like to learn every day about your area and task."
good,Target is a great place to work. There are many opportunities to advance within your job. There's health plans and all that if you qualify for it. There is a ton of guest interaction. The pay is really good.
good,Target is an ok job management it's always stressed out over corporate stuff scheduled work hours are very inconsistent management expects you to stock fast and under 20 mins or you get the boot if you know what i mean. team leads & mangers pick favorites & treat other team member like trash
good,"Enjoy and love working with my peers. They are the reason I enjoy going into work, pretty much my 2nd family. "
good,"Target was a great place to work at. The employee discount was very nice and the hours are flexible. However, the pay isn't the greatest and it is hard to advance in the company."
good,"I like working at target because we work as a team."
good,At target i stocked overnight. I come in at 11pm help unload the truck. Move the pallets with a pallet jack to the right location and stock the shelves.
good,This is a great job for a college student. My  responsibility was to due all of the online orders at our store. Weather that be those picked up at the store or those that would be shipped to the customers home. I would highly recommend this for any college student.
good,Target has been a positive workplace and environment to be a part of.  The expectations of my position on the sales-floor keeps me active and focused.
good,The company was innovative and regularly implemented programs to keep up with industry standards. Peers made the job enjoyable. Dealing with unrealistic customers was the most difficult part.
good,"Very good benifits. Full health, dental, and vision insurance after 90 days and full time. Also get a 10% employee discount. The job is a very stressful work enviroment."
good,"Safe place to work and get good training. At begining of shift the job duties for each person for that day are posted. If there is an issue receiving something there is always someone to ask. We all work great together as a team. Sometime you could be moved to do a different job, per company needs."
good,Target provides an environment that includes inventory control and placement that encourages sales within store and outside store through internet sales.
good,They have good collaboration among team members. Team members focus on helping store guests find what they need. Management has reasonable expectations.
good,I enjoyed working at target. everyone helped each other and no one was treated any differently. I like that they cross train you just in case you are needed somewhere else. They are willing to help you whenever you need it.
good,"Its always busy at Target and always so much to learn,don't like the fact that you have to have a college degree to become a Manager hoped that changed."
good,work in team of four for 10 hours and four days each rotating to be the lead person and or data input and safety inventory check for quality. Unload all products to stores
good,i honestly loved this job but i was already 7 month pregnant and over working cause i was high risk this job was a great experience and i will def do it again
good,"Some managers can be hard to work with and dont know how to give out workloads.You meet alot of nice and friendly co workers and managers but can change very fast with new people coming in and old ones leaving. Work days are stressful near holidays but overall very relax.Benefits are alright could be better.You get 30min lunches and depending on how long you work 15 mins breaks"
good,"Each day, you come in and your team leader leaves an assignment sheet so that you'll know what to do and where you're working. The management in my store is very good. There's always someone to speak to if you have any job-related questions or issues. The entire team that I've worked with is very friendly. I was able to rely on my team members a lot when I was still learning the job."
good,"I like it at Target, my coworkers make enjoyable.  The hours can be tough during the holiday season, but overall, hours are flexible and management will work with you."
good,"I started out as a cashier but quickly moved to work at the guest services desk. Now I can work literally any position in the store except electronics and back room. The job can be incredibly taxing, but coworkers and good customers make things easier. You have the opportunity to make a big impact on your work environment. Discounts do suck though."
good,"It's a retail store just like every other retail store, managers care about those that advance them most. Shift ease depends heavily on which manager you work under that day."
good,"Didn't work there long, but the crew I worked with were wonderful, friendly, helpful people! If I ever had a question or was struggling, someone would be willing to assist me in anything really."
good,"I had great managers, and great employees. Very fast by easy work, great pay. It was hard to move up in the company though. Other than that I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the company"
good,"it was an awesome experience working there, management was awesome and they were all very nice, the team members are fun to be with and it was some of my best time there"
good,"I enjoyed working here because it was a new store to this area.  It was the first ""super Target"" in Wichita.   It was a fast fun and friendly environment."
good,Was a good work enviroment.  Learned good career skills and appliable techniques. target put too much enphasis on degrees towards career advancements over the work ethic of an employee even when the compitance of a college graduate is less than that of a several year employee
good,"Very nice environment for all ages, excellent benefits for full time workers. Flexible schedule for those in school or have other obligations outside of work."
good,Target is a well-organized environment. Co-workers and management are great to be around. Target is a fastpaced business that always keeps you busy. Target is a great place to work.
good,Different stores have different culture the store i was at was a small store so expected ridiculous amounts of work to get done all in 8 hours of the day. Had good benefits but for the amount of work you can go to other places and get better pay and benefits.
good,Overall pay not bad. Chance to work and learn in different departments. Promotion is also an option. Being team members you get discounts within the company.
good,"overnight work required unloading trucks, stocking, and shelving products. Managers were friendly. Each department helped make things easier for each other so staff were great."
good,"There is always work to be done, and new team members are always fitted to what suits them best. Food is almost always in the breakroom to enjoy during breaks!"
good,Target offers a great experience opportunity to retail sales. They can teach you the fundamentals of providing good business to their customers. Learning everything from receiving to being a cashier. Great opportunity to gaining work experience.
good,"Distribute returns to proper departments"
good,It wasn’t bad it was a good 1st job experience. The other team members were nice. As long as u finished your job there weren’t any complaints.       .
good,"A typical day was assisting guests at the checkout lines and customer service desk, sending cashiers on breaks, maintaining a cleanly area at and near the checkouts, and answering phone calls."
good,I did not hate my job at Target. I do not recall loving to walk in to work either. Everyone was happy. I never witnessed any conflict among employees.
good,I enjoyed my time at Target. I spent 3 years working there and would definitely recommend it. Staff is great never really had a problem with management.
good,"I was a sales representative in the beauty department, which i loved! I worked in a department i was passionate about, which made my job more enjoyable."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"I loved working for Target. I've always respected how even upper management within Target stores are also in red and khaki, offering a more inclusive team like culture where everyone works together. I worked at Starbucks where the Team Leads paid less attention to us and allowed us to manage ourselves for the most part. I enjoyed the self-motivating environment this provided us."
good,A typical day at Target was different from day to day. One day could be project focused on one area of the store that needed help and others could be more slow and focus on the cosmetics of the store.
good,The job was fun but the pay was too low to start a family.  I would still be there if the pay was right. I still keep in touch with old team members. Overall it was fun
good,"Working at Target is easy because of the amount of different positions and areas you can apply for in the store. Management is strict when needed, but also is understanding of personal issues and hour flexibility."
good,Very nice place to work. Mission drives the company. Would an day go back and work with target. Leaders are very supportive and always will guide you in what you want to do
good,"A typical day at work started with checking my coworkers what needed to get done and how everything was doing. I would then go to my job to get done and assist guests as I preformed my duties. There was a lot of flexibility at the workplace so if you, for example, were helping a guest for an extended period of time, everyone would make sure that your duties were being filled. The people there were very friendly and always took care of me."
good,but this was a good place to work at I find it a little bit difficult when you hold things and somebody just comes and unfold things but that's what you get in with retailing the good paying job good place to go in shop and nice people
good,"Target was overall a good place to work at, none of my duties were complicated. The employees and managers were kind and easy to work with. Here I learned how to be an efficient cashier."
good,The work is very fast paced. It has a great work life balance. I really enjoy all cross functional partners that I get to work with. The culture is a very teaching & learning culture.
good,"I came in USA in the year 2009, country was new and language too was new. I was good with British English, but not good with American English. "
good,"The culture there was welcoming, and they are likely to be patient with new employees. Easy to get along with people and so long as you can keep with the pace you'll be fine. Most of any difficulty I faced came from the fact that I was working during the holiday season, which is a stressful time for everyone."
good,"I would go into work and casually say hi to my coworkers, managers, and any other employee I pass by. I learned how to appropriately conduct work at a cash register and work around customers at every second. Management was good because they treated you fairly and made sure that you got what breaks you deserved and were more than willing to work with you. The most enjoyable part of the job was I got to interact with people constantly."
good,"Good environment to work in, loved being able to interact with good-spirited people. The work wasn't very hard labor, pretty simple/easy intstructions to follow."
good,I really enjoyed working here and hate that i had to go. Most of the managers were great. The customers hardly gave you any problems when they would come in. There were many opportunities for employees to advance in their career.
good,"Working as a sales associate was perhaps my first real experience in customer relations and driving brand loyalty.  Every customer interaction was unique, and there was always something to be learned."
good,This company was a fun and fast paced workplace. You were constantly meeting new customers and were able to learn more about people then I thought. It was a really great place to work.
good,"Only worked as seasonal worker for the Christmas holidays, and work was sufficient for the temporary time I was there. Great company to work for."
good,"This was my first job after high school. It is a flexible place to work for when you are a student, they will work with your school schedule. Favoritism when choosing who to promote"
good,I think it's a great place to learn team work and being adaptable in every department; be versatile for you job title and become an exceptional worker.
good,"All about meeting their Guest's needs and working to improve standards of retail business, along with keeping a healthy workplace environment. Good growth oppourtunity and excellent business standards to work by."
good,"I enjoyed working the season, however I would have liked to get hired there I really liked the job.The employees were very friendly and helpful in training in the area i was assigned to.The managers showed concern and appreciation towards a new employee, they asked the new employee if there was anything I needed as far as more training or anything to make my job easier to let them know ."
good,"Cashier,Customer services, sales floor also working in Charge Back helping with defect items and shipping products back to vendors. Helping customers find items be able to rings customers thought check out in a timely matters"
good,"Overall, for this position at least, its for the most part laid back. Find guest orders and then pack it, only becomes hard when reaching the time goal for the day. May become overwhelming too if not enough people in order to reach the goal, but this rarely happens. Everyone works as a team and then just relax afterwards."
good,"I loved working there everyone was very easy to work with, working the cash regestier was the best but we also did alot of restocking and unloading. Overal i feel my experience there was well worth it."
good,"Great company to work for, wonderful people around, great culture. In terms of scheduling and handling the floor, management is terrible. They will be short-staffed but then need to keep pulling employees from other departments, onto the front of store floor. Inconsistent scheduling."
good,Started in August before the holidays and had okay hours in the beginning. The most hours I got was during Black Friday and then it plummeted from there. The management plays favorites with your hours.
good,"This was my first job. The job was boring but easy. The customer is always right should be this places motto. I once was written up because a customer told me that im ugly and i responded with i really dont appreciate that sir im just trying to check out your groceries and do my job. Also when i quit i told my manager i was putting in my two weeks and he said he'd take care of it. I was still on the schedule and came to them confused. They told me i had to put in my two weeks and work an extra two weeks again. This wasnt possible with my new work schedule so i told them i couldn't do that and they fired me. Management here has poor communication and they never stand behind their employees when a customer is being flat out rude. I had paid time off, great pay, and insurance. Great benefits but very poot management."
good,The job is great. It is a wonderful enviroment to work in. The people are nice but the hours aren’t the best. You have to fight just to make ends meet because they have to cut so many hours
good,"Inbound Overnight."
good,Very good job for a first job. Hours per week weren't great especially for us who have bills to pay. Other then that Target is a good place to work at for a first job.
good,"Being a captive company of a big US retail giant, work culture and work life balance are very good. and a big list of latest technologies and tools which gives good scope for long term working"
good,"Awesome people, but I have only had four hours of work total in four weeks. Everyone is very nice and understanding. Sadly the lack of hours lead me to need another job."
good,"Enjoyable place to work friendly team members"
good,Not that flexible w shifts and such its not bad work tho pretty easy to do. Its run pretty efficiently shifts arent that long they are manageable to work.
good,"Every employee welcomes you with kindness, and helps you learn more strategies. A typical day at work for me was ringing people out and satisfying their needs. The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on your face when you get the grumpy people in your line. Although you get to brighten your day with the joys of your coworkers"
good,"they are very trendy and that allows job stability with hours and pay. They do lots of luncheons and ""thank you"" treats to team. Pay is great for entry level compared to other retailers"
good,I loved working in Cosmetics! They allowed me to talk to customers about which products would look good on them.  Great hours and I loved working with the employees I worked with.
good,good place to work good training great place to learn about management. they training very good. you training in all the dept. they have a step by step training
good,My co workers were fun to work with . I especially loved working around the holidays because the spirit is always lightened by everyone. fast paced which i enjoyed very much .
good,I have worked at target for 1 year and 2 months. I was hired as a seasonal employee and after 6 months I was hired on as a part-time hardlines employee. I quickly became the hardlines trainer and shortly after I was given the opportunity to move to starbucks inside of the target. With that being said my experience has been very good however I can not see myself making this a career.
good,Its a great place to work and move up if you want to . I like that you can transfer jobs if need be . They help you in learning areas to get your hours .
good,I enjoyed my time greatly at Target even becoming employee of the month my second month there unfortunately due to corporate changing hours it no longer worked for me and my children. I love working at Target and would go back in a heartbeat if the hours where to change back.
good,"Target(the one I worked for at least) provides a really healthy work structure, where they do their very best to treat every member of the team as a real person. Personal requests and home life are treated seriously and management goes out of their way to be personable and positive."
good,It was a fast paced work environment built heavily on customer service. I learned how to work well with a team and to communicate efficiently with management.
good,Target provides a great environment to work in. Personally I've enjoyed the team work based attitude that is always encouraged. Moving up is great and Target provides many opportunities to train for other job roles. The pay can be better.
good,"On a typical day at work there were allocated tasks for me to complete within a certain amount of time. I was able to go above and beyond to complete my tasks in the most efficient way possible.The skills Iv'e learned while working at Target include: ""Critical time management"", ""Team coordination"", and ""Positive Social sills"".The work place culture was high energy and task oriented. I honestly found no part of my job hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the positive reactions from guests and customers I helped achieve their shopping goals."
good,"fun  to work, friendly  shaft,  great  hours,  free  lunches  in  break  room,  easy  hours,  can  be  trained  in  any department,  great management,"
good,"Target has a professional environment without taking away the friendly atmosphere. Most people would love to work for this company. It was hard to get a lot of hours, but the pay was really good."
good,"learn customer service skills, flexible hours, great staff to work with. overall great learning experience to start out and grow from. Always busy which made shifts go by fast."
good,"Decent place to work if you want some cash in your pocket especially as a college student, going on and off seasonal work. Pay was good for the time being as well."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Target.  With its great leaders, they molded me into the great employee I am today.  Lots of opportunities and resources to be successful"
good,"Honestly, in general, a great place to work at."
good,"Hi there,"
good,"My job consisted of cashier/ customer service. Very easy medium paced days. Not much lifting or stocking. Mostly facing and cashiering. Not much room for extra hours or advancement. Most of the managers and employees are nice to work with. Customers are not always respectful to employees, they expect too much and leave the place a mess thanks to Starbucks in the store. over all a good job"
good,"I was a stock person in the back warehouse.I filled orders for products going out to the sales floor,as well as stocking products that came in on the trucks."
good,Anyone who is looking to build up their communication skills should be led to Target. They provide positions that engage customers and employees in situations where good communication can lead to happy customers
good,"I had fun working at Target. Lots of joking around with co-workers, but we still got our work done. Approachable management. A team-centered environment. It started to make me sick looking at and wearing so much red, though."
good,"I loved working for Target.  I had an issue with the Store Manager of the Lake Charles, LA store, but other then that, it was an amazing place to work."
good,This was a long time ago.  I worked in the warehouse on the night shift so very rarely did I interact with guests.  Management was good and hands off.  They allowed the jobs to be completed
good,I restocked the products for the cosmetics side of the store. I helped a lot of guest finding products and what works for them. I would put my guest for any task I was working.
good,It was fun you got to meet new people and make friends. Wish I could’ve stayed longer. But I was hired for holiday hoping to still work there but I got let go. 😞
good,Good place to work. Good Management.  Good team environment to work with.  Overall a good experience and great team mates who always are willing to assist.
good,"When you walk in the door for the first day if you are friendly the co workers will be friendly too, its a good environment for a first job but would not recommended it for a full time job where you need to pay bills and rent."
good,"clock in to work and then ask the current manager of cashiering what register they want you on for the day. sometimes they will have your shift be covering everyone's lunches. I learned customer service and communication.Working at Target as a cashier isn't hard at all. The only thing I would complain about is the inconsistency in scheduling. For example; I would ask for day of months in advance and I would still get scheduled on those days and then when I would let them know of the problem they fixed it but they blamed it on me. For the most part the job was an okay job. I would say the best part about working at Target was being close to where I lived, the shifts were tolerable in length, and the pay was enough to keep me going."
good,"The Management there is clear in what they expect from me, and I get immediate feedback on job performance.  They have given me opportunities to learn other duties as well as perform product demonstrations for customers."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Target. The management was always there to help out the cashiers, as were my fellow cashiers. I'm going to miss the people that I worked with there. Sadly it was a seasonal position, and they were only allowed to keep 5 seasonal cashiers this year."
good,"read email to see if leadership left you any plans"
good,"I only worked there for the season, it was a pretty good for someone that is going to school. Getting paid bi weekly is not what i perfer but its money."
good,"Target Security is fun and a good job to have fun, but the management to is changing. Turning the whole AP world to a different world then when was actually taught in training."
good,The pay is really great for what I was paid (12.50p/h) and everyone is really friendly. They had fun food days for the staff. You can always ask questions if you don’t understand something
good,"It was a great job far as retail, and I always enjoyed the discount and sale they always had! Manger was cool and so was the worksers, the precuts they sale was great also"
good,"Fun place to work. Great supervisors, cool co-workers and I really enjoyed working on the floor pushing out the different merchandise and taking lunch with everyone. Overall relaxed environment."
good,I really enjoyed my target job for the time I was there. I had many opportunities to learn each position throughout the store and was able to work my way up in a sense.
good,"At target I'm normally caught running back and forth from the front room to guest services getting and pick up from the back but everything there was fun and enjoyable enough to want to deal with it. As I would run back and forth I would be stopped by a customer asking about a certain product or where a certain location was. Most the time I'd be able to help them. Other times I'd have to send them to someone who works in that department. The hardest part was when I need to stock 5 flats in 4 hours and it took up the whole time and I still didn't get the last one done. It definitely is a lot of work but it doesn't all fall back on you. They admire and appreciate your effort. That was probably the most enjoyable part, seeing someone enjoy the hard work I put in to my job."
good,"great environment to learn"
good,"Pros"
good,its was a very good place to work. I had fun. it was cool wish I could go back there but I had to move on to better things in my life. Target is a good company to work for.
good,productive and a nice play to work. Good benefits and reputable place to start your career. Understanding management when emergenices occur and very helpful wihen trying to move up the corporate ladder.
good,"It was hard work, but you go in expecting hard work. The pay was enough to pay bills and rent if you're a single person. The company gave good benefits as well."
good,"Good place to work if looking for part time jobs. Full time job they do give every worker benefits from working there. From health cover, dentist and eye"
good,"Nonstop work, however can be done on time. Team leaders very nice and cheery. Managers under a lot of stress so sometimes they may seem rude, but they are just trying to push you to do your best. Cart attendant a physical workout, but is fulling and always has something to do."
good,"It was a fun place to work at. I was always happy going into the store and clocking in . It was always a good vibe working at Target. Nothing ever seemed stressful or hard. "
good,"Fun place to work, always making new goals and group meetings to keep employees motivated. Great teamwork, very easy to work with when it comes to scheduling."
good,Fast paced workplace with knowledgeable staff and management. Easily attainable task/assignments. Ability to seek help if needed without reprimand or consequence.
good,Interacting and helping customers was always a part of the everyday job but it was very fun to do so my workplace was clean and i learned to handle a crowd in a very short amount of time.
good,"Start with a brief discussion with my manager about the work I was expected to do for the day. Sometimes this would consist of the manager telling me what register I was working at and nothing more. Other times I would learn about another department that I was going to help for part of the day, or a project at the front that I was going to be in charge of. The days that I spent in other departments were usually right after large shipments, where my manager would need help getting as much merchandise to the sales floor as possible. The projects at the front were typically displays that I would be organizing or new promotional items that I would be putting up in place of old ones."
good,A day at target can vary from being very busy to calm and empty depending on the day. Target is the go to store for a lot of people so you always have to have good customer service.
good,"I only worked here as a seasonal employee. However, it was a nice job with decent starting pay. I worked the Black Friday weekend, and it was not too bad at all."
good,Great pay.  Lots of hours during season. Love working with customers and showing them around. Recommending store items to but to they’re interest. Over all fun job
good,"Working here was a not too bad of a start for me. The team was fun to work with, and they're all great people, however directly dealing with irritated guests is definitely the downside."
good,"Get what you expect, Great culture and the managers treat the employees fairly and should be looked at as a great place to work for anyone who is looking for work and willing to deal with the hassles or retail"
good,It's like working at any other retail pharmacy but management was awesome~only downfall was I worked around the time they were converting to CVS Pharmacy and I previously worked at CVS and did not have a good experience with the expectations
good,"A typical day could be receiving new inventory. Resetting planograms, assisting managers where ever needed. Depending on the schedule I would be the manager over the soft lines department in addition to making sure my own department was presentable.  Other employees had an attitude of a team player and were eager to assist when needed.  The hardest part for me could be the  physical demands.  The most enjoyable was the interaction with customers."
good,This was a typical cashier position.  Target gets very busy and is customer service driven.  If you enjoy that kind of environment it is a good entry level job.
good,It's a good job to start out at while in college or just out of high school. They work well with hours and the team was very nice. It was a place where I could get to know other associates and actual call them friends.
good,Fun fast paced easy to do. Everyone was easy to get along with. You can sometimes work overtime. Managers are very easy to talk to. Great work place environment.
good,"Fast paced, friendly environment. Lots of truck and stocking time. Very high expectations. Recognition is given when earned. Overall a good experience and I learned a lot working here."
good,"It was a aright workplace, unloading freight , customer service, audit the work zone, clean it from stray items, nice people with good attitudes, bosses were pretty nice."
good,When walking into target you had to be ready for all types of personalities. At times handling situations you are the only one in the boat and you have to make the best decisions Target way. Even though working at Target it taught you a ton of customer service it also taught you had to hold your head high.
good,"I actually slightly enjoyed working for Target as a first job. Gave me a good introduction into working retail and customer experience, and I got a lot of training as a result."
good,"I would start out straightening clothes, then we would get called up to the registers to help check out customers, and then we would have to clean up some sort of mess."
good,As a guest service associate i would assign cashiers to their location for the day. I would also help solve guest issues and help make situations less stressful.
good,"It has been so long. Good staff fun place. Did normal retail stuff. Stocked shelves, cashier, among other things. Peddling credit cards was a little tedious."
good,"It's always a busy day at work. Helping customers find their items, chatting, and  going about the business."
good,"It's an okay job for a seasonal position. I liked helping the people more than anything. I worked the sales floor and did cashiering so, interaction with people is something you have to enjoy in order to work at a job like this."
good,"Target is a god place to work, the environment is nice. The management is friendly,  your coworkers are also friendly.  The benefit are fine and so is the pay."
good,"a good place to work, I got lots of stuff experience"
good,"Its a good job for people who don't have a family life. Long hours, lots of overtime in the holiday months, High pay rate. It certainly lived up to my expectations. I  really like the store and the environment."
good,"Decent company to work for. Management at the location I worked for were all very decent managers. The only issues I had was that the management allowed seasoned team members get away with being lazy and not adjusting to the new ways of the business, very frustrating!. I would not recommend the GSA position unless they make some major changes to the position including the pay this position only pays 50 cents more than a cashier and the same pay as an electronics team member! With that being said you have to do way more work than anyone else including cleaning bathrooms, carts, etc. The store manager told me that this is the hardest position in the store. Overall Target is a great company if you can work at a location that has good management then its a good idea. I would not recommend the GSA position."
good,"The pay is competitive, so if wal-mart raises their wage so will Target. I got a raise every year ($1). I got paid a good amount for the work I did, the job was super laid back however it was stressful sometimes (like all jobs are). Guests aren't that bad, problems were easily solved. You get a 10% discount off everything. Super flexible schedule and call-ins were understandable. Minors (under 18/in high school) leave by 10 pm everyday, everybody else left late (midnight or so). Nice, relaxing place to work at and low stress compared to most lower-level jobs. Sometimes management gets annoying, and also lots of drama because there's a bunch of young people working in one place, so mind your business."
good,"As a basic team member, my job wasn't what you might consider the end goal of one's working career. But it was still a wonderful experience where I felt motivated to work. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for simple, part-time work."
good,Working there was great but I had difficulty and I had not let the staff know I had special needs when I should have. Hours were far too long for me and it was stressful and tiring
good,Typical day began with morning team meeting with complete staff. Strong management structure. Lots of breaks.  Never asked to work longer than scheduled shift.
good,"Good place to work at. Although the supervisors were always aware of our actions, they weren’t as strict as I thought they would be. I would reccomend a friend to work at target."
good,"It was quick-paced, focused, and organized. I learned how to operate a cash register and talk to customers. Management was cool; they were all fairly nice."
good,Great second job.  Will be able to work with various schedules.  The coworkers were helpful and management was easy to get along with.  Hardest part of the job was just making sure to stay within the allotted time requirements for stocking.
good,"Ambiente de trabalho agradável, onde tive oportunidade de oferecer meus serviços e aprender a cada dia com experiências diárias."
good,There is always something to be done at target so I never find myself bored or looking at the clock to leave. I really enjoy that part of working at target. Working in the clothing department at target has also made me more creative. I've had to come up with outfits for manikins as well as rearranging shelves so it is more appealing to our guests.
good,"Having great team leads is a plus. Hours can be hit or miss depending on the season, with holidays having GREAT hours (most often at a full 8 hours a day), though right after Q4, hours drop drastically."
good,"Not only was the experience seamless and painless, but, for my troubles without me even asking the my manager and co workers provided me with every thing i needed to get started i learned a lot great place to work"
good,"target is a great place to work and very fair, the staff around are awesome. the job is very easy and stressful sometimes but it could also be fun and fast. the pay roll is good"
good,The job was fun and fast paced so it kept the day interesting but definitely made you work out. I loved working their I wouldn't have left if it wasn't so far from my house.
good,"A typical work day at Target is basically the same set up as Wal-Mart except the trucks are a lot  more smaller than Wal-Mart's and when we unload the trucks, we basically get together as a team and we wave the whole store together as a group. The management at Target was very friendly and understanding."
good,"Great job, really liked how they would work with my schedule. Pay was okay and team members are all really friendly. Always being productive and helping out guests."
good,Target is a great company to work for. They are very fast paced and the management is great. They really try to understand you and do whats best for you.
good,"fast paced works days, team member appriciation week once a month, competitions within teams with prizes, always motivating team members to do their best"
good,Made alot of lasting friendships when I worked at target. When I first started they really looked out for there employees. And after about 4 years that stopped and we just became # to them.
good,Over all it’s a good job if you are good with people and can help them find what they need and give them information about different products that they might not know about
good,I liked being able to conversate with the customers when ringing up there items. I also enjoyed being in an environment where the co-workers were supportive and willing to help me
good,Target was a fast paced work environment but had a good team work environment. Coworkers and managers are helpful and check on you when you are new to the workplace.
good,"Target is a very relaxed and fun place to work. I really enjoyed the family environment. The staff is great and so are the managers and department heads."
good,It was a fun place to work fast paced I learned how to help guests and sell items I also learned how to interact with management they were very friendly there.
good,Target offers a great variety of position that you can learn. In my expiriance I was given the opportunity to cross train when I was a cashier I was offered to learn the roll of the instock position which consisted of counting the sales floor merchandise and creating batches of merchandise that needed to be restocked. I was then given the  opportunity to learn the Loss prevention position all in the span of 1 year.
good,"Target Was A Great Job While I Worked There . Managment Was Ok , could've Been Better I Don't Think I Had An Equal Opportunity But Its Fine. Overall I Would Recommend This Workplace To All Who Apply."
good,"In many ways it's a far more organized Kohl's from a Logistical perspective. Nice folks, but slim hours. It's much like any other retail store but with a section devoted to selling kitschy furniture to aging millennial couples. It's the place to shop when you want the illusion of being better than the proles that shop at Walmart."
good,Working at Target showed me more each day that I would love working to help people. It also showed me how to work thoroughly but quickly during the busy seasons.
good,A great place to work if you are in need of a decent paying job and willing to work long hours. One of the benefits is you are able to work at the most sixty hours in a single work week.
good,I started working at target when i was 16 and in four years my pay went up four dollars. It is good pay for the work load and you wont find any other retailer that will pay that well and be that flexable
good,It was a lot of things to get done at one time. It was always kinda hard to keep up with the flow of things. It wasn’t nothing I couldn’t handle though. I like the job overall.
good,"We are the one who handle orders that need to review if valid or not."
good,The culture in the work environment was very inviting. Everyone supported each other. Management was quite approachable for any concerns and assistance.
good,Target is a great place to work. The only down fall is you do great at your job and they won't promote you because you are good and the position your in.
good,"I was one of the first people that would get there in the mornings. Morning crew has to restock shelves, unload the trucks in the morning, and organize any extra proucts in the back of the store."
good,It was a great place to work  everyone was friendly and i loved the electronics section was very easy to handle and make sure was organized and clean.
good,"a typical day at wok would be stock shelves, pulling the truck, keeping hard lines neat and tidy. The work place had a diverse place of working from different religions,race, and a big supporter of the L,B,G,T,Q community."
good,"Target overall was a good place to work at for me, I could do my duties on my time and how I like to do them without anyone complaining. The days went by fast and productive, and I was happy with my pay and hours that I was getting. I enjoyed working with the target team."
good,"I would get  to work check log in sheets. I learned how to check cameras for theft my team lead was awesome. The culture was great working at target, hardest part was deterring theft. The best part was the team."
good,i worked here for a seasonal job and it was very fun. i had a great time working here. this job was a normal paste job. you get to work a awesome crew who will gladly help you out.
good,"Great job work/life balance"
good,"I was accepted into the team very quickly, and people were always happy to help me learn new tasks. HR was very helpful when I had to file a complaint about a fellow employee."
good,Loved working here because of the amazing management and customer service. I had to leave because of relocation but I was very upset to! I would recommend working here 100%!
good,"its alright, I worked here for a number of years and seen a number of managers pass through. The team tends to be friendly but work can get stressful when all the younger people call into work without consequences."
good,Get to meet different new people. While working at retail t you get to learn more about patient. Its not that hard of a job but must wear comfortable shoes.
good,I worked at Target during seasonal hours so it was quite a hectic environment. But a few of the managers there were very helpful and quick to assist you if you ever had any trouble.
good,During my time there I rarely was in contact with a manager. I couldnt really tell you who my direct superior was. I had to start at the bottom which is understandable but felt they only saw negatives when there was gaps in my training.
good,Working at Target was my first job out of high school and it was one of the most professional and well run companies I have worked for. Great benefits and overtime. I was paid fairly and enjoyed working in the logistics department.
good,I was a sales associate and backroom member. I helped customers with there purchases and assisted in anyway I can. respond to online orders. maintain a clean welcoming store
good,Did everything as expected everyone was good and helpful the manager was always good and always told me good job loved the discounts never had problems with target
good,If I had a chance to go back I would the job was good enough to take care of my bills. You have to put in the time for what you want Target opens up that opportunity
good,"Target is a place of business but can be very fun to work at stocking,  greeting customers asking them do they need any help help others with work when catching up on the lack of work"
good,The job was consistent and meticulous with my job role at the time but my team and i worked hard but no one complained because we worked as a team on every if not most assignments.
good,"The team took pride in warming up, attention to safety concerns, and had an excellent storing system.   They took care of their employees and rewarded them for hard work and meeting goals."
good,"Good position to learn customer service experience."
good,"your on your feet all the time. You work in the whole store and not just in one department. I would help out at customer services with returns, answer phone calls, and  cash handling "
good,It is an enjoyable workplace but sometimes doesn't provide enough hours. You have certain sections in the store for example if you work in clothes you could have the infant section. Good teamwork and fast responses.
good,"I work on the logistics team and also stocked the sales   floor and unloaded the truck. But it good place to work and the management was great people, we're all a team player."
good,The Atmosphere was very welcoming. The coworkers are very nice and excepting.  Atmosphere was very welcomeing. The coworkers very nice and accepting.  Overall very good job
good,"I learned how committed Target is to their signing program, and how that affects their customer base. Felt that management listened and valued their employees. Enjoyed the positive workplace culture."
good,Overall its a fun place to work. The management is pretty good. There isn't a whole lot of room for advancement but when there is it takes a very long time. There are politics involved.
good,"overall productive and flexible, friendly environment with lots of kind customers and coworkers, can be stressful during holidays but it goes by fast when you do your job right"
good,This job was a very important stepping stone for me.  I already knew how to stock shelves but at this job I learned how to do warehouse work half the day and stock shelves the other half of the day.
good,"Target has amazing training programs and gives new hires a ton of great experience. The culture speaks to being fast, fun, and friendly but it doesn't always live up to that mantra. Decision making is slow and the company is very cliquish."
good,"A typical day at work is long and always busy. There isn't a second where I wonder what to do next or just do't have a next task to do as the day goes on. I learned a lot of useful things about the retail work life such as; how to fold and put away clothing, pushing out new merchandise, and helping with the visual merchandising as well. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be my coworkers, and the positive environment that is present in the work place."
good,I learned a lot about products as well as services.     Took part in quality control. . Customer service skills.  .  Inventory control and  Receiving.
good,It was a fun place to work at but at the time I had a foot injury that required me to leave. I couldn't work because of the injury. Most of the workers are friendly
good,Target has a nice environment to work in. Everyone is helpful in assisting you acclimate to your new duties.  Pay could be better. Good life work balance.
good,"A typical day at work would be expecting to come in to a full workload, and to be on your feet the entire day. You learn to adapt to that workload and it become second nature. The managers can be bearable as long as you do the work."
good,"Everyone is always happy and willing to be a team player. Decent pay, but their not discriminant about having tattoos or colored hair. Relaxed and fun."
good,"The work can be demanding at times, but you’ll always be busy and on your feet. The pay is pretty good, especially if you’re a college student, it’s a good way to make money. They’re also flexible with your school schedule and are accommodating with hours."
good,"It's a job. It's not awful, but I don't want to spend my life there. I made good money and friends and learned a lot about sales and how the company works. However, it's stressful work."
good,"I liked it, but the pay and benefits were not compatible with my living expenses, and the opportunities for advancement were not very good. Plus, getting paid every 2 weeks for part time work was not working out."
good,"The working environment is a place to work. Management was very nice and caring to work with.  A typical day as an electronic specialist, one would prepare with inventory count, help customers, have all the demo's running."
good,It is a great working experience. A friendly and family working environment to keep clean at all times. The workers are friendly to each other and the bosses will accommodate you with anything you need if need.
good,"definitely customer service oriented, always helping a guest. Cleaning regularly and stocking regularly. Working with the staff was the funnest part of the job we were always team oriented, helped each other regularly"
good,"Working at target is pretty stressless. I currently work at super target by the mall of millennia in Orlando. I work in the Deli & its nice, but I just don't feel like its the right place for me anymore (after a year of working there)."
good,I enjoyed working at target. I was promoted fairly quickly and through Target I've been able to acquire alot of management experience from my managers and peers.
good,"A great atmosphere, reasonable work load, great supervisors and great working for the customers who really appreciate the Target atmosphere verses the other big box store that is competition."
good,target is a great company to work for with great perks and  benfits. I been withe company over  ten years and enjoyed working with everyone at 1158 and 1006.
good,"I worked for Target twice, and had a great experience both times. They're a strongly ethical company who cares about their employees, and they pay well. My only regret is their limits for advancement, you simply can't move up past Team Lead without college."
good,Was a quick  paced environment. I learned how to provide quality customer service. The managers were very accommodating and so were my co-workers. Was a great place to work.
good,"Target is an awesome company to work for if you have a strong work ethic.  Typical day is 10 hours minimum moving fast, but with varied tasks so time always flies by.  The management is amazing at all levels.  And the culture is very fun.  The most enjoyable part of the job are my peers and whole team."
good,really nive place to work. i was at the parma store and i loved my first job! it was a great experience and i would always be willing to go back to work there.
good,"Enjoyed working with a lot of friendly co workers. It did required great customer service but it was worth it. Management was really good, they made you feel appreciated"
good,I like the fact that I can make a decent paycheck and i'm able to take care of my family. I enjoy the atmosphere and the work environment as well at times.
good,Spent hours assisting customer with billing issues. Great place for advancement. Learned a lot of skills working for Target. If you need more skills they have learning available.
good,"It's a good enough job but the sleep is hard. The shifts might start anywhere from 1am to 4am. And the hours you work a day, generally aren't more than 6 hours, so you have to work almost the whole week to get good hours. You can pick up other shifts or just call in to work when you don't."
good,Target is an easy entry level job for people who know they can work under pressure and in a fast paced environment. It all depends on the position and department you work in but its most the same throughout the store. Everything is constantly changing.
good,Everyone team member was nice and willing to help you figure out what to do. The work environment could be fact paced but you had a great learning experience. Customer service was top priority. The team members were pretty diverse.
good,"Great managers, Fun work environment, Team building exercises at least once a week, helped people find what they were looking for as well as put stuff back where it belongs"
good,Tense at times to meet a dead line. Fun activities at times and team members become a family. There are opportunities for one to grow. Accountability is high.
good,"Target is an overall great place to work"
good,"Overall great company, great happy guest, team members. Greeting customers with service . Making sure everyone is well treated, and greeted. Approaching others in positive manners."
good,"Target is a fun and exciting place to work."
good,Fast paced workplace. Career advancement if recognized. Helpful Management and associates. Friendly customers. Lots of learning options and advancement.
good,"It was a good first job experience. It lacked the opportunities I am now looking for to move forward and after a year, it feels as if the potential to grow is limited. I would like work that feels more tailored to my future."
good,"It was a fast paced environment to work in, enjoyable but also stressful at times. Overall was a fun and enjoyable place to work. I would recommend working there"
good,I am very happy with the time I spent in the Target family . All the associates including management are always willing to help not only the customer but the associates as well.
good,learned teamwork product codes and learned to have fun doin my job management was very involed cared for the employees fun environment to be in graet place over all
good,Target was a great job and i made many friends working there. the managers were nice and would always provide fun things to do while on break during the holidays. the only reason i left was because they cut everyone's hours due to labor.
good,"Culture is very inclusive, team atmosphere is great, they feel like they really care about you, discount is good, lots of people to interact with on a daily basis."
good,"Very welcoming environment.. Almost like a college campus, but for working people.."
good,I learned many ways to help customers in various problems quickly and became an expert guest service team member with the help from my superiors and co-workers.
good,It's a lot of work working as Guest service at Target. You are basically the problem solver of the store. Any customers with any problems get sent to Guest service.
good,"Target has provided me with a lot of personal and some career growth. The culture of the store was always friendly and open. "
good,"If I had garde scale to grade the specific location I would say a B-. Co-workers were great, leaders and managers were great, the pay was worth it. I just wasn't ok with the amount of hours given to me weekly."
good,"At Target I do ship from store or I do hardlines.  Many of the staff members are very friendly and the store is very flexible to your needs.  I enjoyed working at Target, but I am looking for something more now."
good,My  experience  here  taught  team  work  and  efficiency.  Quick  moving  was  a  plus.  You  had  to  work  together  to  keep  the  whole  floor  running.
good,Retail is always going to be stressful.  But think Target and my store managers did a good job of giving us little benefits and treats to help make things comfortable.
good,"Overall I am still happy working with Target. The work place is pleasant because we have a set of nice and friendly team members and executives. I only need another second part time job, that's the reason I posted my resume."
good,Seasonal employee for Cashier/ Cafe position my reponsabilities was to prepare and serve the customers our fresh food. Learned to multitask and work better and quicker in a fast paced environment.
good,Good place to work for hardworking individuals - not too difficult to move up & has competitive pay. Overall a fun place encouraging work place friendships. Really friendly vibe so long as you don't slack off / have attendance issues.
good,"My time at Target was enjoyable it was hard fast paced work but I had a strong friendly team to back me up. While uncommon my scheduling manager while a good hardworking manager was somewhat absent-minded and would occasionally miss-schedule employees. while not a constant problem it would occasionally arise, other than that I would highly recommend Target for employment"
good,"it was a cool place to work"
good,It was never a dull day at target your're always on the go helping customers left and right. The managers there were very competitive to see who would get the most customers to sign up for red cards that to them is one of the most important things. I think for me the hardest part of working here was the holiday hours it was hard to enjoy thanksgiving when you had to be at work @ 6pm the same day for black Friday. I think what I enjoyed the most was the volunteer work target would set up.
good,"Nice people and fast paced. Friendly co-workers and balanced scheduling. Currently,  challenging location due to recent relocation from Norfolk to Hampton, VA."
good,I love my job at target. I don't really want to leave but I will probably have to cause I can't afford to live on my own with the hours and hourly pay rate. But the coworkers are fantastic and I have never loved my management so much. The only downfall is that it isn't very easy to move up in the company. But I learned a lot and I never feel dumb or weird about asking for help or asking a question. Definitely a great job for anybody that needs a partime job and wants to make great friends with their coworkers and higher ups.
good,I liked the atmosphere there everybody was treating everybody with respect. The hardest part of the job was finding where the items went by the code number.
good,Ive been at target for going on 8 years and its a job that i enjoy. Each day is different but always keeps you on your toes. It is fast paced so you are always thinking of ways to get more things done in a certain time frame.
good,I have worked for Target for over three years at three different stores. Each Target has small changed on daily operations but you will know what is expected of you at each location. They offer ways to grow and get trained in multiple departments at Target. The work environment if friendly but fast-paced.
good,Fast fun and friendly management is great  the only downfall is the credit card program you have to not only ask but it is required to get so many apps a day/week at less it was when I was there not sure now but still a good company to work for
good,"Productive, Great environment to work, great benefits, customer service,  Target taught me a lot of things to wear that I can build in ensure a career"
good,I have learned alot st target  and enjoyed my time. Have been able to do alot ANd help guests get what they want. Help team achieve a goal. Met wonderful people
good,"Target was an ok place to work all around for me. Learned a lot of things because my mom was my manager, but a lot of the people were just horrible. Managers and workers."
good,I loved working at target. You actually had a chance to interact with new people. Definitely a job for anyone that loves helping people. Staff always kept things in shape. Even at the busy stores
good,This is an extremely fast past environment.  Management is on top of their game and can sometimes be disconnected with some of the part time staff.  Overall it's a great place to work.
good,"For the most part Target is a very relaxed job, but it has its moments. Between working consumables and electronics, I have seen this dynamic first hand. The staff is very friendly and mostly young people such as myself, the older people who work overnight can be a bit touchy but for the most part the team is great and helpful to newcomers. The managers are very welcoming and easy to talk to and time off requests are almost always approved. I've worked this job since I graduated from high school and it's very good for a young person balancing college life or someone who just wants a second job."
good,Target has it all down to a science. the trick there is to trust the process and the diagnosis. The culture is great and there is opportunity for advancement.
good,I loved my job at target when I first started. Once it got later in my time there they started to cut hours and change our process over and over but then it fell on us when they’re new process didn’t work
good,Target was a fun work environment that allowed teenagers to get a job and prove themselves. Target took into consideration everyone’s busy schedule and gave us the time off we needed if scheduled in time.
good,"I was 18 when I started working at Target as a cashier and it was my first job. Training was super in-depth and all my co-workers were more than happy to help me with whatever I needed! Most days I would work a 7.75 hour shift, but the shortest ones were 4 hours. Selling RED cards was probably the most stressful thing to me, but it was nothing I couldn't handle. I looooved seeing regulars come back to the store and just interacting with so many people who loved Target as much as I do! My co-workers were the absolute best, seeing them every day just brightened my mood and motivated me to get through my workday. It's such a great place to be introduced to the working world, especially for college or high school students. I hope to come back and work for Target again someday :)"
good,I really enjoyed working at target and would love to go back. Very upbeat staff and they treat employees and customers with care. Hours aren't too long but not too short either .
good,Target was fun to work for. Fast paced and kind people typically. I worked in starbucks there for several years. I advanced to a trainer. There is oppurtunities to advance if you do the right job.
good,"Target helps develop you in ways so that you can stand on your own two feet. Whether it’s working on a major project , learning a new electrical system, or work in a group as well as working individually."
good,Target has a lot of different people from different backgrounds and it makes working there really interesting sometimes also. Meeting new faces also when you check out guests gives a sense of understanding of people which I thought was cool.
good,"Great coworkers and managers that always make the day go by, as well as recognition for hard work and prizes. Fun place to work for additional income, as a second job, or to work around a school schedule."
good,"I like the educational and supportive, and customer service focused workplace culture. Work was steady to fast paced.  I loved interacting with the customers and aiding them in their needs. I learned how to work the cash register and take all forms of payment  and educate guests about Target services."
good,Fair management.Poor training.Good pay. Open door policy makes it easy to voice your questions and concerns to management.HR is in the building so any issues are quickly resolved.
good,A typical day starts with a leader assigning you wither to the regular cash registers or to watch over the self-checkout registers. You're lucky if the store is busy or else you will stand there and wait for a guest to come by. I learned that everything in the store have their own 9 digit DPCI or DePartment Class and Item numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to interact with people on a daily basis.
good,"morning crew, unloading crew, moving stuff, moving freight, putting stuff to the floor, helping customers, talking with coworkers, being on the  run for work."
good,Target was a great place to work and increase my pharmacy skills.  The management was very flexible in scheduling and time off.  I was going through nursing school while working here.
good,when you clock in there is a team huddle to go over work assignments and recognize individual efforts of team members going above and beyond to assist customers or even certain work duties.
good,"Work was easy but repetitive. Co workers were friendly. Hardest part of the job was closing. Pay and benefits were really good. Hours were good. Learned how to work with customers, work as a team, and work throughout different positions in the store."
good,"A typical day while working at Target was always a joyful time. An amazing team was always set and ready to work. The management is very admirable, the supervisors always showed genuine interests in every team member. The part I always enjoyed working while being at Target was when we were able to learn new things once other tasks were finished, such as back stocking, setting up new displays e.c.t.."
good,A typical day for me would honestly be fairly easy scanning items and bagging wasn't too shabby but the only con about working cashier is I wasn't old enough to sell alcoholic beverages so i had to call a GSTL over to overwrite.
good,I learned retail from one of the best retailers. Started in inventory planning and worked my way up to merchandising. The fast paced world of retail is challenging and rewarding.
good,Was ok but not a lot of hours. The workers were nice. Its a good job for beginners but they don't provide enough hours for one to get accustomed to the job
good,"Retail is what it is. Large scale retail requires hard and thoughtful work with a flare for customer care and service. It is business at the root, getting products to the customer fast, friendly, and efficiently."
good,Go in to work and clock in then get to your responsibilties. Many times we were short staffed which meant you had to know how to perform nearly all of the tasks at hand. The company had a short tolerance for those cashiers who didn't sell the red cards.
good,"I worked soft lines freight, I did my job and cleaned my area and got to go home  it was a great experience and I am thankful for it. The managers were amazing and everyone is willing to help everyone learn so that everything flows smoothly."
good,Senior leadership is very matured and knows clear direction both for business and technology. Middle management might not be so efficient as there are quite a lot of Senior engineering managers who has over 22+ years experience and got saturated. But yet great place to have a work life balance.
good,I love working for Target. The work environment was a fast-paced and friendly one and every one of the employees had a positive attitude about their employment.
good,"Several job opportunities.  Helpful management team and other team members.  Friendly staff, fast paced makes day move by quickly and employee discounts."
good,I had the opportunity to learn new skills and also to a chance to oversee new construction projects. Opportunity to travel to new Target stores or locations.
good,the work there was decent did get chaotic at times but it was all good. Some of the supervisors were a little unreasonable. I would have still worked there if it wasn't for my poblem.
good,Great company and place to work for. Make sure you get trained in all areas so you can pick up extra shift. Team members are always friendly. They make working fun and enjoyable.
good,Very fast paced due to Holiday season.  Enjoyed customer interaction. Early morning and afternoon hours were ideal for my schedule.  Great managers to work with.  Managers were very helpful & thoughtful.
good,Typical work flow and great employees learned a lot about team work and how fast you can get things done with help from the team. Need more cashiers so the flow of the store can go by faster and not have so many people complain when there's not a lot of employees.
good,"The customer are cranky, but it’s a fun work place, people are positive and you could make good friends their. They also have good fashion and a Starbucks within just in case you’re tired before work"
good,"I had no retail experience before I started at target but they gave me a chance and I really liked it, the hours weren’t terrible the people were nice"
good,"Target is a fantastic company, in my opinion. Management was very clear with my job responsibilities when I first started. I was given three opportunities to advance. Payment is fair for your typical team member, with the company starting all employees above minimum wage. The company is good to their employees, creating an environment that allows us the freedom to avoid forcing sales down a guest's throat if it isn't the right fit for them; loyalty is their concern. Sales are important, but happiness is top priority. Management has also been great at my store, with everyone being supportive and helpful in my growth over the last five years."
good,"Target is a comfortable place to be that has varying ranges of managerial competence. If you have a good manager, chances are your experience at Target will be just fine. I needed a job very suddenly and applied to Target and they were very understanding when it came to flexibility, my desired hours, and upfront about what the job would entail and what I could expect from a salary. A note: If you are disabled or LGBT, Target is very friendly about hiring disabled and LGBT people, and the culture reflects this, I worked with many disabled and LGBT people during my time there."
good,"Staff was always there for questions and concerns, conflict resolution was on hand any given day, Human Resources always available for issues and concerns, teamwork was cool"
good,Working at Target was very entertaining to say the most. I saw many faces and got to know many customers. We had many that would come in once a week  to shop.
good,"Un lugar bueno para trabajar, especialmente para personas que no desean más de 25 horas a la semana"
good,work for target was good worked in the early morning was a simple job went by fast needed to be fast and efficient amazing opportunity management was really good
good,Target has a very good work environment for a student who is starting out in the work force. The company provides flexible hours and works around people and there schedules
good,"Target offers an environment that promotes personal development and encourages advancing your education.  "
good,"I loved working here, the bosses and the people made everything worth it. I was just too young to understand how important of a company and how good of a chance I had to be promoted"
good,Target was a great place to work. The store runs on a team attitude that works very closely together. This goal is definitely accomplished between team events and the day to day working environment.
good,The coworkers I was teamed with made the work day very productive and enjoyable. Managers and supervisors are very attentive to items needed to complete all assigned tasks safely.
good,Good hard work easy to learn and easy to do. Couple of bad customers but we were trained how to deal with them accordingly. Over time was only for holidays and If you didnt want to work that shift you can give it away
good,I wish that Target had provided more opportunities for advancement because I would have stayed with the company if that were the case. Leadership is somewhat disconnected from the day to day and many decisions are made without great understanding of the wide reaching impacts to the employees and the business.
good,"i learned a lot about Fashion,Warehouse, stocking shelves."
good,Work at your own pace in certain areas. No issues with management or staff. Customer service a must. Only stressful if you could not get along with others.
good,"Managers were nice. I liked what I did even though it was stressful at times. I never would've left, but they got rid of the overnight shift and my position altogether."
good,"Great place to get developed as a leader. Great training programs. Always working towards a promotion. Pay is ok, but the environment is great. Lots of fun,"
good,I loved working for Target. Although it was only a seasonal position I thouroughly enjoyed working in a happy environment that was well managed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers. Everyone was tremendously friendly and was easy to work with.
good,a good place to meet and help different people to look for items that they couldn't find in the store very family orientent learned how to use different computer scanners
good,"Target is a great place to work for. I learned to be patient with customers and to give them the best of myself. It is a great environment to be in, the managers and workers are a enjoyable to work with. Overall I liked working for Target."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Target . Everyone gets along , you can work at a slow pace , and management are very understanding and also willing to help there employees with scheduling ."
good,Easily going job apart from around the holidays but that is to be expected. The people are great to work with and are all caring and very kind-hearted.
good,"Such a good experience working in Target LLC. Good workers, management, and infrastructure. Kind owners.happy working with you for the past years. Wishing a good luck for the future."
good,I worked through the Christmas holidays.  Enjoyed working with the customers and got along well with most the employees.  Never had a problem trying to find ways to keep busy.
good,I am grateful for the time I spent at this job. The people and the environment are exceptional and fun. The leads are easy to talk to. Every here and now you'll have a specific team lead speak down to you but for the most part the workplace is great. The Target I worked at was mostly younger employees and so most of us as coworkers were close. Never difficult to ask for help and the tasks they ask you to do are pretty reasonable. All depends who the lead is for the day. Weekends are the most stressful only because it gets busy especially the electronics department.
good,Target is a wonderful Company. There are many roles and ways for advancement. The scheduling can be tough but if you are a cashier the timw will go by fast.
good,"1st off; I am semi-retired. Spent over 35 years running computers or manning data centers. As a part time job, it isn't bad. have to watch the scheduling as they did not follow the hours of availability I posted, until I started to make a stink. I work 3 shifts a week, The present. Pay is good for part time work, discount on store stuff is nice. All the people I have met at Target have been nice. 99% of the customers.They could do a better job of informing cashers of the sales and items that prompt a gift cerd,."
good,A typical day is a lot of costumer service and placing items on shelves. Management is very good and listen to feedback and concerns. worst part of the job is that sometimes you have to close until midnight.
good,Great experience for knowledge in management level as well as how to work in many different areas of focus while still maintaining company branding standards
good,"This process in order to submit an application for a different company is insulting.  Seriously, y’all should advertise that you get locked in to this nonsense when you start the application process."
good,the workload was busy yet manageable. the customers were very demanding at times but manageable. the supervisors were also very trained and understanding.
good,"I was only here seasonal but the company was good to work for. Good team spirit, always cared about us, always had breaks. Not to sure about the benefits they offered."
good,"good place to work if your career is just starting off, I worked at several different stores around the Minneapolis area and the culture is for the most part is good although it can change as the leadership teams change fairly regularly"
good,"Operator, mange break coverage and schedules. Cashier, cash handling. assist guest to right department. Announcements on intercom for guest and team member"
good,"I loved this job. The management was great and I loved my hours and co workers. I did not love the pay. The Commission base was uncapped, but it was based on a point system which is odd and sometimes got really confusing."
good,"They expected you to work and when you did you were rewarded.  When you did not they let you know, especially if you were seasonal they then would not hire you on as a part timer."
good,Overall good place to work. Staff is friendly and pay is good. They are very fair and one is always able to pick up an extra shift. Team members are very helpful to one another.
good,"This was a good experience and great benefits. I think people will enjoy his job because they treat everyone fair. This job was fast, fun , and friendly"
good,it would get hot but in the lines I would be walking constantly and the fans would blow nice cold air. it was good pay. it was a big warehouse but the break room was close to my department. the secuity was good. it was a big parking lot.
good,Great benefits and loved the discount. The focus on advancing your career if you so desire. I worked in the distribution center so it's slightly different than working in the retail environment.
good,"This place had rules in place to keep it organized and clean.  It was a nice place to work.  It had lots of customers daily, so you didn't have  a lot of slow periods in between.  I liked that because it helped the hours  to rush by."
good,While working with Target I was able to help hire and train new members and open a new store it was very exciting to be a part of a new store opening.
good,"Everyone that works at target is great. super fun, friendly, and fast. While working here i was cross trained in all areas of the store. Costumers were really nice."
good,learning warehousing work very physical job working over night learning how to do inventory and rotate stock setting up work floor for the next day and employee discount
good,I've learned how to be more friendly and have a lot more patience with guests. For my first job it's not so bad. The hardest part is keeping the mess of the clothes under control but i always try my best. The thing i love about my job is being able to connect with people. Helping people out when they are in a hurry and making it so that they won't have to stress looking for a certain item. Being at Target has helped me grow in different ways but i want to try something new now.
good,"worker as a seasonal employee during black Friday and Christmas time so a typical day was busy for the most part."
good,Working at target was a good experience for me I really enjoyed working on their presentation team they helped me learn a lot and build my resume up. I would go back and work there or recommend it for someone.
good,"I've worked for Target for 3 years while attending college and each semester I was able to do Leave of Absence for education. I was able to return every break and work without having to reapply. I always go by the saying ""if you treat the company right, they'll treat you right"", and target has definitely done that for me."
good,Really cool place and lots of nice people. I made a lot of friends. Working at target helped me learn how to handle hard situations and how to communicate with people more
good,I worked in the Eagan retail location as an intern.  It was a great experience in learning about retail management and all of the in-store activities that take place to drive a great Guest experience.
good,"The store I worked at had me doing carts plus custodian at the time. Some days were hard to keep up on busy days expecting some mess such as spills in the store. At the time, the store had no custodians and the person who took care of cleaning were the cart attendants. Most shifts only had 1 cart attendant per shift. I worked McDonald's and Target at the same time before I decided to leave Target after finding out I was getting hired to TerumoBCT."
good,"As a pharmacist, Target provides great opportunities for one on one customer interactions.  Everyone works as a team to provide patients with optimal service."
good,this is a good job to start with. they will hire anyone depending on the supply and demand. in time the weak will weed out. good place for hours and experience.
good,It's a good job. It's juts the 10% discount sucks. Its very fast paced and you have to be focused at all times especially if you are working the front end.
good,"I had loved it at target, the first week was the hardest becuse I was learning how to stock. I unloaded the truck in the morning. But had horrible communication with their employees"
good,"The environment is very friendly and they provide lunch breaks. These breaks are fun! They have taco day, PB&J, Ice cream day and etc. almost every week! Pay is fair. Management is fair."
good,Over all good company. Mostly good people working there and got a decent discount. I just had to move on to a much more full time job. They also had good food at the food cafe.
good,"there is no limit on body jewelry hair color or tattoos, nothing exposed that is profane or provocative. "
good,at target it was very fast pace but if you befriend people you will have good time but also be motivated to get your job done. management is okay but they are hard core you need to get your job done which is expected obviously.
good,"fast paced but collaborative, casual work uniform (red shirt, khakis, name tag), good pay with some holidays off, good discounts in store, clean and well organized environment"
good,"I worked as a pharmacy technician at Target and it happened to be a great experience. I learned a great amount about medications, dosages,  and clinical uses. "
good,Great place to work and good place to start a career. They offered me a flexible work schedule and allowed me to learn different departments within the store.
good,"Target is great place to work, just not enough training before you are held to standards within company. Also not enough hours of work provided to team members."
good,I was so happy here .... a great team player job. Mgr . Way cool ...  I loved it .... was a cashier 2 and 1/ 2  years .I had morning shifts and pm shifts.   .they treated me withrespect
good,There is definitely work for advancement if hard work is put in. Team members are more than just coworkers and everyone is very easy to get along with. With me being a student and taking a semester off to study abroad they really have been able to work with my schedule with no issues.
good,"I was only seasonal help, very busy. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day. Break room all the way in back of store and break was to short."
good,"I was a cart attendant when I worked at Target. So my job was very strenuous and action-packed. I was responsible for cleaning bathrooms, cart attendance, and store maintenance. All at the same time."

good,"You need to watch how a cow worker works so you learn the basics of the work at target , show respect and respect will be giving , i learned alot working at target its a great job"
good,"I am allowed to work my section freely, as my leads trust me to make it productive and beautiful.  I am able to contribute to profitability and freedom to create."
good,I worked as a cashier. I dealt with people and my coworkers. I had to keep my area clean and make sure there was no clutter. I had to manage the money. If guest service needed help I would go there and help them to get there lines down.
good,"Enjoyed my time at the Super Target in Mooresville. All employees were friendly and helpful. The management were transparent about numbers and their desire to impress their higher-ups, and were also honest about hiring/letting go of seasonal workers and lax employees. For driven employees, this is a great work environment."
good,"It's a standard big box retailer, the quality of the team depends on each store. My particular store had a new store team leader every year so it was always in some sort of flux."
good,"Very popular company and brand."
good,"Hard work, long days, good pay in the warehouse"
good,Everyone was nice and helpful upon my first starting of working at the store. I felt comfortable with my coworkers and asking my superiors questions or help with my work. The breaks were good with 15 minutes as your first and last break along with a 45 minute lunch break.
good,A typical day at work would be opening the store in the morning and making  sure everything was operating smoothly. Afterwards a morning meeting. The hardest part of job was always having to identify a low performing employee.
good,if you want to work for a corporate company this is a pretty safe bet. usually always guaranteed hours and flexible schedules. good for students. but you are really just looked at as a number. like more corporations.
good,Very flexible with hours and working with your schedule. Everyone worked as a team if needing to get something done. Management was helpful in answering questions or showing you how to correctly do something. Very supportive when issues popped up both at work and in personal lives.
good,Nice work environment. Nice co workers. Advancement potential . Friendly management. Good pay and benefits. Employee discount. Multi department training

good,I have worked with Target for 15 years within the human resource department.  My responsibilities include implementation of the ongoing solutions and improving the overall service provided by the human resource department.  This includes managing several HR tasks and balancing fluctuating workloads.
good,"I worked at Target during the holidays as seasonal help, it was a fun and definitely exciting place to work!!! The Tulsa hills location has a great store manager who keeps things going as well as keeping moral high."
good,I absolutely enjoyed working for this employer and would definitely love to work here again.  I only had to leave my job and position because of relocation and then financial situations.
good,I have to say that I did enjoy working with all my co-workers at Target and most of my customers were pretty awesome too. It was definitely hard to leave but you would have to work two part-time jobs just to make ends meet.
good,"This job was a great way to get introduced to customer service. My managers were all very personable and helpful in my training. The wage is fair, but probably won't support a family."
good,"I loved here as a first job. Taught me a lot, grew me a lot. Learned well with how to deal with people from everywhere and every background. Highly recommend to any new person into the job world to work in either retail or food service"
good,"A typical day at Target consist of meeting and greeting customers with a smile, promoting sales, credit cards, and newly arrived merchandise to customers. I learned that most customers are looking for a friendly face and smile to lighten their shopping experience and to save money while enjoying the friendly atmosphere. Management consistently make employees aware of changes in scheduling, merchandise, sales, and employee outings. The workplace culture consists of a diverse employees and customers which enhance my working and serving customers experience. The Hardest part of the job is not having enough scheduled employees during peak days and nights. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers compliment me on a their shopping experience and my positive interaction with them."
good,"Target was great to it's customers and employees as a whole. As an employee, there was good communication with management. They were very alert to all standards and did their utmost to keep said standards."
good,"Work,and life balance. Competitive pay and benefits. Outstanding operating and technology procedures. Flexible working hours. Clean working environment."
good,"It all really depends on the job position you apply for, i applied for hard line which pretty much work half of the store and sometimes electronic. But just work hard and communicate well with others, and have a go get it attitude you will do fine. Also apply for full time positions."

good,Working at Target has been a great building experience for me as not only a person but to build my skills as an employee and  a supervisor.  I have not only been placed in a direct supervisory role but have also been part of the Cash Office that counts the Daily Money intake.
good,"Managers were nice, yet expected too much at times. They would make up stay way past closing to make sure everything was in check, understandibly, but I felt as though they kept us way past closing, tidying up with unnescessery busy work."
good,"Worked in a section on the floor, kept it clean and organized"

good,"Target strifes on work life balance, providing flexibility to their employees to manage their personal life and be productive as a result.. nice working environment with great coworkers and team members/ great opportunities to grow and learn from others."
good,"Since I worked for Target they have sold to CVS so this may not be accurate.  Target was a super company to work for.  They were very regimented in the way they wanted thing done including how you put prescriptions in a bag.  I was hired as pharmacist in charge from outside the company which is unusual to a location and had many problems.  My staff was the best and we rapidly ""turned it around"".  I left after 6 months because my mother was ill and I needed to are for her.  I have no knowledge of what it is like to work for CVS be Target treated me very well and I only have positive things to say about the Target company."
good,"It was a overall good job , I was working in the holidays (Black Friday ) so it was a bit hectic at times but besides that it was a good job to work at . Worked well with school so overall it was fine"
good,assisting customers
good,Apply if you like the vibe you get when you walk in a Target. Target is one of the few companies that prides themselves of employee appraisal. They are very professional while still maintaining a fun working experience.
good,"Easy first job when I had no experience. Always is short on staff because there are never enough hours to go around. Worked at Starbucks and Food Avenue, workplace culture varies from store to store"
good,"My work skill have improved from working with guests one on one. Target is a great place for a high school student, college student, or someone looking for a little extra cash to add to their life. I enjoy being able to be cross trained and there are great opportunities for advancement."
good,"Target wasn't anything too special, just simple cashiering and the computer even counts back the exact change for you so its literally just mindlessly scanning items."
good,I liked working at Target the employees were nice and the managers knew how to treat the workers the workplace was drama free and the guests had nice personalities too
good,"Great place for growth opportunities. Awesome experience with guest and very flexible with work/life balance. If you have a great working attitude, it will help get noticed fairly quickly."

good,you'll end up having a routine if you work at target everyday. target has taught me to work at a fast pace. management is cool very nice managers. i think the hardest part of the job is just the rush hour
good,"I had a lot of friends working at Target. Everyone was nice. It was a relaxed work environment, and scheduling was really easy to work with. I liked working at Target part-time."
good,"∗ Introduce new products to guests"
good,"Good company, minimum wage pay, definite growth with the company can be fun to work at depending on personality and location City Target is still fairly new as far as retailers go but it was fun experience to be with a store for its opening and the location is great in the heart of downtown"
good,"Great Job and great pay. Management was decent and so was the overall atmosphere. I would love to work here once again. Work was well balanced, and the pay was worth it."
good,Target was a friendly and fun atmosphere and the staff and managers were very helpful and supportive. I worked there as a cashier and was promoted to help desk within a few months. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement.
good,"Target was my first job even though it was temporary until I started school. Friendly staff , friendly management . The only thing is that if you was sick they didn’t care and hold that call out against you ."
good,Target is a good place to start working and build your customer service experience. it is kinda hard to move up but there are some opportunities. The store culture varies from store to store so try to find the right one
good,"A typical day is accommodating to the Guest needs and answer questions. Also to be Fast , Friendly and Fun while guest are exiting the store. I have learned how to problem solve and fix mistakes in a quick fashion. The management team is very helpful and concerned about there team members. They are always helpful and ready to help you excel in the company when ready. The workplace is fast paced and energetic, also busy at times. The hardest part of the job is when you get frustrated and don't know what to do sometimes you need to just take a quick deep breath and keep going.Also when you don't know the answer or cant help a guest to the fullest extent due to last minute problems. The best part of the job is knowing my co workers are there for me and vice versa because we act as if we are family in the store."
good,Target places an emphasis on employee morale; I never felt unappreciated while there.  Was given ample opportunity to work in various areas of the store.  Management is a mixed bag.
good,"Love the organization and people here, They are amazing to work with. If there is retailer to challenge Amazon this is the one. After Mike tookover as CEO its doing great. I have a constant watch for Target. Its always amazing. Stores are great and changing gears to adapt to customers."
good,great place for young adults to start out their work experience very safe and neighborly place. the best part about working there is there's never really a dull moment
good,Time goes by quickly since there is always something that needs to be done. Best part is the people there are usually enjoyable to talk to and be around. Worst part is many of the people lack motivation or interest in their job.
good,it is a work place where customer service is top priority but you must also be able to multi task and be able to complete daily task. There are a lot of different job specific teams. The ability to cross train and work in other work centers is always encouraged
good,A fast paced place that has a great worl life balance.  They care about their employees and have a great recognition program.  Benifits were great as well.
good,"Worked as a team and alone, drove machines, did inventory control. Picked freight through out the warehouse to fill orders for costumers. Staff work together as a team."
good,"good place to work compared to other retail stores. great coworkers, but awful store operator and not great managers. you get a 10% discount on everything but you can only get it if you get a REDcard or cash."
good,This was a fast paced environment as a cashier.  It was fun and I loved the discounts.  I would recommend wearing comfortable shoes as you will be on your feet all hours.  Clocking in/out on cash register was easy and ringing merch was simple.  You must ask for Target Red card and some customers were irritated with it.
good,"i was hire for a temporary seasonal   position."
good,Target is a good company to work for. Not the greatest benefits for part timers. Good management and workplace culture. Very physical in the stockroom.
good,"This was such a great job; I was promoted within four months of being there. However, the stress of the situation took a toll on my health. I learned so many great and wonderful things from this job."
good,"Loved working for Target.  It was a great job.  Could not advance any higher due to lack of college degree (I have since gotten one), and I had a huge conflict with my manager."
good,For gaining a work experience this is the place where you should start. It will enhance your abilities to multi task and interacting with guest and build confidence.
good,"Track orders, place orders online, Give guest their estimated delivery dat,Greet customers and direct them help them to place order while I am on the phone with them sometime."
good,"The management and coworkers at Target are phenomenal. There was very little stress while working, and most of the time the crew I worked with would get all the closing or opening tasks done ahead of time."
good,I really enjoyed working with this company. I was there for about a year. eventually transportation became an issue for me do to the fact that I am in a wheelchair and do not drive..
good,People are very helpful. I have learnt how to deal with people very nicely. The managements are very good. The most enjoyable part is to dealing with different types of people.
good,The employee for friendly management was organized. The pay rate was fair the scheduling was flexible and understandable although I was only seasonal my time working for the company was grand
good,"If you like to work with the public, this is the place for you.  It's always interesting.  Never idle or quiet. Many different job duties to the job from keeping the area around the register to working the customer service register on returns."
good,"Pretty cool palce to work. Loved the managers at my store. They dont have a lot of hours to give out, and it seems like they're trying to cut them down so most people are part time only though."
good,I enjoyed working for the pharmacy until it was bought out and we had to transition to CVS pharmacy. I think things were run much better while under target management
good,"Great place to work for a first or second job. Great experience with coworkers, very welcoming group of individuals. I would recommend working here to a friend or young person."
good,"Target is a great place to work at because your able to move to overnights/daytime as a part time worker if you don't like doing certain duties, unless your a TL, ETL your kinda out of luck"

good,I liked working there. I made friends. They were understand about any personal things that came up. They fed us for the holidays. They were all real down to earth.
good,It was a good place to work and get to know each other. And the managent was very willing to work with my schedule. One thing that I liked was my schedule days was off and then when I could work then I worked
good,Target is a wonderful place to work with okay benefits and good pay. The only bad thing about working there is the hours. Everyone wants 40 hours every week. The only time you might get 40 hours a week is at the end of the year from November to January.
good,Very fun workable job that ensures everything runs great. Most of the workers work very slow and if you are more familiar with most of the areas the mostly will depend on you more.
good,"Working at Target was a fun place, the employees where fun to be around and they always helped each other out. I went to school while working so Target was able to help me with my school schedule and work life."
good,A good part time job with flexible hours. They are willing to work with your college schedule and allow you to change your availability often. Would recommend.
good,"The managers were almost always helpful and on task helping to make the night go smoother. Hours were always decent always, never too much or too little."
good,Fun relaxed work place no hard part  a typical work day was good management was very respectful overall a great company to work for i would recommend a friend
good,I have enjoyed my working experience here. The management is good and knowledgeable. I have gained valuable experience in customer service and valuable work experience.
good,"Target was a nice experience I definitely loved the vibes I the store everyone was so friendly and full of energy ready to learn and work. My target family taught me a lot , as far as work timing & management"
good,"It was a good experience. Since a was a seasonal employee, I do not know much about the company. I worked there one and half month only. Everything seemed good to me."
good,I highly enjoyed my time being employed at the lawton target. Fast fun and friendly co-workers as well as managers. I would enjoy being employed for target again.
good,Always had something new to learn each and every day. Wanted to branch out and work in different departments but unfortunately I had to leave because I wasn't getting the hours I needed.
good,"Target is a great company to work for. Though, management is strained when working within very confined resources. My experience was great, but I found an industry that presented more options. Best of luck to all!"
good,"Target Distribution can help you become self sufficient, able to work well with others and help build good work ethic. Also it help me to be more hands on and work accurate under pressure."
good,"It's very fast faced, ever changing work environment.  The company keeps up with new trends and stays competitive with their extensive training and new roll-outs."
good,"I actually enjoy working there and really don't dread going to work like some other jobs I've had."
good,"A lot of choice in where to work, good people to work with. Good place to gain customer service experience and how to work with various types of people that you can come across."
good,"Yes Target is a great place to work, especially if your in the younger generation. Alot of the employment were young. Yes I was older and got along with everyone. Everyone helped out with each other."
good,Definitely a fun place to work with so much diversity. Only thing is the pay isn't suitable for the living in Cincinnati. Not for a single adult living on their own.
good,"It’s a good starter job , okay paying and okay hours , not the best but also not the worse , my checks will come out any where from 400$ to 600$ depending on how much work there was"
good,"started off as a holiday worker, which was fun and interesting. Got kept on after the holiday season. The hours slowed down after that and the pay is not the best but its also target"
good,"A typical day at work included customer service, zoning sales floor, and checking customers out at the front end. I learned how to serve customers well. Management was helpful and friendly. All of my coworkers lent a hand and we worked as a team. The best part of the job was being exposed to products and serving customers. The worst part of the job was not being able to advance in the company."
good,Target is a good company to work for. IF you know the right people theres plenty of room for advancement.very flexible with scheduling nice incentives
good,"Because the location was next to campus, you run into a lot of classmates and get to know the usuals. There are times when it would slow down but there’s always something that needs to be worked on or done. Definitely can’t just stand around and do nothing. The management is almost always willing to send help if needed. If a problem arises, it’s easy and quick to get in contact with supervisors. Hardest part of the job is probably the constant standing and being short handed. The best part is meeting new people and having conversations with locals and sometimes travelers, as most of them stop by from or on the way to the Grand Canyon."
good,"For what it was, the kiosk was an interesting place to work, and as a first job it was a steep learning curve for someone who's generally an introvert."
good,Target was a pretty good hard working fast pace job. There where a few great bosses that attended to employees needs and they made sure fir sure that there were no accidents or mishaps under there nose.
good,"All staff and employees are such a blessing,  work environment is perfect but can also be very demanding. Management does a great job in helping employees stay focused."
good,"Target is a faced paced work environment. Workload fluctuates hourly, daily, weekly and monthly. There are no guarantees with scheduling, hours or work-center. The team at Target operates as one. One Team, One Voice!"

good,"As a cashier, mangers expected us to meet a weekly quota of red cards. I enjoyed working in the fast pace environment, and gained a lot of customer service experience."
good,I enjoyed working for Target. The company liked to make competitions for their employees and hosted many charity events. It meant a lot that a company does so much to influence the community around it.
good,"Warehouse work, daily assignments, learned all aspects of receiving merchandise, stocking, picking  & packing orders, shipping orders, loading & unloading incoming & out going trucks. The hardest part of the job, was loading the truck in the outbound area."
good,"While working at target it was very fast paced, most of the customers would come at once and you would have to be quick with your hands and friendly so that you can get them through and on their way. I simply enjoyed working here because it was a great experience."
good,"Target provided me an opportunity to get promoted to a certain extent in leadership. If you have never managed a team before, this is a great place to start to do almost anything you want at Target Corp. You'll work the holidays yes, but the work can be rewarding."
good,Many benefits for employees. Company overall looks out for their employees. Would recommend this company to someone looking for a long term career. Good to work for
good,"Long twelve hour work shifts from six am to six at night, short breaks, and no paid lunches. Nice cafeterias and break rooms. It's a fast paced work place."
good,You know your schedule two weeks in advance. it’s easy to switch shifts when needed. The work environment and clean and organized. Reliable money every two weeks.
good,"The culture is good, but it depends on the manager you have.  Some are amazing and some are not.  I learned to know my audience and work with them well."
good,A good place to work with higher pay than anywhere but the downside is they have you work mandatory every week now so you don't have much time off to spend with family or friends
good,Nice place to work. Managers are nice and they are flexible with hours. Works very well when going away for school and working on school breaks. Flexibility to try different positions in the store.
good,Awesone place to work if you can handle retail. Long hours sometimes and the holidays are really what drags it out of people sometimes but overall the team is what makes it worth it.
good,"Pacing of being a cashier for Target can vary with the amount of customers coming through at one time. Proficiency is judged by how many items are scanned and how quickly  making it a priority to move fast, even if customers are slow."
good,I worked at target as a seasonal temporary warehouse position. My time there was enjoyable and would have liked to stay on full time as a permanent Full time worker.
good,friendly environment with lots of options to move up and work more hours. I did not intend on staying there for long so I did not take advantage of all benefits but they still gave great discounts and incentives to all employees
good,Target is an innovative and fun place to work. The benefits are really great and the discounts help out too. They offer great 401k options and take care of their employees. There systems are usually top of the line and way a head of their competition and they bring a sleek and sexy look to their stores. They are clean and organized and really encourage people to come and shop at their stores.
good,I was given necessary tools to ensure I could grow and do well. My co workers and bosses were all helpful and understood my need to move on to something else.
good,"Being a sales team member was absolutely my favorite job. I enjoyed working with the public, helping sell products that are worthwhile and desirable to own, working with a diverse team of people, having the opportunity to work through the holiday season, working full-time and the store environment was inviting, warm and incredible. I loved my job. It was well worth the time and effort. I would love once again to work for Target. Great hierarchy of employees and great global causes they support and help. Great place to shop. Affordable products. Overall, the best job I have ever had."
good,This is a  good  company to work at and  be apart of .I learned  how to work with others and  also  how to complete tasks  by myself. The  workplace  culture was  productive  to the  different types of people that  worked here. The  most enjoyable  part  of the job was the  human resources representative because she always had answers and was pleasant .
good,Target has a fun and energetic working environment. I really enjoy working here. The employees make the workplace a fun place to be in. The security makes it a safer place.
good,"Meeting and making a connection with customers, asking questions and listening to shoppers' needs, then giving options and advice on meeting those needs."
good,I worked here while attending community college. I started in the logistics department which required restocking the shelves. I moved into assets protection department which essentially consisted of patrolling the premises. It was a good experience and I met a lot of good friends.
good,Target is a wonderful place to start working. The team members and management are friendly and willing to work with me on scheduling and I can go to my boss at an time if I am having a problem. The work can be easy or hard depending on the day but if you ever need help with something. You can ask someone without fear of  being ignored.
good,The company has a good community and are experi bring an amazing store remodel. They have great culture and amazing managers. The grocery Check date system can be better improved.
good,"I made plenty of friends working for Target, the work was fairly easy and management was always there to help you need be. I learned to move at a steady but reliable pace. Time moved very fast when you were busy, so 7 hours or so flew by."
good,It can be boring and  repetitive but it does pay well and has great hours and life accommodation. It is worth working there and can be a great first job
good,"Fast paced keep you moving all the time "
good,I learned a lot working at Target. Management never turned me down from wanting to learn more. Keeping pace while offering good customer care was hard
good,"Management was horrible, nobody ever really wanted to do any work, would always pass work off to the next person. I learned customer service skills and how to deal with people. The workplace culture is hard to follow. The hardest part of my job was working with customer issues."
good,Managers were nice and listened to the team. The only downside of the job ( other than rude people) was having to push the red card so hard especially as a cashier. They almost require you to get one a week. It’s doable but you start seeing some of the same faces a lot.
good,"I really liked my job an team. it was  an new oppertunity, i had never worked in the field before but i really liked the job an hours. unfortunately i had a medical problem an had to leave."
good,"easy work environment, recently poor staffing, great compensation, nice and friendly management, job position is slower than what I'm used to so its slightly boring."
good,There was always something to do.  The store was pretty much had a steady flow of customers.  We all worked as a team to see that the customers needs were met.
good,Target helped me learn customer service and retail service. It was great for a first job and loved working there. Management and coworkers were very sweet and helpful. Customers were usually very patient and friendly!
good,The managers would allow their employees do to their jobs and not micromanage every different department in the store. Workers were all treated fairly and with respect.
good,"Jobs are a bit tough and sometimes require a little extra effort than most, but the management staff is fair and they take care of their team memebers."
good,Everyone was friendly and helpful. I worked early hours but i still enjoyed the job. Not once did i complain other than the occasionally about working 0400-0830
good,"Working at target, you must learn to have patience and be able to help with problems even if it is outside of your job title. Target is a fast paced group effort, if someone is slacking the whole store starts to slack. So everyone must remain on top of their game."
good,It was productive. I was able to get my job done in a sufficient amount of time. People were friendly and willing to help. One of the hard parts was when we did not have enough team members to get the task at hand accomplished. Most enjoyable was seeing team members grow in their role and take on new ones.
good,very good place to work if you retired or looking for a second job or if your in high school an need extra money youll need to keep a positive mind an stead heart
good,Good job as far as retail goes.  the equipment has improved and they will adapt to online shopping.  wish there were more hours and they would approve overtime.
good,The job was never boring it was always something to do and the customers were very polite so was management. I learned there that customer care is a consistant job that takes a lot of focus and dedication.
good,"I worked in a high-volume store, which meant there was always tons of work to be done and pressure to do it quickly. But this helped bring everyone at my store together--the burden felt more or less evenly split between us, and we each had a role to play in keeping things moving. Organizationally I was at the very bottom of the totem pole but no one ever made me feel inferior or unimportant. The break room was vibrant and positive--I remember that the TV was pretty much always tuned to Judge Judy or Divorce Court or the like. The disciplinary process always felt fair."
good,"I enjoyed this position. A lot of nice people to work with. But the location is too far from my house, And the drive has too many traffic jams.The pay and the hours were good."
good,"It is a very fast-paced job, always having something to do, and the bosses always walk through and make sure you have something to do, or aren't getting behind with what task they have given you.  The bosses work right along side you in most aspects of the job, and it's a nice change from my other jobs."
good,"They always worked around my school schedule for the most part.  There was one period where I had to compromise because they really needed coverage.  The expectations to get things done by the end of the night were usually unrealistic and we would be required to stay an hour sometimes 2 hours past our scheduled shift to get things done.  In their mind it was the ""employees not working hard enough"" and not ""we don't have enough people to get everything done that we need to"".  At least we were compensated for the extra hours.  Some managers were really bad about having employees clock out and then they would make us wait for 15-30 mins while they did all of their closing paper work and then would finally unlock the doors to let us leave at the end of the night.  You are required to sell redcards if you are a cashier which is not fun.  I believe your experience working for target is only going to be as good as your managers make it.  I knew someone that worked for another Target location and they said their managers were always stressed out, over worked and wouldn't budge on schedule changes so she ultimately had to leave.  My managers were really fun and upbeat.  They treated us with respect for the most part.  We were compensated well compared to other big chain retailers."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Target as an ETL Logistics. They have excellent pay and benefits. The biggest downside to this position is the typical retail headaches like working weekends and dealing with crazy people, but that is expected."
good,It's just about what you'd expect of a retail job like this. It's a good first job for any young applicants looking for busy work during a season or part-time.
good,Target was a ok job kind of Strenuous work but with two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute break all paid for it all kind of weighs out to be a little less than perfect
good,Target is going downhill with all of the new changes they are implementing to a system that was working just fine the way it was. Im sad to see them taking such a turn
good,Target is an awesome organization if you do not mind working nights and weekends.  Once I started my family I did not want to have to spend that much time away from them.
good,Always doing other people job. Always being rush to do your job. The manager don’t help when you called for it. Rude people and always thinking they right.
good,"You get in there, everything is fast paced. As for me, being a cashier,  the hardest part was to get at least one RedCard per day. Being a cashier is the most important and responsible job in the work place and the most important part of being a cashier is to make sure your customers, as we call it in Target ""Guests"", come back you. The workplace is very comfortable and friendly and everybody is welcoming and they treat you like family. I enjoyed the people i worked with, working in Electronics , and the experience and opportunity I had. As for being my first job, it's a great first job. Well recommended. You learn about the real world in a job like retail and you encounter so many different people from all parts of the world."
good,The job was OK. Certain days had its moments where you will be stressed out due to some customers and co-workers but just move on from the  situation.
good,"Target is a great place to work, with great pay! Staff were friendly and nice.But, I don’t think they should have fired me because I had to call off because my kids were sick and I had a doctors excuse, and they didn’t except it and wouldn’t look at it. I wish they would have gave me a second chance!!"
good,Overall working at Target was awesome. I loved my job and my hours only wished I worked full time instead of part time. I learned so much and advised far quickly at this job.
good,"very friendly workplace , employees have some sort of freedom  to participate in some companies decision making process , timing and working hours are very good."
good,The work environment is relaxed and friendly with the management team willing to help you learn and grow in your work responsibilities.  But the potential for career advancement seems to be very limited.
good,the target ware house is on rita road. its a great workplace when it really busy. during the holidays like thanksgiving and Christmas is when the warehouse show it full work flow.
good,"Typically a day at Target Distribution Center was very fast paced but stale. Often did the same task for the full 12 hours I worked. Due to the physical nature of the work the first ten to fifteen minutes were spent with all employees for the incoming shift warming up with simple exercises while management went over expected productivity for the day and performance for the day prior. Management did care about the employees often stressing to work safe and encouraging to take a few extra seconds to avoid bodily harm. However the actual work stressed otherwise. I often found myself risking my safety to keep up with more experienced workers, not to mention my lack of training for anything other then the powered equipment. I usually didn't have a full understanding of what I was doing until I made a mistake and was told how to properly do it. Unfortunately ways of executing the work differed from person to person which was frustrating for a new hire. Overall it was a good experience, the general atmosphere was lax and you could ware what you wanted as long as it wasn't offensive. The best part was the pay, as a seasonal I didn't not get benefits but did start at 15 an hour for an over night shift which was the best part, the worst being the hours. It was difficult to adapt to working 12 hours over night anywhere from three to five days in a row."
good," Positively impacting guest services through the management of employees at the"
good,"The company is a very good starter job. The management and the Team were wonderful to work for. They pushed you to sell RedCards a lot, but they were very good about rewarding you for meeting a goal."
good,"Most definitely the most fun co-workers I have ever had. Most of them are very helping, energetic, productive and friendly. It was a very nice atmosphere to work in. Definitely an ideal place to start for a 17-18yo."
good,"When I was put to work, I jumped into a place that I learned a lot about communication. That's what the job is about: talking to the leaders that walk around the store, talking to employees, and talking to the customers. Typically they want you to get a red card for each shift that you are a cashier, which puts a lot of pressure, but at the same time, the best effort will make everyone happy even if you can't get the cards. I enjoyed loading shelves the most with others: we can talk about whatever while unloading some flatbeds of toys or whatever needed to be done."
good,"pushed  out items to floor, made sure everything was in the right label, and shelf. making sure nothing was expired or broken."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, it was a great experience and I had lots of fun. Everyone was so nice and excepting and I love meeting different people every day"
good,"Target is a place that allows you to move up or down in whatever you are doing, as long as you are a good worker. I started in the Cafe, then moved to cashier, and then sales floor team member. I eventually had shifts as a styles specialist where I used suggestive selling to help add to people's carts. It is especially a great first job so you can gain all of the retail and customer service experience needed."
good,"The management was great to work with. If any co-worker needed help, someone always was there willing to help. There was not a day that I did not want to go to work."
good,"You know, this place was pretty ok to work for. I took a seasonal cashier job having just moved to the area, and while it was exceedingly boring (as cashier jobs typically are), it wasn't a bad way to keep the bills paid until I had full-time work lined up. "
good,"I started working at Target when I was 16, it was my first job.  It was a great place to work during high school and college.  I left the company when I was offered a full time position at another company"
good,"Very busy especially during holidays. I learned to multitask while being there. Greeting clients, stocking shelves while taking customers and processing transactions. They were very flexible with schedules."
good,It is a fun atmosphere! Team members are enjoyable as well as the management staff. Working here itself is very fast-paced and always busy! BE READY  for hard work and long days.
good,"Good job for High Schooler's and college kids, looking to get into the work force and advance up in the company or help through school. Seasonal period comes a hassle."
good,Every weekend I would start around noon. From here I was either on the floor or register. The hardest part of this job is falling into the motion of a fast paste enviornment. I learned so much about retail and customer service.
good,this is a great place good people and fun work I wish I did not have to move away form the area hope who ever works there likes it as well you stay very busy and the day goes fast.
good,"My only complaint is that they gave me only four days of notice when my seasonal position was ending.  Then again, management also had only four days of notice.  They were just as surprised as I was.  It would have been only two days of notice, except HR didn't have my final paycheck ready in time, so they extended my position two more days.  Even HR didn't realize my end there was coming."
good,"for a normal workday it can be stressful during the holiday season but for the most part, it much more relaxing in some ways.  for me personally, I would say that it is a fun place to work at as your first job and the manager that I work with are pretty great and they care about how you are working and they would ask idea about how to make it better so for me I would recommend the company to anyone that is looking for a first time job."
good,Target is a good place to work at if you ever want to do retail or customer service. I like working their but I am ready do and learn something new and different. But I am getting some great experience well work here.
good,"A typical day at work consists of me doing HR routines but also helping the team out when needed which consists of cashiering, loading items for guests and assisting with stocking the shelves."
good,had a really fun day with a bunch of friendly faces competive wages get to help others that where in need of help    ...................................................
good,"Your average day, depending on your position, would consist of arriving, clocking in and going to your post. I learned that work ethic opens many doors in some companies. I learned this after completing the winter season at the job as they requested that I come on full time."
good,"it was a nice work environment, nice people, ok pay and benefits. Fun company to work for. if your looking for a long term position I would recommend Target."
good,Enjoyed working with other employees and learning new ways to do things.  Management was pretty fair but sometimes a bit ageist.  Under a certain age people were not respected as much by a certain manager.
good,"Pleasurable experience working there, management and co workers friendly  Great guest services , great benefits, enjoyable/relaxing to shop at. They take care pf their employees whichever way they can...their willing to work with you!"
good,"good place to work with lots of opportunities for overtime hours. long hour days, many different types of shifts available. vacation, 401k, insurance and many other types of benefits"
good,"this job was a long time ago and I was young. It was a fun place to work, but has changed a lot since then so I cant really tell you what it would be like to work for them know. Back then, it was a fun company to work for."
good,It is a good place to work if you are looking for something part time.  If you are looking for full-time then I would not recommend it.  You have to be a people person and willing to sell at this point in any position.
good,Being a stocker at target can be hard work but it is a fine workout. Throwing the truck was always a personal favorite! But the rest of the job was relaxed and involved a steady pace of work.
good,"Working at target is pretty amazing, the staff is great and worked with my school schedule. I was able to learn many different skills, the culture is very welcoming."
good,Never to busy or cluttered always prepared to work very friendly team members pay was good very clean and organized. Management kept everyone on the same track to achieve one common goal as a team.
good,Cette compagnie accordait énormément d'importance envers leurs employés.
good,Target is a fast paced environment full of guest with large numbers of items to purchase. I learned to operate a computer system such as a cash register. The work place was full of joy and happiness from co-workers their self. The hardest part about target would be when the store becomes very busy and lines would began to stretch to the back of the store. The most enjoyable part was being able to conversate as well as laugh with co-workers.
good,"Regardless of what time you came in, you would have to work with scheduled caff and more than likely do online orders. Back room attendants are the heart of the store with them products don't get pulled from back room or pushed to the sales floor. When other sales floor employees or managers cant find items, they ask back room members for help."
good,"As a highschooler, I was employed by target during the christmas season and I had a wonderful time. As a seasonal employee i did not receive many hours but received great and helpful training from the staff."
good,"With changing deadlines on a day to day basis it will be hectic, but the people you work with help ease the day. With a good team the job is simple. Spreading your abilities to different teams will allow you to have a different experience coming in each day to keep the job interesting."
good,It was my first warehouse worker experience and I enjoyed it a lot. Every target employee was very friendly and helped the temporary associates in learning the job.
good,"A typical day being a cashier is making sure we greet our customers and thank them for shopping with us. it’s sometimes difficult when we get a rush and angry customers we try our best to make the guest satisfied, but most of all it’s a great place to work."
good,A great company to work for with good benefits for every team member. The average team members get 20 hours per week   Also it’s a friendly environment.
good,"Worked setting up planograms and new merchandise and one  the sales floor. Hours were perfect, 6 am to 2:30 pm. Workplace was always positive, maybe a bit too much at times, but it was never a problem. The most enjoyable part was definitely the team I worked with. Management was hands off unless they needed to be otherwise. All in all a good experience."
good,The environment is very upbeat the work is quick and the customers are nice.They are good at training and it only took me two days to work the self-check out.
good,Everyday is a new adventure. Nice management. Everyday I have learned new things about Target. Nice place and environment to work in. Target is a family friendly place.
good,great fun place to work
good,"Communicate clear goals and expectations to you employees."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, however, it can get frustrating when you don't see eye to eye with other employees and your work end up being affected by it."
good,I liked working at target but I had to leave because I could not have two full time jobs and still have time for myself. It definitely felt like high school. There where cliques
good,it was a good place to work but no advancement there. had no benefits as it was a seasonal job. .Might have stayed had a fulltime position come available
good,good use of teamwork and communication. typically every day similar. management a bit disorganized yet good communication. most enjoyable part of the job would be the people you work with
good,"Friendly staff that will help you when you need it, you need to have a flexable schedule though, as they like to change your hours on you, also good paying job"
good,Management treated employees fairly. Training was appropriate for job. High emphasis on safety in the workplace. Communication between management and staff was good.  Pay was commensurate with work.
good,"Working here was average. Not the best place to be working at. Management doesnt care, hours are not given to any employee. Management favours employees."
good,Target has many part-time and full-time opportunities and job offers especially during the busiest seasons of the year and this exactly how i obtained my job
good,Only worked 4 hours a day and 5 days out of the week and was paid big weekly. It was a good job if you're looking for something part time. It was only busy around holidays.
good,Team work makes for a friendly environment.  Customer service is important to job.  Enjoyed working in all different departments of the store. Expanded my knowledge in retail.
good,"My two years working at Target came and went very quickly."
good,"Now being at the current pharmacy, target is a way better place to work in terms of customers and management. I worked at a pretty slow pharmacy and it was very manageable. They gave you great benefits and all of them had an HR dept located inside so discussing issues was very easy."
good,"Had to learn a lot in a very short period of time, but it was exciting and the culture at my store was awesome. Team leaders were always willing to answer questions and give advice."
good,"I only worked there for 3 months ,however the reason I quit was not because of any problems I had with my co-workers or anything .it was my first job and I did not organize my schedule properly in order to work and study at the same time so I had some issues with having to work 8-hours shift sometimes ,which I had quite often."
good,"There were never down times, there was always something to do and people there that wanted to help you. Team work oriented work place. One on one interaction with guest and other employees. Good place to work to sharpen time management skills. Fast, Fun, and Friendly."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Target. The pace was good, the pay was amazing and my coworkers were very supportive and helpful. The management did have a tendency to interfere in other departments, they made me feel very uncomfortable half the time. Management is really the only issue that I have, besides the fact that as I was only seasonal work, I feel like I was taken advantage of."
good,"After you punch in at Target the day; began by consulting with the team member and crew, afterwards we prepped the store by stocking the shelves. During winter season our staff was thin and we would share the work load; team and I from the backroom also learned too work guest service counter, and cash registers as well."
good,"ok to work there. all on your. That is all I have to say.  I'm trying to find a job, not review Target.  Please let me move past this.  How is this helping me?"
good,Hard work lil pay for months before promotion people are good but not enough people to unload 4 trucks a day by yourself with no help and lil breaks but good other than that.
good,"Good place to work, many hours of work, good atmosphere. Good team work "
good,"didn't care for anyone. all of management was a joke, no one could keep things on track. or your LOD would tell you to do something then the next LOD would see what you are doing and yell at you because you are doing something someone else should have done"
good,"Excellent work team."
good,"I worked as a barista in the Starbucks section of the store.  If I could redo the whole experience, I would have tried to work at an actual Starbucks instead of a licensed store.  You are expected to do all the work of a regular Starbucks barista but without receiving any tips or benefits (from the basics like a free drink to more substantial things like tuition reimbursement.)  Additionally, the wage increases were very meager and insulting.  People who are hired later with less experience make more per hour than those who have been there for years because they don't raise everyone's wages in proportion to the new minimum.  Managers almost never recognize hard work but will lay into you for a small mistake.  Overall, it was a good first job but I would not go back."
good,I have nothing bad to say about them. The Management was fun and the environment was quick paced and fun as well. I was able to advance pretty based on my job skills
good,"Logistics shipping receiving manager "
good,"I would work for this company again,I f i could I enjoyed my supervisors and the way the lead their team for success it was a good environment to work and learn"
good,"Having worked at two different Target stores in two different states and towns. As a team member, your stress level and job quality are completely dependent on your managers. When I had 1 manager, my job was generally quite straightforward and easy. When I had 4 managers, my job was stressful, full of contradicting orders, and generally unpleasant. My view of the company though is very good, the Target corporation is quite progressive in comparison to other companies. Even as a grunt on the totem pole, I felt like the someone above me was looking out for me."
good,Very fast paced work environment. A lot of opportunity for advancement. It will keep you on your toes all shift long but great paid breaks. management is very helpful.
good,Good place to work for people who want to start small and work their way up. Working there teaches you how to adapt to different departments at ease .
good,"I did enjoy working there,but there was some cons."
good,It was one of my favorite jobs. Fast paced and the option to learn new departments. The only downside is its only always part time. I was looking for a full time job. Everyone working for the company had two jobs. Thats not what I am looking for. But its a very great place to work.
good,"Working at Target was pretty stressful and fast paced but the hours went by really fast, I had to quit because getting only a 15 minute break was not enough to give my back a rest. Overall good experience."
good,"Target is a fast pace place especially during the holidays. I got the best items there. Shopping is fun especially when I was on my break. My co-workers were great with me when or if I fell behind, they would always be there to help."
good,The Target Warehouse was a fast paced environment and very friendly on a typical day. In the Target warehouse I learned a lot about packing and thought it was a good job.
good,"A typical day at work is I retrieve carts, I check that all aisles are clear of inventory. I stock shelves. I have learned about inventory and have enjoyed my co workers"
good,"Coworkers were friendly, job paid well. I didn't love closing as I am still a student but nevertheless it was a good experience. Would recommend to other people"
good,"as far as retail goes it isn't a bad place to work. There's plenty of room to advance in the company, and can be a fun place to work depending on the team."
good,"Target was a very fun place to work at. I gained a lot of experience through them and it’s was my very first job. The managers were fun, and cared for their workers, and they always answered my questions. Target makes everyone feel basically like family especially if you’re a newbie. I regret leaving there but I really didn’t have a choice, but that definitely is a great place to work especially if you’re a first timer. Great pay as well for the work you do."
good,I had a great expercience at target if i knew what i knew today i probably would have stayed it was very fun we had cool days such as twin day every friday they provide a variety of different food each friday it was something different to look for they treated everyone equally and it just was amazing
good,Target is a good working environment with understanding management. The hours i asked for weren't the hours I was given if so less. A day at target consisted of being alert when a customer needed services and being very attentive.
good,"American culture enjoyed 9 hours of work and good work life balance. Good HR connect and fun to work with company."
good,"The job overall wasn't very difficult and I never really dealt with customers that were rude. The people I worked with were great the only thing that really bothered me was the fact that I was seasonal but I had to actually go up to a manager and ask them if they were going to keep me or not, they didn't tell me that far in advance so I didn't have much time to look for a job because my last check."
good,Great pay the job was nice I would recommend anyone to work there. Team members are equally yoked. The hours are great as well. I would go back if I could
good,It was a very nice environment. They allow visible piercings and tattoos. Everyone was very respectful and worked as a team. They are very on top things and make sure you're working well with your position.
good,Enjoyed the team work and working together making it a fun place to work.  Working with customers and various areas of the store made for never a dull moment.
good,my typical day at work began with a discussion about what was expected of me and then some loosening up exercises before going to work. I learned team work and how to work with multiple team members. management was hard but fair and I loved it. work place culture was everybody is one entity working close together. the hardest part of the job was getting back and forth from lunch on time because the lunch room was very far away  the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I work with.
good,"This company was a fantastic ""out of the gate"" career move for me as a new Designer. I was recruited to work there right after I graduated design school. Corporate employment has many advantages - competitive salary, benefits, mobility, coaching - all of which I appreciated while at the company."
good,"Friendly staff, good work environment. Flexible schedule,  more hours available for swapping.  Could do better with training.  I enjoyed working there, if I didn't have to relocate I would've stayed."
good,Staff was very enjoyable to be around and very accepting. I learned to be a quicker thinker and made many friendships with my co workers. Hardest part of the job was getting everything done before we hit 6 hours.
good,target does a great job with recognizing and rewarding their colleagues. they understand that hard work is required but show their appreciation. they also do a great job with helping to support your development and focus on leadership skills
good,I worked here at target for a company called marketsource but overall the target management was good but were very cut throat about things and kind of made working there not a fun experience
good,"The location in which I worked at was a high volume store so we were always busy as well as having higher sales and REDcard ""goals"". The culture was positive for the most part which made most of the team work comfortably but it was challenging to keep everyone happy because some were better at achieving their individual goals. As a team leader it was in my duties to have the proper follow up conversations with all team members as well as with my executive."
good,"Great Place to work. Fast paced, friendly, clean, upbeat, very concerned for employees. Management does not mind working side by side with associates and are always willing to lend a helping hand everywhere in the store."
good,"It is a very easy job, low stress, but no real sense of fulfillment and therefore can't find meaning and happiness here. but thats besides the point. j"
good,Enjoyed working at Target.  People was friendly and helpful.  Hours was good. Pay not so god.  Customer service was great.  Helping customers was also a learning experience.
good,I really love working for the target center I always got free tickets for me and my family and friends also I have met a lot of famous people that have performed at the target center .
good,"I have worked at two seperate Target stores and they were very different. "
good,"Target is a great company to work for with a fast paced work flow, Load on a average of 5 Trucks for extreme high volume stores with accuracy and efficiency daily."
good,Hours were flexible depending on openings in the schedule. Workloads were manageable.  Materials were organized and safety is a big key. Training is provided.
good,"The job enviroent was excellent, the hours where good as well. I enjoyed my time at builders first source.I would reccomend it to any that wants a steady job."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is helping out in other areas when needed. Its a very uptempo place to work at and managenment cares about their employees.
good,It was a fun place to work.  The managers there were awesome. The pay was not good. You do have to deal with some people you think they own the place.
good,"great place to work, great people to work with. I have worked at many different places and target is definitely a great start or a cherry on top to a long career."
good,In all it is a fun and productive place to work. I would recommend working there and would still be working there if i didn't have to relocate. It pays good and gives good hours.
good,"the culture here is fantastic. everyone looks out for each other. coworkers will help make the day go faster, which certainly helps when the store is left a mess for us to fix."
good,I really enjoyed working at Target because the management was excellent! A typical day at Target for me started early in the morning with unpacking new merchandise and pushing it out onto the sales floor and stocking extras in the backroom. The most enjoyable part of working at Target were the employees and the great relationships you make with your coworkers.
good,"A typical day is just storing and pulling merchandise from the warehouse. You have to keep a fast past throughout the day so the work can be somewhat physically demanding. If the managers and employees do their work efficiently, the warehouse will be clean and the work will be easy. On hard days such as holidays where the warehouse receives a large load, work tends to get disorganized and more difficult. However, the store typically does a good job of hiring more workers when needed."
good,"Was only temp but enjoyed working in the back area at Target."
good,"Target was a great experience for me, I really enjoyed working there. If I could go back, I most definitely accept a part time position. Overall, Target is a great company to work for."
good,i restocked the store with all products such as clothes shoes baby department kids men cookware electronics and pets sometimes we get to help a customer right before the store closes
good,"It was fun . I had good hours .the pay was good too..i had lots of fun,,flexible hours .overall target is a good company too work for.they also have good benifits too. My favorite one is the discount one for the employees"
good,Working in the electronics was the best department of store because of my team and team lead.But the only time its difficult is when I was just by myself for many 8 hours shift and guests are everywhere in the department. And trying to multitask to ensure no complaints come my way. Other than that when my team is together everything runs a lot better.
good,"This job is typically fast paced, but I enjoyed my employment with them. This job requires customer service experience and the ability to deal with possible disagreements.  Over all, a good place to work."
good,Target is a place where you can make decent money in a relaxed work place. Also the teamwork that Target implements makes each Target team stronger. Which is why I appreciate the opportunity to still be working there.
good,"I really loved working for Target because of who they are as a company and what they stand for. The work was hard and fast paced, but they pay you enough to make it worth it. Your work schedule is online so there is never any confusion and you're told what it's going to be at least a week in advance, which I really loved. My one grievance was the management. When I was running late and tried to call in to tell someone, I could never get through on the phone. They weren't understanding. I was blamed for ridiculous things that didn't happen. That may have just been with my particular store though, of course. Target as a company is great."
good,I worked for Target.  The Bay City Mall opened a new pharmacy and more importantly hours of operation were 9-7pm every weekday.  My schedule was 3 10 hour days a week.  Loved the schedule.
good,"Pros"
good,"good place to work "
good,I really enjoyed my time at Target. Positive work environment that encourages growth. Great management and leadership. Benefits could be better but its still a great place to work.
good,"was seasonal, would apply and work again. I learned a lot about the store being a fulfillment associate.  The staff was enjoyable to work for, as long as you did your job they would not micro manage you."
good,target is a decent place to work its a little fast paced during the holidays and black friday but the customers are decent but dont take anything personal the way a customer treats you and dont let it ruin your whole day if its negativ but target says the customer is still always right. Which i dont always believe that.
good,"All of the employees there ar very nice and understanding. For example, if I needed a break to reevaluate myself, I was allowed to have it, if we weren’t to busy and there was back up. If there wasnt back up, I would have to wait a little bit."
good,While working at target theres was a lot of personal growth in the position I was in as a stocker.  Being a replenisher really shows true character in a person.
good,"Days are long and fast paced; teamwork is a must, because sometimes your numbers will not be there, for you or your co-workers. Volume and pace are the hard parts, but the 3 day work week is nice."
good,"Moved & organized merchandise, kept sales floor fully stocked. Worked overnight shift. Truck comes to unload merchandise. merchandise is taken to areas and put away."
good,"I was able to utilize my management skills and learn more about team building. I was also able to sharpen my customer service skills and improve on ,y communication skill as well"
good,target was a great place to work. i enjoyed being able to meet new people and assist in any way i could . its a close knit environment and the logistics department is one of the hardest working
good,I wish I got more hours I love the work place just would like to be full time great people just hate that I’m part part time only working twice a week
good,Target is a very good place fun environment people are awesome the pay was great  the discounts were also good  the only bad thing with target no leniency with no call no shows
good,"Working ""the line"" and stocking shelves at Target was a decent job. At the two locations I worked at, almost all employees were extremely friendly and it felt like the company fostered a good work environment. They schedule hours for every employee but for the merchandising team, we were allowed to work more if we wanted. My first boss was kind and understanding (stern when necessary of course, being a manager), but my second boss was a tad overbearing. Overall, a great place to work."
good,Target was a great opportunity to keep up with modern day technology and/or fashion. Also a great outlet to complete your to do list after work hours.
good,"Great paying job, very outgoing people to work for. Great training. "
good,I worked there for about 9 years and it was enjoyable.I learned a lot of helpful skills.  I liked the pace of work. My co-workers for the most part were easy to work with.
good,I liked working for Target. the seasonal position was perfect adding to my holiday funds. training was convenient and easy. the team at target was very helpful and teaching me the floor and different departments.
good,"At Target, they always encouraged on-going training and advancing in career opportunity.  Most of my computer technology and skills sets, I attribute to my training at Target Corporation."
good,this place is productive fun and enjoyable. you will learn alot of stuff and do a lot of stuff. it is a manuel labor job be prepared to move. but the boss is pretty laid back as long as you dont mess up to bad evn then hes pretty cool great starting company everyone in the shop has been there 20 plus years lot of people in the field to lifers i tell ya
good,"It was alright to work for the company. They did have unrealistic goals for most things like keeping the toys, books, cd, and dvd sections organized. Most days it was hectic and barely had help."
good,"I was season but it was fun and I got paid decent, I did salesfloor Logistics, I thought it was fun, but it was one of the harder jobs in the store, people who do cashiering make the same and it is a much easier job."
good,Fun and great place to work. Great customer service. Very fast paced environment. Great employee discounts. Would recommend this job to any one looking for a job.
good,I liked working for target.The over night shift was very layer back we got to het our work done peacefully and cruise thru the night until out shift was over.
good,"Working in Target is Fast Fun and Friendly. The management in the Hollywood Target are very professional, The bosses are down to heart. It has it's moment when it comes to Scheduling hours. Working there for 12 years the Team members are fun and very respectful, We get along very easy and make you feel comfortable as a new Team Member. They don't give enough hours except the busy times of the holidays."
good,"Fun place to place with friends, only worked temporarily during summer before college not long enough to fully understand company culture. Overall not a bad environment to work in, or bad company to work for."
good,My job included working in the electronic department as well as seasonal and books. At time it got complicated when I was the only one running all departments and needed to go back in stock room to retrieve a television or season furniture but overall it was a lot of fun and it was a friendly environment.
good,Target treated me well as an employee. The supervisors were helpful and treated us with respect. The work was pretty easy. The days felt like they went by quickly.
good,when we clock in we would just punch in our ID number and head to the back to unload the trucks boxes and put them on carts and take them down to the isles that they are in and start to stock up the merchandise.
good,If you would like a quick paced job with always having something to do Target is the place for you. The coworkers are awesome people to work with and will help you with anything you need.
good,I loved the people and environment. I enjoyed everything about it except the fact that I could not become full time unless i was a team lead or someone higher up.
good,I only worked here briefly but the managerial team seemed super nice for the most part. Pay was a little low. Recently got offered a leadership/low level management position there that paid the same as my current line level job. Discount was okay. Pretty neutral experience overall. Mostly just a lot of nice people working there.
good,I worked at Target while earning my degree. This company was very flexible with my class schedule and my theatrical schedule. Great employees and overall accepting culture.
good,"though everyone is smiling and having fun with each other, everyone  is still getting their work done. It is a great place to work. with great employees."
good,I learned about customer service and how to work with different kinds of people. I also learned better communication skills while working with each individual customer.
good,"Overall, a decent workplace, friendly and understanding superiors. Communication skills are a must have if you plan to work for Target. Modernized systems and protocols to aid both the Team Members and Guests."
good,"Overall I would go back to target.  Learned how to work in a group.  Management was understanding, tough but lenient.  Hardest part of the job was not even the job itself. It was mainly just waking up because I worked overnight.  I enjoyed everything about target."
good,"My experience here at target is awesome , meet tons of new people from different nationalities and ethnic background. Target is very flexible with scheduling , to make sure you have everything you need ."
good,I was always very busy I made sure to keep it that way. rather its helping customers restocking the shelves or even going too help the cashiers. team member is what I was I worked hard and showed them I wanted to be apart of the Target family for a while. I was only a seasonal employee until I showed them how great I work. Then they offered me a full time spot. after a few months I then started working for pizza Hut in the target store in which I was already working at. Star bucks was there as well that was next on my goals to accomplish.
good,"very faced paced no matter what i was doing, need to be able to stand on your feet for the whole shift, lift 25+ pounds, be able to pull pallets, customer service"
good,"Target is a great company, retail monster! You can learn so many different things Target has to offer as far as growth, development. Customer service is great their they preach treating everyone like family and working with fun and urgency."
good,"a good job, no stress.   Once asignments are given you are left alone to accomplish them.  accountability is a given.  the workplace is culture is good."
good,Great culture! Target gives you all the tools to succeed. The expectations are HIGH everyday. You MUST hit your KPI's daily. You MUST KNOW your business. Target us known for having visitors fly in from the corporate office to walk the stores. If you fail to excuse anything on that day it could cost you your career. Most don't believe this but you will once you start working there. The key to making it at Target is knowing your business and BUILDING the right relationships with the right people.
good,Management and co-workers were friendly. Work environment was fast paced. Facility was very hot during the summer and very cold during the winter. Lots of recognition for good work.
good,"Target is a fun and enjoyable place to work. Amazing people to understand and have conversation, meeting new people. They train you to do more than one thing."
good,"transport good"
good,"This does not matter anymore because the sector of Target I worked for is now gone. So, I liked it while it lasted, but that has ended...alas my sadness"
good,I worked at Target while I went to school full time. I worked the service desk as well as the cash resisters. They always worked with my schedule and even when I didn't qualify for FMLA when my mom fell ill they still allowed me to keep my job!
good,"Typical day at work was fast paced, training was well given, management was involved in every day function, work place culture was fast, fun, and friendly, the hardest part of the job was not being able to please every customer. the best of the job was to see the customer leave the store satisfied."
good,"great place to work. multiple discounts, flexible hours. work in all areas of the store. great for around holidays.  hardest is when lines got crazy around Christmas."
good,"Target is one of the largest retail stores in the US, so they have cutting edge marketing, innovations, and new products. There is so much to learn from retail, and it is a good start to your career."
good,Clean and friendly it was a temporary assignment wish I was hired as permanent learn a lot and nice supervision and benefits great hours and shifts. I want to apply for full time regular position hopefully in the future bug j plan on going to school to better my skills for better opportunities
good,Target department store is a busy place. It is a fast pace work atmosphere. Fellow employees were very helpful. Good benefits. The management was partial when it came to promotion.
good,Everybody was really nice and welcomed me into the environment very nicely. The customers also made the job very bearable and the coworkers became my family.
good,Opportunities abound.  Very structured business and processes. Very Neat clean and organized mentality.  Continues to drive the business to a  leader in the Market Place.
good,"I have worked for Target as a Logistics Team Member during Graveyard/Early mornings for over a year now, and I LOVE my coworkers and my managers. the problem lies within the cooperate people. They do not hand out as many hours as it requires to see the job done right and to inspire company loyalty. (Slow months, most team members only got 7-12 hours a week for MONTHS). Or they would come in and try to change how we do things, requiring that we take MUCH longer to complete out task, meaning less hours and occasional firings to save bodies. My store manager and my managers all listen to feedback and try to apply it where they can, but if cooperate demanded it, that issue will never change and there is no reaching out to them. So I love my store, but i am 100% over doing things the wrong way to please someone who has never worked our job, but makes demands on how it should be done."
good,Good entry level job with many opportunities for advancement and good people to work with. Pay could be better. Requires a lot of walking and customer service.
good,"Good job, decent pay, great culture. management cares about employees, and helps out a lot with their ""team"" on the floor. When applying, bug bug bug BUG them after by calling back for an interview. They do 2-3 interviews before hiring. I was seasonal."
good,Job is alright if you don't have an education. Also very face paced environment and competitive. Bad thing not really much opportunity to move up as every has been at the job forever as it is an good job. If you don't have an education.
good,"If you enjoy working retail, Target is not that bad of a company to work for. Yo kind of have to be a bosses pet and make sure all T' are crossed and I's are dotted in order to advance."
good,Target is a great company and taught me a lot. I have used some of the management skills I learned there in other jobs. Christmas time it got very hectic but it was still fun.
good,I really liked working at Target. Wish the job was not a temporary job. Management were nice. The job was easy & fun. I have no complaints about working at Target.
good,"store stock management, store isle management, assisting customers and advising about products if asked."
good,Great work environment and wonderful employees. I really liked working here just wish i could have been a full time employee instead of being seasonal.
good,"Target is very flexible with their hours, conveniente for college students. The benefits offered such as 401k are great. The managers work with the employee's hours. The breaks are also balanced for the lenghts of the shifts"
good,"This is an extremely fast paced position. You must be able to multitask with coworkers issues as well as guest interactions. Management is always willing to help when needed, but the expectation is that you do the majority of things alone with your own intuition."
good,Working for this business was both beneficial to me financially as well as mentally.  The team that I worked with was very professional and supported me in my work efforts and life decisions as I was attending college at the time of my employment.
good,Target corporation is excellent place to work. Target is good for begeners because requirements are very understandable and managers also very helpful
good,Target has what a young person looking for a job would want with many types of tasks positions and a bunch or useful skills that would be relevant in any environment.
good,"I was a cashier at Target on a seasonal basis.  I worked the holiday shopping craziness.  I was actually glad they didn't hire me as a permanent cashier.  The roughly two and a half months I worked there, I nearly froze to death being so close to the doors."
good,"It was a fun place to work, I like interacting with guests and helping them find what they were looking for. I was the team lead for the grocery department, but I was also leader for 1/2 of the store. Duties include to keep shelves and endcaps full and fresh."
good,target is a chill place to work. its not very hard work. you can get through a weeks worth of work without being stressed at all its a pretty easy job.
good,Target is a competitive job. target i based on performance. Target has great benefits and good salary.Target is a reliabe job 12 hours shift for three days.
good,"Good job and with balance and easy to work at."
good,Not a bad job. wasmt there enough to know about job advancement. Work life balance was normal for an overnight team member. The pay is bi-weekly and depends on the individual.
good,"Yeah its a typical retail place but as far as that goes, it was awesome working there. I really enjoyed the people and the environment. I felt like my higher ups actuallycared and tried to make my job as easy as possible"
good,I was a customer service Team Lead so. I worked with cashiers and customer service employees and encouraged them to do their best and promote the red card
good,Working at Target was a very good place there was a lot of co-workers there that were really great felt like a great place to work. Only thing was the hours since it was a part time seasonal job and just didn't really make a lot.
good,Everything at that job was acceptable but what I didn't like too much was the lack of hours I was given. While at the same time they were hiring more people.
good,"I love working here!"
good,Loved worked here and moved up into management.  Focused on the new and biggest and best items that are on trend.  Moved up to become a manger after being hired as a tm.
good,"Great fun place, best culture I had ever experienced. I departed due to another opportunity. Likely would have stayed as their was advancement opportunities, but received an offer I couldn't refuse."
good,"At work i was the cashier so i would be the last person that anyone came in contact with. I would make sure that they found everything ok and stocking the front by the registers was also apart of my job. Learned to compete with others, making customers sign up for their credit and debit cads was always a challenge. Management was ok didnt really pay attention to the workers as much as they should."
good,"slow, sometimes busy, the employess were nice but some of the managers were annoying, lunches are only 30 minutes, and they work with your schedule but dont always go with the schedule you give"
good,Great company to work at. Very face paced and busy. Not always a lot of downtime. Work together as a team. Schedule was fixed and got required hours i asked for very frequently
good,Working for Target was one of the most dedicated company's that i worked for and they was willing to work with scheduling days of for personal reasons.
good,Target is an okay Job to get started and to acquire experience for someone like me that wants more in life i had to move on. Over all the target experience is fine.
good,"target was fun , I like my store manager and my team lead when I was there gave me a lot of hours , let me stay late if I wanted to pick up a couple of more hours to earn money"
good,Great place to work . Friendly environment. Relaxed environment. Friendly co workers. Fun place to shop. Great discounts. Wish they gave more hours and had full time position.
good,"Fast paced and every day is different.  Although stressful at times, you get what you put into the company.  If temporary or career minding, Target has roles for everyone,"

good,Love this place. Fast paced enviroment. Great team members. Family atmosphere. I worked 3 12 hour  shifts and i loved my schedule. learned to how to operate 3 pallet riding lift truck and TPS lift.
good,"Worst management "
good,It was fun working at target I challenged myself everyday  on a new task how long it would take to complete it .Then i'd help the others         finish  their jobs.
good,Atmosphere was great but the upper management was sub par. Lack of discipline and they played favorites real heavy.  Couldn't advance because of the management
good,"Target was a relaxed place to work.  The team was very serious and did their job quickly and worked together as a team on a daily bases.  A typical day at Target was fast, fun, and friendly"
good,"I had a great time at Target,  loved it their,  the pay was not so good, which is why I left, after 6 months I kept asking to learn sells floor, kept getting told next week for too long, they thought I did so well on front end, they just kept me there."
good,"In a typical day you meet and deal with alot of people and situations, some of which can be very stressful. Overall great team member atmosphere. The hardest part was dealing with rude guest. The most enjoyable part was the different events and holidays celebrated with team members at target."
good,And you only get a quarter raise once per year if you're lucky.  Targets are everywhere so if you have to relocate you can usually do so and keep your job.  My biggest complaint was I worked my butt off for Mervyn's Department store which was a sister company to Target for several years until they closed all the retail stores. I then transferred to Target which was simple and easy. On my first day I was training others because I was already familiar with their system etc.  Still I could not get a raise even tho my managers agreed I deserved one.   After all them years I left still making minimum wage.
good,The employers were serious.  The employees were fun and enjoyable. The job was fast pace and a lot of lifting.  The hardest part was getting up at 3:00am in the morning and getting to work by 4:30am.
good,Very busy store at times. Usually short of staff on cashiers. Overall managers are very busy as well as ascociates trying to make sure store is up to date and in good condition.
good,I loved working at Target. I loved the guest base and the co workers. The mangemeng staff where really easy to go to if you had a problem or needed assistance. It was a fun easy going place to work.

good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with and my LOD's. I enjoyed the interaction I had with customers and my leaders. Target worked with me when I needed to adjust my hours.
good,"There were so many great aspects to working with Target. I loved the management piece, getting to work on a team, and all of the tools for professional development. I felt truly cared for when I worked for Target. However, the work hours are extremely long, you have to work weekends/holidays, and it's hard to find a work/life balance."
good,Target was a great place to learn new innovative leadership and management skills. Excellent training programs and benefits. Executives in the building are always willing to help coach.
good,"You get to meet great people and form that bond with them. Great people makes it fun to work, and we always get the job done no matter what. Its a great place to be."
good,Amazing company to be a part of. Target Inc. cares for their Team Members and encourages a great work/life balance. I would highly recommend Target to anyone looking for a great company to learn management skills.
good,Great company for new grads interested in business.  Great learning environment with plenty of opportunities.  The company if moving in a positive direction that is great for is customers
good,"Its basically an above average first job, but the atmosphere is great and the management and coworkers are awesome. No job here is hard, but with that said, few will ever move up here. They do have more room for advancement than many retail stores, but retail is difficult to make a career out of. If youre looking for a part time job, second job, or your first job, Target checks all the boxes."
good,Environment was very social and so it was fun to work in. A typical day at work was putting things on the shelves and organizing things. There wasn't really anything hard about the job.
good,the customer experienced part of the job is fun the management staff are cool and not so mean and over authorized everybody helps everybody nobody is all for themselves
good,Target Group is a dynamic working environment.  Not for the faint hearted but guaranteed to challenge a person and give an opportunity to make a real difference.
good,I've learn so much working there of the daily operations of every Department I can easily go into 1 of them and have no trouble acclimating to it from cashiering to planogram to price management receiving flexible fulfillment ship ship to store in-store pickup processing I love learning all there is to do there has so much that I've even became one of the team Trainers for the back room
good,"was a nice place to work, wish they paid more and offered overtime. everyone really tried to work as a team which was really refreshing. they always had snacks in the break room for us which was nice on busy days."

good,i had a lot of fun working there and if it wasn't for the fact i moved and had to quit and couldn't transfer to the one where i moved to i probably would still be working there
good,"A decent place to work. Supportive environment and helpful team leads, but the hectic pace of busy holiday traffic can scare most workers. Demanding pace"
good,depending on what area you work can be 8 hours a day. can be more hours or less hours. management is good. workplace was fun and and sometimes relaxing but could be stressful. hardest part of job was maintaining the floor to be clean. most enjoyable was interacting with customers.
good,"Honestly, target is a great company to work for. Its just my management is not that great.There are a lot of things that you can do to further  in the company."
good,"stock the shelves with product and help costumers with anything they need and with a smile and have friendly service, don't say that this isn't your department and find someone that can help"

good,"On any day working at Target, would check in with management to see what my daily responsibilities would be for my shift that day. Fast, fun, and friendly atmosphere. I would say hardest part of the job would have to be getting all tasks done before leaving for the day. Most enjoyable part of the job would have to be working with others well and being able to build more of a family not just a team."
good,"I overall would definitely work at target again, however i would said its some pros and cons to worker with this company i do believe they work you harder than for what they pay you."

good,I Think That this was a good experience that i had in the customer assistance feilds. Anytime that i was there to work i was either for the overnight crew or the early morning shift. Sponsorship and also that team work will make the dream work. They Were Pretty Fare With the way they trained us to work idiviually.
good,This was my first job so I enjoyed working there.  I loved working with the people in the store they made my job fun and a lot easier to do because everybody did their job.

good,"Not the Worst but Not Best, somewhat decent in everything all around. This type of job, is a retail job so there isn't much I can say, but the TEAM leads need to work on people skills regarding how they manage their workers. Positive reinforcement has been proven to work better than negative reinforcement. The pay is very competitive, a lot better than their competitors. They are willing to work with your schedule, so that's a plus. All in all, I'd say 8.5/10"
good,it was nice place to work you interact with many people. you help customers with finding what they look for and answer questions they have so if the customer is happy  your day is great

good,To unload a 54ft truck of store product and then unload everything you took off the truck and stock it on to the floor seem hard. when you start to get the hang of it then it became real easy...the overnight can take it toll on your body.

good,"Target Pharmacy was a great place to work with friendly co-workers and great customers. I quit before the CVS merger, so I am not sure of the workplace culture now."
good,Working at the time along with workers for the renovations disrupted sales potentials and other than those instances it was a quality work experience.

good,Target was awesome for the 1st 10 or so years however the last 3 years they have slipped a little. They have really cut the hours back and it is extremely difficult to maintain store conditions. Also there is huge turnover in management ranks and the replacements have little to no experience which makes it harder on the store teams. It is a little discouraging seeing the direction of the company right now. They need to maintain their experienced team members and management and get through this rough period.
good,"Some data entry, but a typical retail pharmacy. Upselling Target Red Cards, helping guests find items located in the store. An even balance of data entry/prescription filling/cashiering."
good,"great place to work each day was different as we interfaced with every sector of the business world from bankers to construction workers.

While retail can only get so good, my experience with Target has been overwhelmingly positive."
good,This company is great to work for. There are so many things that you can do here as a employee. There is room for advancement in this company. Great people that work there.
good,Everyone was pretty cool and friendly most of the time during my limited time working as a cashier there. Hardest part was just keeping up with the flow of customers during Christmas rush.

good,Target is a great place to work. Everybody is very nice to you and they treat you with respect. You have plenty of options to expand your knowledge on the different departments.
good,My history with Target started when I was in undergrad.  They worked well with my school schedule.  Enjoyed the people I worked with.  It clearly shows since I have come back twice.  The first time after undergrad was to have a part-time job while teaching and came back to have a little extra income.
good,It was a nice new expierience. I really enjoyed dealing with customers on a day to day basis. It was an open and safe environment where I was able to move at my own pace and be very productive.
good,"Target was a great job to have in my teenage and year of college days. It help to develop me and prepare me for my work days at BB&T. A typical work day, making sure cashiers were on time and a schedule was developed to ensure lunches were provided on time. Making sure customers were provided with a fast fun and friendly service. At the end of the day I had to obtain all the money from each register and take to cash room."
good,"This was my first taste of the working world as a young man. It was only a role i took while securing my apprenticeship, but none the less taught me customer service skills, and cash handling abilities. The culture was that of a normal retail industry, and the were no bad parts of the role, the work was fair as were the hours and pay."
good,it was ok I worked during the holiday season other employee were not friendly and kind of standoffish not welcoming and gave lots of meanial tasks to pass time

good,In target I was always greeting our costumers and making sure they felt welcomed. I kept my station cleaned at al time and if something was out of place I would put it in its right place. I counted money and made sure to give the right amount of change back.
good,"Every work day was fast paced filling stock and helping customers out with issues "
good,Target was a fun place to work as the culture is very knitted. Their is opportunity of advancement and growth as long as you want. I enjoyed working here in my early 20's.
good,"There were a couple times when I would come in as a shopper and be asked to work, and then there were times I was asked to come in early for signs and tagging, but the pay amount for that role was higher and I was compensated at my regular, lower, rate of pay. Otherwise the only flaws I found within the Target were within the people themselves- the job is so finely tuned and team oriented however, that people ended up being generally realistic about issues in the end. They allow colored hair, tattoos and piercings. The customers were generally very happy or very mad. Taking the time to help one person at a time to the full extent is great- but ensure that attention provided is equal to all customers, regardless of any biases you may have."
good,Management was well organized and the expectations were clear. They worked well with me while I trained. I hear that they don't like to hire from within when filling management positions to prevent their employees from being treated equally.
good,"For a Female this was a hard job to do , they would make you unload trailers, and do stuff guys wont even do ! "
good,I loved working for Target. It's a great company to work for. There's plenty of room for advancement. The time i worked for them i learned a lot. I learned how to be patient and how to listen to people. Also they work with your schedule which is a plus if you go to school!
good,"A typical day at work has changed, as the Instocks process continually does. Now, assuming all responsibilities of work haven't been completed once I've arrived, I scan through the task list. Once finished, I stock the shelves with the product from the back room. I learned to better focus on the quality of work I do as well as understand the purpose of my job; doing the best I can of lessening the stress of the guests and creating the best experience they can have while shopping. Management has changed often while I have worked there. It can be difficult at times when you and the management aren't on the same track but you learn to do what you feel is best for the store. Workplace culture is great amongst coworkers. Many of us have great relationships outside of work. The hardest part of the job isn't necessarily a physical reason in that the work isn't hard. More so, it centers on seeing other workers not having the same expectations of a great work ethic being put onto them. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing the quality of work that I am doing to help make the consumers/guests job easier"
good,It is good place to learn retail business flow and also got the knowledge on supply chain management and it is friendly working culture and got a chance to work in real time retail process.
good,"A typical day at work is being a cashier theres no hard part to it , people come to your register you ring them up take payments in exchange for merchandise "

good,"Everyone who works at Target is friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, they started cutting down on my hours. I started with 25 hours per week, most recently have only been working 9 hours a week."
good,"None I don't have nothing to said about target , I'm just looking for better opportunities.i need more hours , not too many hours are going to current employees I like my job but need more hours"
good,There is a lot of work to be done in a small amount of time but as long as you do what you are suppose to and are not afraid to ask for help then everything will run smoothly.
good,Great company to work with wether out of school or needing a change as an adult. Very team oriented and very kind people overall. Really enjoyed the time spent with the team.

good,"No complaints, the work environment was solid. staff was nice. learned allot from my boss. The most enjoyable part about the job was helping the customers."
good,"This job is great for college students because they work with your school schedule, however your mileage may vary. Work is simple, help people find things, and bring items on the shelves forward (if you're a hardlines employee.)"
good,"The job is straightforward and it takes a backbone to do. If you don't mind repetition it is not a bad job, but there is stressful elements. You are expected to treat the job with a lot of respect, whether you are or not treated in the same way."
good,"One of the top optimal retail stores for customer service, meeting people, learning new stories and working in a great environment. Would stay there forever if the pay was more competitive and easier to compensate with."
good,"Good place to work at! The managers care to help you out and teach you about working in a retail environment, met great employees, they pay well and are a clean company."
good,"Great team members. Upbeat work environment. Flexible hours. Good pay and discounts. Friendly people. Very open, progressive and excepting co-workers."

I've learned a great deal working at target from making sure the guest is a priority to developing a guest-friendly atmosphere within target. Management did their due diligence in making sure the team members were informed and taken care of. The atmosphere in target has always been great. Management as well as my fellow team members always worked in accord to make sure the guests have everything at their disposals. My job was not difficult at all, in fact I enjoyed working for target. The one thing I enjoyed the most while working at target was being rewarded for the work that I as well as the team members put in. It boosts our morale as a team and helps to create a jubilant working atmosphere."

You know, the usual. What I can say though is that if you get along with your co-workers, do your job well, and stick with it, you'd be surprised at your pay increases and how many hours they give you. It's a soul draining retail job, but if you can beat the stigma of that, it's amazing for college students looking for their first job. Plus, if you do well, you're free to move from department to department if you get approved for it!"

Our boss was good till after working there for some time he kinda changed and threatened mine and a fellow employee's job there because it was slow and we were not selling as much.The insurance is a joke, if you work for Target mobile do not get the insurance, they take $300 from you every month and then when you need them to pay for anything they won't."

good,"Being a cashier was fun and exciting. Sometimes there would be alot of people there sometimes no one.  The people I worked with were cool. I would get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch."
good,Great company to get started with retail work. Awesome culture and great discounts on merchandise. Can be difficult to reach or maintian full time hours.

good,"Often times work days consist of constant work for up to 4 hours straight where you get to interact with many personalities while still having to maintain a quick tempo as you are put under pressure by many customers checking out. It is balanced out by great management however, who are quick to help and interact well with staff and customers."
good,it was kind of slow and it sucks i was fired from seasonal without and notice at all but as far as the actual job and people went it was a really chill work environment. not to mention the pay is awesome for a young person
good,It was a good company to work for I enjoyed the team mates an working with them made a lot of lifetime friends management always treated team mates fair hardest thing about my job was finding a mistake when things didn't balance but always managed to find it I enjoyed my job because I worked alone an was not bothered by anyone it was very nice
good,Target is a great store the quality of the clothes and everything in there is just great. A lot of the team members are really nice and a select few of those who are over us.

good,"Of all the Walmart stores in the CSRA, of which there are quite a few, this is probably the best organized and maintained. So with that said the checkout being the reason I refuse to rate 5 stars, I shop here 2-3 times a week, I've never seen enough checkouts open to handle the heavy shopping periods. Clearly the store has more than enough employees, but time and time again lines stretch beyond department after department."
good,"Working at target was quite an experience. It allowed me to gather manager experience and a great amount of friends. I learned a lot about myself while working at target along with that, I learned what exactly how important balance is."

good,"I enjoyed working at target. The management was fairly friendly, enjoyed working with my team members. Great hours for part-time employees.  My experience wasn't as bad as some of the others I've read about. I was cross-trained in many different areas which I like in a job. Some of the managers though could use some serious lessons on being managers and the proper way to handle their employees."
good,Target has a good work day flow. Lots of management supervision and working directly with other coworkers. Does not supply lunch or food. Its a good team work job.
good,Checked out customers and made sure they found everything they were looking for at our store sometimes I worked over and made sure the store was clean and ready to go for the next day

good,"A typical day at Target as a TPS specialist (security guard/prevention) is very busy, monitoring employees and customers at all times. I've learned that there are many dishonest individuals in the world, people steal for no reason and quite frequently. My manager at Target was great, he was a prior active duty Marine as i'm a veteran as well. The culture at Target was diverse, my co-workers were different walks of life. The hardest part of my job was apprehending shop lifters. The most enjoyable part of my time was ensuring my co-workers and customers were safe while working/shopping at Target."
good,I would say that Target is an easy job for the most part and there is rarely a time that the stress level is noticeable. I would say that for the level of responsibility the pay is more than adequate.

The hardest part of my job was folding the clothes tables and immediate a customer turns it upside down. The most enjoyable part of my job was working overnight filling the floor, while customers were not present. We were able to talk and laugh. This made the shift run faster."
good,good place to work. it was a good part time good . offered lots of perks. i would work there agin for sure. they give you free food. and they make it cool
good,"Worked here in between semesters at college. The people I worked with made it enjoyable. Target focuses on cultivating a team environment. Often gave small thank yous during the holiday season. Some days, meals might be catered throughout the day. Hardest part is balancing store maintenance and guest service during the holiday season, especially if short staffed. Most enjoyable part of the job is the team culture."

good,"A typical day at work consist of interacting with guest, completing whatever the task is for the day. I learned how to operate some machinery in the back room which was used to stock selves. The workplace was very organized which made it easier to complete task without so much hassle. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the rude guest who would give you a hard time just to do it, but always handle yourself professionally."
good,"I tried so hard to transfer to another area with this store but i ended up not getting accepted after calling both stores to try and get my transfer information sent over. The Target i worked at was pretty good, good hours, good people and it was overnight which wasnt to bad at all."
good,"A great job , just a lot of stress at times. Get to learn a little bit of everything , you not just in one department but in all . Where you get to build your expirence better ."
good,"Target is a great place to work. I like the working environment, but there aren't enough hours. I've been working there for quite some time now and it's great. I have a  good team to work with."
good,"At Target the day would start by clocking in, then head out to the sales floor to the grocery department. Get caught up to speed by morning person, check pulls, run pulls and stock shelves before zoning. Management varied, some were helpful, others were not. Culture was really broad. Hardest part was catching back up on sales floor after leaving sales floor to back up check lanes. Most enjoyable part was opening the store."
good,Very nice job to have... if you like retail this is a good place to be... good opportunities to advance... But only so far without a degree...........

good,"Contract role responsible for building out regression scripts for store scanners."
good,"Hours might seem long and work might seem a lot but you will be mentally satisfied and relaxed. Management takes good care of its assistant managers (ETLs). Everyone is eager to promote you and develop you, gives you more opportunities. I miss working at Target and miss my Boss, he was more of a trusted friend than a boss. We worked when we had to and we chilled and enjoyed the time off. "
good,"As long as the management team is positive, friendly, and ethical Target is a great place to work especially for students. For full time employees target is great about promoting the people who are interested and hard-working."

good,"At Target there is always new things to learn and challenges to overcome. I can definitely say that i feel more comfortable helping customers and other employees. My managers always give me opportunities to learn new things, and always offer to help."
good,I learned a lot about working in stores. I was able to learn more about customer service. I was also able to learn more about working. I also learned about merchandising.

good,"A work day at target included running guest services by returning items for guests, helping sign guest up for target red cards, and answering any questions the guests had.

good,"I typically stock items on shelves, and process payments, i am responsible for keeping the store tidy, and associating with customers, the management is good, and the most enjoyable part is communicating with customers."
good,"Target is company of very talented employees and sharp management.  Lots of new project and learning to be had.  The hardest part of the job was the approval process, but good decisions were generally made."
good,"This was my second job and I loved it. Although I was looking for more money to better my future, so I could go to school and get a degree. I would recommend this job to anybody."
good,productive work place it is what you make of it.you have to be a people person to work here because you often will help up to 30-50 people a day.great pay for a starter job.
good,This is a great job for high school students but not as a full-time job. The sales floor can be so overwhelming when there aren't enough people working or when there is a busy rush.
good,I enjoyed working at target. it was a fun environment and had great management. They cared about the front line employees by constantly having contest and other fun filled days.
good,Target has high expectations of their Operations Managers. Not only are you responsible for your daily task you also have to focus on Continuous Improvement which is what most companies would hire an Industrial Engineer to come in and take cycle times. As an Operations Manager you are expected to take on many task and if you do not finish your tasks at the end of the day you are required to work off your shift to complete everything.
good,The job was good. Soft lines was the most boring position I could have picked. Very repetitive. Lots of long hours on your feet. The employees were so-so.  Didn't have a problem with management.
good,"Overall a good job to have. Reliable paychecks every 2 weeks, decent amount too. The job itself is great, the managers tend to fluctuate but your coworkers will be amazing consistently."
good,"Supervisor over 12 lanes, customer service, and food avenue.  Cash prep, inventory, cash office.  To assist my team in anyway possibly making sure they have a stress free work environment"
good,A typical day at Target was to set up for the section half hour before work starts. What i have learned from working here is my public speaking got better. My people skills excelled. What i enjoy the most out of working here is seeing a smile on every customers face after helping them with everything they were looking for.
good,"very fun "
good,Target Apple Valley has gotten a few new managers into their system that make working there easy.  I have found my niche and they are allowing me to grow in that area.
good,"I liked working with the other employees, upper management was a little too much for me. I did learn a lot while working there, I would work there again."
good,Helping customers finding there merchandise and stocking merchandise in alleys and some time helping custumers taking there merchandise to there  cars
good,Target is a Great place to work. I will recommend a friend or family member. Target has provided me the experiences that I need to help me better my future.
good,"Easy to learn, easy to work on a day to day basis. Loved getting to know everyone. I would recommend to anyone looking for a part time job. Easy to cross train."
good,"Engaged in daily duties"
good,"I liked working at Target. I loved my coworkers. The job wasn't too hard or stressful most of the time. When I first started, I didn't mind the management but over time they became more and more demanding. They expect way too much of their employees."
good,Its a team work environment that is super fun. But I feel that sometimes they ask your opinion to make it look fair but they make their own decisions in complete reguards to the feed back
good,Target was a great place for me to work and i learned a lot working there ...i learned to drive forklifts i learn to work in a fast pace enviromentand my only reason for leaving was me moving out of state
good,"Bad thing first: with the job I personally had, any hours on the schedule were subject to change based on the size of the truck each day. Sometimes, this meant we went home two or more hours early. Sometimes, this meant we were asked to stay two or more hours late. It was completely unpredictable outside of holiday season, when it was consistently 'please stay late.'"
good,a great learning experince in the retail business world and a good foothold in other areas like cosmetics warehouse work and grocery stores with dairy and produce
good,A good place to work if you're a college student or high school student. Pay is pretty good and training is pretty adequate. Not much hope for movement based off of performance.
good,"We had a slogan about being fast, fun, and friendly and I thought it would be just that. However, the managers are commited to making the enviroment like that a reality. Sure the job doesn't offer the best benifits, the pay is lower because of the turn over rate, and advancement there is hard and very limiting, but the enviroment makes up for it. Combo that with very flexible hours and you have yourself a good work place. "
good,"Target is a great place to work, it empowers its employees to work creatively and take accountability of the projects. Leadership has clear plans to take the company forward and ensures that all the levels are aligned to its vision"
good,Good pay decent people and they don't mind about tattoos or piercings so its generally a cool place to work and pay higher than minimum wage so that's a plus
good,Target is a great corporation with many opportunities to excel. They have a great stocking procedure and keeps locations up to date and pricing is very competitive to other department stores
good,"It was fun working there. I worked there seasonal so it was a lot going on, but it was still fun. The good part was the days hours did go by fast. It was a nice experience."
good,Really good place learn a ton about customer concerns as well with working with other people in general. Really love the teamwork and getting to know people and also flexible with shifts.

good,"Enjoyed working at Target the professionalism, and great work environment. Utilized great customer service skills, and good communication skills. This was a company that allowed me to grow and learn new skills."
good,"Target team members perform a variety of job duties throughout department store locations. Typical work days include greeting customers, stocking shelves, organizing displays, taking inventory, and assisting in sales. Many crew members with Target serve as cashiers, as well. Target team member jobs may involve heavy lifting and working on foot for long periods of time. Holiday shopping seasons may create hectic and demanding work environments at times. Applicants with customer service experience may gain preferential treatment during the Target hiring process; however, crew member jobs typically require no previous experience."
good,This was my first job and for what it was I was happy.  I had good and understanding managers.  The environment was great and the job wasn't difficult.
good,Enjoyed my duties and responsibilities if being a team leader.  I liked expounding my leadership skills. I was proud to be responsible for the performance of other employees.
good,Loves working here besides the mean day to day Customer this is and overall great place to work really great for teens and  summer jobs ..Only com was it was really far from where I lived
good,"For me, I enjoyed a lot by woking there. the have a great team and manager. The gave me more houses than other places. I have the chance to help gest directly. it is a big store have a lot of sections to learn. I learned a lot by organizing as a seals floor. I liked the star blocks to make me sit there on my break. their makeup section is amazing. and the cartwheel app gave me great offers and discount to shop from there."
good,Working at target was a great experience for me . I enjoyed my time at target. I was hired temporarily and they decided to keep me full time the only reason I had to give a notice of resignation was transportation
good,clock in and set up station making sure everything that is need for the day. I have learned that I am a team player. I enjoyed my job. The hardest part of the job is to know when to stop.
good,I like working for Target. I enjoyed what I did there.I missed a lot of the people that I managed and guests at target. I will love to get back in there.
good,"Awesome place to work, and if you are a hard worker it's easy to move up in the ranks. But after my recent starting pay I have now at a clothing store, the starting pay at Target sucks."
good,"At a typical day at work I stocked shelves, greeted customers, and zoned. Zoning took up most of the time because I worked mostly nights. The management there was very friendly. The workplace culture was great. Everyone was very friendly towards me. There were no hard parts of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was zoning and getting help from coworkers at the end of the night."
good,"My first experience was the whole recruitment process and i felt really good, lot of emphasis given on personal development and it actually happens."
good,Target is outsourcing there operations to Verizon. They want all of the Network team members to learn coding. I enjoy what I do and would like to continue doing operations. This is why I am looking elsewhere.
good,This was a great job & they make sure you're taken care of. They feed there employees on certain days. They make sure you're comfortable. It's a great environment & I had a great experience working there.
good,"With the current state of retail and the challenges facing stores with the explosion of online sales Target is in a constant race to change to the new market. While retail is a great place with (for the most part) great guest experiences it can cause difficulty in having a great work life balance. With the constant changes in order to run an efficient process one must be able to be extremely flexible. Any manager at Target works every other weekend with one day off in the week. Stores can be made or broken by one manager because of the reliance on every manager needing to be the ""Leader on Duty"" (the person running the store for a certain period of time. Depending on the position in your store you will never have a steady schedule because of the need for rotating closes to covering hourly leaders in the store."
good,I have worked several retail jobs in the past 14 years and I feel like this is the best one yet. I feel like hard work is actually noticed and it's easy to advance within the company.
good,"Pulling items from the backroom for stocking on the sales floor."
good,"I learned to share my own values and culture with all my coworkers."
good,I worked softlines/cashier. Folding clothes. Putting up restock and being a back up cashier. Most of the time i was on the floor assisting customers find items.
good,typical night at work would be stocking and unloading trucks.managers were great and i also loved mh co workers. wish i was able to stay there but i ended up moving over an hour away.
good,I unloaded and loaded freight properly  and organized the production in a orderly fashion in the limited amount of time offered and stock the materials in a coded format
good,"good company to work at, was a seasonal job, always stayed late at work to help with go back around christmas, i enjoyed working with my co-worker everyday."
good,Good work environment with good people. flexible work hours and days to roster. able to work  in different departments and learn new skills. great for all agaes
good,"Working seasonal at Target made me realize how busy stores can get. It also provided me a chance to work in a fast-paced environment,assist customers needs , and overall keep our are clean at all times."
good,"A typical day at work consists of providing fast, friendly, and fun services at the checkout counter. The pay was good and we got raises often. The managers were easy to talk to if there were any problems."
good,"Getting a job with Target was one of the best things that happened to me. I truly loved working for this company they treat there employees with nothing but respect. Unlike a lot of companys u are not considered just a body, u are considered and treated as a person.  My ability to have customers sign up for red cards for a 5% discount was well above average I am able to relate well with customers I always am able to discuss things with customers and strive to make the company better My customers always came back and usually to my checkout."
good,"It was a greet place to work. It felt like family than worker. It was a positive, friendly work place. I enjoyed learning new things such as, cooking, doing inventory, and serving."
good,"When I would open I would check my department to see what signs may be missing or pegs for items. Check to see that the areas that need to recover was recovered. Overall I enjoyed working here, but it took one bad manager to push me to far and make me feel undervalued as a team member as well as a person to make me quit."
good,good work environment. Good co workers. work place is very nice. hard work. Good week end parties and nice work location. Very hard to clear the interview and all the latest technologies are used in Target
good,Amazing person pole to work with and an outstanding environment. It was great to get to see everyone with the guest and how respectful everyone was told each other
good,"As a part time worker at Target I experienced very little stress and a far mount of reward especially for a retail job. Customers were fairly polite (with the select exception) and eager to listen to advice I was able to provide them. Management was another story, as the specific supervisor I worked under was a nightmare. This supervisor was often verbally abusive to employees and caused a lot of workplace drama that damaged workplace morale.Aside from that, this job was not especially stressful or draining. Target's diversity policies are very progressive and protects employees against racist, sexist and discriminatory behavior from both employees and guests alike."
good,"I learned to deal with alot of different people attitudes, i enjoyed my team members and team leaders we had great laughs and got the work done it was never a hard part at the job."
good,"If you want to work with a team that takes care of people first, these guys do and make sure that success blends in with people and work skills. As a team member for one and half years, the managers, hr, ad team members have always got your backs whenever you need to prepare for finals or midterms."
good,Target was a great place to work for. The management was good. Target was flexible with the hours. The team members are acknowledgeable. Great pharmacy.
good,starting off at target was tough at first but i learned alot and got hired on full time they have alot of good benifits they started me off at $15.85 an hour and i met alot of good people to work with while i was employed by them .
good,"I Unloaded and Loaded 3,000 piece trucks stocked backlog as well as on the floor merchandise..I was also in charge of sanitation for my area. I also worked as a cashier"
good,"It's not a hard job but it is a busy one. There's always a lot to do during the day, but both the management and other team members are nice for the most part. If you're flexible you can be cross-trained in other departments so that can help keep things fresh. Scheduling can be strange at times, sometimes giving only 4 hours on one day and the full 8 on others. Wish they paid better."
good,target's work was a great experience in team oriented experience and guidelines of what time effort and keeping track of your performance by stats are great.
good,"I learned how to do customer service and stocking the back warehouse with devices called PDA's. I worked on black Fridays and big events so I sold the most items during those times. Management was okay. The only problem were the unnecessary new hires and violation of  our schedule agreement of my seasonal work. The hardest part of the job were keeping up with guest and pack away our stocks from the back of the store. Though, the job was very memorable throughout the duration."
good,In a typical day at work I clock in then proceed to the backroom and pull pallets to the floor. After I will begin to push out each pallet with a team member. During this time I learned how to operate jacks how to efficiently stock shelves and how to use a mi-device. The management were very professional and provided answers for any questions I had. The culture was very diverse and welcoming. I believe the hardest part of the job was stocking high shelves and adapting to waking up at an earlier time. the most enjoyable part was working with such a diverse of people.
good,Everyone is very friendly and helpful. It is easy to move between stations and get training for new things if you'd like to. They are always accommodating when you have to take off work and are usually able to give more hours if you need them.
good,"Came into work, took back items that needed to be put back on the shelves in my assigned area and then scanned each isle for items that didn't belong in the area I worked in."
good,"very fun, family like store / company to work for. Everyone from management to support team member were very friendly and helping when it came to service or helping the customers. They were great with making you feel comfortable and were all about promoting from within."
good,"Overnight stocking for awhile then I got moved on to doing the floors. Worked here for little over a year. Enjoyed the most part, unloading trucks , lifting 50lbs and over ."
good,"Its been a while since I have worked at Target, but while I was there they did their best to make the environment fun, energetic and character building.  They wanted your best and helped you feel your best.  It was difficult leaving Target when I did, and would love to work for the again."
good,Great place to work. Work life balance and benefits. Open culture  - HR and management is always pro employee and friendly. . Especially great for women due to its diversity policies and gender inclusive culture.
good,"I enjoyed my 2 years with Target but was offered a state government job that paid much more so I left the company.  Training was thorough and I was promoted fairly during my time with them.  I learned about sales auditing and counting cash and preparing bank deposits.  I also worked in the jewelry counter and the stockroom so I learned all aspects of the company.  Before I left, I was being trained for Personnel and was interviewing new hires.  The company was very fair to me and I learned valuable skills."
good,"Secured the location.patrolled many areas..protect the visitors,,apprehended shoplifters.tense and fun place to work..managers were professional teams"
good,This job taught me a lot more about customer service. The team i worked with always made you feel safe to come to work and always had a good aditude towards us all.
good,"The overall team you get to work with at Target is uniquely positive and fun group.  Expect leaders overall to be in mid twenties to mid thirties.  If you are out of this age group you will be in the minority.  Work days are jam packed and you never leave feeling you accomplished anything because there is so much left to still be done.  "
good,"Target is one the best company one can work. it gives the employee job satisfaction and the work culture is ultimate."
good,I was working at the target warehouse. There was a very specific way of doing things. Anything that you were doing for any day anything you came across you had to follow the right way to take care of the problem yourself. It gave me more independence and more of a need to understand what I was doing and doing the task the right way. I had to leave the job because I was pregnant.
good,"I transferred in the company from one state to another, so I have seen the business operate in two different ways. My first location took pride in each individuals success and we all worked as a team to resolve issues as quickly as possible. My second location was a smaller store, but lacked necessary team effort from a few of the managers and coworkers. Physical changes were always taken place to accommodate product, but made things a little more challenging with work space. As for both locations. every team member that comes in is always friendly and helpful and team effort was always outstanding."
good,"The company provides Fast,Fun and Friendly environment.This was my start up company where I had learnt most of the manual testing processes and automation stuff as well.Worked on waterfall as well as agile methodologies.Provided online and classroom trainings to update the technical and soft skills.The work culture was friendly and flexible."
good,I think this place is a great way to start off I started working here right when I turned the age of 16 and I still like it here but I want to move on big and better things now and adventure different places to show my skills!
good,"At Target, it is important that customers have a fast, fun, and friendly shopping experience. As a sales floor associate, it was also important I ensure that customers' needs are met by answering questions concerning different products offered by Target."

good,Everybody works like a team and a fun place to work and very flexible with the schedule and manage the place good and always given opportunities for other positions
good,"My typical day at target i always got there 5min early. What i've learned as a backroom team member is its a team job not a one man job. the hardest part was the first couple of days starting the job trying to figure out where everything was at and using the equipment."
good,"Target has many places you can work , there are lot of jobs you can do.But you might be expected to work a lot of different areas of the store.Target is great for part time people but it is no longer great for full time people ."
good,As an Asset Protection Specialist you get to have fun while catching shoplifters. I would come into work one day looking like a high school student and the next like a teacher. The company is amazing. I love management and the hardest part was blending in from the locals.
good,Sometimes there was nothing to ship and all there was to do in the back room was back stocking. If you enjoy not being around people then this is the perfect position for you.
good,"As far as part time work is concerned, Target is a tremendous way to go with plenty of ways to pick up hours where needed. However, the room for growth is advertised as open but in reality is arduous and bureaucratic. Some districts will allow you to reach promotions within a year of work, as long as you put in the effort. Where-as others will see you never get past Team Leader. Weird rules, if you work for target you cannot reapply after you complete a degree for an ETL position, you must leave the company then reapply."
good,Very physical but not too difficult. Make you want to succeed. Good leadership. Very flexible on work life balance. Raises are not too great but there's room to move around and learn new skills
good,"On a typical morning there would be a truck to unload. After that was done everyone would be sent to the floor to stock the items. I was in charge of controlling the bailer and the trash. The hardest part was how hot it gets inside of that truck, with the task of getting it done in a hour. I enjoyed the employees that I worked with"
good,Busy community throughout the day and I learned to communicate with customers by listening to well performed managers. Target was a fun enjoyable job meeting new people.
good,"A typical day at work is normally productive. I have learned better people skills. Target management is very organized. The workplace culture at Target is very joyful, everyone knows their job duties."
good,"Was assigned as part-time position in retail cash register task and pre-package meat sales. While I was there, I had wonderful management staff that would help you grow and develop, as well as help work around my schedule for my college courses. I really enjoined the staff and management as well as the skill I learned from them. Unfortunately, will I was put in charge of the pre-package meat locker and meat disposal I would frequently become ill after a few days in the department, resulting in me leaving the company for a better outlook."
good,"Not enough people were hired and hours were always taken because the store wasn't making enough money.The non management like myself couldn't get enough hours to pay bill. I worked at the Target Cafe and I served pizzas, pastas, and other assorted foods. The management team was good and understanding to your needs.The hardest part of the job was people showing up to work. The enjoyable part was my coworkers that's what made the job fun."
good,"Target Distribution Services is a great place to work.  A typical day of work consisted of packing sub packs of products into overpack boxes that were bound for shelves of Target retail stores.  The process changed daily because there were two different sides to the job: hardlines and softlines.  Hardlines include things such as durable, hard goods like skillets, weights, consumables like beauty aid products and seasonal food items.  Softline items included things such as sheets, pillowcases, shoes jeans, bras and t-shirts."
good,Management was not always easy to talk to. I do not recommend working in the Fayetteville nc Store. It is not the most friendly place to work at.
good,Though fast paced at times was very enjoyable place to work. Learned lots of skills in a short amount of time. Managment was some of the best people i have worked with and allowed me flexibility as far as my work schedule.
good,"A good first job to have, gaining experience in all sorts of areas, as well as developing patience with guests. One of the highest paying retail jobs so snatch it up if you are paying for school. The benefits are very nice."
good,"Typical day at work,very easy ongoing"
good,"Working at Target taught me how to engage customers with energy and enthusiasm. Everyday I would punch in, look at my schedule, then go to my designated lane, I would greet guests, scan and bag their items, try to sell red cards, and they would be on their way, and I also kept my lane clean. That was my typical work day at Target."
good,"Target did not seem like it was going to be the best job, however it turned to be the opposite. Everyone at Target was accepting and willing to work with me. It is a great environment. It fit me well and I was lucky to find such a wonderful company."
good,"My day started early in the morning. My team mates and I started separating the boxes to their respective areas. Shoes, the clothes that goes in the racks, the clothes that goes in the tables. Then by 8:00 am we had to start taking the clothes to their areas. By 12:30 pm I was out."
good,Fun and stressfull but a good place to start to learn your first things about how a job functions. Thaught me how ti first sell credit cards or debit cards

good,Good corporate assistance with everday challenges and a company that's knows how to move large quantities of merchandise at a high-paced level. Very positive team atmosphere.
good,"A typical day would be for me to get merchandise from the back room, stocking shelves. i enjoyed meeting the new people and helping them."
good,"Great environment to work in, fast pace type of job, early mornings. I enjoyed stocking and lifting boxes. This job was the hardest in the morning, by just getting the truck unloaded and most enjoyable part was just getting finished with the truck."
good,Great job just the pay for being a assistant manger was to low  they have great customer service very patient they take guest service very serious alway willing to help one another out
good,"This was a great job and it taught me new lessons, skills, and experiences I will add to future jobs. A typical day at work started off with unloading the truck. Then after other co-workers distributed the supplies to the correct places in the store, other employees and myself would start to stock the shelves. Everyone there was very friendly and nice, and if I had ever needed help there was always someone to come assist me. The management was really good they would give us props when we were doing a great job."

good,I love that place. I can't complain at all they're fun loving people in there. There's a positive attitude in the air at all times. I would definitely recommend this job to someone
good,While working as an outbound team member i had to endure the most labor intense job of all in the distrabution center. Ten hour shifts four days a week. I would have anywhere from seven to fifteen trailer trucks that i was personally responsible for. This was one of the most fast paced jobs Ive ever worked behind finishing cocrete.
good,"Great team work allowed for us to accomplish tasks in a fast and efficient manner, helping guests in the best way possible and just overall great work environment"
good,This was a great part time job while going to school. It did not pay very well but it was good for a part time position.  There is not much more to write about this job due to the fact that it was part time

good,"There's a reason why those three words in the summary are Target's Modus Operandi. The people of Target strive to be a happy, and energetic place. Sometimes things might get frantic, but otherwise, you're going to find yourself having a great experience with social co-workers. As a Cart Attendant, my day started off right away. I had an organized list of things to do, and I'd cycle through the list over and over making sure the store was running smoothly. The managers and the co-workers were some of the nicest people I've ever worked with. And granted, sometimes there'd be stress, but that can be said anyhwere really."
good,A overall good first job for work experience. A great place to work on your communication skills. I got pretty good hours there working part time and full time
good,"My time as an Executive Team Leader Intern at the Tacoma Target store was a really transformative experience. I learned what it took to be successful in the world of management and in what areas I was lacking. As a consequence, I have become much more ambitious, professional, and motivated to be successful. As a Managerial Intern, I participated in managerial meetings, scored the performance of employees, and organized the work-related efforts of a team of diverse employees in the pursuit of departmental goals. A normal day consisted of me supervising the ""soft lines"" department, soft line employees, and writing daily reports for my fellow managers. My fellow managers were all welcoming and willing to help address any concerns I had as I learned the ropes. I had a great mentor guide and counsel me over the course of my internship. She embodied the positive radiance and industry of Target's organizational culture. The hardest part of the job was having to occasionally report to work at 4am. I would often still feel fairly groggy even after I made it to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being surrounded by a diverse set of employees and managers who all had a special function that somehow kept the large Target store running."
good,"This job has taught me very valuable lessons when it comes to not only work experiences but life experiences. Starting off as a seasonal cashier and now a front end supervisor pulled me in many different directions. It has taught me management skills which I did not have before. Although it has its struggles, this job teaches me new things everyday."

good,It's nothing like working at Wal-Mart but target is more better to me as a company and they look out for there people if we are busy at target whoever on the floor would have to go help out in the front no long line or wait like Wal-Mart. That why I see why a lot of people would go to target before they would go to Wal-Mart but I love target fun place to work for.

good,"We would meet up in the back of the warehouse, next to the loadings docks to get in early morning exercises to loosen the muscles, before unloading the boxed materials off the back of the trucks on the conveyers properly so that the lasers could scan and tag it and be shipped to the proper store. Some of the other workers were either cool or not, Management sat back and would watch at times to see how everyone's performance is going and if its improving, checking over notes, occasionally come over and help if and when needed. I would have to say the hardest part was getting so many on the conveyers at one time and spaced out even as well, but the most enjoyable part getting to meet new people."

I learned how to work under pressure and with a team, I also learned time management and how to talk to guest. Halfway through my first year management was changed. They weren't too bad, but as the year went on they started to have trouble with complying with my school schedule which really impacted how often I was able to work. There wasn't really a ""hard part"" per say. Everything was easy once learned. The most enjoyable part of the job was really the people that I worked with.

good,"Working at Target was a new adventure every day. It was awesome to work with a team that became like family very quickly, sharing opinions and ideas and improvements that could be made to our team. Although it was always crazy busy, the managers in charge of the store made each work day fun and spontaneous with surprise snacks or impromptu meetings just to see how everyone was doing. The most important thing I learned was what true customer service is, and how to treat every customer like they are special and take the time to give them the best experience I possible could. I also learned valuable skills such as using multi-line phone systems and transferring calls. The main difficult thing working at Target was the erratic scheduling, working until 11pm one night and coming back in to work at 6am the next morning. My schedule was never set, always changing from one week to another. Also, I never got the hours that I asked for or was promised."

The hardest part of the job would be dealing with difficult customers who wouldn't accept some of our prices or rules concerning coupons, but the most enjoyable part was dealing with them as well! I have lots of wonderful stories and have met many wonderful people."
good,"If you are looking for a place to work it's alright.  It's good for short term unless you get promoted quickly then it's great long term.  The people you work with are probably the best part of working there.  The ETL's vary from store to store on the basis of working with them. The hours are mediocre pending on what time of the year it is, also may vary from week to week.  You may get 35 hrs one week but 20 hrs the next."
good,I loved working at target. It was a great environment and had a blast with my co-workers and the customers were always great. I enjoyed helping them pick things out and they asked for opinions.
good,Great place to work. Lots of standard procedures to help you know how to meet company guidelines and thresholds. Good people and leadership.
good,"My overnight crew was no nonsense, just like I like it, you come to work TO WORK, not to socialize. We'd come in get out numbers for the night & get to it & push through till we were done & then clean up for the day crew. Biggest challenge was Black Friday week every year, had lots of overtime but it was worth it because our numbers were great & it felt good."
good,"If you're looking for a starter job, or a place where you can make a good amount of pay a day, this is the place for you"

good,one of the team leader on the flow team had it in for me and i don't know why some say i was because i was a women and straight and others say i was white but who know the truth i did nothing to the person and i was baffled just like my could-worker and friends.
good,"Working at Target was the first time I truly felt like I was part of a team. We knew each other well and helped without having to be asked. We had frequent ""huddles"" in which several team members and a few managers would gather to exchange information about the store's operations, how to handle a possible rush of customers, or any other important matter that needed to be discussed. My only complaint is the grading system used on the registers. It would rate a cashier's performance on each transaction for the purpose of encouraging improvement of efficiency. However, the rating was either G or R, meaning Green for good and Red for bad. There was no middle ground. Sometimes, a transaction that went slowly was not the fault of the cashier, but a customer who may not have had their money ready or had a question or two."
good,"It's a retail job, so if you've ever worked here, you know what to expect. Management is generally pretty good. HR is great about helping you."
good,"Positive work environment, and friendly management. I learned how to work as a team player. On a typical day it was very busy and rewarding."
good,Target's key to success is their training culture.  Training of the team helped us provide all guest needs  thru knowledgeable team members..  The best part of the job is having a guest tell you they had a great shopping experience and our team helped them through a smooth purchase. Our job was to ensure we had the product and services guest wanted as well as a speedy checkout.
good,Great place to work. Target is always moving forward and looking for new and better ways to operate. Employees are friendly and make working there fun.
good,"-pick up machine, drive to a walmart, find from anywhere between 400-1000 items , input their prices,and any kind of sale on a product, that I knew Target sold as well."
good,"Target is really a great company to work for, especially if you're just starting out and looking for a position with upward momentum. They encourage positive team member culture and typically the relationship between upper management and team members is very friendly and respectful. However, it is still retail and different times of the year (Christmas, Back-to-School, etc.) can be very demanding and stressful, but you are compensated above your normal salary at those times. Management also seems to turn over fairly quickly, either by leaving the company, transferring to another store, or advancing into a different position. This can be a little unsettling at times to have a different team lead coming in every 6 months or so."
good,"A visually simple, Medium-fast paced job that requires you to work your best, meanwhile not burning you out. It teaches you time management, fast visual-motor coordination, and organization. However, interaction with the supervisors requires patience, due to rare misinterpretations of certain situations and miscommunication between employees. Besides that, It's a simple and honorable job."
good,"Fast paced, fun environment with lots of great people! Not a lot of hours but pay is good. Most anyone would like a job here."

good,"Target is a great place to start off in the workforce. They give a decent wage, and allow minors at the age of 16 to apply and become team members. Over my two years, I have come to learn a lot about working on the sales floor as a Target Team Member, I have my Team Leads to thank for that, they have shown me all the necessary things I needed to know to function as a Team Member, but were happy to train me further when I expressed interest to learn more. I was originally trained in the Hardlines department, but am crosstrained to Cashier, Grocery, Backroom, Ship from Store, Instocks and can assist at in processing returns and payments upon Guest RedCards at Guest Services."

good,"Usually I was a cashier, so I would walk into the store and clock in. then id proceed to the cash register and check if I had enough cash to start charging people. I learned a lot of Spanish because we would get a lot of people from Mexico. The management was not the best but it was good enough. My co workers were very friendly and would help me a lot when I was first starting out. nothing in that job was hard, it was a nice place to work. the most enjoyable part of the job was the break time, after like 6-7 hours of standing in one spot it was nive to sit down for a couple minures."
good,At Target I operated the Guest Services Counter where any given day is different. It ranges from processing returns and refunds to encouraging customers to apply for credit applications. All this while helping and guiding cashiers to provide the best and fastest customer service possible. Management was a joy. I was mentored and guided in such a way that when I had to leave and eventually did find another job I was quickly successful and promoted.

This past year, many changes have taken place at the managerial level as well as on the floor.  I am 3 years in remission from cancer.  The first two years Target was a huge supporter of me and my new diagnosis.  I unloaded and loaded trucks, and made sure merchandise was correctly placed.  I worked 10 hour days.  The hardest part of my job was the lifting especially in the past three years.  Due to my cancer, my shoulder had to be rebuilt with metal and rods.  I never missed a day of work with the cancer except for taking my short term disability.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my coworkers."

good,"This job was tedious, but it was time consuming and you made great friends.  It had okay benefits, but you met all different kids of customers and it really helps you in preparing to be patient and understanding with others.  You have two 15 min breaks and one 30 min break which is not bad. The hardest part of the job? Manual labor.  The easiest part? Showing up to work. "
good,"Very friendly. I made some really good friends here. Management was great. Some of my fellow sales associates didn't know what I knew in electronics however we always helped each other out.

good,"My job at Target was simple.  I retrieved products from shelves and placed them neatly on the product floor.  This gave me opportunities to be helpful with customers and a familiarity with where to find most products they were looking for.  The holiday season was busy enough to have very little down time, which in my opinion makes time pass much faster and is my preference.  "

Employees are polite, helpful, and knowledgeable of the store and products. The customers are always amazed about the customer service. The management team are always looking for ways to improve services and well as promoting employees."

As well as if managers needed breaks, watch the front to make sure everyone is doing what they need to as well as provide great guest service to our guests and to make sure they have a great visit and want to come back again with a smiling face. That was the most important is the fact we wanted our guests to whoever comes in to make sure we provide excellence guest service."

good,Target has an amazing leadership training program is highly recommended for career retail professionals and college grads looking for a challenging way to start their careers.
good,"Target employs some of the best people you will ever meet. Almost everyone is pleasant, outgoing, and will always help with anything you need.

good,unloading trucks best way to stack skids of merchandise. liked co workers heat in the truck. lifting heavy sports equipment and furniture
good,"Target I have to say offers a nice work environment for retail and allows room for promotions and raises; it also gives you the chance to experience the store from all parts.

The most enjoyable part of the job was friends I had made and the team work."

I worked with several people I found pleasant and helpful, and found the clientele to be much different than my previous pharmacy locations! I now worked in the suburbs, as opposed to the inner city. I answered calls, helped guests in the store, and maintained up to date records. I didn't leave Target, the pharmacy was bought by CVS."

good,"A typical day as a seasonal Target employee was interesting. I would have to come into work, my hours were all over the place, and see what zone I was assigned to do. Sometimes I would be putting up stock all day and sometimes I would be in a specific Zone. Let's say I came into work at 4. I would have 2 hours of pulls to do while I was tending to ""Guest"" needs. That meant in store and calls to your zone. It was a big no-no to say customer. When my pulls were done, on a good day, I would have 2 zones to do. On a more difficult day, I was expected to do 3 or 4 zones. It would usually take 4 hours or so to get all of the pulls on the floor. Between customers and 2 or 3 pulls an hour it consumed a lot of time. For the next 2 or 3 hours you had to do re-shop. Re-shop was the items guests dropped because they didn't want them etc. We had to pick that up from our zones and sort them out and then take our zone re-shop and put them away. This was usually a shopping cart full. For the last few hours of work you needed to zone. This meant tidy your zone up. If you were in F (toys) or B (kitchen and arts and crafts) this was usually a disaster and couldn't possibly be done by yourself. Sometimes employees would help you if they were done with their zone but that was a rare situation to come by."

good,"Am currently employed and like my job. This job is fast past, and can sometimes have a heavy work load. There are times that you must stay past your scheduled hours to complete the daily workload."
good,The job was not described to us very well due to lack of timing we just had start off right away since Christmas was close and we had to deliver good customer service and fill the shelves on the floor and make store presentable to customers.

I had the opportunity to work with many managers who enjoyed working with the public and who helped to create a fast, fun and friendly place to work.  One hard part of the job was the physical labor, but this was also one of the most enjoyable parts of the job, as I enjoyed keeping busy.

good,"i never really spent much time here after work because i only worked part-time then left to school. The work wasn't bad either, it was stocking the aisle's and getting everything in order before the store opened to the customers."
good,"A great experience, holidays was very demanding, my job description was very demanding, working with the customers was the best part"
good,"The job was very demanding with my schedule as well as my physical being, but it paid off. I also enjoyed working with the dedicated employees on this job."
good,"Team Oriented and Fun Place to Work! They love to promote from within, so great for professional development. However, it is retail, so prepare yourself for the schedule."
good,It is an amazing company with great work atmosphere. Growth and hike is limited. There is no much work pressure as such. i have learned how to be a better person at work.
good,"Enjoy assisting Guest to achieve maximum customer satisfaction and company profit/"
good,i only worked for them for a short time but it was great. they treat everyone the same no matter if you are in management or not.
good,"I worked for Target for 24 years.  In that time I had 5 distinct careers, but each one led to the other based on my contacts and level of experiences.  Target is in transition right now, if you are looking for a smooth ride it might not be a good fit. If you are interested in digging in and making a difference, this is the place for you."
good,"Target is really making some great improvements right now. The work is hard, but it's innovative and exciting. It's nice to be part of a successful transformation."
good,I did the dish washing and bused the table and cleaned the place form top to bottom. Also helped with the hosting and catering for time to time.
good,"Eight hour shift serving for customer service. Worked on the floor stocking at times which was fun with other helpful co workers,"
good,Good job for teens or college kids. Easy Job you really dont have to worry about much. The job just gets monotonous after awhile though.
good,"Team work, cashier assisting customers as much as possible so they leave feeling satisfied. Overall a time managed workplace with co-workers who have each others back."
good,I was constantly interacting with the customers while completing my job duties. Managers were very supportive and took care of the employees by hosting different events.
good,"enjoyed stocking shelves, reorganizing shelves"
good,Fun work place with supportive management. I work the cash register on an everyday basis and scan peoples items. I also try to promote our Target Red Cards to customers so they can save 5% on their total purchase.
good,"It has been the most fun, stressful (at times), and supportive place to work! I've really enjoyed working at Target. You meet some amazing people every day!"
good,"Great work environment, management was excellent, never a dull day at work,  always something to keep us occupied. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and knowing that you've made their day with great customer service."
good,Everyone treats each other like family. Management will support you and co workers the same. love this place. they will work with your schedule
good,"It's a good place to work and has good hours especially for a student, mom who has young children in school, or someone just looking for extra money"
good,"Great place to grow as a collector, and also a very knowledgeable company in regards to collections. Overall nice company."
good,"So basically, I loved working at Target. Not for the pay but for the people. My mangers were always willing to work with my schedule. I could have any day off I wanted and needed. Honestly, as long as you actually did work they loved you. Don't bring in drama. They love you. The only bad thing is I did 10 peoples job and didn't get paid for it. You start out at 8.50. But your in retail that's normal. Its a job where you are repeating the same things everyday, so yea you are kind of getting paid your worth. You do get a raise every year if you get a good review. It's almost impossible to get a bad review unless you are a jerk who never comes to work. I was sad to go because it was such an easy place to work but if you have years of experience this is a set back. It's a good place for college students and retirees who just want some money in the pocket."
good,"Target is a fast paced distribution center that thrives on team culture while fulfilling customer orders in a productive and timely manner.  A typical day includes me going in a staffing a team of 20-30 team members to pick orders on an automated system to ship out to stores before designated dockouts.  Throughout the day it is my job to remove obstacles from my team and act as a coordinator to upper level executives.  Responsibilities also include reporting productivity levels and keeping team members compliant to OSHA regulations and Target Best Practices.  My favorite part of the job is my team and the strong relationships I've built.  Hardest part was coming in at a young age, it forced me out of my comfort zone and challenges me daily.  I have come to learn that facing challenges I never experienced is exciting and beneficial."
good,"There's no down time working as a sales floor team member; it'll always feel like there's too little people working as people call in sick everyday. Generally, the guests are really nice as long as you are nice to them. If you want to develop customer service skills any retail store, especially this one, will be more than enough. Most of the time working at this job is spent backing up as a cashier, taking calls, organizing the sales floor, and assisting guests that need help finding something. The job culture is amazing, and management is pretty good but sometimes they watch you on the cameras and get on you for the smallest things like talking for longer than maybe a minute. It's their job I guess. The greatest part about the job though is getting to know the people though, especially your coworkers."
good,Company was good to learn and grow from. Many opportunities to grow within. Got a lot of knowledge and skills on how to become a better associate and person.
good,"Great company to work for. Strong developmental culture and opportunities for advancement. Challenging, but rewarding work."
good,"A good cultured company with supportive management and colleagues, Here all employees are grown as fast as the company grows. Target will teach its team members to grow very professional in the corporate world."
good,"All and all I enjoyed my time working here, the people were nice and the pay was good. I would recommend applying here you would like it."
good,"Great, entry level position with tons of amazing people to work with on a day to day basis. Not a lot of opportunities for career growth from this position."
good,Target is an overall great place to work. They assist you with problems that you may face and have flexible schedules that assist your needs. Another plus is that management is there to help you with anything you may be struggling with whether it be schedule related to work related.
good,Great leadership! I enjoy working for the company just wish i had more hours. Other than that i have no complaints about the company.
good,Loved the ups and downs of the job. Cleaning theaters was not fun. No longer around. Would work for Marcus Corp. again some day.
good,"City Target is an enjoyable place to work with a unique culture for retail. The management is supportive, team members are flexible and willing to jump into projects when asked. I learned how to manage my time to complete projects and daily tasks. The job has taught me the importance of Customer Service and to make each customer feel valued. This is the best group of co-workers I've had the privileged to work with. The most difficult part of my job is relying on our off-site team to bring over all of the items I need to finish my job each day. The most enjoyable part of my time there is working with and learning from my co-workers."
good,the work is fine up until a point. you will eventually hit a wall and just view everything as uninteresting. the same people walk through. the holiday rush's are simply abominable. the management gets stale and you have only going home to look forward to. but maybe that's just me.
good,"Show up to work on time, clock in, Go to my designated work station and sign in, Face/ stock items needing to be stocked for ex, bags, receipt paper, merchandise. I learned how to do loss prevention in customer service. Co-workers were great always in a great mood, made work very fun. Hardest part id say, sometimes dealing with an unruly customer. But by staying calm and collected always seem to work through it and they end up leaving happy about 98% of the time. The best part is getting to meet new faces everyday. Management always tried there best to work with you in any way possible."
good,"•	Compute sales prices, total purchases and receive and process cash or credit payment."
good,"A very friendly, fast pace company to join. Here you can learn working with a great environment and team, makes the job and the guest experience a great one. I was able to learn and try new experiences and be apart of a great team."
good,After clocking in I would walk to the operators desk/fitting room. I restocked all the clothes after folding them or putting some on hangers. I would answer any phone calls received and trans them to a certain department if i was not able to assist then with something specific. Employees were friendly which provide a great environment.
good,"The people who work at Target are fun and friendly in earnest. Target is eco-friendly and actually encourages team members to put the guest first. It is, so far, the best place I have ever worked. They hold your place for you if you take a LOA for college or the like, so it is a great place to work for students. Target employees get time and a half on holidays and are paid extra to work overnight shifts. I know I am starting to sound like an add for Target, but that is because I genuinely like this job. "
good,"When I worked at target, I had great support from other Team Members, they taught me everything I needed to do, and they were always able to help me with any questions I had. I would typically stock products in grocery and whenever extra help was needed elsewhere, I would help because the other things at the time had a priority. Management was always great and friendly and would even ask me if I wanted to come in for overtime, which I gladly accepted. The workplace was friendly and fun to be at."
good,Loading and unloading items that’s was coming into the warehouse. If we were slow I would help out other team members if the needed extra help.
good,"Good work culture and great leadership.The training combine with activities makes it more easy to adjust."
good,a day at target with me start with being at work at 6 on some day an others at 630. im either driving the box truck every day but two days out the week an that would be mondays an friday thats when im in the coolers back stocking the products that came in for that day..
good,"greeting customers as they walk in and out the facility, keeping a smile on my face all day long periods of standing. collecting money and giving change back ."
good,"The job in itself is awesome.  I love what I do as Sr. Team Lead - Logistics/Replenishment, and I love the people I work with... I couldn't ask for a group of harder working people.  Though, I will say that there are bad apples in every group (my fellow peers in leadership are not exempt from that criticism).  "
good,I loved working for Target because they truly care about their employees. When my sister passed away (and I was just hired the week before) they sent me flowers as well as gave me time off to console. They make you want to come to work.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"Target is a positive work environment and values their employees.  The only reason I am leaving is that I am unable to pay debts and I am overqualified for my position.  The difficult part of this position, as is probably common in sales, is working with limited or continual fluctuating resources.   Target's biggest weakness is their faulty technology."
good,"I liked working there. The employees I worked with were friendly, we worked as a team to get our work done, assist customers, we were competative to reach goals on sales."
good,"I enjoyed working for Target immensely.  The team was amazing and I had a stellar group that I lead on the Sales Floor.  I enjoyed the fast pace, the ability to connect with Guests and develop new Team Members.  "
good,Good company to work for. Management is very easy to work with and accommodate personal needs. Good company to further my career.
good,"Awesome management team, with solid team members. I learned a lot about logistics and retail skills. a normal day was unloading the truck, scanning all items and transporting them onto the floor to be put away."
good,"Great place to work, I really enjoyed being employed with this company. As a student they were very flexible around my school schedule."
good,"its a terrific company to work for and has good benefits as well, a company that will continue to grow. awesome place and the managers are very friendly"
good,"a great job for a person without children, I worked overnight not sure if they still do that, I would have stayed if my children where older. Room for growth"
good,"Everyday was different and I really enjoyed that. Always new people and new challenges to take on every day. My team members and team leads were very enjoyable people over all as well. I always learned something new, whether large or small."
good,I have gain a lot working here. I get to utilize me communication and verbal skill. I gain enough confident in my work and be able to do my task.
good,"•	Drove sales by overseeing sales floor operations throughout the entire store"
good,"Fun work places, other employers were really friendly and a really supportive manager. Everybody worked hard and made sure customers were happy. Everything was done for customer satisfaction."
good,I already posted a review of Target and it asked me to do it again after I reviewed Blockbuster.  Not sure why this isn't working.
good,"Get up around 3:30am go to work, clock in and head to the back to get a pallet jack and start distributing the merchandise around the store. As for management, the supervisor is very hands on and makes sure the rest of the employees feel like their doing a great job. There isn't a hard part to the job as long as everyone stays on task and gets what they have get done done."
good,i enjoy working together as a team. i'm a very adaptable person who can get along with anyone. i enjoy helping people to get better and live longer to enjoy their life. i've been told i make a great asset to any team i am inflate with. my co worker enjoy having me around because i make everyone feel as if we are working together as a friend. hardest part about the job would be the commute to work.

good,"I was hired and temp but within 1 month was asked to become an HR Team Member."
good,"I clock in at 4pm, do my job and stay as long as possible. Management worked with me as far as good scheduling around school."
good,"A typical day at work usually starts with reviewing your email and catching up with the manager on duty. You will then move on to whatever tasks are on the table, or use a developed routine to begin your tasks. You will also have LOD days, where you act as the store manager for periods of time. Target has an excellent development program, and I have been challenged to grow as a leader on many fronts. Co-workers are generally agreeable, and I have had some great co-workers in my time. It can be difficult to measure success sometimes due to the fact that directives change goals and payroll is not always sufficient to succeed at set goals. It is great to aid in the development of team members, as well as work with awesome customers, and challenge yourself with mastering the ins and outs of the role."
good,"I enjoyed working for target, the team was great, the management was nice and it was a great environment for learning. I wish that I could have had a more reliable schedule"
good,"great team members, great team leaders and management, hard working pace, good pay, hardworking environment, learned how to use pallet jack, learned good leadership skills"
good,"The environment is a very friendly and welcoming place to work. The service lives up to it's name and quote of being fast, fun, and friendly."
good,Overall a great company to work for. Team oriented atmosphere with an emphasis on leadership development. Moving up in the company is difficult though if you do not wish to work in retail nor Minnesota.
good,"Easy, enjoyable work. Company has clear goals and expectations that are meetable. Taught me valuable skills about team work and that will transfer over to another employer and help be successful."
good,Face paced challenging. Learn how to manage people and run a company. great leadership and peers. Everyone has a positive work attitude and wants to help the team achieve goals.
good,"Depending on the store, work can be so much fun. My first store was great! Unfortunately, my second store wasn't so much."
good,The hardest part of the job is properly using time management skill set. The company offers help from other team leads all the way to executive assistance so you can grow within the company.
good,"Very good company to work for in retail, fun fast friendly.. Target goes the extra mile to assure the Guest and Team members are happy! I recommend Target"
good,"greeting customers with a nice and friendly smile"
good,"Solving all kind of issues related to customers and my team , I learned how to face any circumstances with no personal behavior and use all kind of tools to please the guest. Treat all co-workers with mutual  respect and communicate for a better service. The hardest part of the job is when i'm requested in different workcenters in the same time and there is no back up , therefore it is my responsability to deal with the most important concern and move on according to my own judgement ...and the most enjoable part of the job is really when I do achieve my goals and leave the day with the highest level of recognition."
good,didnt work that long there but the organization where on point they have team members help you with work making sure everyone get help in there group good friendly people an want to help you suceed  in life an career
good,I loved working with people. On a typical day i was a cashier so i would check people out with their belongings. I would do go backs and help clean up the store
good,"unloading trucks bye hand counting inventory ,loading trucks very busy warehouse hardest part of the job is the unloading process"
good,"I have been employed at Target for over 3 years now, and I enjoy working there. I have learned so many things, and I am still learning new things. I really enjoy my coworkers, and managers as well. One great advantage of my job is being able to ask days off when I need them."
good,"this job was so long ago I dont really remember my day to day job duties accurately, but I did assist with cashiering, customer service for returns or pricing discrepancies and help floor agents help setup and clean their area."
good,Always productive at a day at work. Using all the skills I know to accomplish my job the way it should be done. The management was alright they didn't really notice the people that stood out and got they're jobs done very much. But it happens some people don't do their job and you get blamed for it. The co-workers were great always helping me with what I needed to know when I was new to accomplish my job daily. The hardest part of the job I would say would probably be the lifting and going up ladders with heavy objects. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably going on break and getting paid.
good,"I enjoyed working with a group of people who knew the true meaning of ""team work"".  My favorite part of working at Target was that they would cross train you.  One day you will be working the sales floor, and the next day you could be the cashier.  It made work interesting."
good,"Working for a big retail store was a fast and friendly environment as well as a lot of responsibility and customer service. Learned many things about retail, from labeling products to even receiving merchandise. I worked with a great team starting from great co-workers to having a helpful supervisor and a respectful manager. Hardest part of the job was learning how to deal with different characteristics in guest. The most enjoyable part was learning how to work in different departments of the store."
good,I had a lot of fun and it was most definitely a learning experience for me. I made a lot of good friends I still have today from the short time at Target.
good,A typical day at Target call center is taking over 100 inbound calls. I've learned to have patience. The management was a proactive. My co-workers were fun loving. The hardest part about the job was not being able to make Every Single customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was going above and beyond for the customer.
good,"When I worked there a long time ago, it was a good place to work. They really worked with you on your hours if you needed to take a day off for any reason. Management was a little inexperienced and the direction of out daily activities felt like it was changing constantly. One day the focus was on this, the next day it was completely different. Also, during that team we lost our Store Manager and there was no replacement immediately, so every manager that was below the store manager tried to step up in there own way and lead, and the result was chaotic. I am sure by now though that those problems are resolved and that the store is functions great now. The pay is not that great for working with consumers all day, but its a nice foot in the door job that can help you gain experience."
good,"Loved the employees, management, and customers!"
good,"A typical day, I would assisted customers with cash and credit purchases and balanced cash register at opening and closing of shifts.  Assisted customers with their purchases and decisions in selecting items.  Arranged merchandise according to Plano gram and operated LRT to keep track of merchandise."
good,A day at target usually consist of setting sells planners and helping our guest. I also answer the phones and put away clothing items that guest do not want or have returned. Working for target has helped me a lot with my people skills. I really enjoy resetting things and seeing the finished product and helping people it is a pleasure when a guest leave satisfied and I had a part in that.
good,I made drinks for the customers orders and help bag food up and take food and drinks out side and some time I took orders. and cleaned and stock my area back up.
good,"I learned how to work more on a team, whereas I used to be a pretty individual worker. I made many relationships with coworkers, bonding  with each coworker. The hardest part was having to help many guests all at once. I learned to manage and overcome the little burst of stress."
good,"Great HR team, decent hours, great starter job or a job for someone learning how to work the corporate system."
good,I was Able to use my knowledge of pharmacy from college. Enjoyed my experience at Target Pharmacy. I Filled and dispensed medications; effectively dealt with with and resolved insurance rejections and other issues. I was able to manage drug and supply inventories.  I provided assistance to registered pharmacists and pharmacy customers.
good,I was there on temp work. Once it was done I left. I wish I could have stayed longer. I enjoyed it and the staff was very nice.  The hardest part of the job was just knowing that I was there only for a short time and being under stress to be laid off.
good,work on the sales floor and the fitting rrom making sure the fitting room is clean and neat and the sales floor is in order.
good,I enjoyed my time working at target but there was a high roll over in management so it made it hard to get  down a routine. great place to work if your in school
good,"Customer service"
good,Productive and fast paced working environment. The managers are very understanding and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting to help all the customers. The hardest part would be when its extremely busy.
good,"I had the opportunity to work with some of the greatest people.  Everyone created a great work life, fun environment and kept it fun.  Management has always been extremely supportive in development."
good,"worked on the flow team, unloaded trucks and stocked floor shelves.  I also did some cross training on the floor. I helped build bikes every tuesday morning."
good,"great place to work, great job by mid level management recogizing hard working employees even if it was just a ""thank you"" or ""great job"", or free stuff like movies, cds, clothes, giftcards, food. room for advancement was decent but you have to have even a liberal arts degree to go somewhere, i didnt like the discrimination in that sense towards the people who couldnt afford school and went right out and worked for a living."
good,"Work usually starts with counting the register and logging in inventory. Patients will drop off and or pick up medications and prescriptions. The Pharmacist will oversee the tech making sure that everything runs smoothly. The hardest thing about working in the pharmacy is when there is a rush and only two people working, usually one pharmacist and tech. The most enjoyable part of working in the pharmacy is seeing the patients smile, it's a great feeling knowing that you an help people in their time of need."
good,"While working at Target, I learned a lot on how to expose my strengths for employers while juggling daily tasks and maintaining customer service/satisfaction. That being said, I also found it challenging to prove these strengths in order to advance within the company. I enjoyed being able to work in almost every department Target had to offer in order to be knowledgeable for future positions and training capabilities. The more I knew the easier it was to help the store, and our teams to excel daily."
good,"Team Leaders are great and it's fun to work here. Feels like Family. The hardest part of the job is waking up but as soon as you get there, everyone makes it worth going to work. Great Place to Work."
good,Target was a great place to work. The management staff went out of their way to make you feel welcome at the job and they did everything that they could to accommodate my schedule with school.
good,"APDA (Asset Portfolio Data Access) and RIP enhancements (Repeatable Infrastructure and Patterns). RIP application is the source of truth for the projects, applications and solutions used in Target. RIP provides a pattern matching algorithm for the Technical architects to decide on the technologies to be used for the given requirement. It also provide information on the related teams and the way to engage them for the project activities."
good,"Target is a fun place to work. You meet all kinds of new people daily, and you also have regulars that you become friends with over time. I really like it when its busy because it makes the time go by quicker. The only thing I dislike about target is in order for you to get time off you have to request it three weeks in advance."
good,"This place is an amazing first job into the working world. The Job rigor may be a bit much at times but its all part of the discipline. Great People, Great Leadership, and a great opportunity."
good,I loved working for this company. Great management team very supportive. Great Owners. Great co-workers. the really was not a hard part to the job.
good,"The company has a good sense of direction and is always growing. With that, policies and rules are ever changing. Working for this company isn't a problem as long as you're willing to understand that  much. The overall work environment from store to store is very upbeat and positive for the most part. This was my first and possibly favorite company to have worked for"
good,"The most enjoyable part about the job was being able to vibe with guest throughout the entire day, my co-workers played a big role in contributing cleaning up the floor for neat shopping and I learned that a lot of tasks in this retail field are based on working with other team members to get the job done right."
good,"Payments on time."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Target. My day at work would begin as heading to the designated floor area I was required to work and ensure that area was kept organized while expecting customers to ask me for advice in terms of the right size of clothing to find. I answered all their questions effectively and always made sure they left the store with what was needed. Also, at other times I was responsible for working as a Cashier where I had to keep a consistent attitude and keep in mind all the sales going on that week. My co-workers were great thus making the job more enjoyable."
good,I enjoyed being around the team members who made working at Target fun. They are all out going. Every day was different so it kept us working hard and staying focused.
good,You have the ability to be a creative thinker to find innovative solutions in a productive work environment to benefit interns and take their ideas into consideration.
good,"I started working as a Recreation Aid Assistant in Japan for MWR company. I learned many things about my job and duties. For example, I prepare a meal for the children's and make an activity program before and after school. Even though job was tough but I manage to keep up with it and it's worth because it was fun for me working with children's. The management was fantastic. My supervisor is always friendly to his/her employees. Also my co-workers were fun to work with because we have team work. We always work together as a team. Sometimes jobs is not always easy for other people and sometimes I have a hard times dealing with kids. But I kept my composure to finish my job which I did."
good,"Honestly, I complain about my job a lot, but I actually like it. It gets busy and stressful, but at the end of the day I meet a lot of extremely nice people that i enjoy talking to. My co-workers have become my friends. The managers there are willing to work with you for flexibility on your schedule. The hardest part of my job is when you have those few guests that are angry, it becomes stressful because you want to make them happy. The most rewarding part of my job would have to be the guests that have been there over the years that have become friends. They tell me about their day, and sometimes vent to me and I listen because I enjoy hearing about it. If one day I had to leave Target, I would miss it specifically because of the guests I encounter everday!"
good,Target is a great company to work for. I have been here for years and enjoy being part of a great team. The best part of my job is accomplishing our sales goals and being a top performing store in the San Antonio area.
good,"There's like 20 different types of jobs in the store and there's flexibility  if you ever want to try or move to a different position. For the most part its very predictable, typical group projects and interpersonal behaviors in team work. Usually, each team member on the sales floor are required to used walkies to communicate to each other. Anyone that works early morning or in the backroom are required to have access to a PDA. Guest Service is the number one priority with Target. Their motto is ""Fast, Fun, and Friendly"". Helping guests comes first. Second priority is to get the project, or whatever you're working on, done fast and efficiently. And of course while doing all of these duties on the job, you are required to have fun. Target is very corporate, so if you represent the Target brand very well, then its very easy to move up in positions at Target, as long as they are available. They hardest part of the job is keeping yourself motivated to work with the same people and the same routine daily. And its also hard to filter the lack of communication sometimes with all the different managers."
good,It's is an okay job. It is an early morning position. The typical work week is 13.5hrs. The job is easy. The employees are really cool.
good,I enjoyed Target as a whole there are always areas that could have used some improvement but as a whole it was good! Most of the team members were a joy to be around and I became really close to a few of them and still have contact with. The management was pretty good and as with any company there is always room with improvement!
good,"A pretty easy day, you help guests with any questions they have. You learn how to zone and find merchandise. Atmosphere is very friendly."
good,"Provide fast and friendly service to customers. We work as a team and we maintain the store clean, great looking store. Team members are helpful and friendly. Management are reliable and helpful if problems occurs. The hardest part of the job is to unload, in-stok and restock merchandise from the shelves and makes sure all lables are accurate. But the most enjoyable part of my job is helping one another as a team."
good,Complete guest purchases and customer service needs. Management is always nice and makes sure you are well-rounded. Co-workers are usually nice. Hardest part of the job is handling difficult customer requests and questions. Most enjoyable part of the job is assisting guests with their needs and getting redcards
good,"A typical day at Target as a GSA starts by checking my email to follow up on daily and weekly goals and any other sort of communication. After, if I am opening I bank all the registers, set up the restroom checks, walk the front end to make sure it looks brand then I'll go do the daily grid and schedule all breaks and lunches for the day. Throughout my shift I follow up on routinely tasks, ensure cashiers are delivering exceptional customer service and as i supervise I ensure I am leading by example. Working at Target helped me realize that I am a leader and it has helped me develop my leadership and management skills, along with leadership development classes that I completed in college. I have also learned how to work as a team under the circumstances of being under pressure due to a very busy day or short -staffed. The hardest part of my job is trying to engage every single employee to participate in the Target culture that strives for the same goal as a whole and that is serving Target's guests.Then the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting a lot of people, whether it is a new co-worker or another daily guest."
good,This company was a very good company i liked working with so many people and they was so uprising and very cheerful people and i go to know each and every one of them
good,"Typical day here consist of pushing products to the sales floor, answering calls, and handling cash in excess of 5000 dollars a day. "

It is very challenging to move up in the company but if you earn it you will be rewarded.  My co-workers were fun and very team orientated.  The hardest part of the job would have the workload, at times.  The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers.  I haven't worked for this company for years but I made life long friends."

Because I mainly worked closing shifts my main task was 'recovery' of the department (I worked in the clothing department, also referred to as softlines),"

good,Never a dull moment! Helping our guest find what they need when they need it is very rewarding.It's wonderful having a team that is willing to help in any area to best serve the stores needs at the time. The part I like least about my job is when the communication breaks down and task are not completed.
good,"As a manager of a small business, my job was comprised of many different tasks. Customer service, estimating and sales were my primary areas of focus. Overseeing production and quality control was integrated into my regular routine. I really enjoyed working with customers, vendors and employees whether it involved motivating employees, improving communication, increasing production, negotiating better pricing from vendors or putting out fires when they arose."
good,"The great thing about my job is that there is no ""typical"" day at work, however, if I had to summarize, it would be to lead my team to drive incremental sales in-line with the company's goals through planning, strategizing, analyzing reports, and developing effective leaders.  At Target I've, of course, learned about how to operate a very high volume retailer and learned several other businesses within- electronics, apparel, a full grocery store, logistics, HR, assets protection, Starbucks, a high volume pharmacy and a clinic.  However, more importantly, I've learned how to strategize and lead teams at a very high level.  I've become an effective leader of change, goal setting and developing. The hardest part about my job is balancing my time between business and team.  I have 12 direct reports, and would love to spend more time with each of them, developing them into a stronger leader and teaching them how to run a business, however between schedules and time in the day, it can be difficult.  The most enjoyable part is the other side of that.  I love developing people.  I love watching my team learn and grow, and being part of that process. I love to watch my team succeed, hit goals, overcome barriers.  As their boss, that is my number one priority- to make sure I am helping them along in their career path. I am also very results driven, so I love to ""win"".  I love to grow sales, beat company averages, and accomplish goals my team never has before.  I also love the people I work with.  I have been surrounded my impressive talent throughout my nine years at Target and have learned"
good,"I love the environment that Target offers.  They make changes daily, but definitely changes that make a difference.  They listen to the complaints/concerns of both the guests & the team and weight them constructively.  They are fast to resolve any issues that may arise."

good,"This was my first job with the primary task of stocking and I lived it, the people were amazing and kind to me and I learned a great deal."
good,"I have worked at Target now for almost 5 years. I have trained in almost every area of the store from guest service to salesfloor and most recently in logistics, I have learned it all. I have also gone through multiple trainings to become a supervisor and even have taken on interim leadership roles in various departments. Unfortunately, no supervisor positions have become available in my store. I feel that my time was well spent there and the time has come to move onto something new and challenging, hopefully a type of supervisor position where I could be a great asset to a company and put use to the many skills I've learned over the past 5 years at Target. Target was a great environment to work in, the management is very welcoming and receptive."
good,"As an Executive Team Leader at Target I learned how to effectively engage my team through proven techniques.  Each day posed a different set of challenges.  Known as a leader in the store, you learn that every action you take is related to servicing the guest proactively and with a smile."

good,Daily challenges to find our way in this new Retail Environment. Seeking to understand our guests and business needs has led to frequent change and an unclear future.
good,"Early morning shift, breaking out boxes and separating products into carts then pushing them to the floor. While maintaining a safe and clean work area. When there is more boxes to be pushed, I help my members stock the shelves and clean up before the store opens. The hardest part is breaking down boxes, making sure not to cut myself with the box cutter. The most enjoyable part is seeing the guest happy when they leave with an item they were looking for."
good,The environment was always fun and easy going.The other employees always made you feel welcomed and were always available to help if you needed it.
good,"the enjoyable part about the job is that you have a very supportive management team who helps out with the department with the sales, guest issues and team training. my co workers are fun to work with and has a clear  understanding of my role as a manager.i have learned so much working with this company,how to be a team player,how to hold my team accountable when there are issues, participate in the company culture and how to drive portable sales"

good,"Typically, I would report to the ""LOD"" or the person in charge that day to learn which area of target I was in charge of zoning and restocking. Mainly, I would spend my time zoning the area and placing items back to their proper location. I would report on my progress to the LOD  and would occasionally be told to help other team members or work for another part of the store. I would offer back up cashiering if it was needed. Also, I provided help for any guest with questions or problems."
good,"I enjoyed going to work every single day.  The people, products and culture were second to none. I learned a lifetime of valuable lessons not only on how to be the best I can be professionally, but also personally.  I'm very sad to see it go."
good,".The manager was so nice"
good,"Every day we would unload the trucks and then sort out the contents of the truck and distribute the goods across the store and then stock the shelves, and then put any remainder products back into the backroom for later use. All before the store opens, then afterwards maintained the shelf stock with the goods from the backroom, and greeting and helping customers all throughout the process."
good,"A position with numerous responsibilities, a Target sales associate primarily provides customer service. Additional job duties include stocking shelves, maintaining a clean work environment, assisting in sales, and performing cashier responsibilities, in some cases. Friendly workers with personable attitudes and motivated personalities typically make ideal Target sales associates. Target also looks for energetic, knowledgeable, and positive sales associates. During training, new Target sales associates learn proper store protocol, merchandise inventory, loss prevention tactics, and customer interaction skills."
good,"It was nice working for target, they are really good with working with you on a lot of things including working around your school schedual or other important factors.

What I have learned while I have been with Target is how to use a PDA for creating work batches and monitoring inventory. There has not been any hard parts to the job. The job is consistent with work I have done in the past. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with our guests, co-workers, and management teams. Target is a great place to work."
good,"Before ever becoming an employee of a Target store, I had always enjoyed shopping there as a customer. So becoming an employee was exciting to me. I enjoyed being apart of their flow team and providing seller customer service to our guests. I enjoyed interacting with coworkers in the break room and I wish the job wasn't seasonal. But it was a great experience that I look back on and I'm just focused on where I'll be employed next."
good,Good hours and store to work at!!! They have a lot fun and helping people is nice.
good,This is a great company I had the pleasure of working for. They use technology very well to identify losses. Target also have a great partnership with law enforcement. I would recommend that you work for this company.
good,Keeps me on my toes through out most of the day. Customers are a joy to work with. Management is high energy and have no problem jumping in to help out with work. Being able to find any product in the store through the Target inventory system makes doing my job easy but also helps to find guests what they need quickly.
good,I had a great time working here. The managers were awesome! Anything that you needed they would gladly help. Wish I could have stayed there.

good,"What I learned when i work in Target is team work spirit, everyone helps each other to finish the project "
good,"A typical day at work is fast. It starts by clocking in to the time clock, going to your station for the day (i.e. Guest Services, Cashier, Electronics, Hardlines, or Softlines) and work until the end of the shift. Typical work is maintaining a clean, presentable store for the guests and assisting them whenever they need it. To accomplish all, if not most tasks of the shift, I have learned to be good at multitasking and keeping a positive and friendly attitude for guests and co-workers."

The executives are pretty pushy when it comes to results, but with the right mindset, the expectations can be exceeded. The job is mostly difficult for the team leaders, most of the workload and responsibility is on them."
good,"management is nice its always exciting everyday to work"
good,"i enjoy working for target, however my home life out balances my work life."
good,A typical day would be making mud and building scaffolds. I enjoyed working at this place.
good,"i would show up for work punch in, announce over the walkie to my team lead and from there my team lead will let me know what location i would be working in. after i go to the stock room and check the lines if any freight need to be pushed out and if there is i would work on that until everything is out. i learned that customers may no be able to find there particular item they are looking for, so thats where i come in and suggest them to other items similar to what they are looking for and if they are not pleased ask them if they want us to call other targets close by if they have that item in their store. the target team was amazing we all work together as a team if some one needed help we help each other out. the hardest part was figuring out where everything went but once you got the hang of it,it became easier. the most part i enjoyed was helping the costumer save money at the register by helping them with the coupon and signting them up to the target red card."
good,I really enjoyed working for Target.Every day I could just walk in the store with a smile on my face and it would never leave my face.We had huddles every day and we could be ourselves.Very laid back and relaxed atmosphere.My job at target was very fast.I would be running around the place helping the guests find what they needed so you better have on a good pair of shoes.lol Absolutely love working for a business where i'm always busy.
good,"fast, fun and friendly workplace, team eager to learn new thing, benefits good, the most enjoyable part of the job is teaching a employee something new and giving that encouraging word."
good,it was a seasonal job so there is not much to write about. the people were great and i worked before the whole working on Thanksgiving started

Backstock when necessary, also pull items for the sales floor team members. clean and organize the backroom before my shift ends. From working at target i have learned self confidence, integrity, and how to be a team player."
good,"The waves of people come with items they wish to consume, throughout all these ringed up purchases, i learned how to use the cashier more efficiently, how to use coupons with bundles you wish to purchase, how to restock your aisle and maintain multiple answers for various question brought to consciousness."
good,"Overall low team morale, everybody works together to accomplish daily activities."
good,"A typical day at Target, I would clock in and walk back to softlines where i find out what area I will work for the day. Then I would gather my reshop and head over to that area to start my zone. I've learned how to pull items from stock rooms, zone, answer and transfer calls, and basic cash register functions. Overall my co-workers were good, however there were a couple who never seemed to get anything done. The hardest part of the job would be constantly going for register back up on a very busy day which doesn't really leave you with much time to focus on your area. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people find what they need or didn't need but wanted."
good,It was a great experience to work at Target. My experience in learning leadership skills were great. My workload and my home life was made very manageable. They had a great program for advancement when I was with the company. My toughest time of year was the holidays. But I had a great group of people to lead and was always a great experience.

good,"- Unloading shipment and putting on the shelf"
good,Great place to work!!! Its a lot of tedious work but the environment is great and everyone gets along. I will be returning to target after i graduate school because the benefits are great and the hours are guaranteed if you work your hardest. I would change the compensation though. That was the only reason why I left.
good,I enjoyed my time at Target and would love to work for them again if I had one close by.
good,"A typical day in a retail store is never the same. If you aren't great at multi-tasking, this job will definitely make or break you. Not to mention the long hours and some times not being able to have a quality meal uninterrupted. As a manager you are always available and expected to drop everything for your employees. This position taught me good/bad habits of being managed and managing others. If it weren't for the evenings, weekends, and holiday hours I would still be at Target and probably own my own store or be a District Manager at this point in my life."
good,"I loved it, made great money, and I loved working there."
good,"Loved the work environment and the employee interaction. Great employee activities, meetings, and inclusion."

good,"- stocking shelves and cash handling"
good,A typical day at work for me would be me coming in and making sure everything is running as smoothly as possible. I believe II've learned the most from this job but the biggest and most important thing is conflict resolution. The most enjoyable part of this job is putting a smile on a customer face and making them believe that great customer service still exists.
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Target but I would like a change. I am looking for graveyard shifts to better suit my needs.
good,"Retail can be a harsh environment to work in.  It takes a great team to make it manageable.  Target does a nice job trying to integrate a work life balance and make work ""fun"".  Granted, there are some tough days but overall its a great place to work and I believe a great place for someone just graduating from college.  Target has wonderful programs in place for personal and professional development."

good,"I worked here for eight years.  As time wore on, the top"
good,"Typical day was to finish our task on time, if we were done early with our task, we would help others in the store. I learned how communication is key to have success at any workplace. My ideas were all ways taking into consideration by the managers. Hardest part was not all ways having the right equipment for the jobs. what I enjoyed most from target was my co-workers."
good,I couldn't continue on working at target because it was very difficult for me to get to work every day during that point of time. I liked the enviroment and most of my co workers.
good,"Will learn alot from worjing at target, biut thepay is not very good for non management positions."

good,"a typical day at target would include either being in the trailers for the day or in depalitzation both were very hands on physical work. In trailers i would load freight into the trailers and typically sort non conveyable freight to pallets all around the wing. A day in depalitization would include driving a forklift, throwing freight onto either the manual line, cart line, or the automatic manual line. I would also run the autos that takes the freight off pallets automatically. I was also cross trained in warehouse where i would operate an order picker and grab freight off the racks and drive the carts to deal."
good,"typical day at the job would be on the sale floor stocking inventory answering guest questions and aiding them in anything they needed assistance with. I learn the proper way to fold cloth on the sales floor .the management was superb very well managed, my coworkers where exceptional and did what they had to do the hardest part of the job would probably have been trying to find the right price of and item that we no longer carry but was found by a customer. I enjoyed being rewarded for promoting sales and food being n the staff lounge."

good,"The best part of working for me was always being able to help and make a difference for someone's day. I would help 10+ guests on slow days and 25+ guests on busy days. Management was good with a lot of different supervisors to look up to. There was a majority of younger workers there that also attended school next to target. Target was a great fast pace environment that is easily learned. What i enjoy the most is the people that i get to bond with, help and make that difference for them whether small or big."

good,A typical day at Target consisted of a lot of customer facing interactions. Which usually included cashier work or re-stocking merchandise. I learned through working at Target that not everybody is going to be someone you get along with but at the end of the day it is about making a positive out of negative and just doing you're job the best you can.
good,"fast, fun and friendly work place. We clock in and get all our tools needed for our work area such as baskets for separating merchandise trash cans and bags. Start getting flats with boxes and start separating and de-trashing merchandise. Once done start restocking the items. Everyone has their assigned area, once done in their area helps out in other areas."
good,"It was good fast, fun, and friendly"
good,"I order food, deal with vendors, make sure to keep the area clean, and free from bad produce!"
good,"The work is grueling and takes a lot of diligence, but the company takes good care of its employees and their various needs."
good,My typical day is getting my team of 10 together and price the store and what I learned is to manage a large group of people. The management team was great helped me with anything that I may need help with and I helped lower management with any questions they may have. Co- workers work as a team. The hardest part of the job is getting all the pricing done on a timely manner  and making sure the accuracy is 100%. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing my job and I hated to leave it.

I dabble into work load, and assist on the sales floor. on a Monday I do pre planning for the next weeks of work load, as well as lead STL walks. I pre plan any set schedules that need to happen. my team comes in mid day, I start their shift with them discussing , the day, their assignments and any plans that need to happen. being at target I have learned how to be global through out our store and they to being successful their is communication . I have learned that relating to my team has helped me in my development as well as their. I learned to be a leader and not a manager. I enjoy my team and feel I do good job for the business. I have good peers that help my department succeed through communication and vise versa. the most enjoyable thing about target is the culture, I feel that the people there want to see the team happy."

We have what's called a Fast Fun and Friendly calendar that is used for team member events and there is always something fun going on and the team members enjoy the food and recognition. I've learned a lot of skills and experience in my current job that I enjoy. The management is good for the most part and most issues that are brought to them are fixed pretty fast. The most enjoyable part of my job as an HR TM is being able to help my fellow Team Leads and Team Members. The hardest part is keeping up with all of the tasks I have to do. I always have a lot to do! However, this has taught me a lot about time management and prioritizing."
good,"I was hired as an electronics TM. I loved my job. I got to sell things I'm familiar with and have contest with my coworkers on who sells the most. out of the 10 or so managers only 3 really got on my nerves but every company has those. I would work the same days as my managers but we were never hovered over. the pay is decent. the scheduling is flexible to a certain degree. great if you have school or a side job. of course my review is a little bias because I worked electronics. if someone working the cashier position was writing one it might be a little different haha. they do offer benefits if you average a set number of hours and like 3-4 times a month they give you treats in the break room, (ice cream, cookies and milk, sodas, etc. and on some holidays they actually order food like panda or pizza hut."
good,I learned to use common sense I used a pallet jack and also stocked shelve and return unused stock to back room. My co workers were of all ages and gender. Most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the grocery aisle
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of making sure all employees were productive and provided excellent customer service to all guests. I was in charge of entering the prescriptions brought in by guests, sent over by fax or electronic communication or called in by doctors. I also had to make sure all employees were in uniform, on time for their shifts and working to their fullest potential at all times. Being a supervisor was stressful but definitely worth every minute of it because I was able to use my skills at discovering talent and helping all the employees try to advance to higher levels within the company. The hardest part of the job in my opinion was making sure all guests were satisfied. Even in situations where the doctors had messed up , the pharmacy was always at fault and it sometimes was difficult to explain and then appease the guests but we did it. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the employees and being able to be apart of their personal lives as well as at work and I was able to really relate to them and help them in all aspects of their lives. Management was supportive and always available to listen and put forward the effort to make sure all the team leaders had the support they needed in order to effectively manage their team. It was a great work environment."

I have enjoyed the ""Target culture""  for the last 21 years and found it to be the ideal work environment."
good,Target Distribution Center pays well but puts a huge strain on your body. Management is concerned with numbers rather than people.
good,There was great people to work with. Everyone helped each other out if you did not understand anything. Only complaint I would have is not working with the public.

I would set up shopping carts in the back of the store and would sort boxes that came off the truck into each cart, depending on where in the store the items were located. After that was complete, I would stock the shelves accordingly. I would also work for the 'Pricing Team', where we would mark items down throughout the store, according to the plan-o-gram. I also cashiered from time to time."
good,"É uma boa empresa, séria e correta com todas as leis e normas. É uma terceirizada que presta serviço para a Petrobrás - BR, com contrato sendo finalizado em Agosto/2015. A gerência é bastante profissional e organizada. Os colegas de trabalho são tranquilos e de fácil relacionamento interpessoal. As condições de trabalho não são tão agradáveis, pois o escritório de atuação fica dentro da Vale de Camburi e não há condução para chegar ao local. A Vale não disponibiliza o ônibus, sendo difícil o acesso e perigoso em alguns momentos. O trabalho em si é tranquilo, tendo dias mais pesados, mas não tenho problemas de trabalhar sob pressão. Estou trabalhando atualmente nesta empresa e busco outra oportunidade por questão de contrato."

good,Supervisors had a 10 minutes meetings and then started working.  I learned about this job how important the customers are and what they need.  My supervisors had the best attitude and desire to help and everything that you need they were around.  The hardest part of the job was deal with some customer that they were not satisfied.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when you see a smiling face and customer satisfaction and everything was done for the next day.
good,"Target is a great place to work for a young adult. Depending on the job one would like to have, skill development in communication, organization, teamwork, logistics, and management is readily available. Target was often able to work around my busy school schedule, for which I am very grateful. The atmosphere and camaraderie is very evident and attributes much of it's existence to the job that management does every day to keep employees happy and engaged. The hardest part about working at Target was learning how to prioritize work with customer relations. While sometimes difficult, the guests who walked in the store were the most important part of the job and also the most enjoyable. Nothing quite beats the smile on a person's face after you make their day with exceptional service."
good,"My schedule would range while working there. I would help keep the all the clothing areas, such as juniors and babies cloths wear, organized  and clean for the next set of customers that come threw the area."

good,This was a great job to work in the breaks between college. I love Target and working for them made me very happy.
good,"Target has a very specific culture - so it doesn't surprise me when people say they don't like it. I happen to really enjoy most parts of the culture, but as always think parts of it are ridiculous. You could call me brainwashed as I haven't worked at another corporation since graduating from college, but if you are smart, driven, a good communicator, mostly normal, and fun, then you will do well at the TGT. "

good,a typical day at work was usually fun for me because I learned something new everyday with each isle that had to be set because each one was different. the hardest part of the job was trying to read pogs which are packets that you have to look at to see how the isles needed to be set. my co-workers were very helpful anything I needed help with they were always there to help me with it. the management was good my supervisor would always be there helping us set up isles. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to learn something new everyday.
good,A typical day at target as a cashier is met with a fast pace work environment where we politely assist customers in the check out process.  We also bag sold merchandise at the request of customers.  As a cashier we are trained to monitor cash drawers within multiple checkout stations to ensure adequate cash supply.  Cashiers at target also answer questions regarding merchandise and pricing from customers.  At target I learned to operate and master a Point Of Sale system to effectively check out customers at a high rate.  Target also taught me how to excel at cash flow management to ensure exact cash supply.  The management at target is very well organized.  We always have managers near to provide assistance and feedback with our current workload.  Our co-workers are very friendly and it's very easy to be relaxed in a target environment no matter how hectic a situation can get.  The hardest part about my job would have to be understanding each individual customer's needs and how I can accompany them.  My favorite part about being a cashier would be co-workers I get to work with.  Everyone is very friendly and are also willingly to help assist a potential problem.
good,"The management and fellow employers are all very hardworking and enjoyable to be around. The working environment is very positive and friendly.

good,"Friendly environment, flexible hours. Great boss! Very busy which is a good thing, it makes the time go by fast!"
good,"I started second shift. I work in areas my manager ordered me to work at. Managers at Target were good and I followed directions. Most coworkers are okay and I engaged in teamwork that is very helpful towards each other. If all of one product is sold out, ""guests"" would get upset, but it is most enjoyable if ""guests"" find and get what they need."
good,work would start at 11 pm and would end at 4 am. we would unload the trailer then push the product out on to the store floor then stock the selfs the people I work with were great they would help you with anything you ask them to I dint really have any hard part of my job it was simple unload trailer then stock the shelf

At Target the workers are required to work fast and most of all be friendly to the guest. My duties have taught me to have patience, and learn that if I can help anyone in any way possible then it is my duty to do so. My co-workers and I work as a team to be able to find what the guest need and when the cashiers need back up on the front end then we also assist them as a team to get the lines down. Working at Target, I enjoy assisting guest the most and knowing that I am able to help them find what they need and they are able to leave satisfied."

good,"A high volume of patients"
good,"Target D.C. was the fastest pace job I've experienced. working twelve hour shifts, constantly moving and standing is a workout on its own but a dedicated worker gets use to it and endures and becomes good. I ended up being so good at my job that corporate ended up giving me a certificate for best new worker and they took a picture of me shaking hands with a corporate office worker. I ended up leaving this good company due to the fact that my girlfriend at the time passed away and my mind needed time to mourn.

good,"a typical day at work"
good,Enjoy the team and how each day is a different than the previous day.
good,"Target is a good company to work with. At the time that I worked with them, they offered good health benefits and scheduling which allowed for a good work/life balance. The hardest part about being a Logistics Team Member was that it was very physically demanding. The best part about being a Logistics Team Member was being able to help ""guests"" (as Target calls their customers) on and off the sales floor! Many times the knowledge and experience in the back of the store as well as on the sales floor came in handy getting the guest what they needed, therefore, leaving satisfied with the product and service."

I learned many things, including retail sales, logistical operations, time management and essential communication skills. Dealing with hard people was common and it really opens your eye to experience people with no regard for others. It is/was a great experience and I enjoy it 95% of the time."
good,"A typical day at Super Target would be, first off, clocking in and getting to your station. Make sure that you were signed into your correct cash register and be sure to check the work chart in order to see what time you take your breaks. Next you would turn on your register and begin your shift. Every 2 hours, depending on the length of your shift, you would take a fifteen minute break and a 30 for your lunch. Be sure that you always clocked in and out of your lunch break."
good,"Most employees work well with others, it was really basic.  When your first handed the planogram your mind goes in every direction but once its explained and showed hands on its very simple."
good,"Une journée typique en tant que directeur, était pour ma part un travail que j'adorais. Entrer le matin au magasin, aller voir les employés pour leur demander comment ils vont, prendre de leurs nouvelles. Faire une réunion d'équipe avec tous les employés avant l'ouverture du magasin pour ainsi donner les objectifs de la journée, les points forts ainsi que les opportunités. Chaque journée était différente, le lundi était la rencontre avec tous les directeurs pour donner nos défis, donner nos commentaires sur le magasin afin d'avoir une amélioration continue. En 1 an seulement, j'ai acquis beaucoup d'expérience puisque j'ai eu la chance de toucher à tous les aspects de l'administration. En effet, j'ai touché à l'aspect des ressources humaine, opérer un magasin, gérer une équipe de 120 employés, faire du coaching, s'assurer d'offrir un excellent service clientèle, s'assurer que nos membres d'équipes soient heureux dans leur travail et faire leurs évaluations. Si nous regardons l'aspect le plus difficile dans mon poste a été le voyagement constant durant les premiers mois de mon emploi. En effet, j'ai eu de la formation au États-Unis et j'ai eu la chance d'ouvrir 2 autres magasins, soit celui de Gatineau et celui de Montréal, ce qui a fait que je n'ai pas été souvent à la maison durant 4 mois."
good,Good pay for people with no experience. Flexible with work schedule. Good management.

good,The Team was supportive and engaging. There were many staff activities that made the whole staff feel supported and cared for. I enjoyed my first job here.

good,"Each day included multiple customers that needed to be taken care of. The amount of training that was given will undoubtedly help me in my next venture with a different company. Although times were always either fast paced or slow, there was always something to be done. Working with customers everyday was rewarding and also a challenge. However at the end of it all, when the customer is satisfied with the companies service it allows everyone as a whole rest easier."

good,"I was hired as seasonal help and offered a permanent full-time position after 60 days.  All I really had to do to was show up every day.  I worked 3rd shift unloading the truck and stocking/organizing shelves. The job itself was made up of self-explanatory work. There was no penalty for being slow, the team leaders were happy enough to have people show up, especially on Fridays and Saturdays.  My advice to you, don't look for a 3rd shift job with Target if you can't work Friday and Saturday nights.  Other than that, I wasn't the fastest worker but I showed up to every shift I was scheduled for and picked up extra shifts when available.  The position I had provided boring/monotonous labor, but you get paid more than a fair wage."
good,"I love to work there all was fun and easy to me, except sometimes I need some help to move some furniture, I like to work with my team."

Target believes in Fun Fast and Friendly and if you are not you will have a hard time in any Target role.  They are innovators and are usually just ahead of the curve when it comes to retail.  So if retail is your thing give them a chance."
good,"It was only for a short time but I learned a lot while there. I was working at target part time for seasonal/overnight, so I had to get up really early or stay up late. Which didn't really bother me all that much. While I was working for target my responsibilities were to restock the merchandise or if I had a day shift help guest with there questions.

good,"A typical day working at Target was never slow. Always working fast, if anyone has ever been to Target they would understand what I mean. Especially on Holidays and special occasions. I learned a lot while working at Target during my college career. Such as, How to be patient. Sometimes the customer is completely wrong, but even if they are you are suppose to treat them as if they are right, just so that they will be feel heard and return back to the store. I also learned how to work at the register. Working at the register can be very unpredictable. I've had to keep eyes out for people trying to go past the register without purchasing an item, I've had customers yell at me because they thought something was on sale and it wasn't. Management wasn't bad at all, I enjoyed working at Target for the most part. I loved my co-workers, we have such a good relationship. The hardest part of the job would have to be the unpredictable customers. Sometimes you never really know how someone is going to respond to anything, thats sometimes the thrill of the job too. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be meeting new people everyday. I've had plenty of people start personal conversation's with me, or come to me and asked for help as if they would die if they didn't find what they needed. I enjoyed working at Target I'll truly miss it."
good,"Amazing people to work with from supervisors to peers. Hard working people, long days of work. Drama free working environment."
good,"I know you wouldn't initially associate a retail position with helping people or making a difference but that's what I made it to be. When a guest called target I'd be the voice on the other end, a representative bridge to the outside client calling end. This gave me the opportunity to be able to help in many different way whether by answering a question, communication information from fellow employees or by transferring the call to another department. Being able to help made my day especially around Christmas, there was no happier feeling than when I was able to help a guest get that one gift their loved one had to have , or even when there was an unhappy guest and I would had the opportunity to be the listening hear and helping hand to correct the problem they had."

good,"This job was kind of difficult to began because i accepted to third shift. It was hard to adjust to act first but once i got the hang of it it was pretty cool. I liked this job because i prefer working independently but I dont mind working with others. Most of the time I worked by myself and managers would check in with me to see my progress. It was also pretty cool being the only female working in the backroom and operating the forklift. The logistics team was pretty cool, because the store depended on us to mantain the inventory in the backroom, and it felt good knowing that i was part of the accomplishments that we made every night. "
good,"order stuff"
good,"I mainly worked the softlines and it was a challenge too because you had to learn the sorting and where things went. The management would also commend people for a job well done. The co-workers were ok, and the management was good. The hardest part was the job was it was overnight and that was the first job where I had to adapt from daylight to overnight. The most enjoyable was I always saw brands of things I always love buying and also working with good people. "
good,"Target culture is strong and in the midst of evolving to be more focused on ""test and learn"" instead of perfection."

Management strives to make the atmosphere of work more fun and your coworkers become like a second family to you. "
good,working here was great. i liked the way they treat you and you meet new people. the bosses are also really cool.
good,Target has grown me as a person throughout the 7 years I have worked for them.
good,"Target is an awesome place to work.  If you have the opportunity to get managers that truly care about you and your work, it will feel like you've never worked a day."
good,"it was fun"
good,"I would come in and get the re-shop from Guest Services before working on the push in the back room.  We would need to work on the push while responding to back up and attending to guests. After the push was done, we would start the zone while still responding to back up and attending to guests. With the exception of less than a handful of team members, everyone I had worked with was really awesome, both management and team members. "
good,"I worked in Target retail during the summer while in college. I enjoyed the people I worked with, and the leaders in charge.  A typical day started with unloading the truck, stocking shelves, and when the store opened, helping guests as well.  The hardest part of the job was the early mornings (4AM), but it was well worth it getting by getting the afternoons and evenings free to enjoy.  "
good,"stock merchandise, customer service. cashiering. supervisors letting you do your job without constantly being behind you but being available when you need them, but they do check in once in a while. bad part was the schedule as it changed constantly"
good,Target can be a great place to provided that you work for a Store Team Leader that knows how to allocate payroll and run a store. However if you are at the exempt level and salary it is possible to end up working much more than the required 50 hours per week. The company mission statement is great and it teaches you a lot of great things about running a business but your work/life balance and happiness all depends on who you are working for. But I believe this is true for any one you work for so best advice is to learn to be politically correct and challenge tactfully. 
good,Overall Target is an great place to work! Target is focused a lot on development and has taught me a great deal about being a successful leader. The company focuses a lot on making its managers the best they can be and striving for high results. 
good,"lavoro autonomo con orari flessibili (poichè titolare) gestione personale, amministrativa, pulizia e contatto con la clientela."
good,I went in to work around 5 or 6 am. Every employee clocks in and heads to the back room. I would go to the trailer of the truck in the dock with two other young men. We would break the seals after verifying them then empty it out and set it our for the sales team to organize and set out on the floor. Upon completion we would assist them with that then clock out. Lunches and other breaks as authorized were off the clock as well. Weekends I grabbed a radio and scanner and would sign in then head to the back. Using the scanner and certain programs I would pull items from the excess supply and load it in carts for the sales floor team to fill up holes in the shelves to maintain supply for the customer. On occasion I would pull items from the back that customers had requested and come in to pick up after they paid for it. I learned hard work really pays off and it can gain you greater employment potentials within your organization. The management was genuinely caring and took care of the people and ensured high morale. The hardest part of the job was learning everything at a quick pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting smiles on customers faces.
good,great employees and management plus security is always on the job
good,Excellent environment to work in if expecting development. I learned many of my leadership skills here as well as holding a higher expectation professionally.  The co-workers work as a team and assist in completing task together in which the company is all about team work. The hardest part of the job is usually the holiday seasons.

good,"A typical day was very stressful. You never had enough time to get everything you wanted done, so prioritizing is a must."
good,"I Really enjoy customer service and the people side of business. However, I don't like the demand the retail puts on life. I found that I was constantly stressed about numbers and working on holidays."
good,fun place to work and enjoyed working there. great place to work your way up and learn alot.
good,"A typical day involves walking the floor and identifying the opportunities that need immediate attention and delegating the tasks out to team members to ensure quick action. When problems surface, myself and the other leaders on duty partner to discuss possible resolutions. What i've learned about management is to never pressure yourself to do all the work on your own when you have your team members available to assist you. No one man can do it all but a consistent team can accomplish anything. The hardest part of the job is when i have to take on another area due being short-handed but i do so without hesistation. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing my team can count on me for anything whether it being assistance with a concern or just to have a normal conversation about non-work topics."

good,"Great place to work. The people are accepting of all walks of life and management is supportive of your goals. However, it is still retail. While the flexibility is great, a reliable and steady schedule is sometimes hard to acquire. Nights, weekends, and holidays will be spent at work rather than with family."
good,"This position is great for a person who's in school(college) or right out of high school. Very laid back environment, but you have to pay attention to detail. Co-workers were very nice & helpful. There was nothing hard about this job."
good,The one thing I loved about working at target was the people they were friendly you always had a good laugh.

good,Since it was during the Christmas holidays it was a very busy job. The managers were nice and I didn't find the job hard at all.

good,on load trucks
good,Good position good pay for the job your doing management fair they could do better with scheduling lack or help in the morning left to run first floor check out by myself someone with a slower work pace would find great difficulty.

My job wasn't hard it was just a lot of repetitive lifting and walking for ten hours a day four days a week it was a lot of ware and tare on the for a woman. I really enjoyed working with the people and the company gave good incentives for making production in your department and when we had an all teammate meeting up stairs management would do trivia's to see how much you know about the company and if you answered right you get a prize.

You can ask for days off, switch shifts, or request a certain schedule no problem. You accumulate PTO even for part time employees. During the holidays they have daily or weekly events where they provide food for the employees. You have a daily huddle to know what you have to do for the day. The only thing that I did not like was that after 2 years I could not move up as a team leader even though everyone including myself felt that I was qualified. It takes people a long time to move up because someone has to quit in order for the position to open."

good,Target was a good company to work for with a good work/life balance for a retail organization.
good,My typical day would be to come in and go straight to the sales floor. I would fix the end caps and straighten out or clean up in the area. Help customers find what they needed.

Target has the foundation for a lot of success in the future. There are great leaders and no one day is the same. It definitely requires one to be adaptable to change and to maintain a positive attitude through that change. The hardest part is the sacrifices that must be made to hold a career in retail management, but they are manageable for someone who is willing to make those sacrifices."

Make the dough for pizza and breadsticks for the next morning. Make Whip cream and mocha for the next morning. I've learned how to manage my time to make sure all my duties are completed during my shift. Learned how to work with coworkers to get things done quickly and effectively. The hardest part is completing things when others haven't done what they need to do as well. The most enjoyable part is knowing that you helped make someones day a little better."
good,"at typical day would be to find out what department the co-worker would be working for the day, assisting customers and putting merchendise where it belongs ,answering calls for requested items in the department i would be in.what i learned how to improve my people skills and also in retail. management was helpful and respectful along with my co-workers .hardest part of the job was having to put away all the last returned items of the day back into there correct departments sometimes withing very small time limits before closing time. the enjoyable part of the job would be staying productive and meeting new people."

good,Target is a fun place for hard working people. They have competitive pay and benefits.
good,Enjoyed working for the Target company. Like their business
good,"It was a very nice place to work, although overtime is frowned upon."
good,During a typical day as a backroom team member there was always work which was good. I learned high levels of organizational skills and how to appropriately work with the time given. The management was not as professional as i expected it to be there were a lot of corners cut by my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was stocking the shelves because of the time frame given and the customers. Although it is our job to help customers it felt to me that the staff responsible to helping the customers would avoid them and allow the customers to stop me and others in the backroom team from completing our jobs in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of my job was during the holidays where our work was completed and we actually had the time to assist customers above the stock floor.
good,I loved working for Target. During the hoildays they always did stuff for the employees and the guest was polite to all employees.
good,customers make you wanna come to work they very nice in respectful i enjoyed working hard making customers happy worked as a salesfloor stocking keeping the store together in also was a backup cashier
good,The overnight position took getting use to. Easy but after a while this position takes a toll on your body.
good,a productive and fun workplace however compensation was not worth all the hours in my opinion.
good,A day at work was a fun day because I like to work. I had no trouble and I never got into it with anyone.
good,this was a very productive and fun atmosphere at times. when the store was extremely slow during our late closing hours it was hard to find work to do.
good,"Fast, fun, and friendly work environment. Target is a company where growth will occur if certain channels are followed.I already had a very good customer service history so at Target i was able to train my fellow co-workers on the correct way to handle various situations in a productive manner."
good,Always stayed busy which I liked. I got along with most of my coworkers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the public. I enjoyed providing customer service
good,"This was a good job, got to meet alot of customers. This job had a lot of great employees, but at the time they didnt have enough hours to work."
good,I work mostly evenings since it's a parttime job. We stay pretty busy. I like the people I work with.
good,Stocked Shelves. Enjoyed working there. Got pretty busy during the holidays.
good,"Typical day at work consists of evaluating the sales floor, delegating tasks, strategic placement of team members and tasks, motivating the team with incentives and developing team members to become global with room for personal and professional growth while maintaining a guest service as a primary focus. I enjoy being able to make a positive impact throughout the entire store while being able to engage with guest and overcome obstacles that may occur and provide my peers with positive energy and excitement."

good,"You get what you expect, retail"
good,Zone
good,"I learned that I could work on my own pace. Management was alright if you didn't have a major issue. Some of my co-workers were not very nice, but the ones that were, they helped me out a lot. The hardest part of the job was figuring out where the boxes went when they got out of the truck. The most enjoyable part was when I could rack up the clothes on the clothing racks."
good,Overall good company to work for. Plenty of room to grow and develop. Benefits and Pay are also better than one would expect.
good,Awesome place to work! You will learn a lot about yourself as a person and as a leader
good,"My experience working at Target was positive. I worked with wonderful managers that were mostly always willing to help with what they could. Executive management liked to switch up assigned areas for Team Leads which was a nice change after having Seasonal, Toys and Electronics for the Xmas season!!"
good,"Working for Target was such a great experience. A typical day was anything but typical. I did something different everyday. I set planograms, stocked and helped guests on a regular basis, but not always in the same department. I learned how to work at Guest Services and Food Avenue, so there was an extra hand to lend when needed. The managers were nice and always helping me develop into a better team member and leader. The hardest part of the job was leaving it after making so many friends and helping great guests. My favorite part of the job was walking my department after completing my daily task and feeling a sense of accomplishment. At Target, the benefits were amazing and we celebrated personal and store accomplishments and worked as a team on challenges."

Cooperates with the team leader and all co team members. Makes price changes audit every Friday. Perform other duties assigned from time to time. The 12am Sunday night duty setting for the signs is the hard part especially when I have special gatherings to attend during weekends. Having good employer employee relationship is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,It was a good job. The owner was a great guy. Did what ever he could to help you out.
good,"A typical day at work would include zoning, labeling, assisting customers and managers with inventory. Safe and sometimes crowded envioronment."

I learn alot of different things work in every department of target i know how to backstock item when we have too many on the floor.

I know how to set endcap, POGS (planograms) Adjacency(softline clothes), i always cashier, cover fitting room, answer and tranfer calls to the department in which the guest ask for help in. I'm not a manager but i have a day of co-manager when my teamleader is off, this day is to help me with my developement skllls to become a teamleader. My co-worker are fun and encouraging we have a fast, fun, and friendly atitude when it comes to work. The hardest part of my job is sometimes the work load be a littl too heavy form the team to get done on time but we try our best and make it happen. The most enjoyable part of my job is making the guest happy."
good,Very buisy i got to learn how to interact with others and promote properly managment was very simpothetic to our needa co workers were moustly great. the hardest thing about my job it seem like it was performing repairso on top of the roof during summer time. the moust enjoible thing about my job there it wasent boring.
good,"I didn""t stay with this company long but when I was there I had a BLAST. I loved coming to work. The fast pace and different people, I did enjoyed my seasonal position here."
good,"when i worked at the electonics boat. i came upon a frantic mother trying to open her mind to video games she wanted to get her son something, but a surprise. helping het in her time of need and being told that i was recomended by her online made me feel warm inside. and wanted to keep delivering great guest service."
good,"Replenish product on floor, Rotated stock accordingly to OSHA standards, Set up/ Removable of product accordingly to Employers demands consisting of labeling, recovery, shelving set up, cashier, phone representative, Electronic Dept specialist, guest attendant, outside store maintenance, general housekeeping."
good,"A typical day at work would involve me arriving sometime in the early evening. I would move returned product from the front to the sales floor if it was deemed unused. While doing this, I would also return product that was misplaced to its proper place. Later, I would go through a specific department I was assigned for the night, and straighten everything so that it looked clean and full."
good,Target is a wonderful company that has allowed me to gain new experiences and skills. The management team is always there to support you in anyway possible and your fellow co-workers are always team players.
good,Decent place to work. Friendly environment leaves you
good,"Love the work environment, as well as my co-workers. Management is pretty fair."
good,I liked Target! I like to meet new people so Target provided that. Although it had its ups and down I still like to shop there even though i no longer work there
good,"Target is a company that is highly focused on guest satisfaction, productivity, community, and profit. I have grown with the company for 10 years. I have made great relationships with the many team members and leaders that I have worked with throughout the years. A typical day at work would be to oversee the functions of the Front End, Food, and Softlines areas. I have learned how to lead teams through change, manage the talent of my team members, and manage the productivity of the entire team. The hardest part of the job would be the work/life balance. Target has an amazing dedication to the community in which it serves. I have enjoyed the people and the challenges that I encounter each day."
good,Work with the flow team stocking products.
good,Very Corporate Work Environment
good,Great place for a first time job such as teenagers who are in school or college students because they do work around your time. Very clean environment and everyone works together. Everybody helps one another out.
good,"•Compute sales prices, total purchases and receive and process cash or credit payment."
good,"A typical day at work starts with some sorting all the go-back into bins that belong in different department and process damaged item or empty packages. After the store opens then we just process payments, returns and exchanges as well as assist the front cashiers when busy."
good,"I have learned how to manage a large team in retail. We have many guests that are not easy to please and Target is a great place to learn how to handle large amounts of stress and still have a smile at the end of the day. I like being able to take an unhappy guest and make them smile and want to return to the store in the future. I really enjoy working in a store where development is encouraged and I am able to help develop and promote others that I see doing amazing things in the store. The hardest part of the job is maintaining payroll. It can be difficult at times to make sure that everyone is leaving at their scheduled times. If everyone clocked out 5 minuted late, there would be excessive payroll in the negative."
good,"A typical day at work, I head in, ask my superior what I should be doing, and I get my talky and scanner gun and head off to do what ever is needed of me to do, which usually is restocking the items on the shelves or cleaning up the aisles. I learned a lot about shifts and restocking and proper safety rules when dealing with heavy lifting from the back rooms, this was my first job and it was a great experience. My co-workers were friendly, never had a problem with anyone while working there and I made a couple friends, too.The manager was fair. The hardest part of the job was the restocking the shelves, in my opinion. There were times where I had trouble finding which aisle to place the items because the scanner was hard for me to understand and the aisles were all jumbled with things guests leave from other aisles. The most enjoyable part was being a cashier when needed, it was fun talking to the guests and scanning the items they were buying."
good,keep my area clean and helped customers find stuff good company but it was just seasonal.
good,"Your day is a 10 hour shift, where you assess the needs of the business and make decisions based on that. The goal is to deliver the best possible experience for the guests. I learned how to lead at a high level based on the volume of the stores I worked at. Both management and the team or co-workers are good at collaborating. Hardest part of the job is applying best practices to random everyday occurrences in $95+ million stores. The best part of being in this role was the ability to lead and develop a team to achieve goals."
good,"I learn to work as a team,enjoy meet new people every day. was fun coming to work every day, knowing that every day is different.Everyone worked as a family."
good,"During a typical day at work I would proof and bake breakfast items such as bagels, donuts, danishes and croissants to be put out in the single serve case by 9 am. I would also proof, bake and package the other various bakery items we sold, once they were cooled down. I would then place these on the sales floor shelves. I would aslo take cake orders for the cake decorator and give the guests their items they were picking up. Writing on cakes was also another one of my duties to perform while working. As well as helping in the deli when needed, I would assist in putting up the delivery truck items and maintain a clean and sanitized workplace. I worked with some amazing co-workers here. It was like one big family. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how happy and satisfied the guests were when they picked up their special orders."
good,The company has made many changes. Some which are good some which are bad. The bad is one of the reason i would like to leave. They have down sized our small volume store so there is too much work and not enough employees.
good,This is a great place to work if you can deal with the time you must work at. I like the job here the people are great and fun to work with. The job is not hard and gives me a workout. The issue here is that there is little to no room to grow without a degree of some sort.
good,"Super Target really does live up to their motto of fast, fun and friendly service, not only to their guests but also their team members."
good,Very fun work enviroment with plenty of people to meet. It was very easy to stay busy and entertained.

good,this company looks out for its employees and is always rewarding those who have gone above and beyond what is excepted
good,"Greeting customers, cashier, restocking shleves, help people find a dressing room"
good,I enjoyed working at super target. Unloading the trucks at the begining of the night kept me in pretty good shape. The management would also feed us pizza and stuff at lunch sometimes. That was cool. When it got busy we were offered overtime and financially that really helped.
good,"Our team did all the overhead signing and the decorations, we also did all the seasonal displays. We would empty a full aisle and then re-work the shelves and peg hooks for the new merchandise. It was fun and creative."
good,"There wasn't really any problems with going to work here. My co-workers were cool, helpful, and good people. Most people you deal with were mostly nice especially if you don't look like your in a faul mood. Management was helpful when I had questions and one of my supervisors was trying to help me get a better position while I was working for seasonal. The hardest part of the job was trying to focus when everything was very hectic and you don't have much help. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a nice face come to your counter once in a while to cheer you up whether your having a good or a bad day."
good,The workplace is upbeat and very happy place to work! They work with their employees and help out their company and community as much as they can.
good,I worked five nights a week from 10p.m. to 7a.m. I was part of two teams. The first team and I unloaded trucks and stocked the sales floor. The second team and I kept the backrooms and freezers stocked.
good,"When I first began working at Target, I was greatful for the amount of help and training I received from employees and management. Target does a great job in selecting diverse and open team memebers and leaders. I quickly learned about the tasks of the job, including cashiering, stocking shelves, how to greet and assist guests in a fast and friendly manner, and techniques used to keep the store's appearance attractive to guests. One of my favorite parts of a work day is ""huddle'. Huddle is where the team members and leaders gather to discuss sales, daily tasks, give recognition, and need-to-know facts that will help ensure an effective shift. Target has a very team-oriented environment, which was something I was not used to, but that helped me build character. Management is always open to discuss any concernes about personal or business matters having to do with your job. They are also great at providing co-workers with fun and interactive activities while on break or during the shift. I never felt as if there was nothing to do. I, personally, prefer being busy, so I enjoyed the fast pace. Overall, Target was an awesome place to work!"
good,"I loved Target. Of course it had its good days and bad days as every job does, especially after working at a place for almost 10 years. Management changed over the years, so it was good and bad depending on the time. I worked with the general public from morning till night."
good,I love working there meeting and greeting new people everyday
good,"I was a pharmacy intern. I loved my coworkers, they provided a fun and pleasant atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was learning the system. If you didn't work everyday, there was no way you'd learn it and it changed frequently."
good,"Target is a great place to work, learned new things, trained in different departments. Hire, train, and motivated team. Great interaction with customers, great opportunity for growth. The most enjoyable part of the job was training new employees. All of my team had been with me from the start so we have developed a great work relationship. The hardest part of the job, honestly there was no hardest part of the job."
good,"Employees are great to work with, flexible with schedules and time-off"
good,"The biggest thing I have learned with this position is how to engage others in a positive, friendly way to work together as a team helping others and being mission minded. Working here allows one to really hone in on their leadership abilities."
good,I really enjoyed working at Target because I loved the customers. There is room for growth in this company. I did a lot of different positions in just a couple of months.
good,At times there is very heavy lifting and during the busy season it can be hectic. The people are great though and they pay very well.
good,A typical day at work was me arriving early and helping my fellow teammates I had a couple of friends that were very friendly and helped me and showed me how to make it. What I learned was that Target does sell quality products and you have great supervisors and management. The hardest part of the job was when there was a rush you have to hurry up but it really didn't affect you as much I learned from that experience. The most I enjoyed was sitting down in the lunch room listening and seeing how the teammates would enjoy them selves.
good,Target was my first job and i liked working there..they said they were going to break me in and they sure did..I was pleased to have worked with them i was only hired for seasonal position which put me to learn alot in a little time but the people working there made it easy for me to learn..I was incharge of keeping the tabels and racks stocked for customers to shop i was also a back up cashier
good,A typical day at target is to help customers. When you work at Target you learned something new every day. The management excellen. The co workers are great to one another and customers. There's no hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the event's we have at work.
good,Target was a very fun experience. Management was always nice and caring.
good,Learned a different aspect of pharmacy in a retail store environment.
good,Other than having to work every Sunday Target was a great place to work. There was content changes in what was required and expected of the employees.
good,the most enjoyable part was assisting the customers with what evre they had questions about
good,A typical day at Target was hardly that. There was always something different to learn from the Company. Every customer that entered the store was amazed in the layout and the convenience that there was a snack bar in case a child was suddenly hungry or an adult needed to quench their thirst or a worker needed to re-energize during their lunch break before his or her work day was due to conclude that day. The most enjoyable part I got to experience first hand how a new store is set up and view the surprising expressions on the customers faces as they entered the building.
good,"I have learned a lot of skills at Target, such as moving pallets, cashiering customers, and working with others."
good,I do not remember
good,Overall it was a fun place to work and they did make you feel valued as an employee. They typical work day was fairly simple and I dont feel that they overloaded the team with more work than they could handle. The only real problem was that you could not advance within the store without a degree.
good,"Always remembered being appreciated by management. Respectful work place, with helpful staff."
good,"its usually easy and enjoyable place to work at everybody works as a team to try to accomplish all task on time i learned how a warehouse is managed or is suppose to be kept up to standards, the hardest part of the job would be having to get up at 3:30 to start at 4 the most enjoyable part would be working together with the co-workers."
good,"A typical work day includes lots of guest interaction, constant problem solving and a need to ensure the sale floor is full and driving profitable sales. This includes leading and motivating an eight to fifteen person team to fill and maintain the sales floor. I have learned to think strategically and problem solve to help drive sales. In addition I have gained knowledge of effective merchandising and how to lead a team through engaging, inspiring, and communicating effectively. My co-workers are a pleasure to work with, and my peers are not only willing to help each other but always there to share experience and knowledge to better the team. Management is largely made up of aspiring leaders who look up myself and other Team Leaders to learn the details and specifics of the job. The most difficult part of the job is the constant struggle to receive clear and consistent communication from leadership in the building. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help others. Not only do i get to assist guests and provide them with the help and service they need, but I also get the train and develop team members to bring out their full potential."
good,Everything is great while working here!
good,"Customer service and helping people, managment of money. Stocking, and cleaning"

good,I enjoyed working with people on my team. I learned a lot about Marketing and Advertising.
good,"work in team environment and stay active and busy. Great co workers. Unloading trailers for 12 hours , got paid really good."
good,Lots of action and leadership was great at Carson. I moved to San Pedro Target and it sucked so bad I quite. But Carson Target had it all together.
good,Target had an excellent training program. The pharmacists were always willing to explain and teach me something new. Everyone showed courtesy to each other and were very professional. I still use the knowledge gained during my time at Target. The only negative part of the job was their strict policy on break times and lunches. They would write you up even if you were 5 minutes out of sync.
good,Sometimes dealing with guests are hard but overall a nice place to work
good,Take all merchandise out of the packaging then begin to fill the selves.
good,"The company was fair to employees, and the coworkers were nice. Bosses were helpful and understanding and the benefits were good."
good,- A typical day at work involved planning and execution of projects and interacting with guests.
good,I loved working at target but I wasn't there long enough to transfer when I moved to GA
good,I do believe that Target Corp. is an equal opportunity employer with great benefits and many possibilities to advance in the company if desired. I also thing that it is a fun environment to work in and you can also have the opportunity to train in all areas of the store if wanted.
good,"Throughout the past 6 1/2 years of working for Target I have learned numerous things such as how to lead team, how important satisfying every guest is, and how to be a great merchant. The most enjoyable part of my is the relationships I've built with not only my fellow team members but also the guests that enter our building each day. Being apart of the management team can be hard at times because many people come from different backgrounds and have different circumstances than most however being a leader has made be a better overall person."
good,"worked overnight stocking shelves. I learned different procedures of how operations worked, how to back stock merchandise, and control shrink better. Management was great, always fun to work for. Co-workers were a blast to be around, we made it fun! Hardest part of my job was trying to get everything done in a timely matter. we did it though! The most enjoyable thing was working with a great bunch of people."

good,"A Place where they not only care about their employees, they care about the customer. It's a great place to work for."
good,I loved working at Target. I learned so much about product and how to run the front end of a one stop shop. Being able to greet customers and interact with them and help them in there shopping experience is definitely rewarding.
good,Target is willing to invest in their employees as long as you are willing to commit to them. They have a great management structure and employees are able to move up quickly in the company.
good,"I would punch in then look at the list of duties. I would either go out back and unload packages off the truck, or I would be in the store putting the packages in the proper place. The people were really friendly and would help whenever you needed it. The mangers were young a little inexperienced but were never threatening always were encouraging. The hardest part was it was 3rd shift so halfway through everyone was pretty tired."
good,Typical day is unpredictable. That's a good thing. I've learned how to better communicate my message concisely. I support Target's management strategy. It is very conducive to advancement if you have the skills and ability to change. Being able to work all major holiday's and only get 3 day's off guaranteed per year. Seeing the team members accomplish a long term goal is satisfaction to me.

good,We opened a new store and with that brought very long days and very little time off. I was able to learn the entire store and advancement opportunities were there for everyone.

good,"Target is a great place to work and grow within the company. Opportunities always available, and posted for u to see and apply."
good,"its a good place to work employees are friendly and are willing to train you in the department you're hired for no ones ""too busy"" to answer a question the company focuses on guest service which is a great policy"
good,Outstanding benefits with good 401k match and great compensation. Hours are very flexible and work around school schedules.Reasonable restrictions on time off.
good,The people at this store really make the time I spend worthwhile.
good,It was a fun place to work. I unloaded trucks & stocked it was fun to me.
good,Target was a great place to work everyone there was very helpful and friendly i had a great experiences working with target team.
good,"The benefits I cannot complain, It's target and they give you all they can. Since I was seasonal it ended shortly for me and they could not afford to keep me any longer after the season which is understandable. They do go out of there way during the holidays, which if hired for seasonal you will be working. They did there best to make us feel welcomed it is just a shame that it had to end so abruptly."
good,I worked for Target for 6 years. I really enjoyed it because they trained me an all departments of the store. The management was really good to me and I worked well as a Team member.
good,"Super Target Was a Great Work Place to work in. Ive learned alot exspecaily when it come to dealing with Guesses, and Customer Service. I also learned the importance of being a good worker, by being there on time and by alway greeting guesses, It really does make a difference."
good,"Target was one was the most lovable Company in my career. It was fun, I never felt like pressurized. There was a continuous support from the Team Members as well as from the seniors.A handy training given for all of us for Individual Development and also educated us to maintain work balance culture. Moreover I felt great because I was working with the World's Second biggest Retail Sector."
good,"Target was an very interesting place to work, learned and grew so much there, worked with some amazing people and miss them all very much. I become a better and stronger person working there and gained so much more knowledge"
good,I was able to interact with different types people on a daily basis
good,It was a great first job and I had an awesome experience working there. All of the team members were great and also the managers were great. The customers were nice and kind.
good,I enjoyed working at my old location and I made a lot of great connections with the leaders and management team. They really focused on a team-oriented environment.
good,Great retail store hands down. They are really great with customer service and always put the customer first. Target is a good company but demands a lot from you.
good,"I worked in the fulfillment team, doing online shopping. It is mostly a good job, but like all jobs, there are some areas of improvement. The store isn't big enough to support the volume of sales we do and this causes logistic problems in the backroom and salesfloor which increases the difficulty of my job."
good,Personally I liked it and it was a nice experience. Overall I did not have many bad experiences. Very efficient team and always pushing team members for positive improvement.
good,It's a great company to work out although they show clear favorites. I came in late 3 times called in sick once and got let go. My roomie just skipped work for a whole week and a half.. Didn't come in because he didn't want to and got promoted. How is that right ??
good,Hardworking and reliable 90% of the time i also learned my job in a good manner while using my training to assist guests and my area in expert fashion
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at Target. My co-workers were understanding of my needs and very helpful when I had questions; upper management was always on hand for help. The working environment was one of the best I have been in since I began working life.
good,While working at Target it was a great experience for the most part. A big struggle was location and time. I was a high student and I was released from school at two-thirty but had to be at 3:30. I did not get home until 3:00. I tried to ask for my hours to be switch but it did not happen. That is the reason for me leaving the job.
good,"The local store is great to work with. Corporate sometimes has crazy ideas they think will work, so we try for a while. On the most part the pay is fantastic, but hours can fluctuate a bunch. Went from 38 hours on a regular basis to suddenly 13 hours. At first I thought I did something, but everyone was cut. I guess they had to make up budget costs so we suffer."
good,"This place is nice, fast and very friendly a great place to work. Do recommend working here to make some good money. The employees are nice and kind and are willing to help their customers."
good,Working at Target was and overall fun experience that I enjoyed my time while I was there. It was fast place and super easy to get into the flow of everything.
good,"Very clean and neat break room with plenty of lockers to store your personal items. On the floor, there were always team leaders and other employees to assist you. Management was very friendly and helpful."
good,"Target is a great but challenging place to work. The culture is focused around continuous improvement and development of all team members. No two days are the same and there is always something or someone to improve and develop. The leadership is very talented and the workforce is pushed to be safe, accurate and efficient within their tasks while having a great attitude."
good,"Is a nice company to get work experience. From my time there meet some amazing peopel. Overall was a good envioremnt to be in, and I think lots of people would enjoy this job."
good,My experience at Target was great. I saw what had to be put in so locals could get their daily needs. I learned about veggies and fruits and when they would be best to eat. Helping guest was always a blessing to me because it's something I enjoy.
good,While working at Target you can basically choose your own schedule and the amount of time you want to work. Most of the managers want to help you succeed and are very friendly you just have to earn there trust through hard work.
good,A typical day at work would include a lot of walking around the store picking things for customers. I learned that nice sneakers are a MUST for a job that requires standing all day. The hardest part of the job was trying to find a product that hadn't been put on the salesfloor yet. The most enjoyable part of the job was being at target because I love that store.
good,Doing your own job and focusing on you and your productivity. Management was good plus helpful. Hardest thing is keep your numbers up. Being able to move around and focus on you.
good,"Target was hands down my favorite job they worked with my school schedule, and were understanding if anything came up everyone is super nice and it's easy to talk to the people you work for and work with. Management had their moments of dropping the ball but it wasn't anything major and nothing I concerned myself with. Healthy workplace environment and has a very customer and employee focused culture"
good,My position in this job was to unload the morning trucks and place the items in the aisles where they needed to be. We had to be quick and efficient until the store opened.
good,I worked for Target for 4.5 years and for the most part I had an awesome experience! Super flexible with school schedules. My managers were mostly super supportive of their employees and didn't hesitate to offer help or answer any guest/team member questions. All around a happy and positive atmosphere.
good,I am used to working in a warehouse environment so target was really slow to me. Management was good overall and i am a pretty easy going person so everything worked out.
good,"Target was fun to work at, I'm young and my coworker were too so it was a great fit. I worked in tech and was able to give advice and knowledge on the area."
good,Good management that recognizes its hardest workers. Pay could be better but the culture does compensate. Managers will go the extra mile to help you as long as your receptive to their advice.
good,Working for target provided good pay while also providing a easy going work day. It is important to always put the customers needs before you own. Its also important to be proficient in basic math as you will need to often work the register.
good,"Very friendly, very diverse, and very flexible. The job has its perks and it has its cons. They give back to the employees and it’s amazing about how much they care about their employees."
good,"Must be willing to put up with grunt work for a few months before you have the opportunity to get trained and move up. There are good people that are willing to help, but the job culture has made a transition into prioritizing production instead of prioritizing employees."
good,Room to grow and constantly be promoted from the inside. As long as your hard working and dedicated you'll get noticed. Great benefits and plenty of jobs to choose from.
good,Workplace was family oriented with plenty of different backgrounds and individuals who made working everyday a better experience. Guests would come in the morning and have great experiences as I worked as a barista in the Food Avenue section of Target.
good,"For a part time Seasonal job, the pay and flexible scheduling were just what I needed. The people there seemed happier than other retail jobs I've worked."
good,Easy work place but guests and management were a bit annoying to deal with. Advancing in the workplace was hard to get solid answers but possible once you knew what to do.
good,I love how they make all the guests and there employees and they are always on top of what has to be done in on the floor make sure it’s nice and clean for guests can shop easy and feel proud of a purchase and also safe there is an 0% of guests that ever get injured
good,I worked here during college and it was very flexible with my class schedule. I learned a lot and met a lot of great people. There is definitely opportunity for advancement and cross training in different parts of the store
good,The people I work with were friendly and helped as a team. I enjoyed my job and did it well was on time and ready. The worst part of the job was not enough hours in the week.
good,Target is a good company it just has very poor communication between the Team members and their management . Also i don’t feel like im get paid well for the amount of work I provide
good,"Like any other job it has its ups and downs, I definitely liked my co-workers they made it more enjoyable to go to work. The free Starbucks is also a big plus."
good,"A good place interacting with guests and helping them getting what they are looking for.  Supervisors are ok, some are better than others.  Great place to make friends"
good,"The environment at Target is friendly and very customer orientated. There’s never been a day where I truly dreaded going to work. "
good,"Management was very young and didn't really seem to know what they were doing. In my opinion, they made some bad choices for the company that didn't make a lot of sense. Very nice people, but some of them needed some additional training."
good,I enjoyed being employees by Target I would like to have my job back. I was terminated because I was sick with pneumonia was in the hospital so I missed more days than the company granted me so therefore I was terminated
good,"Work place was great, easy going pace to work in. Everyone was friendly including management. Training was quick and very hands on. I cross-trained so I was able to work in multiple positions when scheduled, if need be."
good,Target has some of the best people I have worked with. The leaders and directors of the store are supportive and work to help every team member succeed
good,Come in listen to leads and try not to offend them. Enter through their designated door. Follow the rules. Go to lunch before your fifth. There is no overtime
good,"It's a very encouraging, supportive environment. The team leaders are very helpful and understanding about the situations in your life and offer a lot of flexibility to help balance those things."
good,"Employees were all fun and pleasant to work for. Company cares for their employees. Schedules are flexible, they make sure you get your breaks on time and you get a discount."
good,I work with a great team of people that makes it enjoyable to be the clock with. The management is working right beside you in the back or on the sales floor. It feels good to that you are valued and appreciated in the workplace.
good,The work environment and culture of Target was very enjoyable to work in. The managers were very hands on which made the work feel very collaborative.
good,I enjoyed working at Target as my team leaders left me to do my job with a  great sense of autonomy. I feel that I was compensated well for my job and I never disliked what I was doing.
good,Target is a great company to learn and grow with. They are very great with promoting the team from within. I have never been a part of such a great team. Target cares about culture and making sure the team is happy.
good,A typical day included completing an assortment of orders in a timely manner. First finding the items in each order making sure to keep them organized and separate. Depending on the number of people in that day the last part of the day focused on mailing out orders.
good,Positive experience.  Great people to work with.  I would describe my experience as positive and cohesive.  I recommend this company to anyone wanting to work in retail.
good,A day at work is very busy .management is always there to assist it very fulfilling work coworker are very helpful I was very happy to join this company
good,"I absolutely loved working at Target. I was in charge of my own department, paid fairly, and mingled with several of my coworkers. For a college student, it's a great summer job, but they would not work with my schedule this year to continue working throughout the school year. That's my only complaint"
good,"Target was my favorite job I have had so far. Their company makes you feel like you are part of a team, and your co workers were people you could trust. There was a sense of family and community. My main complaint was that the management was not easy to talk to. They seemed to not care about employee concerns and cared more about deadlines, and did not always staff enough people. Many times I would only be scheduled 10 hours, but I would get called in so much that I tended to work 25-35 hours by the end of the week."
good,While it lasted I really enjoyed my time working at Target. I was able to choose hours that best worked for my lifestyle and that was something I really appreciated.
good,Great company to excel in and grow many skills. There is a lot of cross training so it allows you to learn to multitask. It also teaches you to own your work area and everyone essentially becomes business owners.
good,"I enjoy working here, it’s a good job. I like the hands on experience with packaging and finding items, it’s thrilling to go out and help all the customers and make them happy."
good,Target was a good job to work at and I'll go back to this job as well just cause i like how they treat there employees.and makee sure all of was equal.
good,"Engage with people, help them to discover the joy of everyday living!  The most enjoyable part of the job is conversing with people and creating a sense of community -- sharing common interests with them or sharing a laugh.  I enjoy the culture, the community it's in and the overall environment."
good,Very fast paced place with plenty of opportunities to move around. I learned my best customer service skills within working for Target. A very high class of customer service.
good,"As a target employee, you deal with so many situations and you never know what the outcome will be you just have to make the best of it, making sure every customer is satisfied."
good,"Target Corporate was wonderful to work for. Fun, fast-paced, and all around great colleagues with flexibility to show your creativity in the workplace!"
good,This is a great first job or great job in general  I worked here when I was younger but would go back if need be  it’s management is wonderful and coworkers work together for the most part
good,The company was great to work with since the leaders understand how daily life can interfere with work and they are courteous enough to work around it.
good,So far it has been a great experience for me. The management team is very helpful and always making sure you have what you need to get your job done. I just wish I could get more hours
good,Target can normally be a busy place especially during black friday. It can also be a good place to get groceries and clothes along with video games. The management their is great. The hardest part of the job was helping people find things you know where it is but can't find it.
good,Target pays really well. I was cashier was always busy and time always went buy fast. Just another retail job but was fun to work. They always gave the workers free food.
good,"Being in St. John's this place was laid back, and actually fun to go into every day. Everyone was pleasant and easy to work with. A few people had power trips but when the layoffs came they were the first to go."
good,I worked for almost a year and had a rough time when feeling unsupported by my manager but overall was a nice place for an in between job. Left because I had another thing lined up and didn't feel like coming back. Weird changes in company left many people a tither.
good,The company  offers great benefits.  It is very fast paced and competitive .You typically work 4 days a week and 10-12 hrs shifts. The company also offers great pay. However  management  is very controlling.
good,"Loved working here, fast paced and you learn big corporation rules and regulations. It was tough but it was worth it. I loved the times when it was dead because theres not much to do, and the little that you do is easy."
good,I've worked for target for over a year and it's a great environment and I love my coworkers. Management can be disagreeable at times but they're fair and we really are a team! I love target and I love the family that I have become a part of.
good,"Overall, management is friendly and good to work with. Typical problems working in retail exist, but aren't as bad as most places. Pay is excellent compared to other retail stores."
good,"not bad for a started job or even a side job but I wouldn't personally recommend it as a full time job, can be boring. Worth the money though, especially if you're comfortable with people"
good,"Though my time was only a summer position, I enjoyed every minute of it. Always remained busy, which made the time go by fast. Also would be asked on input on ideas, making the associates voices heard."
good,Target by far was my best job. The team is amazing and everyone is very helpful. Does become very competitive when trying to advance within the company.
good,"Overall the job is nice, good benefits, and not too stressful."
good,"The people I worked with were fun and nice, however, the expectations were insane. I was expected to clean the same area someone was given when working an 8-hour shift and I was only working a 4-hour shift."
good,"I loved Target, great workers, upbeat atmosphere and a good paying job. I made some forever friends and it was nice being a part of the team. I have fond memories at Target! Also, I did a great number of red card sales for the company and I was recognized quite often for this, my first year I had 300 or more red card sales.....Target in Philadelphia is ready great place to work!"
good,Seasonal position with full time/part Time position available. Being able to work alone and as a team is necessary part of the job. Coming to work and being there was not a struggle the environment makes it easy to get through your shift with no problems.
good,"I was hired on originally as seasonal Consumables stocking. "
good,"I was just working at Target for some extra money but i enjoyed working there so much, one of my favorite places to work, very flexible with the hours and accommodated everyone."
good,I remember the teamwork and the good management at the target store employees and people were always nice and willing to help fellow employees with task. It was great
good,great until the Target Corporation resructured and did away with some positions giving more responsibility with very little more money to existing positions.
good,"Target is a high energy store and fun people to work for , target has to be the funnest place i had ever worked for , they are flexible with schedules and managers are always with a great attitude"
good,Ot was a good plase to work but a little nerve racking Some guess had issues  if you can handle people attitude and you are nice and friendly then this is the job for you..
good,"It was a great company to work for unfortunately  they left Canada, coworkers  and employees  and store manager great to work with , the store manager was  good communicator , if they were open I would have  still been working there."
good,"Target has been hands down the best job I've had so far. Very good working conditions, customers aren't as rude as places like walmart, staff is very nice, the have a very good and positive environment, overall it's a very good place to work."
good,"I worked in the soft lines department. All of the employees were incredibly kind, but the work was very very tiring. Cashiering was taught as well, I was never thrown in alone. Although I was very busy constantly in the back, answering phones and cleaning, it kept me busy."
good,"Target is a great retailer to work for. Plenty of benefits even for part-time employees. Management is wonderful at my store. You are able to work in multiple departments if you choose and can pick up shifts from other co-workers where needed. Sometimes it is necessary in order to get the hours you need, as my store is unable to give me 40 hours a week."
good,Variety of work. Dealing with public is fun. You learn to work as a team. They work with your availibity. Let you be you  care about your needs. Give feedback on performance
good,"learn to communicate with employees when problem consist, patience, determination, self endurance, working for a fast place environment, staying on task, staying motivated and maintaning goals"
good,"Love making customers feel good, I try to get more than one thing done for example if two customers need help i won’t have no problem with doing that I’m a fast polite worker."
good,"Although I was able to work there, I couldn’t do my job well and had some frustration due to being under 18. However it was a good job that paid well and would want to work there again"
good,"a great typical place to work with a lot of benefits, definitely time well spent there excellent place to work I had a great time working here with great opertunities"
good,This is a warehouse facility. It's hot in the building when it's hot outside and it's cold in the building when it's cold outside. The culture is fairly relaxed.
good,Enjoy working there but management can be rough at times sometimes dont know how to talk to you and treat you like your a human sometimes also dont show you respect either
good,"The management team was very respectful and willing to teach"
good,High paced but your co workers made a very welcoming environment for the staff and customers. The communication was efficient and the division of work was great.
good,"A typical work day when working was to get all my equipment that I needed. Then heading to my apartment and check to see what was done or had to be done, I would walk to the backroom and get the push on U- Boats to stock my departments. I would zone my area, do the reshop."
good,"It wasn't tough to work there but they are extremely worried about you working as fast as you can at all times. We did get breaks from time to time but it was mostly all about pushing products onto the floor. You worked closely with other team members so you had a good chance to just push and talk, which is nice. The worst part about the job are the guests, but you tend to just get used to them. Overall, not a bad job and they pay pretty well for the work you do."
good,It was a very nice place for a first job. I couldnt have gotten luckeir there is decent pay and plenty of room to move up in the company. I have friends who work there still and they enjoy it.
good,The people are very friendly and welcoming. The work load is bearable. It can sometimes be overwhelming but there is always someone willing to help in any way they can.
good,"Very focused on productivity and the customer service. Learned a lot about how to handle a multitude of situations, cash handling skills and other usual skills."
good,I enjoyed working at target there was lots of  opportunities for advancement.  I really enjoyed working in softlines and the jewelry department .  I haven’t worked at target in over 10 years.
good,"Most of the employees were nice and the job itself was relatively easy. Good hours, simple training, and a lot of ability to move up or move departments within the store."
good,Company is going through a change at the moment and there is a lot of confusion at the moment. I have enjoyed working at my Target. I have learned a lot during my time at Target.
good,A very mature and employee centric Organisation. Management are sensitive towards the employees.Committed towards the society by giving back to Under privilege children through making education accessible to them.
good,Good place to work they pay good it's hard work sometimes but the pay keeps you going. The people help each other and the manager looks out for every one.
good,Target was an ok place to work management was good but the hours were not the best I did get discounts which were ok if you wanted more hours you had to pick up shifts electronically but no  guarantees that any shifts were available.
good,Enjoyed other staff and mostly stress free work environment. Great benefits for part time and full time employees. Would recommend as a good starting job to young cashiers or teens.
good,"It’s overall a good place to work. They’re willing to bend over backwards to accommodate just about any type of schedule so it is perfect for a job to mix with school or another job. It’s good, positive work in a great environment as long as you can keep a positive attitude and enjoy yourself. The cons are though that it is a very difficult place to get reliable full time hours and sometimes you get good leaders and sometimes you don’t."
good,Target is a place with good customer service. Their is always a guest that needs your help. They appreciate the kindness and the teamwork throughout the store.
good,"A great place to work where I would come in about 5 mins early, put all my stuff away then I check in and begin my day on the job. A typical day would look like making sure on the clothes that are returned or left somewhere get sorted and put back. Check for tags, if it doesn't have a tag ten try and find on the zebra and print out a new tag. Also being able to help any customer that has a question"
good,"I thought it was a pretty good place to be working. It is a dead-end though, whatever job you get you to stay, there is not much room for growth and the management team is not the friendliest."
good,Working at target was a little stressful at times but overall it was a relaxed and fun environment. i wish i could of learned and grew a bit more while i was there.
good,"A typical day at work consisted (for me) of running registers and helping to check guests out quickly and accurately. Guests at Target were typically much more understanding about the potential for longer waits than the average shopper. Reasonably speaking: expect roughly one ""rude"" customer a month and continue to treat them with civility regardless. Upper management was generally flexible and helpful, but mid-level management tended not to be. The workplace culture was very positive; I got along great with most of my coworkers and really enjoyed my time there."
good,"Team Members at Target are flexible and willing to assist whenever it’s needed."
good,Your time flies when your working with your friends!There is no problem staying busy.I love the team building moments they have everyday and meeting so that everyone is included in on what's going on each morning.
good,"There is room for advancement. Work "
good,It's a great place to work. Just very fast paced. It was like a big family. Management was great but had their off days which everyone has an off day. Was overall a good job. If you are looking to work here I recommend it just get ready to work hard and fast.
good,"I loved the culture at this job, I learned so much not only from my coworkers but from the customers as well. They also have a great security system that makes you work secure."
good,"Frequently snacks/cold medicine in the break room.  Managers care about the employees.  The break room included 2 fridges, lockers, couches, tables, a TV, board games, and often times food.  When they made big sales, they would get a meal catered for the employees."
good,"Typical day includes, pulling product, stocking department and maintaining well zoned work area."
good,"When working the line there where lots of knowledgeable team members who helped look out for you and helped teach. The supervisor not only was constantly around to help, they also made sure to help where needed if someone was out that day"
good,"I think overall, though I haven't been there long, that Target is a good place to work - especially as someone who is new to the working world.. and that they treat both employees and customers fairly and are very welcoming. they are willing to compensate for life events and are accommodating in benefits and time-off requests."
good,"management would often compensate employees for hardwork that showed, by having deserts, or goodies in the break room. they also had board games and movies for staff to enjoy on their time. most employees were friendly and worked well with others."
good,"Overall, working at target was an enjoyable experience. IF you are fast paced and driven you will do very well there. Corporate cares about it's employees, so it nice. But, retail is retail so it is challenging."
good,A typical day at Target was always quick-paced and exciting. I was never bored while working there. At Target I learned how to manage multiple things at once and how to use my time most effectively. The management was pretty decent overall but had a few flaws. The overall workplace culture was always very collaborative and everyone working there would always help you out if you needed help or had a question. The thing I liked most about working at Target  was the technical aspects of the job and learning how the computer software at Target works.
good,Target was a wonderful job that i would love to go back to. The store was organized wonderfully and the management really connected with each employee rather it was helping them with the job or life outside of Target
good,Overall a wonderful place. The specific target I worked at seemed to be a test store so the managers were constantly being replaced and the store went through 2 remodels. A whole overnight team with full time status was reduced to part time due to a new store being built
good,"Enjoy working with all the employees. Enjoy the events we have for employees in the break room. Management listens to our needs."
good,Everyone was friendly and understanding. They provided free lunch on Saturdays during the Christmas season. If you do your job nothing to complain about.
good,"Arrive at work. Look for any new work orders, prioritize my work load for the day, along with what preventative tasks that were required on that certain day"
good,Target does a great job of finding ways to reward their employees for their work. There are many bonuses available and opportunities for advancement are evident.
good,"As a cashier, your day to day is 90% guest relation. Depending on your location and the demands of the guests, you may get into stocking the front end of the store so it does require some organization and attention to detail."
good,"A typical day at work was to clean the clothing department and make it look visually appealing and neat. I would also run the fitting room when needed, and be a back-up cashier if the lines up front got too long. I helped unload new merchandise and restock items in the clothing department. I would periodically help guests find items that they were looking for in the store."
good,Working part time here is pretty nice. the closing leads are very understanding and empathetic toward employee concerns. I appreciate the experience and knowledge i was able to gain from this position
good,"the pay was very low and raises were extremely low and only yearly. the opportunity for advancement did not seem to be shared fairly among the team members. It seemed that you had to be in with the click of bosses friends or dating one of the bosses to get a promotion. Because all of the bosses just about dated each other, which made it hard for anyone outside that friend/dating circle to receive a promotion"
good,The people there are very professional and caring. They show the upmost respect for others and always understand the situations that they are dealt with. They show great ambition ti ensure that everyone there completes there work and will always eager to assist the clients with any needs
good,"Great place to work, and friendly people. As an electronics customer associate you are able to make decisions on your own without a managers approval for some tasks such as price markdowns."
good,Target is a very cool place to work. The guests are almost always friendly and polite. It is a happy environment and we look out for one another. The managers are always willing to do what they can to  accommodate you and co-workers are always there to give a helping hand.
good,"fast pace throughout the day, goal minded task, customer interactions and friendly atmosphere. multiple job task, and a daily forecast morning and evening huddles."
good,"Target Has great people that work there, who are always willing to help. I always feel welcomed whenever I come to work. There are usually treats for staff in the break room, and employees get rewarded for good work."
good,"Walking into my Target store to start my shift included a numerous amount of greets from the Team Leaders. I would head over to my assigned register and start my transactions. I learned a lot about different types of customers and how to handle them. The management team was pretty fun to be around and not at all intimidating. I think the hardest part about the job was having almost all of the registers open during Black Friday and the excessive amount of activity caused some to shut down, but the most enjoyable part was the few employees who chipped in and bought dinner for the rest of the employees who couldn't be home on Thanksgiving."
good,I love working at target and when black fridays came loving seeing all the customers coming in to get items that was on sale how they all had smiles on their faces made me feel happy just working signing the customers up for a Red Card or Credit Card telling them how they can also save an extra 10% with their purschase.
good,"I have worked at Target for about 5 years, and I have really grown since working there. They are a great company to work for, and the workplace culture is very collaborative. The people are mostly always positive. Target is in a competitive area of business, so things are always changing and it can be difficult at times."
good,"Very fast paced and overall a good work environment. Great people that are most always willing to help out. My only negative words are there are some managers (not all) will look at you like a number. It’s all about cartons per hour to them they will randomly stop by, have absolutely no idea what’s going on and just assume you’re working slowly and get on you about picking up the pace because you’re not moving fast enough."
good,"Opportunities available for a variety departments.  The work is quick but fulfilling, Advancement opportunities are available for those willing to work for them."
good,"You’ll be doing the exact same thing everyday so prepare for that. Guest are rude and there’s absolutely no disrespecting them or making faces, gets you fired real quick"
good,Do your job and go home. Not here for friends here to make more money.. I think if you pay by experience and not ppl make the same as a person that been doing this for over 20 years
good,Management and everybody else was nice. Overall great place to work. Can be fast paced or really slow. Flexible scheduling was nice. I would work there again.
good,As a cashier you can talk to guests and have fun with your job along with your co-workers and get involved in a lot of different out going experiences that some companies don’t do.
good,"Strong business partnerships are imperative to be successful, utilize and build a strong network to reach out to. Those leaders who are engaging and expiring will most likely be a great fit."
good,"While every jobs have their flaws, Target does an amazing job at analyzing and approaching any problems to fix them and making the workplace an overall good environment."
good,My time at target was great but my time was short. had long lunch breaks and plenty of hours lots of different things to do during my employment that helped
good,You learn a lot and unlimited options to cross train if you show up on time for every shift and do you work at an efficient hustle. The culture depends on you. If you go starting drama it will return go and do your job the best you can and you will succeed.
good,"Payment was fair for the work, management was not very understanding of issues with availability.   It was a fun workplace and very interactive with others, but the managers felt disconnected at times, and scheduling was difficult."
good,"Everyone is extremely kind , once every two weeks they bring lunch for the whole store. They let your work know it’s appriciated and management works just as hard as a normal team member."
good,"Helping customers when needed.  I worked in many departments. Target cross trains most of the employees to cover other tasks when needed.  Every week the scheduled hours for the employees are different which depends how many sales the store received.  The hours are not consistent every week. This company would be good for only high school/college students that are not trying to make a living. The early morning shift (before store opens) do not get 40 hours per week, and management sends the employees home early before their scheduled shift.  I can't speak if any changes in this today, but rating when I worked from 2004-2011."
good,"Able to work with what hours I'm available and still puck up extra shifts if need be or possible, fair work load, great co workers and managers, always something to do and learn on a daily basis."
good,"great team work, hard workers, flexible hours i learn to be quick on my feet. how to work in a safe environment, keep my self busy work in a steady place"
good,"Target is a good place to work in retail. Management is great and supportive; they build you up instead of keeping you down. Scheduling is flexible, but you may end up working odd hours during the holidays and inventory. If you are looking to advance, promotion is a real possibility. In assets protection, you will be given all the tools you need to do your job well. Be aware that you may be expected to come in early or stay late as needed, without advance notice. This is a great job for a young person, but for someone who is older or has kids, it is doable but difficult."
good,This is one of the most fun jobs I’ve worked . I’ve met so many people just by cashiering and it’s amazing how diverse our world is . I’m a introvert but this job made me feel more outgoing.
good,"a typical day at work would be clocking in, opening a register and helping guests, and selling Red Cards. obviously it wasn't that simple, i would strike conversation with the guests in my lane."
good,"3/12hr shifts-4/10hr shifts do stretching, get updates find your job assignment for the day then go to work,you either receive trucks, pick orders,putaway pallets,or load"
good,Would have worked there longer but unfortunately life threw me some curve balls that caused me to have to move from my job. Would love to work there again
good,"Pretty intense job depending on the time of day. Some coworkers didn't seem to follow rules, or really care about their job. Not a bad place to work, however."
good,"Being regular helps us work better."
good,"Management was great"
good,Loved it there. Just wanted to move up quicker but everyone knows that comes with time. I would go back and work there if I could. No matter the day the morale was great
good,"Target is a fun place to work at but the hardest part is dealing with managers who literally don't remember what it was like to be a regular shmegular employee. They go on power trips so often and don't always lead by example. They like to sit in the back and always say they have a schedule to make but when you go back there they are just hanging out and gossiping. They, most times, do the bare minimum and then require the most from you. The majority doesn't lead by example and it's hard to want to do your job when you keep catching your manager not do anything while supposedly working on the schedule everyday. The good thing is that the job is perfect for students of all ranks. They work with students and make it easy to make money while going to school. It's not a hard job and it's super manageable. I loved working at Target but management was terrible. So many people complained about that but agreed the job was fun. You make friends there and it makes everything so much better."
good,"It was a very fun place to work at, my shchedule was always different and there was over time. My coworkers were the fun part and sometimes the customers."
good,I was a temporary employee hired for the holidays and I really enjoyed working on the flow team. The job was low stress and as someone who actually enjoys organizing things it was fun. I would unpack boxes and stock shelves making sure merchandise was in the correct spot. Flow team is a great option for anyone working in retail who would prefer not to be at the front of the store and is willing to lift and move boxes and merchandise. I also liked that everyone on flow had relatively the same hours and everyone took their break together.
good,I had a great time working for target. My first month on the job I got promoted to a Guest service role at the front end of the store. I did have a bad experience towards the end with my Guest service manager who poorly managed our department.
good,"the SFS team worked very hard, the job often had a sort of ""random"" difficulty curve, some days it was incredibly easy no matter how fast we were working, other times it was much more difficult. Managers and co-workers were all very kind and understanding, for seasonal work it was great if they had offered to keep me I would have stayed."
good,"Very progressive company they start you off with great pay they understand that as a student I have needs, I love that when I requested a day off that I was able to get the day I wanted"
good,"Compensation is great, because they ask a lot of you, which is to be expected. Each day brings something new and exciting. Always learning and growing. Certainly never a dull moment."
good,Overall it’s an awesome place to work at you just have to be prepared to be a team member that they can count on when times get super busy. Target in general is a great place to benefit from.
good,"I hated that I was ONLY a cashier 100% of the time.  Management was fair and just and helped me improve.  I felt like my expectations were not only reasonable, but gave me a good attitude that gave me better work ethic.  The hardest part of the job for me was keeping up with the strange, inconsistent times they scheduled me.  Most enjoyable was how friendly everyone was, as well as meeting new people every single day."
good,Working at Target will boost your communication skills you will meet new people and tell/hear different stories. Some of the employees are a big help others are just nonchalant.
good,Everyone was always doing something even when there is nothing to work on. Team members were always able to go to each other for help. Enjoyed every day working there
good,Never being released on time and management is very tough. They aren't very reasonable. Makes your job a lot harder than it needs to be. The job itself is great and the people you work with.
good,"I was a minor working part time during my employment at Target. I worked most weekends, no more than 4 hours a shift and sometimes during the week. Great manager. Everyone was upbeat and seemed happy to be there. Would recommend for a part time or first time job!"
good,"Very friendly, and open productive environment. I like the people I had the pleasure of working with, and supervision over seeing the work. I felt welcome from the first day I started."
good,Great place to work but very hard to move up and pay is not a living wage in this world now but it's improving it's very hard to move up in the company
good,"I am currently still employed with target which I can’t say too much bad about it, except I wish I had a set schedule. One week I can go for working 20 hours a week and then go down to 8 a week which isn’t right. I’ve spoken to the Hiring manager but it’s like nothing has changed. Other than that everything is great. I love how I can interact with my guest and my managers and coworkers are also easy to get along with and very welcoming."
good,All of the managers are nice and it is a friendly workplace. Good customer service experience. Very organized workplace. Good place to work if you enjoy working with others.
good,"Most of the position is spent assisting guests, as well as tidying up your assigned areas to make the store tidy and well kept. Good knowledge of the store layout is important in helping guests find their goods."
good,"Ask Questions, A Lot Of Question. It May Be Annoying But If You Fully Know Your Areas You’ll Become Manager, If You’re Looking For It, In Less Than 6 Months."
good,"watch the lanes, make sure that guest service stays brand and up to date. Keep on top of the breaks, make sure that the cashiers are askin gfor red cards"
good,I honestly enjoyed working at target the energy from management and everyone that worked there was great. Everyone is really a team player and they make sure you don't miss your meals (breaks).
good,"Not a bad place to work in the ship from store department. The typical day doesn't have many surprises, and has enough structure to not cause much stress."
good,I loved  working in target. coworkers were fun. never had a problem with them. managers were very leaning and respectful. always was there to help if needed
good,"It is a little stressful working because when loading trucks, I was assigned to five trailers on average and I had to keep going from trailer to trailer in order to keep the product moving. And sometimes, some trailers would get backed up if that specific trailer was getting a lot of freight."
good,"Overall the experience at target was good, and so were the co-workers they make and help everything sail smoother with that said the only thing that sucked about target was the schedule they want you to complete 40 hours before Saturday not being able to do any over time unless given permission. If you’re scheduled for an 8 hour shift it’s more than likely you will stay longer than that. The supervisors are pretty cool as for the managers not so much"
good,"A typical day at work is signing in and putting up your coat as well as putting your belongings in a locker, if you had any to put away. The overall environment is friendly and almost everyone keeps to themselves, but not in a negative manner. As a Cashier you would send yourself right out to the front, locate the schedule and your Supervisor, and begin work once instructed on where to begin your shift. The hardest part of the job was definitely the holiday season, but that was to be expected of a seasonal job. The amount of discounts and agitated customers can be overwhelming, but that is to be expected from a retail job. Luckily, most of the departments of the company keep up-to-date with their duties, but occasionally some problems overlap (especially around Christmas) and things can get awfully hectic. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a sense of community and the enjoyable customer scattered through the wind (not really, there are quite a few). My biggest complaint would be that Management is constantly missing from their office and although their absences are posted on a white board on their door, it's still difficult to decipher when they will actually return/be available. This makes discussing certain topics hard to discuss. Luckily, schedule changes weren't too difficult to process as there were other HR members to speak to as well as two additional methods to changing your schedule, so the company lived up to its promise of a ""flexible schedule."" As a Seasonal Cashier I'd give Target a 4/5 at most."
good,"The experience working at Target was great. I loved the people and the ability to go in and stay busy. I spent my time stocking, helping customers, and going to the front as a cashier when backup was needed. The hardest part of this job were the early hours."
good,The overall working experience was good for me but i was fired for no reason and the managers dont really seem to be in tuned with everything going on.
good,day to day was fairly easy.  I worked in the back so I was allowed to listen to my own music as long as I could still hear the radio if I was called for something.  I only worked the xmas season so from about early November to January only.  I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Typical day at work is clocking in, and getting an assigned task/location for the day.Then its just getting through your average retail work, and then you go home."
good,"It is a good place to live. If one is working with the right supervisor, you can advance quickly. However, the schedule and shift change a lot which lead to instability"
good,"Overall i liked working at Target it was very easy because i always had something to do, the days always went by fast and i would definitely recommend working there to a friend. All of the co workers i had were very easy to get along with."
good,Target is staying on course when it comes to paying employees $15.00 per hour by 2020. Currently being paid $13.39 an hour for a cashiers job. 3 raises within 1 year.
good,"Work days, depending how much work had been done the shift before you, could vary from short to very long. I learned alot about customer service. The management could have been better. The culture was fun and friendly. The hardest part was the chaos during holidays. the most enjoyable part was making new friends that I worked with."
good,"The work here is sometimes stressful, but with the help of the people you work with, that stress often fades away. My experience with Target was overall a great one. The people I met and worked with there became like family. At Target, I saved up and paid my way though college (Two Year degree in Criminal Justice at Kankakee Community College), saved up enough for two (used) cars, and saved around 15,000 before fulfilling my dream and moving to Florida. Target does a wonderful job working around school schedules. I loved most of my time at Target, and often look back fondly at those days."
good,"As a hardlines employee I had to be well versed and trained in back-stocking goods, being a cashier, customer service, stocking shelves, and cleaning areas. The workplace culture was very warm and it was fun relatively. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers many can be very unreasonable and hard to work with."
good,"Having worked for the Target Corporation for going on 3 years I learned that the quality of work ethic varies from store to store. "
good,"This is a good company to work for. It gives you the opportunity to grow both personally and professionally. It's a friendly atmosphere where team members go to work ready to learn, task and service the guest."
good,"I work in the inbound department, the work can be very labor intensive if you work in the ART department. My operations mgr. is very competent and easy to get along with, and culture is pretty laid back. However there is a disconnect between tenured employees and new employees likely due to the high turnover rate. Overall, the pay is competitive, and there is over time available."
good,"Target is a good company to work for and has great benefits "
good,"Target always has its employees busy. There is always work to be done and management is a little shotty, but what it lacks it makes up in employee compensation starting at $12.00 an hour."
good,"It was a temporary position with a chance to grow into permanently depending on your evaluation from a manager. It was a group effort, more team oriented with the perks of great ways to earn bonuses."
good,working there was a great time because we get to work together and bond with our co-workers. It was a good environment considering that my entire family worked there.
good,"Working at target was pleasant.   I learn inventory, stock and displaying merchandise throughout the store. My coworkers or pleasant to work with.  My supervisor was nice and fear. I did not work at target for long period of time."
good,"My experience was an ongoing  disconnect with scheduling working hours.  Despite the protocols for providing the company with available days.  They continually, scheduled employees, mostly students and young parents with days and hours, when they were otherwise engaged.  This practice resulted in a revolving door effect on new hires."
good,"I worked hardlines at target for over a year now. Most days, the job is pretty good and helping customers is the best part. Of course, holidays are extremely busy but they do give you a lot of hours. The worst part can be certain team leads who take it easy all the time but expect you to pick up their slack to make them look good."
good,"Fort the most part, working at Target is very enjoyable. Fellow coworkers are like family, and the managers are very good with giving their workers a chance to correct bad habits or mistakes. However, it can be a bit hard to get scheduling changed along with availability, and there have been problems with the attitudes of a few coworkers in the area I worked in."
good,"Target is a great place to work. There are opportunities to grow in your career, and the managers are hard workers and lead by example. Customers are the priority. Team work is encouraged all the time. It is a multicultural work place and everone is welcomed.  It is a great place to work while you go to school because they help you accomodate your school schedule."
good,It is a pretty decent place to work. The employees are mostly nice and most of the managers are about their business and wont bother you too much once they understand your work ethic.
good,"So many smart people to learn from with world class development opportunities. I have not worked anywhere else that compares to Targets development offerings."
good,Its A great job especially if you like to be given a task to complete and be left alone. Management was really very helpful but sort of hot headed. Sometimes they would put food in the break room for everyone to eat
good,"Since working at target it’s good but I wouldn’t go back,m. It’s a great starter job. My position was logistics I unloaded the trucks and pushed to the sales floor. In my position it was high paced but manageable."
good,i was relaxed and calm when working here it was always quiet but still busy at times. The break room was always clean and big with food and tv for entertainment.
good,Target is very laid back. The company culture and management are fairly easy going. Team Members are always great to work with and it's tough to not like most in not all of the Team Leads
good,"The workplace culture at Target is the best part of working at Target. It's very relaxed, friendly, and very team-based."
good,"good company and room for advancement if wanted. Good training on and off stage. Good benefits for employees. Well run company, and stores. Great asso"
good,I enjoyed the employees very much. We became like family. Management was very fair. It was hard work at times with so many deadlines but attainable. There was room for growth and advancement.
good,Target is a really great company!  You are compensated well but you will earn your money.  Your work schedule is flexible.  Target is all about talent.  You can do well with this company.  Target will push you to develop as an individual.
good,Focus the day on our guests helping them find what they came in for.  When not with our guest use time to push product and maintain the store zone.  As a leader it is my responsibility to oversee the team and make the tasks are done.  I also work toward team development for those who are interested in furthering their career with Target.
good,"The only reason I am looking somewhere else is at my level the schedule is fixed. And I have things outside of work that make me miss parts of the day that I can't make up. This wouldn't be an issue if I moved up. But I can't move up since I am missing parts of the day occasionally. Great place to work otherwise."
good,"i only work part time sometimes as a cashier and sometimes on self checkout which i run 8 self checkout stations "
good,"Target was a great opportunity for growth, leadership, and independence. So for growth I went from a team member to a Supervisor. Leadership showed me how to take advantage of a situation or opportunity for the better. Lastly Target showed me independence with allowing me to oversee a great team and to learn with as well."
good,Target rewards people who think on their feet and is good to their employees. They take care of their people and give you the freedom to make choices to better do your job.
good,"Target is a great company to work for, very easy to move up inside the company. They give you great opportunities to advance your career also amazing benefits. Also some really great people to work with."
good,"- Good company"
good,The job itself was not too difficult but the workload per person was high.  Cutting hours back but still wanting the same amount of work with less people to be finished in a timely manner
good,"A fast-paced work environment that allows you to dictate how fast and quickly you move up. Management is very keen on talent and is  quick to move team members up if they're interested. Workplace culture is great as long as you have an HR that is heavily involved with the team. It's a great place to start and learn about the retail world. Again, you get out of it what you want...those who are heavily involved will learn the ins and outs of a big box retailer. In the short years that I've worked there, I've learned a wealth of knowledge that I know I will carry throughout my life."
good,"My main priority as a guest service cashier is to provide quality customer service and to answer any  questions guests might have about any of our products or services to ensure their return.  When operating the cash registers, we ring up any purchases and aid guests in  performing returns and refunds. We are also in charge of organizing and stocking shelves,  and keeping an overall clean and organized work area. In addition, I am also in charge of  training any new team members on becoming cashiers and facilitating their transitions into their specific job positions."
good,The work culture is great. Everyone helps each other out when possible. Hours are flexible but it is recommended that you have a open availability if you want 40 hours a week.
good,love working here. everyone was friendly. very flexible. very helpful.learned new techniques. learned a new vibe. lots of patience. organized time schedule.
good,It was a great time working at Target. All the managers were great. The job is easy and not heavy. They help you a lot if you need to take some time off.
good,"You can be the hardest worker there, but if you're anything but agreeable you won't get far, even with a degree. They would rather promote their friends."
good,You work hard for your money but the pay is amazing. Outbound is the hardest department to work in. If you don't mind hard work I would apply. It can be hard to get on with Target DC but keep trying it is worth it.
good,"Fun and energetic workplace, with an awesome management team who care about their staff . The staff are like a family and communication is great .I  love this job and would accept an position as one opens."
good,"Fun job, learned a lot about this kind of visual merchandising, a lot of freedom in what I wanted to do for the store and listen to the ideas helpong drive sales, but also a lot of misscommunication and chaos in communication between management and team members."
good,"The hardest part of the job for me is leaving my work unfinished. If its been a long day and we get behind I always want to stay and get the workload complete, but my management would rather me go home and it will be dealt with the following day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when your department has a good team. We have been through a lot of upper management changes, a remodel, as well as lower level employee hires/fires/seasonal etc. but once a good team is established and duties are all regulated to specific team members based on their abilities it makes for a fantastic work environment. The worst thing is when a good team member or manager leaves the company, but it's usually for a better opportunity or advancement within the company."
good,"From offloading trucks to running the merch out onto the floor you don't get much of a chance to rest, and you're always getting pushed to go faster, to be more precise, to do more by the shift leads. A back brace and some leather gloves would go a long way if you're considering working in a Target backroom."
good,Target was fun and face paced.Learned a lot of new things and met a lot of great people. The discounts were great also. Had a lot going on at the time so I couldn't continue working there with the transportation and time that I had
good,Working at Target is a pretty rewarding experience. The guests are almost always happy to receive your help and the team environment makes the job pretty enjoyable.
good,Target wasn't a bad job and I did really enjoy it for the time I worked there. The employees and management were very nice and they cared about the employees and there opinions very much. Overall the job was pretty great and my experience there was great and I learned a lot  with the very little time I was there.
good,"My mangers were great, the entire team was fun, kind, and hard working. It's a face paced job and you definitely have to pay attention to details. But, they have great benefits and you can pretty much work whenever you want."
good,"Target is an amazing corporation to work for!  The focus on being competitive in the market does not compromise the team's integrity nor productivity.  I do strongly believe that its a corporation that takes development seriously and therefore will continue to have steady growth versus its competitors."
good,"Operate forklift to unload and load trucks. I learned how to operate heavy equipment, palletize freight, and inventory. Went through so many mgrs. Workplace culture could of been better."
good,"I've worked retail now for upwards of ten years, the ever changing landscape has pushed Target to re-invent some of the things they were so reliant on. I would say now is the time for someone that has a knack for innovation, and a passion for an ever changing atmosphere to join."
good,My review would be working at target means u have fun friendly people to be with and that’s great I suggest that you should work at target to have fun like me
good,Working here can be fun if you are okay with them moving you around and switching up your position a lot. They look for people who are okay with basically helping out in every part of the store.
good,Target was a positive work environment that focused on keeping up with a customer driven business.  Target was an ever changing job on a daily basis that requires adaptable from their employees.  I enjoyed working for Target and would recomend it as a good place to work.
good,"Amazing people and an environment where I was challenged at every turn. However- there was one thing I didn’t like, expectations sometimes were unclear. I would be assigned a project with loose guidelines and turn it in on time to specifications. I’d then be told I did the project wrong. I’ve since learned to communicate better- to ask my supervisor if I have questions."
good,"The job pays well, better then most places in my town. Staff is friendly. Schedule is flexable. Yearly raises. It is retail so you deal with a lot of people"
good,Not a bad way to earn some money during holiday season. Earned more than a starting cashier though the hours were rough having to wake up early in the morning for a 4AM start time.
good,"Great job easy to keep, work wasn’t bad sometimes to much work not enough workers, great for people in school or that like fast pace and energetic positive positions"
good,"Your day will involve many different responsibilities, which vary from day to day. You will need to be very flexible because if you wish to ascend to management, you will eventually learn the key elements of all positions. Management is amicable, albeit at times officious. The corporate culture is very welcoming and inclusive. The hardest part of the job is either the repetitive nature of the work, or the occasional implacable guest, while the most enjoyable part is the people you work with."
good,"Target is a great place to work, they are extremely flexible with hours, vacation time, and are extremely understanding. I would reccomend working here to a friend."
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Target. Target sets people up with a great work ethic and heavily focuses on growth of its people. I believe that Target is making the right steps to remain competitive.
good,"Target has been a great place for me to work since I had started college.  I've been with the company for 8 years, and there is always something new going on.  There can be high stress days where work load can seem overwhelming, and days where managers aren't much help.  Most managers are actually really fun when you get to know them.  Biggest problem was work/life ratio.  It's retail, so I was stuck on every other weekend, and I might come in at 8am one day, and 3pm the next day.  There was just no consistency to it.  Other team members, in order to get 40 hours, would pick up shifts, and sometimes be working over 15 days in a row, and still not have their 40 hours.  Room for advancement is ok if the store has a spot to fill, but if you're trying to advance without an open spot, it's extremely hard."
good,Great first job! I loved this place and wish I never left. Manager wasn't the nicest but other than that it was great! Most coworkers are friendly and very helpful.
good,Working at target has pushed my limits of working long hours and being on my feet. At first I was struggling to keep up now everything runs smooth. You wouldn’t be disappointed working here
good,"All of the workers are so eager to welcome you into the work place. You are truly able to create friends. Although guest service is difficult to manage, the tasks and their outcomes are rewarding"
good,"I've been with the company for 4 years now,target is a geart place to work.only thing is lack of hours.im am 33 years old with 2 children  my job title there is price accurcy im only getting 15-25 hours not enough for a place of my own."
good,"The management I worked under in Capitola was incredible. i learned how to be a leader, utilize strengths, and colaborate within my team to obtain the best results."
good,"I was a floater pharmacist and licensed in NC and SC so I would travel between two states which became a bit much for me.  Overall, good company when it was Target."
good,"Everyday was a new experience, team moral was great but during holiday and seasonal periods things could get stressful. Most enjoyable part was building the team and seeing your team advance"
good,Great working environment. I had a great manager who listened to my concerns. good teams and flexible hours when needed. the company should work  on helping the stores mange better hours for employees
good,"A typical day working as a cashier start with checking in and going to the floor manager to see where he or she wants you to be. After that is just being a cashier and when its not busy making sure you station and surrounding stations are clean.If its really slow then your floor manager might ask you to do a certain task such as re stocking or the left over or found product on the checkout lane. That is a basic day as working as a cashier at target for me at least. I was taught how to work the cashier, costumer service, re stock, and back stock. To learn new thing all you have to do is ask your floor manager. Everyone there is nice. The hardest part of the job is when the rush happens and even that's not very difficult."
good,"If you like to move around at work and constantly be on the move, Target is a good place to work at. I worked in logistics and in food so this only reflects those areas of the store."
good,Target is a fun place to work with great team members but management makes unrealistic goals for certain tasks. Team members don’t feel like they have anywhere to take their concerns without being reprimanded.
good,You start by unloading the truck then pushing product to back stocking the products that can't fit on selves.Team leads are constantly making sure you meet the goals.
good,"I really enjoyed the environment. Everyone was so nice and relaxed, even when busy. The work was nothing too complicated. Management was fair and empathetic when things sprung randomly. I would work there again."
good,The management was very organized and give good orders and training. Taught you very well and put you in different positions to work as a team. Everybody was nice and was a good work environment to work at.
good,"I loved working here, but it is your typical stocking job. It eventually became too much for me to keep waking up early and stocking shelves, my wrists began to bother me and I wanted to pursue my career goals. The culture was fantastic and the people became a second family."
good,"From day one at Target, there was always a fast paced but low intensity energy at Target that made shifts go by extremely fast. I began working there just after graduation, and they were very accomodating with the busy schedule I had. My one con was the poor team member discount (storewide 10% off)."
good,It was very fun. if you finished a job within a certain amount of time they would reward you or give a big announcement in a group meeting with everyone
good,It was ok for the most part and the hours wasn’t bad at all you can really pick up wat hours that you wanted to have and how long you worked that day.
good,The job was ok and the coworkers were very fun. The job just didnt give enough hours or good raises. They are very flexible with hours and it is good for someone just looking for a part time job.
good,Just a nice way to get into the work place. I would not recommend it to anyone who is looking to live off this job as the pay will not cover the cost of living.
good,"Relaxed job feel, heavy opportunity for advancement. Well managed departements. Low wages for normal employees so if your looking to make any headway in pay advances you need promotions."
good,"It was a great first job experience. The branch I was located at was great, they wirked around my school schedule, as well as participated in several community services. Would recommend to anyone"
good,"Work is simple and management is nice. Can be very stressful at times, but usually is slow-paced. Coworkers are nice. Managers are friendly and helpful."
good,"Management was good and they helped me with all of my concerns. Things got a little slow at times though, and the opposite happened whenever someone quit. Things would get crazy because there weren't always enough people to cover every shift."
good,"Help customers find product within the store, assisted early morning truck unloads, maintain company branding and service areas, check out and cashier duties."
good,"Great place to work!  the pay was not very good.  Some employees were difficult to work with and were rude.  Overall, I would recommend Target to young and old alike."
good,"Target has helped me grow personally. I have gained confidence as an employee, I am more open socially and since my promotion I have become a better leader of people."
good,Target is a great place to work for when in distribution. You rarely work over 44 hrs a week and you're salaried. Tools for success are lacking though when it comes to technology. Simple things that most large companies have such as online scheduling and visible productivity capabilities aren't currently available. Pay is good for how many hours you work.
good,The targets environment was very fast paced throughout the day but it was also very neat and clean and very sufficient in all aspects. I would highly recommend working at target as a first actual job it was very fun and knowledgeable.
good,"While being a clean, fun, close knit workplace everybody chooses their own select few to speak to. Often times departments conflict with each other, whether it be the mentality of ""My job is harder than yours"" or ""Your workload is in my work space"" or just people power tripping imposing their seniority, taking pride in that this individual has ""been here longer"" than you. It is a GREAT workplace, not the most amazing social atmosphere"
good,"Really enjoy working for Target. They are really family oriented which is a great atmosphere to work in. Can be challenging at times, but everyone is will to help you if you need it."
good,Your relationship with your manager will make or break your experience with Target.  Having a good manager makes for a relaxed and fun environment.  My position was challenging at times but consisted of good co-workers.
good,"Gathering team to complete tasks in a timely manner. It was hard work, but always made it fun. Learn a lot about teamwork and appreciating each other. Continuous customer service. This company provides great training in all aspects, and there is always room for advancement."
good,Fun place to work and loved the people working there. My only complaint would be the only way to deal with aggressive customers was to ask them to leave but really what else could you do.
good,"It varies with every store, but I've had great management and been generally pleased with my job. Although hours are sometimes lacking, there's always the opportunity to pick up more."
good,"I started working at Target in March 2015 as my first job under the Flow Team position. I was trained and learned how to do my job at a pace that worked for me. I have learned many skills such as unloading the truck in the morning with my team, stocking the salesfloor, how to read and understand schematics of casepacks and plan-o-grams, how to pick items from the backroom, and how to backstock. I moved into the grocery department in October 2016, and learned even more skills that were exclusive to that department, such as FIFO (rotating dates), using a date gun, etc. I got better at servicing shoppers (I have social anxiety so it was incredibly difficult at first)"
good,"Target is place where everyone works together to accomplish team goals. We want to make our guests feel welcomed and comfortable while shopping at Target. Management is friendly, and very understanding."
good,"Often at work i came in and it was fast paced , when needed i went to the to help cashier and balance the pace of the environment. The bad things about working there was i got so used to the job or them to lay me off due to seasonal employment"
good,Target was a fun place to work I would definitely work there again in the future! Also a great place to work at if you're a new worker in the job field.
good,This place is a great part time job to work for. Come to work and get your items and then stock. Break rooms are nice and big. Friendly environment and great management
good,"I was responsible for the food side of a Supertarget.  My main area was the Produce Department.  I was responsible for Quality, Sales, ordering, merchandising and Guest Service."
good,The workers at Target make the job fun and exciting. The management was at times not flexible with your schedule. Only part time is available which isn't what i was looking for
good,"A typical day included two 15 min breaks, and a 30 min lunch. Cashiering was very fast paced, with an emphasis on pushing guests to sign up for Red Cards (the store credit card)."
good,"I gave Target a 4/5 because although there is room for growth, it is unlikely that you will be moved to another department soon after starting your job if you decide that the position you were hired for is not for you. The front-end team seems to have the most opportunity for growth but it is also the most stressful area to work in of course because of being focused-solely on customer service."
good,Working at a place like Target is an excellent way to learn problem solving skills and advance your ability to deal with the public. This is amplified to eleven in the holiday season.
good,a typical day is usually has its ups and downs in terms of speed. I believe the most enjoyable part of my day is meeting all the new people and the returning faces. The overall workplace is can be high strung but the people who work there know how to do there jobs at the best of their abilities and then some. I think the hardest part of the job is when major events or holidays come up and keeping up with the inflow of people.
good,"Target was a really great job, especially to interact with people, learning how to multitask and everything. It could get a bit overwhelming at time when it was packed and customers get upset but you just have to have patience and talk with them."
good,"I worked 5 Days a week and I must say it’s a fast paced environment. The Guest Experiences are always priority. As a Target team member, we ensure that the store is always stocked, prices are always accurate, the store is neat and making sure guest find what they need, whether it’s in store or online. The managers are great. They try to work with all team members and their schedules if they are in school or have another job."
good,Extremely team oriented and large focus on reaching companies goals. Benefits are great. Management can be difficult because of high amounts of pressure from corporate.
good,It was a good wprk put so to say..fast paste .everyone is very helpful and if need anything they are willing to help..if something is wrong at home with family wrre you need to leave they  understand
good,The people that work there are really cool and it’s a fun environment to be in it’s a big store and there are lots of employees who work there and you get along with them really easy
good,Target was a great place to work for the most part. I enjoyed most of the management there. The job was easy and there was always room to move up and around and be cross trained on eveything
good,"My experience with Target has been pleasant for the most part. Working in the Cafe can be stressful, especially when I am the only one and I have a line of people waiting and I'm trying to get all their orders done on time. But for the most part it's a good place to work, I've been lucky and had very good team leaders in my time here."
good,"Great place to work even during the holidays away from you family. the ETL provides wonderful catered food to enjoy during your breaks. "
good,"I have learned a lot while working for target. They tech and teach you about all that they can.  "
good,"Everyone was super nice & helpful. Definitely big work loads, but it made your day go by fast. Drastic hours cut during the off season, only downfall."
good,"Working at Target has given me a lot of good opportunities to expand my knowledge of retail businesses. I have worked some of the most kindest people I could've ever met. At times I truly didn't want to go home after a hard shift. I just wanted to keep working with my coworkers whom I consider my second family. However, there is an issue with favoritism at the store. This has left a few of my coworkers and myself a bit angry that our hard work is being ignored."
good,Very Diverse and Culture driven company. A good place to really learn about self development as a Executive. Love the opportunity to grow within Target.
good,"i had fun unloading items, and stocking across the store, making sure each aisle and end cap looked amazing, hardest part was doing a box per minute, some took longer, but overall, i had fun."
good,"Target is a very friendly environment to work."
good,I was a supervisor of restocking the shelves.  There was 11 people under me.  As a team we restock the shelves.  Some people pull the items from and some of them stocked.
good,"It was your average weekend job where you worked Saturday, Sunday, and Monday working a 12 hour shift. Hours were hectic during the holidays but got scarce once the holidays left."
good,"Target is a great company. I would regiment to anyone looking for a job. It's great place to start. For me, I just wanted to get paid a little more. Target has a great atmosphere."
good,"A typical day at target is shorting out clothing, folding, organizing and helping out guests. I have learned how to interact with multiple types of people. Management is as to be expected they are tough when they need to be and as relaxed as they can be. The workplace culture is excepting and relaxed. The hardest part of the day is having too much to do at one time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet."
good,"Its retail. Expect people to treat you like garbage. It's just the way our culture is now. The difference with Target is that the discounts are nice, and scheduling is very flexible. I was fortunate enough to have a solid management team that possessed high integrity, so there wasn't a lot of favoritism, or nepotism. Show up on time, do the work you are assigned as quickly as you can, and engage every guest."
good,"Everyday is different and allows to not only work in one area of the store. There are many positions available for growth (with or without a degree). Target is a great place to develop many traits including business management, at all levels."
good,"Target is a wonderful place to work if you don't need to earn a large sum of money. While the pay is on the lower end of the scale, the environment is fast paced and usually fun. I worked as part of the flow and logistics team, so my shift started around 0400 every morning. Now, you have to have high energy to work a manual labor job in general, but at this location specifically, everyone around you has high energy so it was not difficult at all to adjust, adapt and become a morning person with plenty of energy to get the job done well.  I greatly enjoyed the ability to work both as a team and as an individual to get tasks done. There were many opportunities for cross training to ensure you got the hours of work you needed."
good,"Your typical day at work varies depending on your position. As a deli team member, which I was for about a year: You get there at either 7:30 AM or 3:30 PM. Find out what sales are going on so you can knowledgably inform guests. Slice a lot of meat and cheese, clean the slicers a lot, laugh at all of the jokes that guests tell you, fry chicken, stock the fridges and freezers where your products are stored, etc. It's really hard when your immediate supervisor doesn't like you that much, but that's an obstacle that can usually be overcome by working really hard."
good,I worked at Target for about 5-6 months. I honestly had a great time and wish that I did not have to leave. They hire very friendly team members so you never really have to worry about getting along with people at work because everyone is friendly. The pay for the type of job is great. I loved coming into work and talking to guests; that was the best part of the job. There is a good bit of downtime when you have slow days. The only problem I had is that my store did not have a dedicated cart attendant and I spent more than half of the time I worked there outside getting carts as I was one of only three male cashiers. There is limited room for advancement because most job positions are locked behind a degree wall. There is plenty of room to pick up more shifts if you don't get as many hours as you want.
good,On target addresses the situation of every client so that may have a chance to gain a job position and sustained income. Rarely the employees at on target find a job for their clients that has double shifts.
good,"I worked there for three years and was cross trained almost anywhere I wanted to be. I learned a lot, but most useful is HR and receiving.  The hardest part was just trying to balance school with it."
good,"My time at Target was very rewarding. I was in a new start up business at Target that was run as a stand alone operation from the main store. This allowed the team members in the location to learn multiple aspects of the business from working with vendors, purchasing, promotions, merchandising, and inventory control to scheduling, hiring and reviewing employees. It was an unique and rewarding position."
good,"Fast-paced, good co-workers and management, and a newly-remodeled store make for a pleasant work experience.  Busy hours can be stressful, but the team culture encourages cooperation between everyone."
good,"It’s a fun place to work st, meet new people, obtain new skills in customer service, working with a sense of urgency. Target is more for full time but also very flexible with employees enrolled in college for they value education"
good,"Loved working here, there were some bad employees who instigated and spread rumors like children but management was quick to correct it. Very understanding as well."
good,Good place to work. management is nice and helpful as well as associates. flexible hours  and work load was always manageable. If you showed interest they would cross train you in any field they could
good,Friendly Atmosphere with a advanced company. Great employees that interact with each other in a friendly manner. Knowing that Target changed it mindset to stay current and trendy gave one satisfaction knowing they are doing their best to beat the competition and stick around for years to come.
good,"The pay I received as a seasonal employee was awesome. They do give you holiday pay, and the perks as an employee are pretty great. "
good,"Management was great, clean and organized workplace with great people working with me. The pay was bareable for a stocker. No problems as much as most jobs in the past!"
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are looking for a job, the management is friendly and fun, depending on the day work could be fast paced or slow, everyone that I worked with was super nice, the team member discount is nice and so are the things the management puts on for the employees."
good,"Good place to work. Good working environment, projects, fat-pace, continuous learning, working on latest technologies. Bold and curious. Good for personal as well . as career growth."
good,Depending on what location you work at it is a great. you have to work really hard and show up but when you do it gets recognized. I had awesome management.
good,I was hired seasonal.  The management is so nice.   I must be in a bad area. Some of the  customers lie to get their way and try to get discounts that are not available.  I didn't get a badge and my direct deposit never worked.  I really like the scheduling ( the 4 hour shifts) the later starts.  Rather then 7am every morning.  Over all it's a good experience.
good,"As an intern you learn how to manage people and projects. You learn how to think on your feet as the managers do not always give you detailed directions. You begin to follow the motto of ""it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission"" as it can lead you up the ladder with new innovative ideas. The company culture is fun and friendly. Everyone wants to see you succeed. Make your purpose and career intentions known in the beginning and if you have as good a store manager as I did, he or she will do everything they can to get you there through constant feedback and suggestions as well as pushing you out of your comfort zone to reach greatness."
good,"My experience at Target was during the seasonal time. I was trained very well, and management was always involved. It's a fairly easy job, but you may have to learn how to cross train."
good,"Working at Target is always a good time. A very friendly and inviting environment! You learn quickly and they help you with anything you need and any questions you have. Would recommend highly, it is a great place to work."
good,"fast paced, training was good, management was amazing, good culture, just really fast paced and need to always be called for something by other Team members"
good,A typical day at Target consists of fast paced and overall fun and easy going. At Target I learned about customer service and customer satisfaction. What o enjoyed about working at Target was meeting new faces and talking to the customer's kids while checking them out at the cash register.
good,"Target is just work. Nothing more to be said about it. Just go in, do what is asked, make small talk with co-workers, finish said workload for the night and go home until the next day."
good,"A typical day at Target is a lot of fun, start coordinating with manager to see what needs to be done and the prioritize then organize with teams and work as a team to get the job done. The hardest days are the holidays it is supper busy and customer in a hurry so you have to be nice even when they are rude to you. the most enjoyable part is to see the results when we work hard as a team, and achieved goals."
good,great people to work with in a fairly fast paced environment always kept very clean which was nice considering i was in the dairy cooler most of my days
good,"The workplace is very fast-paced.A typical day for me is just cleaning up your workstation and making sure it is sanitary before turning your lane on. Then when you are not currently helping a guest, you are to stand in the front of your lane to draw in people that are looking to checkout."
good,"The overall management isn't bad at all, besides the managers pressing you to always move faster. There were many opportunities to move up and to move into different departments if you are skilled. Some days you were able to leave early because we finished early, and some days we had to stay later. Most of the time it is up to you whether or not you wish to leave early or to stay for more hours. They work with you if you are injured, but still want you to work fast."
good,"Target is an excellent place to work, the pay is pretty good, the people are generally nice, and the store looks pretty good compared to others. It can be a little rough at times, just like any other job where you deal with the public, but it's fun."
good,I would come into work and start my day by checking my emails from the night before for absences and yesterdays news. Then I would get with my team leader to discuss what is on the agenda for the day. My team leader and I get along great and we work side by side well. We enjoy working together and thinking of new ways to help our team get work done and efficiently.
good,"The hardest part of the job was unloading . unloading the trucks onto palates and dragging them to the isles that they had to be in , also taking them off the palates ."
good,"I was able to pick up the system and the job expectations within the first 2 weeks, and then again after being trained for a different job with similar hours overnight. I thought the people around me really cared about the job. I enjoyed having some 3 day weekends after working 4 days in a row. The overnight is still difficult because of difficulty in sleeping during the day."
good,Working at Target is good in Human Resources. My everyday job is one that I diligently work at due to it entails with the hiring process of employees.
good,I loved this place because of the way o could work with the staff their. They all are amazing people could have asked foe any other chance. This place felt like home.
good,I love the job and I need the excercises for my diabetes. Its only a part time job and am also looking for a full time job as well. I just started working here 10/27/2017 and looking forward to working here as part time
good,I worked seasonal at target and overall it was a great experience. Great supervisors and the customers were always great. It was my first job and it was easy to get the hang of everything.
good,"Working at Target and it being one of my few jobs in where I was employed to, I can say this position gave me more experience than most jobs. The management and team members made everyone feel nicely and fairly treated throughout my experience with Target."
good,i was a cashier the job was pretty easy you have to push red cards but they are not too hard on you if you dont make your goal they just tell you try harder. management was nice and the most enjoyable part of the day was when you exceed the amount of redcards. schedules are chosen based on how they want to schedule you
good,Working for target is fun.  Friendly team oriented company with a lot of different personalities.   Great for college students and career building individuals.
good,"Target is a great place to work.  Amazing people, work environments and culture.  Some changes are still needed, but they are heading in the right direction"
good,Cool place to work and positive people. The downfall is they rarely approve paid time requests. You have to work weekends and they won't let you change that.
good,"Coming from Wal-Mart, Target felt almost awkwardly nice, being a completely different customer base and environment to work in.  Everyone was much more lax, and it wasn't a get-in, get-out kind of store, allowing for much more customer interaction to get people what they need."
good,Nice place to work . Clicky but can work through that. Fast paced. Self-confidence is important. Peers are awesome in job culture as site managers. Retired now.
good,"Overall have good things to say about the organization. For the most part leadership was attentive and looked after their teams. Processes could be a bit bureaucratic at times, but nothing outside of what I've seen at other large organizations."
good,when I work at Target I learned really quickly that it was a fast pace but not so fast I could not keep up the team dynamic of the people I worked with was really good and the managers were fair to everyone.
good,"Fast, Fun and Friendly place to work. A lot of career options available at the store, warehouse and corporate level. Enjoyed working here because of the team and relationships you build."
good,"I liked my managers in 2015, but I was hired for only temporary. The manager at the time was outstanding and down the earth personality. "
good,"Target has an awesome work culture! Everyone is typically helpful.  10 hour days, every other weekend off. If you don't have a lot of family or other social obligations, its very easy to do."
good,Best place to work. Easy to work in fast paced place. Friendly co-workers to easy work with. Perfect place to be able work with many tasks at once....
good,It was a great place to work. It was a temporary job and this job required much less stress. Leadership was great and understanding. They worked around my other job as well as my school. ONe of my favorite jobs.
good,"Great work place and people. Sadly they did not listen to staff on how ordering should be and to much restock that wasnt selling."
good,"During my time with Target Tech, I learned allot of useful information. I learned how to process and sell a variety of phones, I learned how to process customers with a new cable provider, as well as updating their current cable needs. Also I sold the electronic insurance that is provided by target to every customer. I also learned how to advertise to customers, the new weekly promotions. The most enjoyable part of my job was building a connection with a customer, and gaining integrity with them to further pursue their needs with their phones, or other electronics."
good,"this was an overall great company to work for. I've learned competitive sales, and customer service is essential for any business. The hardest part of the job is when individuals on the team doesn't complete their given tasks."
good,"Great company to work for. The advancement opportunities have been great, the only downside is work-life balance, having to work long hours in a management position."
good,"Good experience working in this environment. Employers took customer care satisfaction seriously."
good,"My coworkers were motivated and it was fun to work with them. Management is very understanding. I would definitely recommend someone to apply there. Worst part of the job was customers screaming at me over the phone over not having the ""latest"" toy in stock."
good,Awesome company but there wasn't much room for growth. Management always took the opportunity to come to the floor and work beside us. There was also a great work culture here.
good,"Love it it's a great place. Great advancement opportunities, great pay, and great benefits. Everyone is really great to work with. More like a family, then a job."
good,"I've enjoyed my time there. Good, hard working people with sincere intentions. Stay motivated and you will reap the rewards and gain strong experience in key areas."
good,"i been  working with target for 11 years  "
good,Due to the fact I was moving to Texas in 2013 I had to relocate but I do wish I could've kept the job I just got my foot in the door & couldn't wait to elevate through the company.
good,"Target is a great company and I learned so much there during my first few months.  The company culture is very strong, and sometimes the employees might feel a bit too over-pressured, but that is often the way in big business today. I felt well trained and appreciated all the personal development courses they provided.  I do, however, wish that there was more loyalty to the employees, and I felt that too many good people were let go during downsizing.  A sign of the times?"
good,"This is not an office job nor a 9-5 but the experience and skills you gain from this position make up for it. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target. Leadership communicated well. Work life balance was a priority. We were able to create our own projects and stretch assignments to get better. "
good,Really fun place to work. Cool people to work with and really nice management. Enjoyed the environment! As well as really clean and friendly environment for everyone
good,Target is well known as a great place for a leader to start their career.  There is abundant training and numerous opportunities to learn.  I worked numerous positions and thank Target for all I learned.
good,"Relaxed, brainless, and easy work are really the only way to describe it. The place was easy to work at, you clock in work clock out. nothing comes home with you and you have your life outside of work."
good,This job is a very good temp job. I like certain thi mgs about the job you have more freedom then other places and they are very systematic your able to find things in the system while at other places they aren't organize and don't have a suffiticated system.
good,My typical day at work is stocking and fixing my area which is beauty. My number one job is selling products. I'm a happier person at this job and get complimented everyday.
good,Target is s nice place to work. It comes with many benefits and the pay is good. You also tend to get many hours depending on where you work in the store.
good,"It's a fast paced job, for people that like to stay active. The vibe at the Petaluma target is great it feels like your co workers are a part of your family."
good,"I learned a lot working at target, being one of my first jobs. i loved it people were nice it always kept me busy. My managers were very strict but nice. i really enjoyed my time there."
good,"Hard work, but a fun place to work. The management really care about you and try to balance your work schedule with your life schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with."
good,"Everyone is very nice at the target I work at, main reason why I love my job. They like to make sure that everything is good with the guests, and even you!"
good,"Great work life, great pay and atmosphere. Consistent volume so you never get bored. As well as amazing benefits as far as health insurance and over time depending on availability."
good,"Target was fast-paced and had excellent opportunities for advancement if you applied yourself. I began there as a seasonal receiver and was quickly hired on as a full time inventory specialist. I was soon approached with an opportunity to work on planaograms (shelf setting) team, and was allowed to come in an hour early so I could still qualify for my shift differential for the entire shift. when the planogram team leader could no longer perform his job, I was given responsibility of leading the team and organization the workload for the five members of the department. I loved the responsibility of everyone calling on me over the headset to find out where things were, or where they would be over the next day or two. I was allowed a LOT of overtime and was making good money, and when an opening for team lead in toys became available I was put in priority position for it. Unfortunately I had to decline as my car had died and I wasn't going to be able to make it to work so far away anymore. To this day I still use Target as the basis for comparison of every other job I have had."
good,A good place if you dont mind very fast paced work. Management was always the type to lead by example which i hold in high regard. The different teams interacted respectively for the most part and the members on each team interacted very well between each other.
good,Hard work but you are recognized and compensated well for your work. Managment is very encouraging. Plenty of advancement opporunities. Great place to work.
good,I enjoyed my time at Target. It felt rewarding. I learned how to multitask various jobs assignment's. I learned how to interact with various department leader's.I learned the importance of safe working habit's.
good,"Fun place to work with many like minded people."
good,"While working for only two months, it was really good. They paid fairly with good hours and cared for its works and had a great team to work with. Along with that they cared and took care of the team with food and emotional support."
good,Lovely fast-paced work place. Great individuals and co workers. Provides reasonable breaks and lunch times. Great teamwork skills learned while working there as well.
good,"The managers are great and reasonable. Especially if you are a college student. Great place to work. Customers can sometimes be a little rowdy but, you learn to deal with that in training"
good,A great place to work up until 2 years ago when the direction of the company started to change.  The direction has been changing for the past 2 years and continues to change at an aggressive pace.  Do more with less is the key phrase here and it is nearly impossible.
good,A typical day at Target was helping customers get their groceries and other items processed and bagged. I learned so much about the different types of sales that a Cashier does. The management is friendly and really is helpful if you have a problem. The hardest parf of the job was trying to get people to sign up for Red Cards!  The most enjoyable was meeting new customers and employees.
good,Loved working with Target. They care about their employees and are really flexible with your scheduling needs. I love that they are willing to teach and train all team members.
good,Working at Target was a great environment to work in and all of my co workers and managers were helpful especially when it came to asking any questions. I loved how busy it was all times and how there was something to do. I do not like working at a place where it is slow and hard to find things to do. My customer service skills were used for every part of this job and I learned a lot when working with the public. My goal with every guest was to always make them feel at home and satisfied when shopping for any items they were looking for.
good,Target is a great place to work. They have a lot of areas for company growth within the store side retail management. The culture of the store is great with lots of fun people to work with. I enjoyed working there.
good,"I very much enjoyed the time I spent with this company. Advancement within the team that I worked was very rewarding. There were changes that were not so easy, but adaptability is key."
good,I definitely enjoyed my time at Target. The training and support is second to none. My favorite part was the work/life balance and the upbeat workplace culture
good,"Target is a great work place for any high school student or college student. The managers are nice and understanding. The overall work environment is good, great team members to help you out."
good,Target was a super fun place to work. It gave me the ability to approach and talk to anyone. Being the manager helped me become more responsible and organized.
good,"Depending on the department an individual works in, it can be a blast. The workers are super friendly and very accepting of one another. Everyone is still expected to get their job done quickly and efficiently, which is obvious.  But overall it would be a great job for someone to get experience in the workplace."
good,"I had good team members when I worked back in 2012-2013. Sometimes it's stressful for me at overnight shift but other than that, It was okay at Target as stocker."
good,"Of all my work experience, Target brought the best out of me every day. I had a blast helping the company achieve customer service and look forward to working for a company like them in the near future."
good,Great place to work. Great place for growth and  Wages are competitive. The management was cool and laid back. Management willing to train you in different areas.
good,Nice entry level job. Great experience in retail and customer service. Advancement is available for those that want to advance. Flexible schedules for students.
good,"The management was awesome, some were not as great as others but for the most part, it was great. It was team oriented which was great because you rely on one another to get things done. I would recommend this company to my friends and family"
good,"A typical day at work consist of putting away reshop, answering phones,helping customers. i learned how to work with people and different ways to work with other people. Managment was not the best, they were very unorganized and rude"
good,The people are great at Target. Great job security and benefits with this company. Everyone from the store level to the district level are great and really care about your well being.
good,I like working at target but its not the best. Management isn't where it should be. They should take everyone's feelings into consideration. and they don't.
good,i loved working there its just the manger could of been more nicer and they didn't see a good worker from the bad ones i think its all about the race as in color i was seasonal but i was let go i don't know why but its all good
good,"The retail scene was not for me but, it was nice to experience it at Target because I really think I would not have liked it at any other retail store"
good,The workplace is a great high energy to it. The are always helping the customers with whatever they need and with a smile. I loved working there and wouldn't mind going back
good,"Target is a great place to work. They have wonderful benefits to include work-life balance, paid time off, and conducive work schedules (all OMs and below do not typically work more than 4 days per week. The 401K is excellent as well (match dollar for dollar up to 5%)."
good,"Target is an amazing company to work for with lots of opportunity to advance. It is very fast paced, which I really enjoyed. Worked 10 hours a day but always went by fast."
good,What really stuck out to me was they really take into consideration the opinion of there hired-in employees. Much labor but if you can get used to the workload it's a great place and wish I could return.
good,"cross trained in most departments and managers are more for helping you learn what your interested in learning. fun perks every now and then, hardest work times are during the busy seasonal periods."
good,"I would say that I'm a people person. I like talking and meeting with new people. That being said, 90% of the job revolves around guests and I was very happy with that. I would have to say that Target is not too bad of a place to work at all. It's got its ups and downs but they treat you well. Its worth a shot, you might like it!"
good,"Basic customer service required everyday. The management is pretty good, very understanding, one of the best job cultures, its only hard to work there if you make it hard. The most enjoyable aspect  of my job is the guest interaction and pride in doing the best I can for the company."
good,"If your looking for a good first job than Target is a good place for you. The workers are wonderful, great place to move up, and job titles are good. The only flaw I see in Target is the Management and Pay. I feel like the harder the job title is the more you should get paid."
good,Amazing team work. Appreciated the help and want to help from my coworkers. Management could be a little more diverse too. I think a more comfortable approach as well.
good,"Target is your typical retail job. Lots of room for advancement in all sorts of areas. Even the opportunity to work in the pharmacy. If you are willing to work hard there is great opportunities to work different areas of the store and get extra hours by being cross trained. Management overall is good, but some are in need of some professional training when dealing with employee issues."
good,"Easy and fun exciting place to work, There is always business but the managers are super lazy. The team leaders don't always follow the policies and procedures."
good,"Target is an easy, organized, consistent job with a friendly environment. Any person with retail job history could easily handle and enjoy working there"
good,I worked 3 12 hour shifts on overnights. The work was incredibly physically demanding but the pay was more than fair and the benefits were great. Would reccomend.
good,Great place to make a career.  Great if you are new out of college.  Once you hit a certain level in distribution you start to get limited on upward mobility.
good,Great place to work  l. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel like a family. I enjoyed my 7 months working there and I only left because I had a change in residence.
good,"Target is very consistent in observing break times and labor considerations. Everything is very organized, and the management is considerate and involved in every shift. The job is not overly stressful. However, as with all customer service jobs, the hardest part of the job is just the demands of customers; that being said, management is always good about helping out in uncomfortable customer situations."
good,"allows one to work nonstop by helping guests organizing products, handling guest complaints in a courteous manner all of which help potential employees to grow in the service industry"
good,"One of the best place to start work, you will learn a lot and able to move up with in the company. Target offers great programs any one who like retail would enjoy there team environment."
good,I liked working at Target because it is a very social job. There is a lot of interaction with the customers and there are also a lot of other workers. At some points the managers seem disorganized and confused.
good,Good steady labor working job.  Anyone who is willing to put in a good days work can make it here.  You are a little tired and sore after a 12 hour shift but am ready to go right back in the next day.
good,"Great working environment, nice break room, lockers could be a little bigger. target pay is awesome the workers are very polite and hard working people."
good,"Very friendly co-workers and managers. This is a job you love! You get to help customers find what they are looking for, and they go home happy. You get to see all the latest trends in merchandise, plus you get an employee discount."
good,"I had a pretty good time working at Target. I am glad I was able to work in soft lines. There was a lot of hanging and sorting clothes. Overall, my experience there was pleasant."
good,There was a chance for advancement. You could move up within Target and get crossed trained in other departments within the store. No day was the same.
good,"Target has a great culture and is a great place to be who you are. "
good,"It was a great experience, My Preceptor was very knowledgeable and i have learnt how to work in a fast pace pharmacy, how to manage your staff and how to provide best customer service."
good,I loved working at Targert Pharmacy witch doesn't  exist now because it is now bought by CVS since I was there. I loved my job but I left because I moved.
good,"Empresa muito Boa de se trabalhar,  onde tivemos no princípio uma concorrência saudável para conseguir atingir nosso objetivo, que era de entrar na empresa, nessa disputa concorri com 62 ( sessenta e dois ) homens para 2 ( duas ) vagas, com exames psicotécnicos e entrevistas diretamente com cada concorrente, onde tive a felicidade de ser selecionado."
good,"In my 11 years at working at Target, I have gained tremendous amount of confidence and developed a great sense of urgency. I have built a strong relationship with my peers and co workers, which provides a great workplace environment."
good,Great place to work as it provides great work life balance. Frequent trainings are provided for employee self benefits. The management is very employee friendly and approachable.
good,A typical day at work is based on customer service. They are the number one priority. The next thing is to keep the shelves stocked with merchandise in an orderly fashion. The managers were easy to work with and were very understanding. The hardest part of the job is that there is heavy lifting involved. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and their stories.
good,"Target is a great company to work for.  the starting pay is great and the job is pretty simple.  the management is great, everyone is easy to get along with"
good,Target's management is one of the best managements in the U.S its work place consist of anything needed from tools to supplies. A typical day at work would consist of easy customer service and stocking
good,I had a great time working at target.There customer service is great and they make their customer their number one priority.The team leads work work with the team members
good,"This has to be my favorite job so far. Target is a great company to work for. You get discounts on everything you buy. I learned a lot while working for Target. I learned how to interact with customers to help them find what they were looking for to drive up sales. I learned how to push and pull product from the backroom. I learned how to set end caps/isles and do revisions on isles. I learned how to research the products we were out of. Overall, I learned a lot of things while working in different areas of the store. The management at Target is only three stars for me due to the lack of communication. I love all my bosses and are all very friendly. The workplace culture is a positive experience. The hardest part of the job for me is being placed around in different areas of the store without being talked to first. The most enjoyable part of my job is always going to work and learning new things."
good,Productive and fun loving company. Work culture is very good. Company provide Indian holidays and free lunch to employees. work only for 7 hours. There is no much work pressure .
good,"Life at Target is great, you have the normal ups and downs working with a large diversity of people, but we always have fun. Target is really good about cross training. They try to be accommodating if you have an interest in a different position and once you get moved if you don't like it they move you back, no big deal. The team members in human resources are great people, easy to talk to, and genuinely want to help with any issue you may be facing. Its really one part of why I like working for Target, that and the team. The people I work with are like a second family. We are always smiling, laughing, and having a good time while we get the job done. The one problem I had was with the constant policy changes otherwise no issues."
good,"target is a great place to work, they have many great benefits. They pay well and the managment was great. I highly recommend working there. Everyone who has worked at Target, loves it."
good,"- I worked for Target Corporation for nearly four years. I learned to work in four different departments doing a myriad of different tasks."
good,"I enjoyed my time at target and defiantly would have stayed if i wasn't moving away. The job payed well, was flexible with hours and had great benefits. My only complaint would be none of the co workers really knew eachother"
good,"ambiente cordial de trabajo, con reuniones matutinas para programar el dia laboral y reconocimientos semanales para los empleados mas destacados..mi entrada era a las 3:30 am,me encargaba de recibir el trailer  con la mercancia, darle entrada al; Sistema , supervisor que se descargara todo sin contratiempos, colocar la mercancia en piso,..limpiar antes de que abriera la tienda, a las 8 :00 am.. seguir trabajando en piso y colocacion del sobrante en bodega... Lo que mas me gustaba eran los retos diarios ..la atencion al cliente, ayyudar a encontrar soliciones y las horas del descanso para convivir con los trabajadores....."
good,"I only worked as a barista, with a single two hour stint as a cashier. With a well managed staff it's a great job. I had between 20 and 30 hours a week, I enjoyed learning all about the recipes, tasting everything, and getting to know my coworkers and the regulars. Without a well managed staff... at one point we had 4 official baristas and sometimes we had ""loaners"" from the rest of the store, which was difficult in a very busy tourist town. We often had long lines, with only one person behind the counter. I would say that's a worst case scenario, and there were extenuating circumstances. I definitely still rank that as one of my favorite places to work, just sometimes management drops the ball. "
good,This is a great company to work for! They teach you a lot things. They are great at advancement if you are a hard worker. Great benefits that cover many things.
good,I like working here would likr more pay. The guest are rude about 48% of the time. The hardest part about my job is selling red cards and I don't even have one.
good,This is a great job to have once hired on with the company. Working through the temp service is kinda hard. but overall the job was a great job to have. It will keep your bill payed.
good,"Target work culture encourages work/life balance. Also, flexi timings are the added advantage. Benefits like parents insurance and year budget for training for all employees."
good,"A fun & interesting place to work on the whole. A lot depended on which department you were in."
good,"A typical day at work involves leadership within my team to complete assigned tasks, setting sales planers, partnering with outside vendors for display merchandise, cleaning displays and work-center, and placing merchandise back onto the sales floor. Throughout my time with the company, I've learned to partner with fellow team members to complete tasks at hand, after all it's not a one man show. Everyone must work together in order to increase productivity and sales. The most difficult part of my job is that as of lately, the store is entirely too low staffed to complete all the desired tasks needing to be completed. The most enjoyable part of my day comes from helping the guests in our store and ensuring they leave happing and coming back."
good,"It was a very nice job because not only did we care for the clients, but the employees were very kind to one another. I learned a lot about customer service as well as client care."
good,"This job is very fast paced that thrives through great customer service. I was assigned to work backroom originally but ended up getting changed over to brand attendant, due to overstaffing in the backroom. As a brand attended you have to be able to be flexible and have superb customer service skills. As, you are the first employees the guests see. I enjoyed my team members as well as my management team there. It was a great job to gain knowledge and experience on customer service."
good,"100 External Apprehensions "
good,Working at target was a fast pace job with friendly people.when i first get to work i would unload the truck sometimes i would have to unload two trucks then i would have to put everything on the floors then i would stock the shelves after im done stocking i would clean up crush all the boxs then im done.
good,I was an unloader and stocker cross trained as a cashier. The job isn't hard as long as your attention to detail is on point. Time flies by and before you know it the work day is almost over. Management was easy going and would actively try to help you with any scheduling issues or concerns you may have. There will be days that are frustrating but the good outweighs the bad. I loved working here.
good,"Came here because I heard they had much better management than my previous employer.  After a few months of working here I can now say that is true, however they are a typical corporation who wants more and more work out of their employees for no increase in pay and no additional compensation."
good,"Many areas to work in makes it difficult to ""burn"" out as long as you are willing to learn new things and help out other areas of the store. Positive attitude and ability  to embrace change it is a good place to work especially for a first time job in High School."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target.  I wish it had not been just a seasonal job.  I enjoyed straightening the clothing areas.  I enjoyed assisting customers.  I really enjoyed being a cashier, but I did not got to do that very often, only as needed.  As a full time teacher, I am looking for something that I can do after school and on weekends,"
good,I enjoyed working at working at Target the little time I was there. But at times it was difficult because they wanted you to work at their pace and  not at your own pace
good,There's is always something to do. the staff is helpful and easy going to work with. You develop close relationships and enhance your customer service skills.
good,"You never know until you get there what type of day you'll have. I've learned a lot in the realm of machines and how to operate them. The management is awesome, depending on what department you work in. The hardest part about the job are the hot summers loading and unloading trailers. There is no air conditioning in the trailers. The most enjoyable part about the job are the people."
good,Everyday was a fun day at work but mostly very productive. Ensuring on a day to day basis that guests(customers) are well taken care of by giving excellent customer service.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves, finishing pulls, sorting reshop, helping customers with questions or concerns and acting as a backup cashier when needed by a GSTL or LOD/TLOD."
good,"Target relies on each member of the team doing his/her job properly.  It prides itself on having a diverse work force and is very accommodating to individual scheduling limitations.  Ability to advance within the company is limited however, since there tend to be many people looking to advance and those higher jobs are few and far between."
good,"A great job to have i loved my short time there as a temporary cashier, i had little to no training but was able to catch on fast by watching."
good,There were many people that worked there that was rude constantly and unorganized. Employees would not do the pulls leaving only a few to do them. Sometimes employees would hid in the store from managers in order to not do them. Zoning is hard because they expect you to be done with big areas when you doing pulls and running to cashier when needed. Sometimes the workload could be too much but overall the place is fun if you make it that way.
good,"Target is a place full of surprises around every corner, from helping a guest to cleaning up a spill. Over this year working in a face paced  environment made me learn to adjust or your going to fall short of the line. Target is  very diverse and I love that about it, I made so many friends from working there from all over the world.  The bosses and coworkers all treat you the same,  no favoritism just the way it should be any business. Target has prepared me to be a full people's person and got me ready to move on and share my skills and personality."
good,Loading boxes into trucks. Place damaged goods into bins. Placed boxes onto a moving conveyor. Opened boxes for packers to inspect and label for shipping.
good,I had so much fun working seasonal at Target they made sure to train me super well and never made me feel bad for not doing something wrong! 10/10 would recommend.
good,"Everyday working at target is for the most part enjoyable. staff are not referred to as staff but instead a Team. With this type of entitlement, it influences team members to want to contribute to the overall goal which is to serve guest in the best way posible."
good,The target family in melrose park was perfect while i was there. They were very understanding about life situations and gave you the tme off you needed and the people were very friendly. The hours got skimpy from time to time but over all it is a great job.
good,"Great fun working as cart attendant, but I need a little more for the bills I need to pay. Awesome environment, and really busy at times, so pressure will be on you."
good,"It was a fun place to work due to the team spirit, it was a hardworking and busy environment but as employees we were appreciated for our hard work"
good,Typical day at work is either putting out merchandise onto sales floor from shipment or checking out guests up at the front. I've learned more about product placement and product numbers. Management was good and co-workers were awesome.
good,"Learned from mentors "
good,This was my first official job and management really took me under their wing. I learned a lot about time and conflict management. I was able to learn quite a bit of the store while working there.
good,"Work consists of preventing theft by receipt checking, guest service, physical and live video surveillance, apprehending and detaining subjects, filing reports, communication with law enforcement."
good,Target was an okay job for me at the time. It kept me on my feet. From straightening isles to checking out guests. A typical day at target would be busy. Co-workers worked hard together. The hardest part of being a cashier would be dealing with Attitudes and rude guests while still remaining positive and respectful to them.
good,"I only worked at Target as a seasonal Cashier around Christmas and I was located in the Westfield Mall. With it being a big Holiday for shopping, I was constantly working fast paste. Lines was extremely long but everybody was very patient. The co-workers was very friendly and the management was also very helpful."
good,"Great environment to work in. The team culture is phenomenal. Its a great place to advance in the company and take on new learning experiences. The people you work with are so engaged and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the new changes that are swung in and out of the company year round. The most enjoyable part of working at Target would be the overall support and dedication you receive from working with all types of different people, it really is wonderful."
good,"I have been working at Target full-time (More than 8 years)"
good,Target was my first overnight sticker job they made all of there team members feel like they we're at home/family... My fellow team members was very friendly and we all work tried our best to make sure our work was done at a timely matter.
good,"Nouvelle expérience de travaille.  J'aimais beaucoup les heures auquel je travaillais. De voir comment fonctionne les magasins a rayon, et le contact avec les gens. Bonne entente. Quand les clients n'étaient pas content parce que nous n'avions pas les produits qui étais en spécial. Quand les clients me disait qu'il avait du bon  service de ma part."
good,"Great Place to work. Tremendous room for growth and advancement. Team work is vital to success. An individual with positive attitude, high energy, who loves interacting with people will succeed."
good,"2 years of warehouse experience."
good,I enjoy being there most of the time but you had to ask for hours if you want them or they will send you home early. But overall i enjoy working there.
good,Target was a great place to start my professional career.  It has a young culture with good leadership.  also has a community presence.
good,Working at target has been a great experience. The team I am with are all so friendly and welcoming I look forward to going to work. They are very understanding about leave for school and are always so happy to see returning team members during seasonal work times.
good,The most enjoyable thing at target is helping guests with what they need. Learning how other co-workers try to complete a job that is different then how you would do it.
good,Friendly approachable senior management with focus in the right places. safety and quality is most important to the company. hard work but they compensate you well for it.
good,"I have been with the company for over two years now, and I appreciate the clean, friendly work environment. My managers are always willing to give me an extra hand, clarify work schedules and time frames and take time to listen to everyone's comments or concerns. The managers are respectful, hard-working people. My coworkers are quite similar. They are often very helpful and get the job done. Sometimes, we have extra work to do, but my coworkers are hard-working. So, all the work is always completed by the end of the night. I would recommend others to work for Target."
good,"Target is a great place to work with great coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was working with guests and doing what I could to get them what they needed. Management is great and always there to listen if you want to talk to them. "
good,"At Target I learned how to effectively meet high productivity standards, individually and as a team while maintaining quality and safety.  I learned how to give and receive feedback and constructive criticism with both my peers and superiors.  The most challenging aspects of my job were trying to exceed the productivity standards daily, and the most rewarding part of my job was when these goals were accomplished.  Over my eight year career with Target I made some great relationships with coworkers, and I am grateful for the daily support and feedback from my supervisors and management.  I am truly grateful for my time at Target and the positive impact it has had on my life."
good,"If you listen to what they say you can go very far there. But a lot of young people work there and do not care about RedCards and what not, so they complain and do not understand that this place cares a lot about employee culture, benefits, and mobility."
good,"Learned more and more about the company"
good,"Great company with competitive salary but a very challenging work/home life balance, at times. Lots of opportunity to grow!"
good,"When I worked at Target there was an amazing team culture, all team members were very helpful and talented.  Since the new management took over I am not sure how the culture is now."
good,a typical day work is great come and interact with the target team leads and try to work on a plan to help drive sales and also maintain target guest experience
good,"I loved the people, but they could never schedule me correctly, and would not accept my availability. Very friendly people and good atmosphere. They really strive to help their team members sell."
good,"The Team Culture is decidedly positive. Of course, every team will be different, but no matter what store you're working in, the team is going to be very supportive, and willing to help. Management varies, but is constantly looking for feedback and ways to improve. Job advancement is a combination of proactively looking for internal job openings, and passing internal interviews. Some jobs are more competitive than others during the interview process."
good,"Good company to work with. Great Work Life Balance."
good,"Target was a great place to work, always an open door to employees. The member were trained to love their job or not be part of the family. The day never feels like work, I went from entry level cashier to deli cashier to mgr. then to Starbucks mgr.The hardest really wasn't hard,taking orders off the truck is the hardest .I enjoyed the customer some were on first name , witch made it feel so welcome to them."
good,"Working at Target is like being in a battle or a war, knowing nothing but to keep fighting yourself and pursue through the angers and hatred there. Shall you give up or shall you keep on moving forward? It's a challenge, not too hard or not too easy, for one to take a long time to think because obviously, you got to move on forward. There's always helpful co-workers there, friendly and cooperative kinds of people. It's a place where you would think to yourself, ""Its not that bad. I can't judge this store by the customer's only but by the people who works here with you."" The hardest part of the job is facing the windy, cold storms and the burning heat like of the Sahara Desert. It's one heck of a challenge to endure those things during such times of the seasons. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers you worked with, they made the work place fun and bearable. If one can smile, so can the other. If one is happy so are the others. I learned that to be a team, you have to support each other not just by being a strong arms for the group but by being an arms together no matter the differences of what is assigned to the team."
good,Target is a really phenomenal company to work for. My position as an ETL was an amazing opportunity and a great first job.
good,great communications of responsibilities. always knew what and how to do my job. friendly people to work with. most enjoyable i got to listen to music becaus ei was in the backroom.
good,"* It was a great experience working at target. I enjoyed everyday working there."

good,"It was a very quiet, but peaceful place to work. The managers were very helpful with whatever questions that needed answers. The people working there were very friendly and helpful, they had great trainers. they made sure everyone felt safe and comfortable, the hardest part of the job was answering the phones from the fitting rooms."
good,"Work hours were 4-8 hours, leads were very helpful, coworkers were extremely nice. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day, the easiest part of the job was the freedom each employer had"
good,"Preventing/reporting theft and fraud by using good judgment, responding to safety issues quickly and professionally. Communicate effectively with team and guests. Working under great management and environment. Dealing with the most difficult guests in the store is the hardest part of the job and how to deal with those kinds of guest is what I learned. Providing a safe environment and having the team's trust that I can protect them is the best part of the job."
good,"I loved working there especially because the people that I worked with were mostly young ladies, such as myself and that made for a very personal and fun work environment. The managers did very basic training and pretty much didn't show me much outside of how to work the scanner and a general area, like saying ""section A, figure out the rest"", for where they go. The most interaction was at the end of the day, when they would check to make sure that you cleaned up properly. "
good,Target is a fun place to work. The management is very involved with the workers. The main reason I took this job was the excellent 401 k that they have to offer.
good,"grinding early in the AM,good job ethics that I can use the rest of my life.good staff that were truly concerned about the employes.open honest co workers.small break room.the payckeck is always good"
good,"The best part of the job is being able to interact with the ""guest."" I left to make more money at another company. Overall, my experience was great at target."
good,"this was a great place to work, very team focused and we all grew together as a management team.  very supportive store management which made it a fun environment as well."
good,"-Help with administration duties, also answered phones"
good,A typical day at work was exciting. I learned how to reach my goals. Management were great. my co-workers stayed helping one another when it was time t close the store. Working during the holiday was enjoyable.
good,"Offrir un excellent service à la clientèle"
good,"Great people, great management but a huge shortage of hours outside of holidays. The management is positive and the coworkers are amazing. There aren't many places this great."
good,"Depending on the time of year, workdays can vary.  They may be strenuous, due to limited hours and a small number of employees working at a given time, or they can be light days when we are completely staffed.  I learned management skills through my peers, and I learned teamwork skills needed to complete certain tasks.  The people I work with are all very nice people whom I enjoy working alongside.  They are always in good moods, and they support each other in whatever one might need support in.  The hardest part of my job is working when understaffed.  We are required to cover more of the store in this situation, and the workload is difficult at times.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with.  They help me through the rough days, as well as bringing me joy on a day to day basis."
good,Target culture is pleasant and every employee is generally well trained and treated fairly. As always some supervisors are unpleasant but if you have a problem with someone it is easy to move to a different team.
good,The culture of working at a Target can be interesting. Think of that preppy high school jock clique that has a few nerds thrown in to help them with their homework. That's what Target is. The system for figuring out problems is pretty well rounded. Everything is clean and friendly.
good,"They really take care of you when you do well, and they're very honest with you if you don't. You will know where you stand, and if you do well, you will have plenty of great opportunities open to you."

good,"expérience d'emploie que jai adorée"
good,It's a fun fast pace environment in which anything can happen. I learned how to function and better balance a multitude of tasks to accomplish throughout the day.
good,"Unload the truck and stock it on the shelves. Pretty simple, only problem is that you're on a constant time period so there's no room to slack."
good,"A typical day requires communication and preparation to achieve tasks for the day. Throughout my employment at Target I have learned the importance of evolving and learning new things. It is also very important to come up with new ideas to improved the business. Management has an open door policy and listens to employee's concerns and ideas to improve as a company. Co-workers are a team at Target and treat each other with respect, people help each other and care for one another. The hardest part of working at Target is performing up to their standards, they pay very well but have very high standards for their employees. The most enjoyable part about working here is the sense of accomplishment one feels after they are finished with a hard days work, and the feeling of being valued as an important part of the team."
good,"For the most part, you will be standing in one spot doing nothing. There are the occasional rushes that can be tiring. Cashiering at Target is a decent job. The worst part about it is the constant pressure to get people to apply for a Red Card which is Targets rewards card."
good,"I have been working for Target for 5 years and I love the overall outcome of the company's vision. The overall communication of the distribution setting is very open to suggestions from the team that I work with. Upper Management is always providing us with information that comes from headquarters to tell us some of the ideas that Target is doing to ensure that there is going to be a Target in the future. Yes the place that I work at is considered hard work because I work in a warehouse, but it is work that has a lot of benefit to it."
good,"Basically a retail job with flexible work hours and schedule, but does include nights / weekends / holidays.  A store's atmosphere depends on those who are currently employed at each location.  Brighter and cleaner than most other retailers in the category.  Benefits, if applicable, are very good and make up the unseen portion of your pay."
good,"Fun job, hardest part of my job was when I was left by myself, but when there was more than 1 clerk in deli, it was awesome.. Enjoyable part of my job is seeing our regular guest.. Always made us laugh and smile."
good,"Target is a good company to work in, all the Team Leaders and co workers are very friendly, makes you feel like you can trust them and count on them. I have learned to be friendly with people and experience diffuclt situations that have thaught me important lesson."
good,"Management was excellent. Job was fun, and fast paced. Co-workers were helpful. Good discounts, and benefits.  Would work for this company again, if given the chance."
good,the hardest part of the job would be picking up the slack from dead weight employees. The upper management was good they worked with me well.
good,"Day was loading trucks with product. "
good,The fun factor is absent in all facets of the establishment. really the only redeeming quality is the fantastic guests. co-workers were cordial and the management was fair and just but there was hardly anything to look forward on a daily basis. and the lust for Redcard leads was detrimental to morale.
good,"Typical day is busy as usual, learned about cashiering, stocking and retail. management very outstanding and make sure they do their part. my co-workers were very nice except one, he make very racist remarks towards me. the hardest part competing with sales with all of my co-workers. The Most enjoyable was to be able and come to work and have so many people there that actually care about you and the work place. i enjoyed how everybody took their job so seriously."
good,"I enjoyed my team and being able to help my guests find what they needed, it was definitely a great place to work. The only hard part about the job and really the only thing I wasn't the most fond of was having my job threatened if we didn't get enough redcards."
good,"A typical day at work would be stocking the store merchandise unloading the morning shipment we receive and helping guests at anytime. I learned that team work was essential to finish all tasks by the end of our shift. The management was great they were very involved with their employees, the co-workers there were also amazing as they were just really down to earth. the hardest part about the job was the very early mornings that need a lot of your morning energy. the most enjoyable part about the job was the versatility within what department i could work in."
good,"A lot pf departments, cool people, I really enjoyed it because it was so laid back and the people you worked with made you want to come to work, I suggest if you get in target try to keep the job."
good,"Team work environment "
good,Good experience to add under my belt. The hours were extremely decent. I was a cashier which consisted of cashing out customers and helping them get the right prices and deals.
good,"Target is a great company to work for, provides a lot of space to move up in the company--depending on how badly you wish to do so."
good,Fast Fun always something to do. learning  new food productions as you go is management is fun to work with co-works are easy an relxed. the hardest part of the job is keeping people with you the most enjoyable part of the job is being creative.
good,"Great work place with an understanding and supportive management. Great focus on growth of its employees and the company as a whole. Customer satisfaction is the number one goal for every Target employee. I have to say my co-workers made my job an enjoyable experience by working as a team. I learned many things from my colleagues that helped me become more efficient and effective. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the sheer volume of guests and requests, but it was also what made my job more enjoyable."
good,My overall experience has been amazing. A typical day consists of completing a planned workload. Management varies as some managers like to be hands on while others prefer to sit in the office. Co workers are fun and supportive. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the holiday hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was planning and executing the workload.
good,Target is a good company to work for because it has good hours and a very convenient location. Good pay as well. Part time and full time hours
good,"I was able to work in all of the departments at one of the highest rated stores in the Great Lakes Region (Minnesota)."
good,Flexible hours and the management do take care of their employees. And we do huddle every morning before we start our day and I love it...We know where we at and organized......Everyone enjoys our work invironment.
good,"target was great job to work at. i never had problems with onyone. my co-workes and managers was great people to work with, they where also very understanding."
good,Starting the job can be rough but you will be well equipped resources to support you. As long as you are putting in a strong effort your job will be secure. Manager's styles vary to a great degree and will have a huge impact on your team's culture. Company places high value on employee feedback and will always at least attempt to address the concerns of the people.
good,"My team is nice... like so nice at times its odd. Its the only place in my 2 or 3 years working where no one argues or bickers instead everyone gets along very well. Working in the hardline area is not difficult at all and someone is never breathing over your neck your pretty much just expected to do your job. The work environment for example break room, offices, lanes, receiving and north stock are spacious and very clean. The managers really like to touch base and make sure the employees are just as satisfied as the customers. Targets number one priority is the customers your job is second but given the ling schedules i get my job done with helpful team members and superior equipment. overall i have had a good experience if not better."
good,"Target is a great company, I was challenged and was able to develop some very applicable skills that are needed to be successful in business. The promotional path does not sound as exciting as what was introduced to me in the initial interview process. I am out working my peers and have been told by upper management that I am functioning at a higher capacity than others in similar shoes. I think Target needs to think more about the promotional path for others like myself who are successful, but want to check out different sectors of the company. They seem to narrow minded on what the promotional track should look like."
good,"While job security is obviously not exactly great, what with the company closing and all, while it lasted it was a great place to work. Respectful leadership, a fun environment, plenty of opportunity to improve and advance, and made some good friends and colleagues I hope to keep in touch with for a long time to come."
good,Typical day depending on your shift you would clock in pick up equipment and depending on job title all required keys and PDAs. Generally after checking to see if you have return to floor merchandise you would walk you area to see what team members you are partnered with today. Honestly all team members young and old at this location were friendly and made the shift go by as if you were out in your everyday life.
good,"I love working at target, the people are just so friendly and helpful. Working here makes you want to be a better person. I would love to work here longer."
good,Enjoyed targets overall environment which focused on providing fast and friendly service that met customer needs. Target also provides a team work oriented work space that allowed for new ideas to be shared among fellow co workers.
good,"Great pay and benefits, but long hours and heavy work load. Company culture is friendly and team oriented for the most part."
good,"In a typical day, I would have assigned areas to monitor for correct pricing. I learned to coach and mentor employees. My co-workers were strong and had no problem sharing their knowledge.  Hardest part of job was often finding space on the sales floor for product coming from backroom. The most enjoyable was working with a dedicated team"
good,I think Target is a great company to work for. I would encourage anyone to apply with this company because they care about their team.
good,"Relaxed environment, little micro managing.  Always offering project developments. Accommodates and is flexible to personal work styles. A company that strives for accuracy and to meet deadlines as required. Strives for great customer service"
good,fast fun and friendly is the motto for target so i try to apply that to my everyday work i enjoy helping people without benefits i always would get compliments about how fast i was or a respectful young men that i was and i would always see a bright smile every time someone leaves my register
good,Greeted with a smile as soon as you come in. Feeling excited on projects to do. I personally learned a lot having to manage a big team in my department. Found management to be supportive in all aspect of my work.Everyone was a team player ' hardest part was leaving my team when the company closed for business. Made friends for life .
good,Great place to work.  Developed a lot in my leadership skills through the training and mentoring from the company.  Enjoyed working daily side by side with the coworkers were the most enjoyable moments.
good,"Overall great experience. I have had great leadership and felt like the managment supported me through those learning curves. As a military leader it was difficult to understand their culture, but once I did it was a great overall experience."
good,"I enjoyed working for Target, the corporation provided excellent customer service.Also I always had an updated schedule 3 weeks in advance.The hardest part of the job was standing for up to 7 hours overnight. I learned teamwork will get the job done. Management kept up with everyone and everything,"
good,"I absolutely loved my coworkers, the work was a little tedious, but the team help cope with the work, and the pay was not worth it either."
good,"- Supportive management who cares about personal development goals"
good,"Depending on position, a day can look very different. I had the opportunity to work in almost all positions, at least in some capacity and appreciate the drive to establish a strong team mentality."
good,Learned about pharmacy workflow and procedures. Retail portion of the job was challenging. Staff was supportive. Company as good benefits.
good,"I operated the register so every day was basically the same. I would stand in my cashier line at a specified register and wait for customers to enter my line. While waiting I would do maintenance around my register station. Once a customer entered my line and placed their chosen products for purchase on the counter, I would grab one item at a time and ring it up however at a quick pace, while engaging friendly conversation. Once everything was rung up I'd tell the customer his total and cash him out by means of either cash, credit or debit, gift cards or check. I often was placed in the customer service desk area where I was in charge of returns, exchanges and answering customer questions as well as solving complaints and problems face to face and also by telephone, without manager assistance."
good,Great team members and managers. The customers are friendly for the most part except for a few bad apples. Very flexiable work schedule willing to work with your lifestyle.
good,It was great working with respectful coworkers. Everyone had a smile on their face every day. Even if they are having a bad day.
good,Empresa boa para trabalhar. Áreas e departamentos são integrados;
good,Target is a great company with room for advancement if you have your degree. Management can decrease the experience if they are not train or do not value Training and Development.
good,I worked in an office outside Minneapolis and have had a chance to work with several experienced coworkers who have strong tech background. The job culture is great and everyone is very resourceful and supported me to complete my project.
good,"Target pays managers well, and the working environment is always changing. Effective communication and IT systems are a consistent opportunity, and can make your job harder."
good,Work days are nice. I only work three days a week. 12 hr days. I learned many aspects of the way a distribution center works. Management is young and really don't listen to your ideas or thoughts. Co-workers are the best people I have ever worked with. The hardest part of the job is getting management to listen.
good,"Working at target was a very easy job, the requirements were simple and it was very enjoyable. Simply all I did was complete the guests' transactions, the hardest part was when it could get very busy and we had little cashiers. I enjoyed the interaction with people the most, my co workers and managers were great."
good,Our ETL and whole team made it a great place to work and grow. Although we ran short staffed at some points we were always made aware how appreciated we were.
good,"I found the Target I worked at to be a great place for someone who doesn't have much experience, or none at all to start at, the team was nice, friendly, and willing to teach you anything you didn't know. Before applying I had no experience in sales, I quickly learned how the basics of providing guest service, stocking, doing mark down, and setting things. It is also a great place if you would like to be promoted or moved up quickly, if of course you do your work."
good,At target our number one priority is guest service. I learned how to use my devices and PDA's. It's an easy job but requires team effort.
good,"Target is a great company to work for however, unless you plan on going back to college to become a team lead or ETL at target its just a job not a career."
good,"Target's Leave of Absence (LOA) program is great for students who live away from home or require a lot of attention to their studies for college and/or high school. After the semester ends, you call Target and they put you back on the schedule with no additional training and without the need to re-apply."
good,"Work throughout the day wasn't always repetitive."
good,"Responsible for maintaining the cash register. I would provide excellent customer service, while simultaneously trying to convince customers to open a credit card with us. I would occasionally close, and in doing so I was responsible for cleaning my work area and assisting managers with whatever task needed to be done."
good,"Was able to tailor my work experience to my needs, hile being able to advance through hard work. Able to achieve a good balance between work and family."
good,"My time at Target has been truly amazing and I have learned a lot. I had the opportunity to be promoted twice in the span of 2 years thanks to great management and a supportive supervisor. Target even gave me the opportunity and work on a $6 million dollar project. A typical day involves me walking the warehouse floor and understanding the current state of my project, contractors, and any operational issues. This is followed by a series of meetings focused on updating senior leadership and HQ leadership. I then usually have some downtime to work on my communications, plans, and deliverables. The hardest part of my job is balancing my relationships between my HQ stakeholders and my Field stakeholders and making sure we are all aligned. The most enjoyable part of Target are the people and the culture. It is a fantastic environment to work in, especially in the Distribution Centers."
good,"The management at target was disorganized, often orders from leaders would conflict with each other (i.e clean an area... 5 mins later a different leader would tell you to leave it for the end of the night). The co-workers were superb as Target created a culture where it was always about one team, one dream. The hardest part of the job but the most enjoyable part as well, would be the Target Guests as you would have those certain bad ones but also the really good ones. (Guests is the term Target used for Customers)"
good,A great company to work for if you wish to gain some work experience and want a flexible schedule. A fast paste environment where workers can interact with many individuals on a daily basis and develop skills in communication and teamwork.
good,"I was a Cashier, so I rang customers up fast and efficiently. While being as friendly as possible. I liked most of my co-workers and bosses. Target is well run and I have never heard any complaints about our store the four years I worked there."
good,"I'd recommend any one who is looking for a nice, fun environment with some great people this is the place. I really enjoyed my self there I still keep in contact with some of my old co-workers"
good,"i enjoyed working at target, the environment and the team members were great, the customers are friendly, busy on weekend which made the place a mad house.i learned alot of patience and understandin"
good,I learned lots of new things and my customer service skills got better and better I wouldn't have quitted this job but I had to because of my allergies to cedar.
good,"Once you find your niche, it becomes necessary to drive results and manage talent.  Once that is complete start working towards a goal."
good,"Typically, I work as cashier, but in the past I have worked as the electronics sales team member.  This job requires I have good social skills and can relate to guests who come to shop at Target.  I have to be able to cooperate with my team in order to get tasks accomplished."
good,"My leaders were always helping me to improve, something that I find very valuable in a job."
good,"I work real hard and I get the job done right the first time. I’m always focused, organized, and mature and can multi-task at the same time and still maintain a positive and pleasant environment. I have worked for the military housing with four star generals. I come with lots of experience."
good,"The people are all-around friendly and Target leadership makes consistent effort in developing fellow workers to grow as an individual. "
good,"Starts at 5:45am, have to get the truck unload, put items out on the floor by 11:30am. Co-workers are very friendly and diverse. Hardest part of the job is finishing at the time deadline. The most enjoyable part of the job is the rewards we get for doing a good job"
good,Loved my time with Target met a lot of interesting people.   I really enjoyed the clean and happy environment. We always had trivia games and food actives in the staff room it keeps the Team in good spirits. Enjoyed the visitors from the states they really have a positive attitude. There was always something new to learn. In my Presentation work some times the work load was large but there was always support from other parts of the store. I was sorry to see Target  leave. It was extremely hard to have to close another store after only a few years earlier I closed Zellers after 17 years of working. Hoping my next job I can retire from .
good,Loved working with My team members they are alway looking to ogive the best customer service and alway going over and above for the customer and excellent Team work.
good,"Target was a good retail store.at a time two shipment were received and goal was met. I Was given training on cashier flow team, MANAGEMENT AND HR CO WORKER WAS GREAT PEOPLE to work with. I ENJOYED WORKING THERE."
good,Developing yourself and others was a primary focus within a typical day/week. The team environment and leadership within Target made it an amazing place to work.
good,"cross training does happen here"
good,"The shelves have to be stocked for the customers and that's what I assist in doing on this job.  I go to my assigned  area and order through a hand held computer any missing items. Then the afternoon is when everything I ordered is put on the shelves,  making sure everything is zoned and neat in appearance.  Helping the customer shop is the favorite part of this position."
good,Great place to work for and enjoyed the culture there. Always felt like you were a part of a team. Enjoyed it and would do it again.
good,"Always great day to put a smile on for the guest that came to shop. Job entailed with very frequent interactions with guest, plus with an team to work with made it a very enjoyable time."
good,"As a Leader On duty, you are literally calling all of the shots, which is both fun and challenging. A typical day for an Executive Team Leader begins at 6:45am and ends at 5pm. You can expect non-stop work from every directions, so if you love being busy then this is the job for you. However, ETLs don't truly get lunch breaks and you cannot leave the building. I have learned that my verbal communication needs work, but that's what Target is all about, helping you improve. My co-workers truly only focus on their own area's, which is a shame since they have tons of total store knowledge, but they are all great people and work very hard. The hardest part of the job is working 50 plus hours per week and two weekends a month. The most enjoyable part of job are the customers. They are so funny!"
good,"Great place to work, Managers make it fun and enjoyable, Have special days during the week for employees. Great team work"
good,"Target is a fun and energetic place to work, with a lot of opportunities for advancement. A lot of the team member are young professionals from all over the country."
good,I enjoy working in a fast paced work environment that shipping & receiving had offered. I love always having something to do as I am a very motivated person.
good,"Busy fast pace with deadlines to meet everyday "
good,"fun and friendly "
good,"Days at work are long and hectic. At his job ive learned how to deal with angry customers, qmos, leadership qualities, how to brew coffee and the different kinds. Management needs to communicate more with their employees. Coworkers are great. some like to call in a lot but are very helpful and always there to back you up. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people and developing  relationships with guests"
good,I have had a great experience working at Target and appreciate all I have gained while employed by Target Corporation.  I was afforded the opportunity to work in several types of law teams.
good,Loved the 5 years with Target because of the people that I worked with. The culture and environment is a great place to work but be prepared to play the politics that comes with a larger organization.
good,"A typical day at work is coming in with a nice attitude smile on your face. I learned while working at Target good customer service, time management, how to work with different people and attitudes. my co workers were nice positive attitudes and dedicated to their jobs. The hardest part of my job is being tired from a long day of work. What i enjoyed the most seeing the smiles of the customer."
good,It is a really nice place to work. The Human Resources people are very kind. My only problem is that if you say you will be ok to be cross trained as something they will instead make you that. I had applied as a sales floor associate but instead they asked if I could be cross trained as a cashier second. I said I was ok with this but they transferred it as I want to instead be a cashier and they would not change it.
good,"To work for Target is an evolutionary experience, what better is there than change? I encountered so many changes and progresses made within the company that I truly became a more resilient and adaptable human being. There were challenges, but through these tough times, I was able to hone my strengths and develop my opportunities. I worked with the most upstanding of co-workers - professional and courteous. Management was competent, supportive, honest and hard working. "
good,"I worked on the flow team (night shift) stocking the shelves, so instead of minimum wage I was paid about $9.00 /hour. I would recommend Target as a nice place for a first job, or anyone seeking a generic minimum wage, entry level job."
good,"- would unload a trailer with typically 2500 pieces"
good,"came in at pm shift uloade  trailers, stocked shelves cleaned up and be gone before  store opened.  I learned to read shelf labels and to operate the crown fork lift. I found nothing really hard about the job. had mostly good  co workers and enjoyed the commaraderie on the job. liked  going to work because each day  brought new challenges"
good,"Le travail d'équipe était parfait, tous les employés de gestion étaient consultés pour toutes décisions et les membres d'équipe également."
good,Great place to work with great people who work there.  I wish that the company cared more about the team members but I understand that it is a business and they need to do whatever it takes to make money.
good,"My main aim as A.M Supervisor at City-link was to get drivers out each day with balanced, profitable and do-able routes in order to achieve and maximise customers' expectations. I then had to oversee warehouse staff clearing the floor for the next shift and the operational team making sure they were providing sufficient support to drivers whilst offering a service for the customers.I dealt with customer complaints, driver issues, disciplinary, company vehicle maintenance, etc"
good,"Backroom attendant sales floor stock cashier,  Great management. Hardest part about the job was running the backroom by myself and being able to scan everything in in the amount of time I had."
good,"A typical work day for me is go around the store to make sure that products are accurately priced and fixing them if they are not. I have  learn a lot form working at Target. I'm also trained in other departments like Electronics, Sales Floor , and the Fitting room. My number one jobs is to always help the guest in the store with their shopping needs. All of my co-workers are friendly. We help each other to get the job done."
good,A typical day at work consists of stocking merchandise to their designated areas. I learned how to give good guest service. Management is fun and friendly. Hardest part was telling a guest we do not have the product they are looking for. The most enjoyable part was finding what our guests are looking for.
good,"Everyone was nice, and I was literally always able to rely on my co-workers for their help,everyone did their job while having fun and I was always complimented on my work duties and how well I was doing. All my managers were always there to guide to make sure I was doing the right thing, I felt important and very much needed working at Target."
good,In my opinion it is a great first job because you get used to working at a fast pace because you have a lot of customers that you will need to help in one day. The management is wonderful they work well with their employees. Another great thing is the people you work with if you have a positive attitude everyone else seems to have one also and it makes the shifts seem a lot easier to get through. The hardest part of the job would have to be standing on your feet all day. I would say the most enjoyable part of the day for me would be when the store reaches its weekly and monthly goals and we receive a special lunch.
good,"Easy going job, with great co-workers and a management staff who us good with direction."
good,"i worked over night stocking general goods shelves. transferd to day side to work food trucks. unloaded and stocked freezer, dairy, and bakery."
good,Enjoyed meeting new people and learning new things about being in sales. It was very different from what I was studying in school at that time.
good,"Good people, decent management. the benefits were good and the hours could have been better but I worked at least 35 hours a week."
good,"Typical day starts off with checking emails to see any communication was given the previous day by other leaders. After I would have to get all money ready for the front end registers which included, guest service, Starbucks, food avenue, pharmacy, and electronics. I then had to make sure that the scheduling of breaks and lunches was accurate for the team members i had to supervise. Doing this would prevent any human resource issues.I had to motivate the team members to drive conversion and great guest service. Also handle any issues that a guest would have with their shopping experience. I had to fill en-caps and made sure that the front end was stocked with supplies and also merchandise for our shopping guest. I had to make sure that all associates were providing great guest service through out the store and also driving conversion. At the end of the night I would had to safely and securely pick up all money in all of the store and put it in our cash office."
good,"Pulling up daily inventory records to print out and check to be sure all items in store were accounted for "
good,"Lead project teams and manage communications with stakeholder groups to effectively deliver business value on large projects and enterprise initiatives.  Effectively transitioned from business to technology leadership role, but have a stronger propensity to drive change on the business side."
good,"I ran the electronics department so I helped guests answer questions about electronics items. I would set plan-o-grams for monthly specials, take phone calls, ring guests out for their purchases. Through this job I learned how to be an adult. I was the youngest Team Leader at the store at 18 years old due to my strong work ethic. I credit my boss with instilling a stronger work ethic because she wasn't the type of boss who would coddle you...if you made a mistake, she let you know and I'm incredibly grateful for that. The hardest part of the job was leading of team of 25 people during the Black Friday sale but I managed to keep everything on track, as well as completing on the spot interviews,  The most enjoyable was not only helping people but gaining knowledge from veterans. (I was named the companies highest honor, Great Team Hero, 4 times) and (Best guest service provider for 3 months in a row,)"
good,"A typical day at work for me is usually busy and filled with lots of questions from either guests or other team members. I work side by side with other managers throughout the store and we do our best to satisfy every one we can. A lot of our team members have been with our store for awhile so you get really close to everyone pretty quickly. I enjoy working along side everyone I work with! Each and everyday I learn something I didn't know the day before, whether its a new way the system works or something new within the store. The hardest part of my job is not being able to fix a guest problem no matter how many ways I try. But it definitely makes my day when I'm able to go above and beyond helping a guest and they are able to leave satisfied!"
good,"I was in the backroom pulled, stocked and back stocked. I also worked on Instock team to change counts on merchandise to re-order merchandise we were out of.  Learned how to order merchandise needed for sales floor.  Also took on-line orders as they dropped, picked up for guest and put on hold.  I was supervisor for 2 teams one the backroom and other Insock team.  The best thing about the job was working with the co-workers.  Hardest part of the job was when we were short handed and had 3 different things we had to get complete within the hour.  We always made it happen.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the co-workers I had."
good,"awesome team, great customer service. FAST, FUN AND FRIENDLY!"
good,"I felt like management was very strict. They did incorporate fun things there to make the job fun and I feel like they did want you to have a good day at work. BUT I did not like how if you made a simple mistake they made it seem like it was the end of the world. Some of the co workers were on your back, and not so friendly. Majority of the co workers I loved working with. They never hesitated to help you. Target really strives to be perfect which can be a lot of pressure."
good,"People: They tend to hand pick fun people who have a focus on self management."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in ringing out customers answering any questions they have, Making sure they had a pleasant shopping experience no trouble with anything, the hardest part of the job I would have to say is the coupons and the sale items or gift cards just because the coupons don't always go through automatically and guest's get angry when the sale item has the wrong sign."
good,"During a typical day working at Target I would punch in for my shift then put my things in an available locker. go to a register and long in and start greeting customers for a couple of hours and ringing up their orders. from there I would be able to take a break if I did had an 8 hour shift, then I would go back to work take a lunch break,then I would have the rest of the day off. "
good,"A fast paced work environment, offering the opportunity to cross-train many positions, and gain insight on behind-the-scenes corporate policies and practice."
good,"I enjoy working there, because all of us in our team are people who are there to do there work . My managers do see who's doing the work correctly and in a timely manner and many times are reward for there hard work. Some co-workers are not always focus on there jobs, so when that happens it puts the  once who work doing there work also in order to be finished by the time the store opens at 8 am."
good,"Aduit, run reports, keep track of inventory daily, complete PO thru SAP system, handle the correct labels needed for client's shipments."
good,They are very good to work with.You get to advance a little more over there.
good,"A typical day would be ringing customers items as they came to my service line. Replenishing shelves with items customer no longer wanted or desired to have, keeping my work area clean and organized. Working guest serives, exchanging and returning items for customers. Cleaning store after closing hours. Management was great with the support and additional service they provided to give our guest the best experience. I enjoyed working with my co-workers since we all had diverse backgrounds and could learn from each other. The hardest part  of my job was letting a guest know we didn't have a certain items in stock or we didn't have that item to be sold and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist in other departments of the store when they were overworked."
good,Helping customers with the best of my ability. ive leared how to talk to people in a respective manner. Get along with all of my co-workers. And have a great productive day.
good,"I do management work at the store since i have been there for a moment. I make sure the floor is taken care of, and I also make sure the workers are doing their job. Our main goal are to keep the guest happy"
good,"early morning start unload truck, stack pallets, pull pallets and place merchandise on shelves.  But if people call off it makes the day longer and harder for everyone else"
good,"The great part about this job is that you're really just expected to show up and work.  The management was really flexible if you needed to take time off for any reason and was willing to work with you to fulfill your needs.  The co-workers were great and the overall feel had a very laid-back atmosphere.  Occasionally the management would bring in lunches or breakfasts in the break-room for all of the team members to enjoy.  Overall, I had no complaints about Target and would work for them again in the future."
good,"The hardest part of working at target is trying to help every guest. because you have more than one come to you and you want to help all but sometimes you have to put them on hold to help the first guest that you had first.My coworker are amazing they are some hard working people an i enjoy working with them, we like a big family. Our management is pretty cool, some stuff i know we need to work on but they getting it together. The most enjoyable part of my job is showing to there item an giving them more resourse to help them save some of there money, like our target cartwheel, redcard."
good,"There is no ""typical"" day, as client demand and needs drives the priority of the moment.  Fast paced, multitasking environment.  Lots of phone work, making outbound sales and prospecting calls, along with internet based research."
good,"Great Company, Just depends on store you work at. Opportunities to advance however takes a couple years."
good,"Its a great place to work no kidding.Hardest part is waking up way too early in the  morning to go to work.It like a life struggle,but you got to suck it up if you wanna get those bills paid.This company care about the safety and the happiness of its workers.Management is great,coworkers are fantastic.Hardest part of this job is waking up in the morning looking like a zombie.Best part is getting recognized for doing a great job.Your name will be heard around the store."
good,"I worked hard and was promoted within 6 months. Target has a fast, fun, and friendly culture."
good,"Working at a retail store it can be hard and stressful since is always busy, there is not time to rest, there is always something to do. Target was the same, when I was not busy with a guest or employees, at was in charge of maintaining the brand at the registers as well as guest service, everything had to be safe for both employees and guest. I had to make sure that the employees would take their breaks and lunch on time and to make sure I had someone to cover them. The hardest part will be the busiest hour which usually was during 12 pm and 6 pm, and there were not enough cashiers,because the store was cutting hours, so the guest will get mad and complain about it, I had to call for help from other departments, but sometimes was not possible because they were busy too, so I will have to apologize with the guest and explain them the situation, and tell them that we will help them, but it will take a little more time. Even it was hard and it will take the other employees a little more time to come up and help me, I knew that they will be there to help me, after all we were one team and we had the same goal which was to make the guest happy and make sure they will come back. "
good,Good comfortable place to work and get experience. Nice work environment.
good,"The first task was to re-shelve, and then bring items from the back and place them in the proper locations on the floor. Furthermore was to zone items in aisles and make sure everything was neat and in place. Co-workers, were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was pushing out heavy products and lifting them onto the shelves. The most enjoyable part was working with the guests (customers). Also, I learned a great deal of patience. It is hard to balance your own tasks, helping  the guest, and being called for back up to the cash registers. It is fast-paced and you can learn a lot about how to manage and budget your time schedule. It was exhausting on 8 hour days, but it had its rewards."
good,A typical day at work was actually making drinks at starbucks i started off there first n learning the drinks the management was great and understanding the coworkers were helpful the hardest part was learning the codes the most enjoyable part was meeting new people
good,"Target was my first retail job, it was a real learning experience because I have never really had to deal with customer service in such a fashion. I learned a lot about from Target"
good,"I have alot of fun running my AP Team, but at times the upper managements can be a little pushy and unreasonable."
good,"The only problem I ever had working at Target was having to wake up at 4 in the morning. Other than that it was a nice place to work. You got to work at your pace and worked as a team, but also independently."
good,"Normally whenever any help is needed, everyone has a walkie to carry with them. For those who are on the sales floor, they are also given a price gun to not only price items, but to also put items onto the sales floor when the product number out on the floor is low. Should any help be needed up in the front, such as cashiering or helping with a guest, anyone who has done their area can offer to help in the front."
good,"i think if i had to i would work there again.Most days were good , but we did have bad days. i leaned that i could be what ever i want to be, an seceded in want ever i do."
good,"My typical day involves meeting guests needs through amazing service which I drive through guest service representatives. I also ensure that that the sales floor is filled so that the guests can find what they need.  "
good,"Always active, constantly moving and lifting. I loved being able to do that and not just stay immobile in one place."
good,"A typical day at work was smooth sailing,everyone helped by doing there part. I learned how well a team can work together. The managers were more of a support crew who helped there co workers achieve what needed to be done."
good,My typical work day was fun and easy going for the most part. Every job has its stresses but the people you work with support you 100% and makes it really fun.
good,It was a good place to work! Beside the HR staff being a bit rude and not so understanding.
good,Being a flow team member was fun. I enjoyed working off hours while the store was not open. It was a fun environment with a great team. I always looked forward to work.
good,"Working for Target was a very valuable experience. Everyone was made equal by being a part of a team. We were all considered team members. No one was there to seem greater than than the next. This was a team effort job and I learned that it is possible for a large group to come together to better the company and make the store a wonderful place to shop. My typical day would include finding out which department I would be assisting in and making sure that I completed my given tasks in a timely manner. Whether it was working in the clothing area or on the cash register, I took pride in making sure my work was acceptable to myself and the guests. I enjoyed being a team and helping the guests."
good,"My typical day at work would be very busy, always moving around making sure the parking lot was clean also costumers was satisfied."
good,great place to work at. people are friendly and help each other.  works around a person school schedule which is a plus
good,very physically demanding fun at times. hardest thing  was to work in  the heat. management and co-workers were friendly not a bad place to work . My job was to load trailers so the stores would have the items the customers wanted
good,"The hardest part about the job was not being able to cross train when I could have used it the most.I learned from the job that work gets done faster working in a team with my co-workers.The management was more than perfect and kept everything and everyone in check.All throughout the day all of that would happen,as I zoned my aisles and greeted customers making sure they are getting the help they need to stay satisfied and keep coming back.That was the most enjoyable part of the job,was making everyone happy."
good,"While working for Target, I led 3 teams in 4 years. It was a great opportunity to learn various working pieces within the organization. It was a perfect opportunity for me to prove my ability as a leader. The store manager trusted me to lead technically difficult teams requiring organization and execution."
good,Come in early in the morning print out your workload for the day. I work with the best coworkers in my department we have fun and get the work done. Getting the chance to not only work your department but being able to cross train in other departments.
good,Target is a great place to work for anyone with drive and motivation. Target offers many chances and opportunities to cross-train and develop into a leader position. Development is a big priority of leaders in the building!
good,I learned to always smile and be polite no matter what. A rude guest might not appreciate the effort but another guest might notice what you've done and complement you for your effort with the way you handled the situation.
good,"Every-night is always different when working overnight for Target. Sometimes we might have a big truck with not enough people, which means we have to think quickly change plans in order to get the store finished on time. I've learned how to give great customer service. I've learned how to work with the team, and independently. My co-workers were fun to work with, they always were very helpful. If  one of us started to fall behind in work, we would always give each other the helping hand. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay awake all night. This was my first job so when I first came into the overnight world I was exhausted. But after awhile I got use to it so it became pretty easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was just coming to work knowing you have a great team to get you through the night. The atmosphere was just amazing."
good,"Through my experiences at Target, I have gathered a sense of what it means to work as a team towards a common goal. I have also developed better communication and conversational skills through interacting with the guests and fellow team members and I'm on my way to shaping my leadership abilities."
good,Target is a fun place to work. I have had a great experience working there.
good,The customer service and team work were very enjoyable. The hardest part about working in retail was to not shop and work at the same time. All the managers were very encouraging.
good,Target is a great place to work with friendly customers and wonderful coworkers but if sales are down hours get cut and once you reach your pay cap you no longer qualify for raises. Also the pressure to sign guests up for the Red Card can be intense.
good,Target has been a great place to start my career in business. They have developed me into an excellent leader and I have gained confidence in my ability to manage/develop talent because of their continous training. The culture is wonderful and all of the staff get along because we all have something in common. The hardest part is just the inconsistent retail schedule.
good,"Wide learning opportunities"
good,A typical day for me was signing customers up for the loyalty card. My co workers were awesome to work with. The most enjoyable part of my jobs was all the rewards I had received considering I had the highest percentage of loyalty card sign ups.
good,I have been with the company since September 2013 and have already moved up to a better position to be a team member in Electronics. Learning about new product and helping guest makes me happy especially when I know guest benefit from my help.
good,I definitely enjoyed my job here very much! The managers were very down to earth and understanding in everyday situations. The team worked very well together and we were all flexible to each others needs.
good,learned to be a self starter and be a team player as well as work on my communication skills. excellent place and easy to make friends with fellow employees.
good,The hardest part about working for target is not having enough time to get everything i want done. i am a over achiever and sometimes shifts aren't long enough to do everything that needs to be done
good,"The day moved quickly in the back room, I was always moving around the store and helping guests. The hardest part of the job was that the learning curves for the various devices were quite large, especially since I came in sporadically, i.e. whenever there was an opening for me. The most enjoyable parts of the job were helping customers find what they want, and completing the hourly jobs on time."
good,"Great environment to work in. Safety and communication are key, not just for guests but within the team. A typical day consist of filling the sales floor, meeting deadlines, communicating and placing orders with vendors, and most importantly interacting with the guests in the store. Always striving to provide great customer service no matter what. It has been a great experience and has provided me the opportunities of development of which I have gratefully taken. With the various tasks, it has been a challenge getting through them all; however it has been wonderful accomplishing so much more than expected."
good,"During Christmas season, a guest approach me asking me a question about a specific toy her newborn son. She asked me, ""Do you guys have anymore in the back?"" I told her, ""I can check for you miss."" I scanned the barcode on my PDA to see if we had anymore in stock. Unfortunately, we didn't have anymore. She felt so disappointed reassuring me she came along away to buy a specific toy for her baby. I felt the disappointment through her emotion. Therefore, I went beyond my duty and called every Target store hoping to hear, ""We have it!"" Once I called every store, I finally found the toy. After hearing the good news, I approached the guest with the news she was ecstatic. She thanked me numerous of times all I could do was smile, simply because I love making my guests happy. What I learnt is taking a extra mile making guests happy. The most enjoyable part of my job is providing excellent service."
good,Was a great learning experience and the people were great. great community impact and lots of volunteer as a store. Treated nice and managers often had free food in the break room.
good,Great company to work for if you just need a job. The pay is not a good reason to work for this company.
good,"As executive team leader of logistics and operations, I manage the Flow process, backroom team, in-stocks process, planogram team, pricing team, facilities management team, and reverse logistics process. Outside of my specific work center, I act daily as Leader on Duty where I manage all aspects of the store including guest service issues, operational tasks, and all other business needs. I have excellent relationships with my peers and subordinates, and enjoy going to work every day. This job has developed my management skills to efficiently lead large teams productively on a regular basis, as well as managing talent to develop the right person in the right place."
good,"Various shifts - 7 days a week.  Opening from 7 Am to 11 PM."
good,"It was a great place to work, great customers, Faced paced and always got extra hours , had days off and Discounts on Merchandise"
good,"A typical day at work would be a wanting to go to work day. I loved getting up and going to work. There was always a new and fresh or returned face everyday. My co-workers or team members, as we say, made Target run. We worked together to complete task that one person themselves couldn't do. Target is a people place with everything you need."
good,work place was nice great benefits. I learned how to do everything in receiving department. the hardest part of this job was going to ART. The most thing i enjoyed about this job was co workers.
good,"I have been an Executive Team Leader for Target since June 2010.  In addition to spending time focusing in my specific work center, (currently Human Resources, previously Assets Protection) I also dedicate attention to the sales floor.  I am responsible for ensuring sales and payroll expectations are met, the store remains brand and in-stock, and efficiency is maximized to guarantee optimum productivity and guest satisfaction."
good,Working at Target is very rewarding because of the quality of people you work with.  Distribution is a fast-paced environment that is always trying to find new ways to improve productivity.  The leadership team is generally very considerate and supportive.  The Christmas season is definitely the most stressfull time due to a huge increase in volume and work load.
good,"My job title was Sales Floor Team Member. This means on a typical day at work I would be responsible of circulating a designated area of the store and help store guests find exactly what they were looking for. I was also responsible of reassuring that overall cleanliness was maintained throughout my area, making it easier for guests to find exactly what they need and leaving an overall good impression of the store. Store guests were very demanding at times, but I definitely learned that staying positive and trying to accommodate whatever I could for them was essentially the great asset to having them come back to the store; which was profitable for the company. Trying to satisfy everyone seems almost like an impossible tasks, it was very difficult to always offer customers what they wanted and disappointing them at times telling them not exactly what they wanted to hear was the hardest part of my job. What I most appreciated about Target was the connection I made with my co-workers. Our staff consisted of several younger adults, therefore it was very easy to interact with them, establishing a very positive attitude within the work area. A plausible atmosphere amongst good people is something that is definitely appealing in a job."
good,"I work in the D.C. in Phoenix, Hard Job but the pay was decent and they tweeked my schedule enough for me to go back to school."
good,help co-workers get the store ready for the day. helping customers is always fun.
good,"Worked in Fitting Room, answered phones."
good,Typical day at work would include delivering great customer services  while maintaining the assigned work space. This would include zoning our assigned area to make sure merchandise were neatly stocked and aligned. Keeping an open line of communication through two-way radios between co-workers and management. I've learned to be efficient and multitask to have my designed area completed by the end of the day. Management was strict and demanded the best out of their workers. Co-workers were dependable and cooperative. Hardest part of the job was having your area completed while delivering outstanding customer services. Most enjoyable part was the experience I've gained through my time working at Target.
good,Moving up the latter may be a bit irrational but its a great place to start working and getting experience
good,"driving forklift, stocking items, pulling orders off computers to load on trucks for different stores,"
good,"Target is a great place to work for a first time job, they employees there from entry to store manager are friendly and helpful and always respectful, But as told many times by many employees in many positions ""never expect a promotion."""
good,"My typical day dealt with answering phones, zoning, cleaning up, helping customers, building displays, keeping areas organized, and occasionaly working cash registers. I learned how to zone and always put the customer first. My co-workers were generally nice and willing to help each other out. The hardest part of the job was working during big shopping days, such as Black Friday, and the Christmas season. I enjoyed expanding my experience, and working for a company who is devoted to pleasing their customers."
good,"It was a good job, the work that was required of me didnt meet the pay grade."
good,"A day at work for Target starts out slow paced but, gradually speeds up.  It's a fun fast-paced working environment and my co-workers and team management makes the day enjoyable and full of fun and laughter.  They're very dependable and helpful when needed.  I would say the hardest part of this job is checkout when the store becomes hectic and full of customers."
good,"Working at the electronics department at Target has opened my eyes and taught me much about different types of televisions, cameras, and video game systems. I already had a good sense on how things worked, but my team leader was very informative, very knowledgeable and was always willing to work with you. It did get busy and hectic at times but it's understandable with electronics being hot sellers with people in this day and age. Management had their flaws but I've rarely had problems with how the company was run."
good,"Long hours, great management development and an awesome Executive Management team as peers. The hardest part is dealing with guest who are not always friendly."
good,"My first job.  Target is where I learned what a job meant, how to communicate with clients/customers, how to save money, what a lot of money felt like, how to operate a cash register, inventory, overcoming objections, work safety, work etiquette, responsibilities, and more."
good,It was a lot of going out and talking to people that would likely not be looking to buy a phone but allowed you to not only improve relationships between you and the rest of the store but also allowed you to build a reputation with more people in the community. Great teamwork between stores allowing you to get answers to issues without having to always call a help desk.
good,As an exec you can expect to work an average of 10 hour days.  Sometimes this can go up to 12 hour days depending on the time of the year.  You can expect to be busiest around 4th quarter.  Plan on taking vacations in February and March as that is when the work is less.
good,I loved working at Target. The only thing I didn't enjoy was how much upper management changed.
good,"A typical day in retail consists of excellent customer service, patience and understanding of others' needs. The ability to make educated decisions, and be able to continuously multitask. Management was always open to new ideas in order make the job more enjoyable and pleasant for the guests. Co-workers are upbeat and for the most part are all team players. Working for Target was a breeze."
good,It was a good experience being a cashier and customer service rep for target. I was able to meet some famous tv actors and Rapers
good,"Typical day as an executive is managing forty to fifty team members. Balancing multiple daily processes while continually working to build a strong team culture and ever increasing sales. "
good,A typical day is a learning day and what i learned to do a very good job and my co workers  was hard workers an a help hand and the most enjoyable is overnight stocking
good,I enjoyed my time at Target I love their training and cash registers but I had the worse co-workers and they made my time there a living hell!!
good,Target is a good company to work for. I feel they value their employees and that is always a plus.
good,I was cashiering at Target and decided to relocate closer to home
good,"A typical day of an Executive for Target is never the same and never dull.  You will excel if you enjoy thinking critically and quickly on your feet, collaborating with a diverse group of professionals, adapting to an ever changing retail landscape, and serving the community.  There are many opportunities to develop professionally and personally with the many Captainships and Mentorships that Target provides.  You will also find that you are able to communicate with and learn from leadership at all levels."
good,"Fun at Work,Informative and Productiv"
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in on time (unless an emergency comes up), and start working immediately. While organizing shelves on isles, I would constantly get harassed by my Supervisor for ""not going fast enough"" or ""going too fast"". He would come up to me about an hour or two after I finish an isle and complain it's a mess, because dozens of customers had gotten to it. It made work very stressful, and started to frustrate me that I was getting picked on, yet he was nice to every other employee. Other than him, I enjoyed my days working here and would love to do it again. All the co-workers were fantastic and easy to get along with! Most enjoyable part of the job was closing. Got to chat and listen to music while finishing up all the isles after the store closed."
good,It is a fast pace environment but funny at the same time.  Job usually is demanding with strong Target politics of customer service.  Sometimes the lack of people makes the job impossible and hard but it is possible to work with fun at the same time.
good,Customer Service.  It's a retail job... so you know kind of what to expect.  Target does make an effort to make sure employees are happy.
good,This was hands down the best company I ever worked for. The in-stock and logistics process are almost one of the only like it among other companies with a backroom in order it ensures the sales floor is consistently filled and up to standard for guest. There is a a segregation of departments with the utmost delicacy to create a daily workflow that is almost perfect. The different departments are also cross trained and cooperate with each other for a real team player attitude that gets the workforce to complete all task almost to 100 percent daily. The only downside to the work horse is the management that might find itself to comfortable and forgetting to reach for higher.Some forget to get their hands dirty with their crew to help finish things and boost morale. I did however learn more into the logistics aspect of retail and was a very useful education.
good,"great managment, fast paced,great work experience,unload trucks,distribute freight around store and stock shelfs,recovery (putting merchandise to correct location."
good,Target is a great place to develop and learn new skills The management is very understandable and they work with you and care.
good,"Busy from the moment i walk in the door till i leave."
good,Target is a great place to work and it is a great place to learn leadership skills and develop yourself into a true leader. They have a great leadership development program. This is a retail job and you are required to work weekends and schedules that change. There is opportunity for advancement. There is a strong team environment at Target. Faced paced but a great place to work.
good,had no problems with working there I like the staff work with food at there counter no much management on that side of things
good,"Im glad this was my first job. I got to learn a lot in the time I was there. My schedule was flexible and the managers were very friendly and understanding. A typical day at work would consist of doing the go backs in my section then doing other sections if my managers asked me to. After I finished with the go backs I would organize, stock, cashier, and other projects my superiors asked me to do. Overall I had a lot of fun working here.                                                           "
good,"Safety, Quality, and Productivity drives the company. Fast paced and team oriented. Rational methods are used to make decisions on issues that may arise with day to day business."
good,"My role as a Backroom Logistics Team Member within Target consists of storage management and replenishment. My workload consists of loading and reloading items that have been purchased. We make sure the sales floor and the backroom is kept up to Target Brand standards by maintaining stocked shelves, clean aisles, organization and returning to proper place of stray items while catering to our guests needs."
good,"Great place to work most of the time. Depending on the department you work , you could go in as early as 4 a.m. I learned many things with Target. I worked in at least 3 different areas. The hardest part of the job was the fact that almost every holiday is spent there and away from your family. The best thing about Target is the team work and people I worked with for 10 years."
good,"Here at Target, I partake in general manager tasks, but had a unique position. I am the Executive Team Leader of Guest Experience which entails me having a passion for extraordinary guest service. I fostered my communication skills and my ability to engage and inspire the team to  drive an overall higher- than- expected customer service throughout the store. The store consistently accomplished ""green standing"" with its guest survey scores, which graded us on what percent our guests were ""Amazed"" with our service! I accomplished this by observing and coaching the team on how to go the extra mile for our guests and by recognizing them for their hard work and great guest comments. At the front end, I have led trough my Team Leader's on how to empower our cashiers, guest service team member, and sales floor team on driving credit card conversion by engaging the team in the perfect sales pitch. We are currently over Target's goal of a 2.5%YTD and at a 2.7%YTD (and growing) in credit card conversion. "
good,"•Assisted the pharmacists in order entry, pulling medications and filing to completion."
good,"A typical day at work for me would depend on what part of the store i was working in.Usually for the backroom my day would begin at around 3:30 a.m. and continue on until about noon. In that time I would assist with unloading our freight truck and storing the product in our backroom. If i was working with the presentation team, I would be in charge of resetting aisles and end caps with new product. What  I learned from there was time management and how to properly store items in the backroom. As well as, how to follow a planogram. The management there overall was fun to work with. They were all very encouraging and helped to make their employees more efficient at their jobs without safety risks. The hardest part of my job was having to wake up at 3:00 in the morning to get ready for work. The most enjoyable part of my job was when we went through our remodel and got to see how our work really helped push that process to completion."
good,"I've worked at Target most of my adult life. I feel like a grew up there, in ways. I wish hard workers received larger pay increases, but its based on a scale. Management is often downright silly, with their focus on more sales and promoting credit cards than having a well staffed store. Hours given are reasonable, but there is hardly enough coverage, making for harder work and more stress when dealing with guests."
good,"As a sales floor team member, my duties were to keep a specific area zoned and clean at all times. I was to help out with cashiering and customer assistance. "
good,"A typical day at work was very calm, we come in and clock in of course then we go to our stations and get started on what we have to do, mostly everyone has the same assignment everyday but at times it will change and will do different things. The management was very focus they all knew what task needed to be done and they would make sure that it was all done before the day was up and it would be done by the team. the co-workers were very friendly i had a lot of fun at times when i was working. the hardest part of the job at time was when i had to work on assignments alone when i normally would have a few people on a normal day help me as i would for them as well. The most enjoyable parts of the job was when at times we would work and our boss would get a conversation about sports or anything else that was an interesting album"
good,"As a cashier, my typical workday was just that. I had the pleasure of working in a friendly, clean, and fast-paced environment with coworkers who were a pleasure to work with. My managers often praised us for our good work and helped us improve when we were struggling. I felt like I was more that just a team member, I felt like I was part of something great and in turn made me want to be great. I constantly wanted to go above and beyond for my supervisors, asking them for any little thing that could help when the store was slow. I was eager to come into work knowing that the customers were familiar faces because of the pleasurable experience they had that I had given them! Overall there wasn't any part of this job I didn't enjoy. Well, maybe except for occasionally having to grab carts from outside in a snowstorm. The absolute hardest part of this job was Black Friday. I had the lucky register that was closest to where customers first saw so needless to say it was a madhouse. As a result of working that day I got more experience then I think a normal cashier would have gotten in an entire year! "
good,"Target is the perfect place to work if you are pursuing college education, or are only interested in part time hours. They are very flexible with hours, and people are normally willing to cover shifts for you if you have an emergency pop up. Unfortunately if you are looking to support yourself and need 40 hours a week you will have a hard time meeting that need."
good,"Working for one of the larget retail stores in the United States was exciting.  The store was fast paced and the management was strict, but fair.  "
good,I back stocked everyday.  I learned how to work as a team.  Management of this job was excellent.  My co-workers were the best. Hardest part of the job was the pay.  Everything I enjoyed about this job 
good,"Buena empresa, con grandes beneficios para sus clientes."
good,"Target is a great place to work if your number one objective is to promote. If you are willing to put in the hard work, and long hours, you will have an opportunity to advance up the career ladder at a rapid pace. "
good,"A typical day at work is replenishing products on the shelf, what i learn there is you have to not only show up but be on time, Management and co-workers there do their job although some of the employees think its all play no work. The hardest part about the job in being on cardboard but the most enjoyable part is the breaks."
good,I love working for target its a very energetic and fun place to work just wish they paid more the benefits are ok workplace and management are good also.
good,It takes a village to have a store work properly and target as taught me to have great communication with everyone. I also learned how  take constructive criticism without feeling emotional and becoming a better worker.
good,"Every day there is something new that presents its self as a new challenge to enable me to be resilient and adaptable."
good,"This job was one of my favorites. It was at night but even though the work hours were an adjustment, when you came into work at night, it was like a normal day. No one was unhappy or at all different from the time of night. It was always friendly, always positive and everyone worked hard. Everyone was willing to help one another and there was no real sense of competition between employees. Support was never lacking. It was always great to get some good hard work done while still using your brain at the same time. It really was an even match between mental and physical labor."
good,"Working for Target was an overall enjoyable experience. The pay was good and the management did a great job in training people to succeed. My particular position as a manger required a level of stress management that I was not prepared for, but the management was very supportive and helpful in this."
good,I worked there as a Freshman in college. I really didnt stay there long because i was attending school.
good,"Very very positive environment to work in, but still there is almost no room to advance or get promoted without a degree at least that is what we were told at the Shaw and Marks location. Also very fluctuating hours based on demand, never a set schedule and you could not depend on a steady income. Other than that, it was a very positive experience."
good,start your day with team meeting to discuss daily achievement and corporate standards for the fiscal year. following the meeting you head down to start your shift and help as many guest as you can. i learned that exuding outstanding customer service you can personally change a persons day for the best leaving an impact that will never fade. as of any workplace leave friendships and personal matters at the door to evade any conflicts. the hardest part of working at target is without a doubt is after all our efforts you just cant seem to help a specific guest find what they are looking for and they leave unhappy! target had many joyous moments of work but the greatest joy is entering that building knowing your going to make someones day!
good,Always something to do. Never a boring moment. Management and customers are friendly and easy going.
good,Team members and management are friendly and easy to work with even during stressful times.
good,A very friendly and family orientated environment.Support and training from superiors very good and understandable.
good,"it s good to work as a guest service representative at target. Most of people are friendly and nice.. however, the position does not have much challenge..and less advancement chance. it is a chance for me interact with more different types of people, understanding more people needs and address guest frustration in some situation.However i would like to have more challenge and the jobs should be related to my education. I would say this job is good to help me familiar with retail industry and gain more experience in customer service field. However it s not meet my career path expecttaion."
good,Target Department stores was a good job. It was always busy. I learned to be fast and fun at the sametime in what I do. My co workers were nice. The hardest part about the job would be not having enough people at the end of the night to help clean up for the next day. The most enjoyable part about Target was working with my co workers and meeting different people.
good,"a lot of room for advancement, its like your part of a family. i really enjoy working here"
good,My experience working for this Target Super Center was something i really enjoyed. The job was demanding at times but also was relaxed depending on how efficient you were in the area I worked in. I like to have a challenge while working and this position gave that to me but I had fun at the same time.
good,"I was responsible for making sure that that area I was working in was neat and organized for when guests came to shop, always greet each guest quickly and friendly. Make sure I always use our signature line ""can I help you find something?"" I enjoyed all of my co workers and I feel that we all worked very well together. My manager was always very helpful and I always felt that I could ask her anything if needed. The hardest part of the job i'd say was the stress of opening a brand new store in the middle of downtown San Francisco, but I would also say that this was the most enjoyable part as well as rewarding."
good,"My typical day at Target involved coming in to a heavy work load, answering high volume phone calls, managing fitting room and customers. Hardest part of the job sometimes the amount of clothing that had to be sorted, hung, and put away, re-tagged or tagged in general. The co-workers had seniority problems. Most thought because they were there for a long period of time, they were able to tell the newer employees what to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some of the employees that were friendly and being able to give customers my opinion on what would look right with what or just helping the customers in general."
good,"Target was a fun place to work at everyday was new learning experience and challenge. My supervisors were fair and understanding. The team I worked with was efficient and good at working together to accomplish the tasks at hand. Assisting customers was fun and challenging at time, but was often rewarding."
good,"My typical day consist of meeting with my six direct reports about daily tasks and company goals. My job is to drive sales and guest service within the store. I am responsible for all merchandising and guest interactions. I have three peers, who cover Assests Proctection, HR and Logistics. The hardest part of my job is balancing an extreme workload with limit payroll resources. The goals have remained high every year, yet resources (hours) have been cut due to the economy. The most enjoyable part about Target, is a very team focused environment. Target has high ethical and professional standards."
good,Fun place to work
good,"The best part of the job is the people. Benefits are very good, the pay is good - it's above minimum wage and you do get annual raises based on performance (there is a cap, though). There is a more than reasonable amount of difficulty to advance in the company, which can be discouraging. However, there is job security. There are people who have worked at the store level for over 20 years. The company is very focused on making the workplace rewarding, fun, and safe. Very flexible with accommodating outside schedules but with less availability comes a lot less hours. Overall, I'd recommend this job for anyone looking for exactly that - a job, not a career."
good,"I love this place as an employer. Everyday I go into work I am always greeted with smiles and kind words, the managers all make me feel like I am more then just some employee. I love getting to handle the guests questions and sales, but I must admit the job did have its downsides in the form of a payroll based hours system that left you work time rather speradic and sometimes rare. However that being said this was only during the first month or two after christmas and then the hours would pick back up."
good,getting to work i would meet up with my team lead to get the plan together for the day. We would unload trucks on various days take stock off shelves in back of store and push it out to the floor to fill shelves then back stock what didnt fit. managment was great and so were my co workers the hardes part was lifting heavy boxes and most enjoyable part was the team atmosphere
good,"I worked from 10 pm to 7 am at Target on Broad st. in Richmond , VA. I learned how to stock and store target's inventory. My co workers very fun to work with. I liked this job because it paid well and it was a peaceful working environment."
good,"Really good company to work for. Strong company culture, good support structure for professional development."
good,"As a Target team member I was able to learn the values of working as a team to carry out specific tasks. Some of these tasks included, following planogram worksheets, stocking of shelves and maintaining overall store products. I believe in working at Target I gained a true sense of insight to the functions of a department store."
good,I would always show up for work and then go straight to the registers and stay there till my breaks. Management and co-workers where okay but seemed to much into drama then work.
good,"Typical day at work would include stocking shelves, making sure store is picked up, and helping guests locate desired item. Learned how to better communicate with co-workers and management. Management and co-workers were always willing to help whenever needed. Hardest part about the job was making sure everything was stocked before the store was opened. The most enjoyable part was working together with co-workers as a team to make sure our store was intact for guests coming to shop."
good,on a typical day i do a closing shift. i ring and bag customers items at the checkout lanes. i clean the store after each shift so it can be neat and clean for the next business day.i learn how a big business runs and operates. the management team and my co-wokers were very nice and helpful. the hardest part of the job was deal with diffucult guest and the late night hours. i enjoyed working in a new enviroment and meeting all the people i met.
good,Great place to work. Friendly people and great team culture.
good,good job but not really much room for advancement. Nice people and environment
good,Great culture and atmosphere. Family orientated company with great values.
good,"• Receive and count stock items, and record data manually or using computer."
good,I learn alot from target as well and while i was working there i was going to school as well so they help work around my school and homework
good,"Great company to work for. There isn't much promoting within the company, they rather look for new people that do do not know anything about target and give them management positions instead of working with the team members that we currently have and promoting them. As a regular team member the hours are not steady, you can not live on your own with the hours they give. One week you may have 38 hrs the next week you may have 8. So the hours are not steady enough to keep up with an apartment or a car note. The company as a whole and how things are ran are pretty smooth though."
good,I only worked their for 3 months but I enjoyed the experience.
good,"Target was a good experience for me, and helped me realize that hard work and dedication makes happy customers. It was a learning experience at Target, and a great company with high moral values."
good,"Early shifts, late shifts whatever your needs, you can laugh and have fun with the guests, in fact it is encouraged that you make a connection."
good,"I have been at Target for over two years now, almost three. I may not have been here long enough to be well experienced with how things go down but I do believe I have the general idea. It is definitely a fun, nice-attitude place to work. The employees are generally nice to work with and there has never really been a problem. Management has its ups and down, however. They definitely take care of their employees by compensating them for their hard work. There are plenty of events. I do believe, however, this could be reflected in a monetary system, but it's good enough. I gave management three stars because I do believe they lack communication and the ability to handle sticky situations. Because of this, problems do arise that often gets blamed on the team. The same can be said about the team though. Regardless, though, I can come into work and see smiling faces, no one complaining, and the freedom to do my job and get things done."
good,"For me, it was a fun and speedy place to work. Once you get the hang of what to do, it's easy to stay on a roll."
good,"food area for work, learn to used all equipment frienlys people working shift 12 hours work four days have 3 days off"
good,Everyday is a different day to work at Target. They value their employees and know how to work around their schedule
good,A typical day at work involves checking multiple system applications for current updates and planning a workload based on those metrics. I have learned time and talent management skills. Management wants to see people do well and is constantly on the lookout for great talent to promote. The hardest and most rewarding part of the job is pushing the team to meet weekly deadlines. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team work.
good,"Hired as a part time ""Hardlines"" employee. Mainly stocking, zoning, and helping with guests accompanied by occasional cashiering. Eventually worked mainly in electronics, with a greater responsibility of electronics keys and locking up valuables. Most challenging was juggling responsibilities with the constant need for guest and cashiering help. Awesome management and co-workers. Confusing at times as there can be 2-3 team leaders telling you different things at the same time. most enjoyable part was helping people find what they need."
good,I enjoyed working for Target. I built lasting friendships and I appreciated the fact that management was willing and able to work with my schedule.
good,Was eligible for great benefits even though I was only working part time. Target has wonderful management and they lead by example!
good,What I learned Working for TGT is that team work makes the dream work. I had the best support team that helped me out with alot of training and gaining the crew respect down the line.
good,"very fun work environment and very productive. All the workers were very friendly and helpful not only to customers but for each other as well, probably one of the best team environments i've worked in."
good,Great place to work with many opportunities for advancement.
good,Wonderful place to be employed. Co-workers were always helpful. The most enjoyable part of the day is getting to help guest.
good,Busy and friendly while keeping pace with guests requests and making sure they had a memorable and happy experience. Execs and team leads always on hand to help out when needed. Fun monthly activities for team members to interact with each other.
good,"Target is a great company to work for, the best of retail. Their training and expectations far exceeds their competitors in the business. Target really values its team with an inclusive culture from all team levels, hourly team members as well as management. Target offers very competitive salaries for its managers if you can survive and thrive in the very intense retail world where work/life balance usually takes a back seat to work success. Target offers ample opportunity for growth in a company that is still thriving in a tight economic times."
good,Target is a corporation that knows how to take care of people from team members all the way up to management. Target is dedicated to creating highly effective teams that deliver outstanding guest service. The work is challenging and there is always something to do. Managment shows concern for each employee and is dedicated to driving the best guest service. Co-workers are caring and friendly often adding to the team spirt. The hardest part of the job is it is retail. The hours can be long and the guest can be complicated but as long as you are service oriented and hard working you will do fine. Every day you will leave with a sense of accomplishment if you are doing the job correctly.
good,"It's pretty mutch simple; just provide good guest service, and work hard and you'll be alright."
good,"Target is a franchise so they have the ability to provide great benefits, compensation, and opportunities for their employees."
good,Making sure all the scanners are working properly.Helping my co workers unload the trucks and placing them on the right pallets.working as ateam to get the job done.
good,Target has helped me become the leader that I always wanted to be. I am not only able to showcase my skills that I already have but Target helped me to build on those skills as well as add new ones.
good,Good place to work. Very busy. Learned to work as a team. Interaction with customers were very important. It was good seeing satisfied customers.
good,"I enjoyed me time at target, the people were friendly an the work was interesting. I enjoyed meeting new people and serving our guests."
good,"The hours are flexible and they are willing to work around your college schedule or family schedule. I got my first shot here at learning how to work the sales floor. A typical day in Soft Lines (clothing dept) or on the Sales floor in general was folding clothes, putting misplaced items back where they belong, zoning clothes on racks or items on shelves, back up cashiering, assisting customers in jewelry dept and occasionally restocking items. The job was fairly easy, but it can be stressful do to the daily deadline of trying to get things done by the end of the day. I enjoyed my time here."
good,"I go into work 3-4 days out of the week, i get maybe 20 hrs. I unload trailers and put boxes on pallets, take them on the floor and stock them. I've learned alot from this company, anything from responsibilites to use a compactor machinery,the bailers(smashes boxes),pallet jacks,safety precautions,maintence and merchandise stocks. My co-workers are fun to work with,we work as ONE team so everyone finishes on time and we leave out together. The managers are optimistic,fast moving,smart,always answer my questions, and easy to work with. The only hardest part of the job is that you have to be fast and strong for lifting heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting treated equally, fun,easy work, and co-workers are funny!"
good,"This is a great place to work as there are many people to get to know. A typical day at work consists of unloading a truck of product to be placed on shelves for customers to partake. In doing this, there are many co-workers involved(30). It takes team work and the occasional assistance in lifting heavy items as a team. The hardest part of the job is the activity it involves. It requires constant movement of items as heavy as 50 lbs, bending and streching, turning, and the use of box cutters. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the team mates and becoming friends."
good,"Target has been very good to me. However, it would be better suited for an individual who is not married and without children."
good,"The job was satisfactory to my need at the time. The work environmental was cordial, and I never felt overwhelmed."
good,"Work atmosphere is inviting. Team members are friendly and are always willing to help. A typical day at work consists of working on go-backs, assisting guests, and ensuring products are visually presentable."
good,"it was my first job. I would show up before my shift would start, sit in the break room with Direct TV and relax before I put my items in lockers provided for employees. Clock in and find my (current) supervisor on duty, as a cashier its about moving quickly yet still helping the guest in anyway you can and provide a friendly face on their way out. I learned that I enjoyed working for the sake of keeping myself busy, the paycheck was nice too. I felt that there was always someone in management if I needed something, 95% of co-workers were extremely friendly. Hardest part of the day was when I couldn't get away from the register for an extended period of time because of constant business. I enjoyed turning off my light and walking around picking up hand carts and putting them back where they belong. I enjoyed all the nice friendly face that I got to meet everyday, some people I will remember forever."
good,No day at Target is typical. Fast paced and ever changing. I learned allot about all the facilities within Target. My last supervisor was great. She had a personal stake in all here people. The hardest part was the ambiguity. The most enjoyable part was having my peers come to me for advise on their facilities.
good,A happy enviroment to work at. I loved working here. it was very energetic And challanging. everything got done the way it should have.
good,"While working with Target, my day consisted of processing any damages that were found in the store, returning or exchanging products for guests, and dealing with any problems. My ability to handle customer inquiries in the most efficient manner greatly improved in this time, but the work quickly became repetitive. For the most part I had a great experience with my management and co-workers, excluding the occasional bad egg. Leaving Target was a difficult decision, but I did not want to start a career, and I did not see a desirable path of advancement at such a corporation."
good,"Deliver Price Accuracy, expected to be a Fast, Fun & Friendly Team. Keep it Brand by Clearance Presentation- keeping it full and zoned, maintaining a neat and clean working environment. Be Fast and Friendly by delivering great guest service."
good,Target is a great place to work. They are very friendly and provide a fun environment to work in while being tactful and mindful of the customers. They do not provide many work hours to part- time employees and they should change that.
good,This is a great job for someone who is in school. They are extremely flexible with hours.
good,Unloading truck to be prepared for stock
good,a typical day at work would be fixing things in the store that need ed to get done.
good,"helping customer's stocking shelves cleaning floors assisting customer's, at Redrobin greeting customers,cleaning tables,sweeping the floors. keeping the bathroom clean."
good,"Target was a good company to work for during the past six years. It had a good environment to work in with friendly team members to work with. If I needed help helping a guest find something in the store, my fellow team members would come and assist me. Being at Target has shown me what it means to be a part of a team and have fun doing it. If I had a question to ask, my team leaders and executive team leaders would do there best to answer it. I would say the hardest part of the job would be constantly dealing with the attitudes of the guests that came to our store, but most enjoyable part is talking to those guests when they come to the checkout lane."
good,i think working at target is a good job i just wish that it paid more
good,"Working at target is a good job to gain sales experince. You can move up in the company the longer you stay. Working in electronics is exciting, and the work is not hard. The main thing one needs to know is how to use a PDA, it is a very useful device which tells if a item is in stock or which store may have the item. Being in electronics it may get busy, but team members are always willing to come and help when needed."
good,I enjoyed working here alot
good,Great company to work for. Great Advancement oppurtunitys.
good,Was a good place to work that instilled good safety and work habbits in its employees. Allowed employees to experiences different jobs within the warehouse.
good,"Its a fast, fun and friendly business, i need to grow and use my degree within my career"
good,"A typical day i would have at least 100 customers come through my line, and it was very fast paced just because it was in the holiday season. I learned to breath and take my time with things, because just one slip you can forget something. The management team were very supportive and would help me with anything that i needed. Co-workers were great, we all worked as a team."
good,"A Perfect Place to Settledown but not in your early career life. I would say do not step into this best company when you are in your early stages of your career because you will not get an opportunity to learn different aspect of Job. Take risk, understand the pressure, grab lot of knowledge then head twoards this company! There you just need to input all you learned so far."
good,Control sales floor and maintain sales floor inventory. Learned great customer service. The company manages everyone with hands -on training. Fun environment. Customer service and pleasing new customers was the most enjoyable part of the days work.
good,"Target is a good company to work for. Though its focus is on the front end part of the business, corporate has started to realize the importance of having a good pharmacy and a strong pharmacy team,"
good,"Nice people and nice place to work. The boss were fun, great if you are trying to work on your customer service."
good,A place that inspires you to be great. Great place to make friends and meet interesting people.
good,"Management supports and pay attention to employee needs. I learned customer service skills, cashiering, and various retail skills. Co-workers were friendly and helped out when I was in a bind and needed a few days off."
good,"It was a pleasant place to work, co workers were very friendly and informative and always willing to help."
good,A typical day at work would consist of speaking with guests all day long. Helping them find what they are looking for is guaranteed. Sometimes I would need to work at the cash register especially when thing got really busy. Organizing the products were a must as well for a salesfloor team member.
good,"Keeping the store looking new, for a good guest impression."
good,Target was a fast pace retail environment. As an Executive I was responsible for many employees. This position stregnthed my leadership and organizational skills
good,Great place for a career. Has the usual ups and downs of any workplace. I would return if offered a position. Daily tasks are various and store is very structured. Rules and regulations are enforced.
good,It was a good job to have during school. I do like the people there and loved the customers.
good,"This job was fun, and on a basic day we always pushed for better guest service. Mangement was always friendly and around for questions. Hardest part about this job is the zoneing to help clean up. Most enjoyable is the benefits."
good,"Greeted customers , cashier, stocked cashier area. Clean and friendly place. Pretty easy work"
good,"It was fun working at Target, Everyone always had a smile on and we always had fun, but the management walks by and all they wanted was business."
good,Whether you're just starting out in the workforce or you have some experience Target is a great place with great culture.
good,"Targets focus is to be fast, fun and friendly, and they are experts at it. A day of work goes by quickly, a constant flow of guests keeps you busy and entertained. Managers are personable and understanding. They are very understanding and flexible with schedule hours, which is appreciated by everyone. However, during the retail slow season, hours are cut and it is hard to keep a steady schedule, which is understandable, but still frustrating."
good,Targets is a great brand. Some store managers (STLs) are better than others at developing your talents. But the experience itself will teach you a lot. I was fortunate to have great partners and with their help we developed our teams to be great. Compensation is well above average and the bonus' are very nice for those that contribute.
good,A typical NIGHT would be unloading and stocking. I learned how to use the pallet jacks and forklifts. The management was super helpful in my training. My co-workers were hard working and dedicated. The hardest part of the job was the schedule. The mosy enjoyable part of my job was the pay.
good,Target isn't that bad of a place to work for if you're either retired or a college student. It's actually not too bad of a place in general so long as you do what expected of you. The downfall is like all retail the hourly pay for team members isn't that great which is why I'm looking for a job that I can start a career with.
good,My job as a cashier was very demanding but overall the place values its team members and guest.
good,"Overall great place to work. It's also like a family working at Target. Since I've started working there, I have learned and gained a lot of knowledge about the company and even myself. Always busy but it's also fun."
good,Target for me was a great place to work while i was going to college. They would work with my schedule whenever my school schedule changed. The only problem was that the hours were not enough to pay all my bills and it lead to me needing to find a second job. If the hours would have been better then i would have been a happy camper as they say.
good,"Target was like family to me, and I really enjoyed working there. Systems were in place for everything, and the general company attentiveness to detail appealed to me."
good,"great job, good benefits, insurance, the hours were great and it was a pretty nice work environment"
good,I wor fulltime and parttime in this co Beaverton OR for five years. i was happy with co. I resine from this job because i got full time job with better benifits.
good,"I enjoyed my days at work due to how productive I was and how I had nice co-workers to talk to about the job and help each other out and having managers that would help me when I had problems. The hardest part of the job was having to stock and face all items I needed to do for the day due to there being so many and many customers to assist, but it helped me become more proficient and taught me more work skills while also trying new things such as being at the cash register."
good,At Target life moves very fast but they do give scheduled break and are very good at keeping customers happy they pay a very competitive rate and most of the managers are good people
good,"I highly recommend working here. The environment is nice, the people are all willing to work, and the managers are very understanding. Working there with the guests and talking to them all day about beauty products was one of my favorite things to do."
good,"Overall, Target has given me a chance to better improve my communication skills with other people, better benefit my family, and has better improved my life goals."
good,"Target is all about excellence and company growth, so there are always new changed being made. Benefits are great, but sometimes it can be hard to get days off when you need them. Management is great and really works to train new employees well. Hiring process is fairly easy and quick as well."
good,"Great place to work overall. This was my first job and I learned a lot of things it also is a great pay , starting at 13 per hour and soon to increase to 15."
good,"I would definitely work that company again. The company Does not require constant supervision."
good,"The store i worked at was great but i had a hard time cause the training was not the best, which slowed my work for a while. They have a good system so is wasnt hard to learn."
good,"A lot of work, but not difficult work. Pay could be better for the area, but overall satisfied.The managers are involved in your success of the section you work in."
good,Good work environment and super motivated in keeping the guest visit welcomed. They were super flexible with my schedule and helpful when I needed them with guest service
good,"Any retail job will be very stressful, especially at a big company, like Target. Managers and team leads were very kind and always willing to help. I'd say the hardest part of the job was having to help others complete their work, after quickly finishing your own, especially when working a closing shift. Having to rush and stress about other's work on top of your own can be very hard. The most enjoyable part was getting close to coworkers. It's easy to relate to each other while working, and you kind of naturally can get along with them since retail is so hectic."
good,Target has great customer service and take great care of their customers. Everyone is very friendly especially the customers. Also their main priority is making sure the customer leaves satisfied.
good,"Things were quit slow every now and then, but the location i worked at received lots of business especially around the holidays. Very neat and comfortable kind of work space. A typical day at target is pretty much organizing and helping guests to the correct departments, then making sure they got in and out in a timely manner."
good,It was good for the most part but not the manager i worked for he was new but also not a good one he made the employees feel rushed and pressured as well and giving them stress
good,"I was hired add seasonal help, and really hoped to stay on the team  sadly I didn’t get to, but I am grateful for the work experience. The team leads are really good to the workers, but if argue they lack at communication occasionally."
good,"Target was really big on making sure they instilled Fast, Fun, and Friendly service. They made sure that we felt a sense of fulfillment, while making sure we displayed a quick and inviting service for our guests."
good,"The co-workers I worked with were very energetic, hard working, and the task was always done faster than the time required by us to achieve. I had a blast working with them and would highly advise working there too."
good,"Target is a good place to work, the managers are there to help you succeed and the job can be rewarding if you choose to let it be! While working at Target the main goal is to have guest satisfaction, however they are also concerned with employee satisfaction. They are very flexible with availability and time off."
good,"Target was a great experience it taught me money management by getting paid every other week which makes you stretch your money and only spend what you need..the pay was good considering I came from single digit pay, ultimately target was great."
good,I feel like target is a good place to work at the time flies especially having very nice guest makes the work easier it’s a friendly environment and I feel like anyone would like it
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and involves a lot of moving . I’ve Lear’s how to pick ,also work a zebra. I love me job I get to interact with customers daily .the hardest. Part is not being able to find certain items ."
good,I been working in warehouse for more than 3 years I love working longer shift than feel like your working eveyday I like working as a team helping others
good,"It was a great job with good pay and benefits, nothing too strenuous but unloading the truck and picking certain pallets off the line could be very hard work. I think flow team employees could be compensated a bit more for the wee work they do. Other than that it was a great job and I should have stuck with it. Live and learn."
good,The team at target is amazing. They work with you availability if you go to school.  Team becomes like your second family. Learned great skills such as money handling and dealing with customers complaints.
good,"A typical day at work was busy and enjoyable. Clock in, and off I went. Then, walk up the front of the store and go to either the cash registers or customer service. Customer service I enjoyed the most. The difficult customers are never as agitated as they seem. If you show respect and manners, you will get that in return. I liked my supervisor and manager; they are both a great boss. They're nice but firm. I learned all of the people skills anyone could want: how to read people, how to gauge their mood, and how to make their day. Just an extra minute to explain something can make someone's day."
good,Target is a great company to work for. I have worked for them previous times. The people are ways great and helpful. The environment is great. They love helping people.
good,Target is a competitive company who is always looking for fresh ideas to be on top of it's game. Great team to work with and high spirited. The pay is fair and the benefits are also great.
good,"The Target location I work at always makes sure we put our guests first. Creating great guest experiences has always come naturally to me and if you have people skills, you’ll fit in perfectly. The team leads at my location are very understanding and helpful. I had to cover another person’s area as well as my own, and the team lead for that night helped me out so I wouldn’t be overwhelmed!"
good,"It can be stressful selling credits to guests, but aside from the expected stress of retail, it was a good place to work. Managers were always willing to work with my school schedule. You are required to be available for holiday shifts (such as working Thanksgiving and Black Friday), but this is clearly laid out upon being interviewed/hired. Even after I left, old coworkers are welcoming and they work fast. Many people I worked with were able to advance their career their without unnecessary push-back."
good,"Working for target has really been one of the best job experiences ever. They pay very well, they offer good benefits, they really work with you with training and other aspects of your position. End really encourage you to do better."
good,I worked for here a good chunk of time. Its retail. Holidays are crazy. Schedules fluctuate which has been the typical experience in retail for me. However I found myself treated more like an actual human being at Target. That makes a big difference to your mental health and moral. Always willing to help with problems when life got in the way. Good days and bad days of course. I enjoyed working there for most of my time there. Good for entry level.
good,"It was not too stressful which added to the great working environment, the hours are flexible and senior staff provide structure and support when required"
good,"Target was a fun experience. Although it was kind of fast-paced, it was easy to catch on. Interacting with customers is a given, and overall a great experience."
good,"I wish Target hired more full timers. The pay has increased since I was there, and that is awesome. Management is about 80% good, 20% not so good. For retail, that's impressive. In general, employees at all levels seem to be treated as people instead of gears on a machine.Target is also great about recycling and donating. I liked Target before working there, and now, I love them!"
good,"At Target, I always felt accepted and appreciated for my work. Target was a very inclusive work place where I met so many amazing people. Target also provided a flexible work schedule which allowed me to focus on school while also working there."
good,"Its a great environment and target gave me the opportunity to show what I can do unfortunately I was laid off because of my performance. I was sad but, it gave me a chance to be better."
good,Target is a pretty nice place to work. The employees are usually nice and so are the manager they’re very flexible with your ours as long as you communicate for places like this communication is key
good,"I know that most retail jobs suck for various reasons. This is very true. "
good,Me gusta su organización en las tiendas y su entrenamiento al personal. Y comprensión para los empleados que hablamos el idioma español.
good,"Typical Work atmosphere, never worked retail only worked fast food but, nevertheless I had a great opportunity and jumped on it, especially for being in highschool it’s well worth it"
good,I enjoyed my Target experience even though it was relatively short. It was easy to learn the job with the minimal training I was provided with. The manager at my location was great and provided me with any help and smiles I needed to do my job the best.
good,"I worked here for a little over a year after college in 2009. I enjoyed my time there. The work was pretty straightforward. They cross trained me to do POG. "
good,Really enjoyed working there. Everyone was super friendly and management was very helpful when I had questions about certain work related things. Recommend my friends to apply also
good,A good place to work at if you love working with other people or groups of people. They offer learning more than just what you apply for (cross-training). People are usually very relaxed at the workplace and easy to get along with. The management like to get to know every employee personally and always tries to help with whatever you're going through or is troubling you.
good,Target is a very fast-paced job that you have to work hard at but you get treated fair and you get excellent feedback for everything you do. They will work around your schedule if need be.
good,"Everyday is kinda like a race against time. There's days where we be packed and have a lot to get down before closing. The workers, managers or hard working people"
good,"A typical day working as a food assistant at Target always started off by making sure the area of work was clean, then I would go on too checking for any outdated items like food, snacks, drinks etc. whenever a customer would come in we would tell them what we had and also what deals were available. The management wasn’t all that great, they never really checked up on you or seen if the cafe needed anything."
good,"Friendly atmosphere, fast paced work, management and coworkers were friendly and very helpful as you learn the ropes and throughout, entry level pay but increases as you climb"
good,"It's a good place to work. The people are nice and understanding. You're not asked so much that you're over burdened. The pay is very good. Hours could be better, but are still good."
good,Very good management and collaboration with employees. I enjoyed the discounts and conversations with customers. Working in Customer Service was not as stressful as other companies.
good,"Going from a stressful office job to target was a great choice. Very relaxed yet quick paced environment. You’ll have to stay on top of your duties in order to keep up, but other than that everyone there is a team and ready to help!"
good,"busy and stressful, love to work with the rest of the team , but did not get along with my last manager and had to live. did not like to be asking to open a credit card to every single guest felt so much pressure from the management. other than that it was good and great experience."
good,"The overall company offers good benefits and flexible schedules. During the holiday and weekend is when they do a lot of hiring. I recommend target for retired people, college students and anyone who is looking to supplement their income."
good,I enjoy working at target only wish was that there were more hours. My previous supervisor was hard to work with but my new supervisor is very team oriented.
good,"Target is fast paced and will cross you in just about anything in the store."
good,"Target is a great work place. A great work environment with so many nice and positive people. It will be sad to see it go but I ready for bigger and better things! The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with the negative customers.  I learned to come out of my shell and be who I am, and to always be positive. The management is amazing they are very understanding, and willing to work with you if you have any problems."
good,"I manage my time based upon the company's expectations of my role, and the needs of the store. My number one focus is the Brand of the building and the experience of the guests."
good,"They have different types of departments which offer sort of a different experience to each person, but I worked through a couple and they weren't too bad. Management was friendly and you could tell the store manager really wanted to make sure everyone did their best, but wouldn't come off as demanding or unlikeable, he was always giving positive criticism. Workers become friends easily with other workers, and we got discounts on a lot of things, even the cafe inside the store."
good,"So I started working at Target as a Flow team member which is a stocker in the early morning. I worked that position for around 7 months and asked to change my supervisor if there was any other position available. I then transferred to a position called Pfresh. At first I was reorganizing industrial freezers, but later I was unloading trucks and reorganizing the fresh food products in the pantry isles and freezers."
good,Overall great place to work coworkers are nice and solve any problems you have. I would say though you will be doing a lot and even more you will love home stressed and even at times unfinished. Schedules range from great hours to low hours very inconsistent
good,"I don’t mind working at target, it’s a great place to work if you need a flexible schedule, the target I work at is great and I love my co-workers, however though the target corporate people aren’t the greatest, they change things every other week, the expect us to get stuff done in little time. The benefits are very good there as well."
good,"•	Stocked shelves, and marked prices on shelves and items."
good,"They start good, helps a lot the guest, always try to be in comunication with the employes "
good,"Target, at least my location, is a great place to work for several reasons but also not so great (because it’s retail). The pros:"
good,It’s essentially a great place to work. They give you the hours and competitive pay that you need and it puts them above the rest. The management is great depending on what department you’re in
good,"Easy work, but a laid back environment. Pay is more than ample for the job. Teamwork could be a little more focused. Sense of self-entitlement in some departments. OMs were mostly good."
good,you have to be willing to work hard. if you have a hard time working as a team and not wanting to. communicate effectively then its not for you. oh Yeah and CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A MUST
good,"On a whole, the customer service aspect was rewarding and built experience.  Some co-workers were a pleasure to work with.  Benefits were nice, and hours were flexible.  Getting a transfer did not work out smoothly, however."
good,"I worked here for over a year and I loved it! The people was really what made working there so fun. The work wasn’t too hard, there was always teamwork involved. Definitely would recommend working here!"
good,This job was a great way to begin my working career in general. There was room to move around the store if I began to dislike cashiering. I moved to the Starbucks within the store and found the management to be less productive than in the rest of the store.
good,"This is a great job if you’re an open, sales driven person. Management can be difficult at times but the team can be super fun and enjoyable. Overall would recommend."
good,Target is a hard working environment that pushes you harder each day. Sometimes they dont push you harder for the better but overall with pay and benefits its worth doing what I do everyday.
good,"I love working for target, but according to the store manager that will determine whether or not you love the job. Some store managers try to make sure they get their bonuses so they will cut team members hours not caring how the store look us to save the hours for their bonus."
good,"Management was lacking in good communication ,this was one of my reasons for leaving. The work load was overwhelming at times."
good,"Working at Target was a great time. The people that work there are very friendly which always makes working hours easier and fun. You have multiple tasks in a day, but with the hours they give you in a day it showed be fairly easy to finish them all. The management is always around to help and there are always people willing to help and answer question any time you have them."
good,There is many things that you need to know and leaned and have to keep up with to be able to be successful working at this store. This was a fun job to have!
good,When working for Target it was very fast pace. There was many things to do and not always enough time to do them. I learned how to balance my work load and helping guest out. I liked my management they were all very nice and even though I had a disability they understood and treated me very fairly. It was hard to keep up with everything we had to do. I liked working with my coworkers and enjoyed my time there.
good,Target provides a fantastic experience for its employees. Everyone is kind to each other and management showed genuine concern for team members. Guests were made a priority and on the front end we were empowered to make their day.
good,"Great company to work with 20 + years. "
good,"The HR and team members we're accepting and friendly, happy to help guests or new members.The people working were all diverse. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping guests with makeup and skincare and informing them about it. I really enjoyed my seasonal position, it was a good first job."
good,"After 10 am it stays busy the whole day. I worked during the holiday season, hence why I was laid off, but it was not on bad terms. The hardest part was just that they pressured everyone to push REDcard sales on the customers."
good,"Not very flexible with your availability. Workload keeps you busy and on your feet at all times. Break times were, in my opinion, pretty great. One thing i really enjoyed were the motivational talks before a shift starts in the mornings or on holidays. Team Leads were attentive to any concerns."
good,I enjoyed working at Target for my short time there. Management was kind and praised you for good work! Other cashier could be gossipy and it will feel like you may not click that well but it’s such a big and busy store it’s easy to avoid chatting. Saturdays are so busy but time goes by. You get multiple mini breaks which is nice and there’s usually food being offered in break room (there’s also a tv.)
good,i learned a lot working at target. i was a cashier and sometimes i worked at the guest services desk. my manager have always been very nice and understanding. team members are very friendly.
good,Great place to work at. Friendly and Knowledgeable co-workers. they offer purchases discounts to all their employees. Parking is not a problem. They make sure that you take your lunch and breaks.
good,My typical day at work would consist on checking the floors to make sure they were clean and organized. I stocked shelves and helped wherever needed when instructed. I worked part time which was around 20-30 hours. During the holiday seasons and the summer time is when I would see an increase in my work hours but outside of that it was hard getting consistent hours. Other than that target was a great place to work overall. My team was very friendly and my managers helped me perform at my best.
good,Target ensured at least 20 hours of work for me per week. I did school and work at the same time.It was easy for to balance school and work. I would work the cash registers and ensure proper flow of service reminding guests of the Target Red Card.
good,"worked on flow team which is good if youd rather not deal with customers during the day. work time was 3:30/4:00 to 12 noon IF and only IF the product truck was over 2100 ""pieces""."
good,"I have had a good time working at Target (Express), management listened to everything I had to say, even as a lowly Team Member. I felt like my opinion was respected and taken into consideration, a hierarchy mentality has not been a problem in this job, which I've experienced in other customer service jobs. None of the Team Members were ""too good"" for any of the jobs non-LOD members did."
good,"I loved being able to work with my co-workers and being able to gain the experience that I needed, but I was there only temporarily, and I wish that I could have stayed longer."
good,"It was very fun very easy-going workplace "
good,Love working for target the vibe is laid back. Everyone is always so friendly. Work keeps your busy. Customers are more friendly then not. Its just over all a great place to work.
good,Working here really helped me gain new skills and build proper work ethics. It’s a fun environment with people willing to help each other and an all around positive team.
good,"Working here is a breeze. Never felt like work when you go in. The atmosphere is friendly and laid back and everyone there is to help you as well as the customer. Breaks were good, always having snacks to enjoy. Day went by fast."
good,"Everyone has always been really nice. Management makes sure your workload is manageable and supports you when you need it. Biggest problem is the lack of hours. Full time should be working at least 32 hours a week, but you're lucky if you get close to 30."
good,Great place to have fun and work hard.   Feeling accomplished at the end of each shift when the day is done.  Great atmosphere and team environment in order to complete daily tasks.
good,I like it I just wish I had more hours. It's nice though. I learned to just be patient and take your time with your work. You'll get it done and you don't have anywhere to be.
good,The job was fun and i would work there again. They were willing to help my with my schedule for school and everyone there was nice and the management was always willing to listen
good,"It’s a good job you meet new friends & everything & great guest and fun activity events. Everything else is good the experience I had was fun, great work staff as well"
good,"Very good work experience, had a easy time adjusting and was trained well. Helpful team kept me motivated, was able to get more hours and the pay was good, enough to live on"
good,"It’s based on the location you worked at. I worked in Pennsylvania and had managers who actually cared about me and checked in on me. They let me take an extra break if I was overwhelmed. We had small snowball fights and water gun fights with the managers. They’re very flexible and will understand if you need less hours. I worked there for 1 1/2 years and I worked cashier, guest services, hardliners, softlines, and market. Basically the entire store. But the managers were also reasonably strict. Not too strict but not too lenient. "
good,I would recommend  this job to any one it is a great place to start off and work if your looking for the work and if you are a person that doesn't mind a little hard work.
good,"During my time at Target, I thoroughly enjoyed the pay, hours during peak business times, co workers, management, and the fast-paced nice clean environment of the store."
good,"Hours are not consistent unfortunately, but pay is good and you'll always be on your feet. Breaks are given in a fair and appropriate manner. Not many employees scheduled at one time, so many customers resort to self-checkout."
good,I enjoyed my time here with the company. I learned a lot. This is where I learned my management skills and appreciation management and HR for believing and trusting my knowledge
good,"very fast paced work environment. "
good,"There was always work to do, but was very enjoyable place to work. I would go into work clock in hit the truck line unload the truck run freight at a reasonable pace with help if needed. I learned how to properly backstock while there, management was alright but some of the managers were not on the same level as the employees when it came to communication. hardest part of working there was having to move some of the older carts that carried the freight. I enjoyed working alongside some great co-workers who taught me a lot about stuff i didn't know."
good,"The best part of working at Target was always working as a Team to finish jobs as even if you did an individual job you were told to accomplish that so the whole Target Team would effectively finish their tasks well!  Each day we had tasks even when there were no Guests coming in yet.  We would clean tops of coolers, around the registers, belts etc.  Put out stock at the registers and the One Spot area where one dollar to five dollar items were sold.  Management was excellent and treated us fairly.  The hardest part of working as a cashier there was getting Target Credit or Debit accounts all the time or as they wanted us to.  They wanted us to get at least 3 per day even when days were very slow.  If you didn't you were counselled and when they had incentives, they didn't always come through with them.  The incentives for getting accounts were not good.  The best one you could get was a gift card for merchandise from 5-10.00, but those were rarely given out because only a few managers were nice enough to give them.  The worst incentive items were target merchandising products with their logos on them that were just plain junk items most people would never use such as wrist bands for sports. I did appreciate a winter scarf, gloves and hat as well as a Target wind breaker!  Those were very nice. I missed getting cash for accounts at Macy's as this was what they rewarded you with when you got accounts.  Cash was great as you could use it for anything you wanted or needed.  Cash was a great incentive so you could earn extra money getting accounts. Cash is always better than any"
good,The reason why I enjoy still working at Target is because my manager is really positive and upbeat. The LODs and my manager make working there easy when I have to be there early in the morning.
good,Target is a fast-pace work environment where it requires you to be organized and learn how to prioritize to accomplish assigned tasks in the time allotted.
good,"Working on the phones can be very fast pace at times,  and other times it could be very slow. Career advancement is achievable and the benefits even working part time is very good."
good,I really enjoyed working at Target. The team was very kind and welcoming to me when I first started. I wish I would've never left and would love to return. There are many opportunities to take advantage of. Great Place.
good,I was helping out during the store remodel helping customers. I walked around the store looking for customers to help. With things constantly moving around I had plenty of people to help find things.
good,"It is definetly a good place to work, good pay, pretty good management. Only things to consider is 10 hour shifts (4 days a week) and most of the positions here are very fast paced."
good,"I would come to work early and make sure all stations were stocked, carts were available then would help customer services, and managing cashiers. I was on pace to move from Cart attendant to a managerial role but it did not workout due to my school schedule."
good,I work as seasonal associate at Target. And during this time its super busy with work and alot of customer service. You have to like both!!! Stocking and restocking the shelves. And helping assist customers with their requests.
good,"So far this has been my favorite place to work. The pay is well, there’s always work to do, every 40hrs worked is one hour of paid vacation, and the benefits that come along with the job should be used accordingly."
good,"Always room to grow at Target and the people there are great! Great schedule flexibility! Pretty laid back, we get to wear jeans during the weekend. We have cereal Sunday’s and a good discount plus the additional 5% saved with my red card."
good,"You would usually clock in. The right away get started cleaning up your assigned area. The store was always a mess because of how busy it was, so you had to work fast"
good,Great place to work with such friendly people. The pay is worth the retail world these days and you get to basically pick your hours. I would Go back here.
good,"It’s was cool very good company to work with , worked good with your hours good pay . Management was good .. breaks needed to be longer . The work wasn’t hard at all"
good,"Target employees from entry-level to management are energetic, friendly, enthusiastic, and willing to help. It's a welcoming place, with room for rapid advancement. lots of support and encouragement, the team work is like no other place I have worked."
good,"My time with target was very pleasant, co workers were all very friendly and helpful, management was great. We worked as a team and always had smiles on our faces."
good,"Great culture, everything is fast paced especially around the holiday time. The benefits are great and if you plan to move up, this isn't a bad company to do it in. Just have to be on top of management and show them you want to move up."
good,favorite was helping guest and learning new area's to work in the store. made a lot of long time friends that i worked with and the customer's that came in.
good,Target is a fun place to work. People for the most part are friendly and nice. Never gets to crazy so it was mostly just organizing the store and helping customers
good,Fast paced work environment with a production standard. Rotation to different job functions. Employee ideas taken into serious consideration and in most cases managers took employee ideas and implemented them into how things were done.
good,"I feel like customers feel more comfortable with you as their cashier if you start a simple conversation about their day, life or of what they bought. Its common to see an every day, week or monthly customer at your store and they are your community people around your work area and being able to start a friendly customer services to them will make them appreciate you at your job and the work you are doing."
good,"Excellent culture, friendly people, and great guest interaction and sales experience. I personally learned how to interact with all different kinds of people and how to help guests find what it is they were looking for!"
good,"Daily ""themes"" for associates like waffle day and they would provide waffles for the employees. Discounts on product in all Target locations. Associate recognition done by peers."
good,target is great with giving their employees to grow with in the company . they treat their employees nicely . they give out free fruits . the lunches were good
good,"Working at Target makes the time go by fast because of how fast paced all employees have to work to get certain tasks done. Depending on a truck load as well, if the truck is smaller than usual employees still need to work at a paced we need to finish certain tasks."
good,"Target Corp is a major big box retailer. Working for this company will develop you into a hard working individual with a sense for the greater vision. Target hires its employees above the minimum wage, and is willing to develop and invest in its team in order to produce the best of the best. "
good,Great place to work there are a lot of good people and management does there best to make it feel like they care. Hours fluctuate hard between seasons. Paid vacation is built up through average hours per week for part time. Clean work spaces and good equipment
good,"The employees are good natured and friendly, the tasks given are simple but sometimes made to seem difficult. Tasks can become tedious at times. Usually very hot in employee areas like the back rooms"
good,"I had great management.  The crew members were awesome.  Some days fast paced, but some days relaxed.  Great place to work.  Great benefits and paid time off."
good,some management issues but other than that great place to work with. they offer great training when you are starting and have an open door policy when help is needed
good,Good company to work for just didn't get enough hours due to being hired threw Agency. Was hired threw Select Staffing and wasn't offered many hours. Was trying to get hired threw Target but took to long.
good,"while i was doing college online, my manager at the time was understanding and was very flexible with my work hours. just trying to reach the limit..."
good,Target is a great place to work to get retail experience they will teach you to have standards think outside the box the listen to to your ideas mold you and make you a great team member
good,"Well organized ,very productive ,fun and the workplace also helps your future decisions.loved been an advocate for those in need.fun place to work and also hard to get noticed."
good,Target allows you to feel like you are part of a team more than just yourself. They also have competitive wages and advancement opportunities with training available to show your true potential.
good,"Target was a great place to work.  They provide awesome training, have great leadership and continuously work on developing their team member.  They position you for a great future with them or even another company."
good,"Target was a very good place to work in despite having certain flaws with certain communications, training and slight failures in computer system. There was great pay, a community feeling and set goals/tasks for everyone per day, week and month."
good,Target has spent the past several years beefing up their technology sector (TTS - Target Technology Services) and its definitely paid off. There are lots of fresh new talented engineers as well as many engineers who have been around for a while and can offer great advice and support. Target invests in the most modern and advanced toolchain and is frequently testing out new technologies and upgrading legacy systems. There is a very stable work/life balance and unless it's peak season and something goes awry not many people are grinding obscene hours to get their work done. Its a very relaxed fun enviroment with amenities like game rooms and pool tables scattered throughout all their offices to keep team members entertained and happy to come to work. Overall being a Target engineer is an absolute pleasure and privilege.
good,"The work schedule was very flexible, management and training were very sufficient, and I never felt like I didn't know what was going on or that I was overwhelmed."
good,"Target was a fantastic company to work for during my short time that I was with them. The management was very understanding of personal needs, and made sure all the employees were happy. There were many team events, and team meetings daily to make sure everyone knew what was going on and what was expected of them."
good,Target as a whole was a very good employer. Unfortunately I had taken a different job as I was promised more hours and competitive pay. Those promises had fallen through.
good,"I love my coworkers and superiors, some things that I don't like but overall is fun and productive working in target . I have learned so much during these 10+ working there"
good,Its a fast fun and friendly environmen. ive been working here for awhile now.. its a welcoming  place to all that want to work its a lot off work that needs to be done and starting pay is $12 for moist positions
good,"In my store, everyone was extremely nice as well as respectful. There isn't much career advancement in this store. You would have to transfer stores in order to become a team leader or even a senior team leader. It's very difficult to advance in one store even though there wasn't a lot of people at my store. The best thing is to not stay in target for too long. It's a good beginning job and since my store was express, the pay was better than a lot of the other target stores. We get paid a dollar 50 more and it isn't bad but on the way they treat us, I don't think we get paid enough for their attitude."
good,I truly enjoyed and valued my career with a company who valued and appreciated their employees. The pharmacy leaders allowed us to seek opportunities and to challenge the status quo.
good,"A typical day on the sales floor, for a closing shift, would begin with pulling merchandise from the back and pushing it (stocking) it on the sales floor. When this was finished, go-backs/re-shop would be sorted and put back onto the floor in proper places. After this I would begin my zone for the department I was assigned. Busy days would be tough, trying to back up cashiers and finish my own work at the same time. Once in awhile a problem customer would come through, but because of the good atmosphere it rarely set the mood for the day, let alone ruined it.For me, the job was all and all quite easy and relaxing in a way. Anyone looking for a retail job I would recommend Target to."
good,It was ok working at target. The workers there were all good not issues with that. I just didn’t like that I was stuck in one area for the shifts I was working. But it’s was great way to learn how to multitask and handle it at the same time.
good,Great job management was great and all the other people were awsome pay and hours were there. Good place to get your feet wet in the retail business..
good,"Target is a good company to work for, the environment is well balanced and everyone at my store was cool. the job comes with the same cons as any other retail job dealing with customers who don't care but other than rude people the job is great."
good,"I started my day by clocking in and heading out the break room door to ask my manager what register I had to work at. The management there was great, and always helped when needed, but the hardest part of the job was me having to deal with the customers that were rude for no reason, yes, I was professional, but nobody deserves to be treated with disrespect when none was given. My favorite part of this job was being able to connect really well with most of the employees and realize that they could be life long friends."
good,Its a nice company to work for u can move from departments and make more money.. U dont get overtime or benefits but its still an ok job. And they do get very very busy and it would help move things along if the had someone to help bag at busy times
good,Enjoyed working at Target.  I was #1 cashier of the month many times.  Cashiers I worked with were very friendly.  Enjoyed helping customers with their purchases.
good,Working here was stressful but it was because i was overnight and i was not use to it but working here is great pay and it can really help out in life.
good,"Target is indeed a great place to work. You get appreciated for the work being done and the work life balance is amazing."
good,i liked working for the company management was awesome they are by far some of the best managers I've work with very relaxed and understanding. co-workers are always nice and helpful when closing everyone works together to get everything done before we all leave.
good,Working at Target has allowed me to apply all the skills I have learned at previous jobs but also throughout my degree plan. I have been able to apply my own merchandising skills as well as using direction given by the company. The company is great and is very enjoyable to work at.
good,"Great culture, warm environment, and unlimited room for growth within the company. As soon as you start, on-boarding is a great experience with little headache. A family oriented business that pushes you to be the best you can be and providing you with access to the resources needed to advance yourself."
good,"I worked grocery, so I had my own corner in the store. Everything I did was entirely focused on my corner with re-stocking, cleaning, customer service, shipments, etc. I would typically come in, check my aisles as I walk to the back and start re-stocking shelves unless told otherwise. The day would go steady or busy depending on the amount of work left, towards the end of my shift I would double check aisles, clean, then backstock if needed. During this whole day, I would assist any guests with any questions or concerns, as well as provide any assistance to any other of my employees who need it throughout the store."
good,"Cortan las horas, hay preferencias, pero es buen lugar de trabajo!"
good,Great place to work. When hours get cut because of the slow time it sucks. But when its the busy time expect 40 hours-- and have to get sent home early cause you cant work overtime.
good,Good atmosphere to work in.  Friendly people.  The company is guest oriented. A typical day is fast paced.  Sometimes the hardest part of the job can be unloading of the merchandise depending on the size of the truck.
good,"Working at Target was an interesting summer job. My hours were from 4am-1230pm, which I would not recommend to anyone. However, I had great co-works who made the job fun and the management was easy to work with. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Target."
good,"Working at TARGET was an great experience for me. I enjoyed working with the target team members, communicating with the guests, and meeting new friends.  I would most likely recommend family and friends to become an team member at TARGET. I would love to go back to TARGET. I was working at the TARGET in Glen Mills Pa, Concordville and would LOVE to go back ."
good,"I worked the flow shift. I would unload the truck. Getting to work at 0330. After unload i would push merchandise and stock shelves. Once the store opened I would assist customers with finding what they needed. I worked in apparel, HBA, baby and domestics.  I helped in toys."
good,"Work out truck and zone store before it opens. Hard to do when you only limited hours each week. After cleaning up store, start unload truck and have them work pieces as it is being unloaded."
good,Upon getting there each day I was greeted with friendly faces which made me enjoy working.  Management was very helpful to work with me around my school schedule.  Overall great experience
good,"Target broadened their brand into Canada in 2013 and brought retail options into Canada."
good,A typical day at target involves a preset list of goals to complete by the end of your shift and what keeps it exciting and fast paced is the day to day interactions with coworkers and guests.
good,Working at Target was one of my best jobs. The only downfall to Target is the Management. It turned into a bunch of high school kids just talking about all the employees.
good,"My review would be that they want things to be completed before our shift ends. As I love being around my fellow team members, and I enjoy keeping busy."
good,"I liked most of the work and the management, however parts just weren't for me. Pay is good but I didn't think it was worth the headache. I can do physical work or stressful work but this job was a bit too much of both. They also have a pay cap after 3 yrs of work, so other than quarterly reviews, that may increase pay, I didn't see a whole lot of pull to keep me there long-term."
good,"Would work their again, working at as a TPS is one of the better jobs offered by Target. You are usually your own boss and have a great say in day to day events."
good,"The customers were really nice..."
good,Working there was a great experience. The employees were very helpful and on tasks. They showed us how to do many different things to keep our self busy even when their weren't costumers.
good,The work  environment  is amazing. The team work is great and so are the people. It’s fast pace but not so much that it becomes stressful. The job is absoulty great!
good,There’s was a lot a people during the holidays and it got really busy. If it cool down at the front then I got sent out to return merchandise to the shelf’s were the belong. I like that a lot better than being at a cashier. All my coworkers were cool and fun to talk to and we would have a little fun every once in a while when there was actually nothing to do but i liked how it was busy because I like working hard and staying busy. I could say is i am open to learn new things all the time and i will work hard even if it’s not the day for me.
good,"Working here in the meat department was a relatively easy job, but it was always made clear that it was appreciated when the job was done well or when you go ""above and beyond.""  Pretty relaxed environment, plenty of hours."
good,was a good job and wont mind working there again . good team work and great experience . every one work together to get the task done and every one got along
good,I really enjoyed being a cashier and greeting customers. I always had customers that were friendly. It was never a time we wasn’t busy working cashier.
good,A typical day consists of going into work and starting to unload the truck and then restock the entire store. Once the store was restocked and opened for the day employees would have to continue restocking items that were in the backroom before and did not sell.
good,"Nice loving place to work for they take care of their employees,you can win cool prizes and have nice team memeber parties. Also HR were very nice and respectable to everyone"
good,its just a very boring job that has very little challenge. its really just a cut and dry dull job.there isn't much challenge in working for target. i personally feel.
good,"i had a great time working at target, unfortunately they were unable to transfer me to a store closer to where i was moving.  There was a couple managers at Torrington Target that didn't deserve to be in the position that they were in. But i wasn't there for the management, i enjoyed working with the team."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of interacting with various customers in which they were all very friendly. I enjoyed most work days because my coworkers provided a fun environment. I learned how to stock, use scanning devices and improve my people skills."
good,This job allowed me to improve my customer service skills by helping to create a fast and friendly environment in efforts to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction.
good,i had a great time working there with there always being something to do always moving around good coworkers and good managers very great place to work at
good,Went above and beyond. Took a job that no one wanted and excelled at it until I was spoken to twice about working too hard.  Some of the upper management liked to sit in the office and so nothing.
good,I enjoyed my work experience and meeting fresh faces I would recommend this experience to anyone you really work as a team and earn great prizes throughout the season for just doing your. Great Management
good,"You would go to work, unload a truck, stock the shelves, and be on your way home. It seems simple but you learn so much about time management and how things work in retail. Everyone treated others fairly and with respect that there wasn't a dull moment there. I enjoyed my time at Target and hope others get the same."
good,Great job to have while in school or simply as a temporary employee. Team and family are true values of this corporation. Gain personal relationships!
good,Target is a Fast Fun and Friendly. My day begins with the STL having a huddle recognizing us with the hard we do driving sales an giving us the facts how to go above beyond. The manager help out and the workers get along with each other we like a family. The hardest part of the job is when we dont have the item in stock an the customer be mad but we always go above in behind an calling other stores to see if they have the product. The fun part is when we all work as a team in the building we like a family.
good,"Retail is not, I repeat is not easy, it will be for some and not for others. I worked in grocery. I left because I moved, it was a love and sometimes hate relationship. I hated it sometimes because it was so much to do and when your new at first it's overwhelming, but once I got the hang of everything I was on fire. I loved it after I learned and was able to multi-task my time and duties. It was always fast paced and I was always busy, I was always moving, I was always doing a job and I liked that. Thanks for all the experience Target!"
good,In produce there wasn't a team leader until after I left so I stressed myself out so badly (being the new person) that my manager let me go home early about 3 weeks into the job. I was on my feet most of the day but my coworkers were enjoyable and made the long hours bearable. After 3 months of lifting 40+ pounds on the daily my arms were toned and I was physically stronger for it.
good,I learned how to engage people and how to sell to get commission and also satisfy the customer with his/her needs. management was great and helped me train even if I had trouble with some of it.
good,The work is very easy and the staff makes sure that you are doing everything safe and that you are at your best. I would recommend this to any of my friends any day.
good,"Essentially, if you don't have bills to pay, this is a great place to work. I'm friends with everyone, if I'm not friends with a co-worker, it's because I don't know them. My managers have always been great, and the atmosphere is definitely great. "
good,Fitting room we're very chill. Most of the team members were young adults and college students. So co workers were easy to get along with. Lots of supporting each other and simple things such as asking how my day was every day
good,"It’s a great place to work at, its fast paced, and fun place to be with employees. I would definitely recommend anyone from any age or race to work here."
good,"Good pay. The company seems to really care about your well being. Long days but you get plenty of time off to recover. My biggest issue is the management, at least in my department, does not seem to know what they're doing."
good,Target is the company were you can learn more and you can take part in various activities and it is a place of entertainment fun and work culture is very good.
good,they are strict with the team but fair at the same time and they expect a lot to get done on a daily basis but its realistic and achievable. I would recommend this place to anyone.
good,Target was heading in the right direction until they tried to develop their own pharmacy software.  Their focus on patient care and guest experience was supported by how they financially staffed their pharmacies.  The pharmacy supervisors actually listened to the needs of the pharmacists in order to be more available to serve their guests healthcare needs better than CVS and Walgreens.
good,"Target does not offer many full time positions, and will work you 7 days just to give you 30 hours. So those that are looking for temporary jobs, or just a few hours a week, Target is right for you. Other than hours, the pay is great, work environment is fun and friendly. Guests are super nice and the discounts aren't half bad. Free PB & J! Any holiday or inventory event, Target provides free food, if you work at a Super Target you are always getting leftovers in the break room."
good,"I had a great experience working for target. While working at target i held various positions from cashier, sales associate and stockroom associate. Ive experienced a great retail experience working at target and would love the opportunity to work here again"
good,"Target was a good experience.  The only issue was training and some if not much of the scanning hardware was not working properly. "
good,Easy requirements and needed no retail experience. Relaxed environment and chill co workers. Online order batches were easy to handle most nights except for beginning of December.
good,"A typical day at work would change between doing go-backs, straightening the isles, taking things out of the isles and putting them into go-back carts, setting up seasonal sections, and I helped back-up cashiering as well.  I learned how to be more organized and jump from task to task.  The management team was very friendly and helpful.  The hardest part of the job was trying to meet time quotas like doing certain tasks in a 30 minute span.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with others and switching tasks."
good,"Although the early morning hours were exhausting the pay was well and the company treated you decently. They paid you more on holidays, fed you really good food every now and then."
good,"Typical work day was 10-12 hours depending on the shift and season."
good,"I worked in inbound and outbound i had to load almost 8 to 12 trucks by myself in out bound inbound i had to unload truck sometimes it maye be 2,000 units"
good,"Target is a place you can get a little bit of everything work ,fun and culture. Management is very good at making sure you have everything you need to do your job ,the company is very family oriented, over all I loved working for Target."
good,I do security and in a stressful part of town.  Which makes it stressful and because of the things we put up with at that store I feel we don't get paid enough for all the times we have gotten hit while trying to detain someone.  I have an awesome manager.
good,"If you can handle fast pace, this job would be for you. This is also a physical labor job. Do not think you can depend on a fork lift. Hardest part of the job, is that most of the management is straight out of college and have never worked a physically demanding job before in their life. IF, Target would send all of the management candidates through a training course of doing the job functions of the warehouse associates before putting them in position, it would allow them to understand associates AND associates would respect them more."
good,Work can be simple and easy on slow days but very stressful and busy on holidays or weekends. Very friendly and helpful team members. You are really taken in as a member of the company.
good,The team was great when I got  Extremely ill the staff was super helpful. I relocated twice and was able to  transfer. Which made things easy. It was easy to get guest to sign up for red cards Most shifts.
good,It was a good company to work for it had very good benefits I would recommend people to work for this company because they have great reputation and there's is room for advancement.
good,Working at Target was fast paced place to be at from what i remember is that we had to do the whole truck  in a hour or less. So that we could the product out from the back onto the sales floor before the store opened up at 8 am. So that for me and my co-worker who was helping me throw the truck had to do that and also go out onto the floor and help the rest of the crew put up the product while also clearing out the back for pallets.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Target for the most part. The work was fast pace, coworkers were great. Management is alright and are fair.  The hardest part of the job would be the heavy lifting"
good,as long as you go there to do your job everything is fine. you have to ignore people rude attitudes . the co workers are very nice and the environment isn't all that bad .
good,"Target has a very specific work culture that is very close knit and feels a lot like family. They give you plenty of incentives and motivation to complete daily and weekly tasks, as well as leaving lines of open communication between team leaders and employees for team growth. The most difficult part of this job is always being asked to stay late to complete tasks that other members didnt finish, the work to life balance is poor."
good,"One of the original employee to open this store in 2002.  Career expanded from backroom stock employee HE Team Leader.  My greatest joy was working in HE as a Traing and Development Coordinator.  I enjoyed standing in front of new employees during orientation, explaining to the life lessons in Retail"
good,Great people and team overall the job itself is AMAZING.. But when things get rough they want to wash their hands of it all. They dont care what happens to you personally and they can make feel low as a person.
good,The company is a fast going company that allows you to get great experience working with different individuals. The people you work want to see you succeed and will push you to do your best.
good,"During my empolyment at target, I have ad a very positive experience. They were reasonable with my hours and as a student, this is very helpful. They were accommodating and my pay was reasonable starting out."
good,The coworkers really worked together as a team at target. Everyone helped each other out and the management did an excellent job at running things. They took complaints and concerns from the staff very seriously. They worked very hard to teach each employee about what needed to be done and were very patient. The hardest part of the job was making sure each customer was satisfied.
good,"Day to day responsibilities included providing a fast, fun, and friendly check out experience to every guest.  Learned a great deal about the challenges of the customer service industry, and learned the importance of organization and communication.  There were different levels of management and supervision; each having their own levels of communication with every team member.  The workplace culture was a lower rating for me personally, since there wasn't a clear opportunity to interact and create relationships with your coworkers.  Being a cashier,  I felt like I was working more as an individual and less as a member of a team.  The hardest part of the job was the lack in cross training. Cashiers are not trained to have knowledge of the whole store, which made it difficult to fully provide high levels of customer service myself.  Had to rely on supervisors to answer 75% of guests' questions, which slowed down my check out service.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the high levels of customer interaction."
good,The typical workday would be coming in checking your areas to see what needed to done first and what was more important. I have learned to balance schedule and set assigned areas and breaks and lunches for the whole store. Management was O.K some were the normal managers others tried to rule the store. The overall workplace culture was awesome. The other team members were great and had hardly any conflicts between each other. The hardest part of the job was having days off only because when you would be off for a day or two and coming back to your areas messed up completely. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work as a team and getting everything done at the end of the day without any problems.
good,"As a supervisor my work day was hectic but fun."
good,"Target management understands that you have a life outside of Target. As long as you stay on top of your schedule, they help to make sure that you get the days off that you need. HR also helps you to get more hours if you talk to them about it."
good,Being able to work in retail was fun and taught me a lot. Seeing the security and how everything is set up to stocking and the break down of equipment. Even dealing with customers helps you see the other side and what they have to deal with and why some are the way they are.
good,"It was a great company to work for, fun, the benefits where great, great management and coworkers they just dont pay enough. Other than that I really enjoyed it."
good,Healthy workplace with an active amount of work. Managers and other personnel were always kind and understanding. Overall good experience and great entry level position.
good,"Great company to work for, yet stressful at times specially the store i was in. The recovery was never at its best. But fun and friendly people do work there."
good,"Very simple job, was in charge of the cashier and pack items into bags. Work place provide many opportunities for consumer services. Had to be friendly and welcoming to the consumers."
good,I loved working with Target for their friendliness and the management team was always supportive when we would have difficulties with customers. even when some customers were having a bad day I managed to have an understanding of why and sometimes the customer would leave happy that I just got them out of the store quick by moving fast on our busiest days.
good,A typical day working at target Is generally a morning shift that is relaxing and sometimes hard working. Very family orientated. What I have learned working for target checking out large orders and getting guest to apply for a target credit card. The work culture is well rounded.
good,Very good as a starter job. There is room to advance as I did very quickly but while I was working being young as much as I wanted to advance I was not allowed to and it was disappointing.
good,"A regular day working at Target is great. Morning shifts were nice, cup of coffee to start the day, grab equipment and schedule, head to grab the unsorted cart, take the cart to my area and sort. Taking calls is great, and speaking to new customers to help out. You feel the responsibility and feel the importance of your position. It was overall a good experience."
good,"Typical day - Set plan-o-grams, coordinate with vendors on product location, revise sales areas, assist customer either by phone or on the sales floor and cover products that fit their needs, training of new employees"
good,"Nice cowokers , manager's are strict but considerate. Job security as well as manageable hours . Need to communicate with employees more . Great hours"
good,"A typical day at work involved me bagging groceries, restocking items onto the floor, and greeting and conversing with the customers. I learned how to multitask and work at a fast pace. I worked the express line and self-checkout a lot. The workplace culture was a range of high school to older adults. The hardest part of my job was selling Target red cards. The most enjoyable part of my job was conversing with the customers and helping them out in any way I could to make there shopping experience great."
good,Target has pride in taking care of its team members. I never felt overly stressed. There is so much room to grow and be promoted. The company promotes activities for its team members which provides a positive environment and great work relationships.
good,"This is a great place to learn customer service skills, typical work day is help all guests make sure they get all their requests and questions answered."
good,"people were fun and interactive, the management was understanding and reliable. The organization was always together and the customers were really nice to help."
good,"It was just above all the previous companies experience while still working with them. The culture is superb; you can feel that you are now gaining an international level experience and that does makes difference. The approach and way of handling things is simply awesome. "
good,"My time at Target was great; I made many new friends and the environment was fun and welcoming. We were paid well and had supportive team leads. My only complaint was when we got a new store manager recently, all the fun was gone. It was much more strict, almost militant. I suppose if I was not used to the previous store manager, it may not have seemed so bad. However, given that I knew how fun my job could be and to see that slowly taken away was sad to say the least."
good,"Fast, fun & friendly atmosphere. "
good,It is very independent as there is only one backroom team member in the afternoon and 2 to 3 in the morning. Its a great job that offers a lot of responsibility but allows the freedom to make the backroom your own.
good,I worked at the Target in Norfolk NE and I loved it. I loved how out manager was out on the floor with us helping and always being sweet. We would do some motivational activities to build each other up.
good,Overnight stocking crew. Full benefits after six months. Good crew to work with. Stocked shelves and organized things throughout the store. Got locked in the store for the night shift.
good,I love the team that I worked with. They all are very hard workers. The team leads are great as well. I learned a lot about the store and its policies.
good,Had lots of great coworkers who were willing to help and were also very friendly. Managers were also very pleasant to be around and were very enthusiastic to make the target experience better.
good,Great experience working in both field and coporate locations! Strong focus on leadership and personal development while driving organizational imperatives. Great place to work!
good,"Target is a good starter job as it does not pay exceptionally well. Depending on your department you may work overnight, early morning, day time or nights and weekends."
good,"I start my day off in the backroom with the audit, then pulling auto fills, once that is complete and Flow team of off the truck, I start back stocking. that's a typical day at target for a Logistic backroom team member. My Team Lead is a great person to work for and with. Target is a Diversify Company so its a great place to work, the hardest part about my job is when the hours are cut and the most enjoyable is the Guest."
good,"The company is great to work for and offers great benefits, but some locations struggle with hiring productive workers and the management seems to be sub-par."
good,"This was my second job during high school. The environment was good with great people to work with. Unfortunately, like many jobs, the moral of the workplace difffered upon the various leadership that took managment."
good,"Plain and simple, job was hard work for honest pay. You were expected to work as hard as your fellow coworkers and you were praised for it. There was very little to cry about."
good,"I think the hardest part of the job is the people that come up there with a lot of coupons, and they expect all of them to work. I also think the accusatory tone is the hardest also."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, it was a very good work place and environment. There was great benefits and great management. Very flexible with Hours."
good,Safety is number one rules above anything other than that the people are always open to help you even they're busy doing something else and family always comes first. When ever you need a emergency target always and always help you.
good,The best experience I've had working at the target Warehouse great people flexible schedules everyone was nice and friendly to each other just a great place to work and get the warehouse experience
good,"This is a place i would love to recommend to the youth. Being fast, fun, and also friendly to the community, This job can help you throughout careers with anything."
good,Cashier greet and welcome guest with a smile and have conversations with them while processing their purchases Keep working area clean and stocked while on register. Food court area was fun. You get a chance to learn to make all the different types of food and now they have all kinds of coffee. You will also  have a chance to work on the sales floor and socialize with customers and their is the stockroom which you will also interact with customers as you bring out merchandise
good,"End of the day, it's retail but good management makes this a nice place to work.  The STL and ETLs at my location always tried to schedule your hours around when you're available.  Because of that, I was able to continue working at Target when I returned to school.  They also provided free meals around the Christmas holiday!"
good,A good place to work if you work well with others. Like the fact that I have threes days off a week and still work forty hours a week. There are time you can get off early if you choose too.
good,"I learned a lot about different machines and how certain positions work. I was not able to be fluent in everything working backroom but I did get a different perspective on how labor intensive my job was as well as my other co-workers. A typical day of work was reporting to the backroom to start searching for items customers had ordered, stocking shelves and counting the inventory, assisting customers, using machines to load products as well. That would probably have to be the hardest part just because it does take a lot out of since it is a lot of physical labor but the most enjoyable part was at least being surrounded by co-workers who could relate and an atmosphere that was nice."
good,Very fun and competitive but relaxed atmosphere.. Target is an all around great place to work. When I started back in 2014 I did not really enjoy working at Target. But within a few months of working my view of them changed tremendously. Everybody is really friendly and makes you feel apart of one big family!
good,"Target was my very first job when I was 16. It was a very fast paced job and always had me on my toes , I was there for 6 months before I moved on. they want you to remember a lot  ."
good,Flow team crew was  the best group of people I ever worked with. management was great. very fast paced enviroment I really liked working for target. good hours store manager was awesone
good,Target is a good place to work especially for high school students.  The store is constantly busy which always keeps you on your toes.  Target is a nice job to introduce teens into customer service.
good,Overall I think target is a great place to work and has the potential to turn into more than just a part time job. I also think the vibe in most stores is very inviting and friendly.
good,"It's a really good starting job. You can move up easily within your work area you just have to work hard for it obviously. As a security guard you check receipts and stand on post, welcoming the guests to the store and assisting apprehension."
good,"as long as you do your job they wont stand over your back. FUn place to work for the younger generation. pay is not that bad. of course, some rude cutomers."
good,Target was a great place of employment for me. Employment came with great benefits and pay. Best job I've ever had and it was very manageable. Great work environment.
good,What didn't I learn in my 8+ years working for Target.  I grew so much as a team leader and eventual key carrying team leader. I developed some tight friendships that I still have 14 years later.
good,"This was one of my favorite experiences being employed. I was so excited to hear when Target was opening up in Winnipeg and across Canada and instantly.. I applied for multiple positions. I got the call, had the interview and I got the job. It was the most friendly interview process i have ever experienced. Also a notable mention that we had a paid orientation and a very detailed training that truly made me feel confident on my own around the store. I worked lots of cashier, customer service, sales floor and a lot of stocking and re-shop. My schedule was part time however shortly after being with Target they noticed my good work ethic and would deliberately call me because I was very reliable and committed to working at Target.. So it was a big plus for me, I got like 20 hours added to each week I was pretty well 20 hours off full time. It was very unfortunate that Target failed as a business/contract and had to close down, they had to let me go due to foreclosure however I will forever be happy with this experience!"
good,"Target is very good at making sure you as a person are satisfied with your job. unlike other facilities/companies, Target cares for your own well-being, maybe even more than you do. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor but this will fade as you earn more time on the job. The management varies on each facility. some are good and some are bad."
good,I liked working with the Target company overall. The employees were very nice and there was no discrimination of any race everyone was treated equally. If you did encounter a problem the human resources at Target was very good with helping you with any issue. The only reason why I had to leave target was because I wasn't getting enough hours otherwise I would still be working with them.
good,"The Home Depot is a very warm welcoming place to work at you get treated like a family, everybody is just so friendly it's a great place to work and everybody knows each other personally"
good,"This is a good job to have when you need one during the summer. On the other hand, it was more difficult during the semester. Target is all about providing good customer service while also taking care of its employees."
good,Clock in and start by checking if there is any reservations on our target tech computers. Make sure all my log ins are working properly. Check inventory on phones is accurate. Start looking for sale opportunities with the target guest. Help guest find items with friendly customer service. I have learned to identifying possible fraud sings. Hardest part of the job but a the same time more rewarding is the phone sales. It can be challenging but it feels great when I can help guest save some money and at the same time help my self with a great sale.
good,It seems like you're just thrown into the workplace for Target but over time if you're willing to learn it gets easier. If you have the right ETLs and team leaders it makes the job much easier. From what I hear Logistics is the highest paying department here.
good,"I basically love the fact that my knowledge and experience fully helped me go beyond to satisfy the customers as well employees of anything they need help with."
good,a typical work day at target Gateway was pretty hectic. the managers try their best to make it where the employees aren't taken advantage of but still maintain it as a business environment
good,"This workplace was the most balanced place to work. There were customers and coworkers of all walks of life and of all ages. There were times when it would be difficult, but multitasking is a must have quality to really enjoy those down times. To match the down moments us coworkers would laugh and joke while performing our duties, in between customers. "
good,The culture as a whole company is very good. Lot of learning. A lot of emphasis is given to your career development. Feedback is taken seriously and is a 2 way thing. Nurtures you for leadership.
good,Working at Target makes you feel like you belong to a family. Great cooperation between management and associates. Everyone just feels like in the right place doing the right job
good,working at Target was great. i was on the sales floor. we had  to maintain a great floor while restocking shelves and also reshops. helping customers find what they need. the hardest part of my job was time management.
good,I enjoy working in the close-knit team environment between employees and managers. Daily activities are relatively simple and can work from one project to another with ease. I learned great customer service qualities and different ways to handle certain situations.
good,"Managers are friendly and courteous "
good,"not enough hours"
good,"My time as a Cart Attendant at Target was very fun. I got to see every inch of the store. The duties expected of me where simple, yet not too ""slow"". I got to work both outside and inside. I was able to set the amount of physical labor I could do, so I had no worries of a job every being too ""intense""."
good,I worked in the back room and on the main floor when something needed to be restocked I would do that and I kept the back room organized so when they radioed me to for something it wouldn't be hard to find kept it clean
good,"I only worked at the Target DC in Midway for three months. I was a seasonal making four dollars than the ""team members."" I also got laid off on January 14th, 2017 because the work load was slowing. Considering these two MAJOR factors, I can't hold a grudge because this place is definitely the best place I have ever worked. And I've held six jobs in total. "
good,Target was pretty steedy. It will keep u busy.  It was my first job ever and I meet a hand full of nice and caring people. The manager was flexible with my schedule and everything.
good,Target has been a great place to work. They care about developing you as a person and a team member. The atmosphere in the work place is truly synergetic and supportive. I enjoy working for this company.
good,"I loved the excellent people to worked with, I would do data entry, and ajust time clocks. If the HR-TL needed anything I would do it for them.  Sometimes they would send me on the sales floor which would be entertaining, and I would do cashier work as well. the only downside was I didn't receive enough hours."
good,I am very satisfied with the work environment. Target is a great place to work and it is very good with working with your needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with guests and meeting their needs.
good,Target was a great job to have as a college student!   They were always understanding and willing to work around school which is very important to me!
good,Great place to work with associates an managers all looking to help if you need it. At the time health issues started to become an issue during my time there and it made it difficult to show up sometimes.
good,target is the most organized retail job to work for. management is really good and you would really like working for target
good,I wanted to work for Target because they are kind of like Walmart's underdog. They are a great fun company to work for and I would recommend this job to all college students.
good,"When I worked here, it was the greatest job ever. Management was great and focused on the team and sales. Management build a safe and happy culture. When the company started restructuring the lost the value of morale and team."
good,"Target Corporation is one of the biggest retail chain in the US market. It has got its own culture, which team members like the most. It's the kind of organisation in which every individual look to start their career with."
good,"Working alongside the upper management they make you feel welcome to come to them with any problem you have, there open door communication is amazing. They have great advancement opportunities."
good,Work is highly motivated and the perks to working here are also driven fairly with a nice incentive to go along with it. High standards and for the most part friendly staff.
good,"Overall, my work experience at Target was positive. I clocked in everyday and went directly to my assigned lane, and began checking out our guest offering them the best customer service and positive attitude possible. I learned how to become better at communicating with others, solving problems, working in a fast-paced environment(ie: Christmas Eve, Black Friday etc.). Managers were friendly and worked with us to make sure we were providing the best service. Co-workers were extremely friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was selling the store RedCard to customers, the most enjoyable part was getting to interact with different types of people and offering them amazing customer service."
good,"Target Distributing is a very fast-paced work environment. Depending on which department you're working in, it can be very strenuous on the body. However, Target knows this, so the compensation is substantial, and the benefits are pretty good. The shifts are long but the weekends are longer and you still get 40 hours a week in. The overtime is guaranteed in the fall."
good,Working at Target taught me how to interact with customers the professional way . I worked target for a seasonal holiday.
good,"Target holds true to its word as being a great place to work as a team. I've learned to work very well with others but even more so with more challenging co workers. I've learned how to assist in almost every part of the store and able to answer questions if asked over the phone for a guest. "
good,"A typical day at Target consist of morning warm up, getting update information form prior shift and getting work assignments. I have learned the every aspect of the processing of freight inbound, warehousing and outbound."
good,"people there were fun and outgoing, learned a lot of things while there"
good,Great company to work for as well as benefits. They really work with you if you have a tight schedule too. Everyone is so friendly and you look forward to going the work the next day to work and see your usual customers as well.
good,"Working at Target was fun and friendly. The start of the day always is welcoming and exciting. Fellow employees are hard working, and helpful, and always have your back."
good,"Management Direction was lacking, and the Job culture was not up to par with the other places I have worked at. There were never any team meetings or individual feedback for performance. They kept saying that when its gets busy then sales and performance metrics will be instituted."
good,"A typical day at work will include work center management, performance management for part time staff, and full time management staff. I've learned how to operate a very complex work center that focuses on driving results. Management staff is very talented and understand collaboration to meet goals. The hardest part of the job is the work-life balance when employed as salary. The needs of the business sometimes will affect your off-time. The most enjoyable part of the job is developing other leaders and promoting those that have worked so hard to get there."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of maintaining my departments requirements- cleaning, stocking, customer service, etc. I learned how to slow down and take my time with my work. The management was good, but really felt fake. My co-workers were awesome and really fun people. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for 9 hours a day. The most enjoyable part was the friendly guests."
good,"Wonderful place to work. There are many different areas within the store itself that you can be trained in, such as the front end, food area, sales floor, backroom, and more. There are some opportunities to advance in leadership that come up every so often. One of the hard things about the job is getting people to sign up for Target's Redcard. You can ask every single person you ring out at the register for a week and still not get one person to sign up. It is a hard task to accomplish when no one wants another credit/debit card. yet there are those who can get at least 2 or 3 a day. The most enjoyable part is your coworkers and the guests. We all work together like a family, and care about each other the same way. And a lot of the guests are friendly, and its fun to see the kids smile, laugh, and help out their parents."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking after hours, and the music playing. My co-workers were fun to work with and did their job well."
good,"I worked as a Barista at Starbucks inside Target. "
good,"This is an amazing job to get into if it's your first time applying for retail. Especially the Hooksett location. Friendly, fast, and an extremely clean and organized backroom and floor."
good,"If you work hard and are open to feedback, lots of opportunity for advancement.  Achieving work life balance is the most difficult part."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was the team members. Everyone was always so friendly and willing to lend you a hand. Even the managers were team players and would always help out.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paces and strenuous. It involves a lot of team work to reach our daily goals. You are given the opportunity to learn and work different jobs. Management is flexible and works to accommodate you and those around you. You learn here that most jobs cannot be done alone. To make a large retail store look great before opening hours, it takes a group to work together while simultaneously doing your part alone to reach high expectations and goals. The most difficult part of the job is keeping up with the heavy and fast work pace the job constantly requires. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers you meet and the music played over the speakers."
good,"Though I'm aware my experience while working at Target is different than many, I found the community in the store I was working at to be much like a family. Dysfunctional in ways and yet we all would look out for one another. A typical day of work as a soft lines employee would include running around and trying to maintain the store while trying to help whatever customers you could in whatever way you could. I learned that regardless of how well you think you know your job, something new will come up. In my time working at this establishment, I did have a customer that used the fitting room as a place to smoke marijuana. Something that I would have never expected to be something I would say. Even in this type of situation, the management was great and always caring in my experience. My co-workers were easy to get along with and quite interesting to spend time around. I wish I wouldn't have had to leave because of health issues. The hardest part of the job was definitely catching up and staying caught up in your responsibilities but the best part of the job were the people that I worked with."
good,"I only gave job work/life balance a bad score because I worked he grave yard shift, but if you can handle it I believe its the best! The temperatures are never low enough for anyone else so we make the most snow. It was awesome to learn how to use snowmobiles, and I was positioned as a snowmaker Technician because I was taught how to fix almost anything out there!"
good,"Very busy and productive place, I have learn great communication skill. I have seen managers as well as co- worker come and go through out my 19 years, have always had a great relationship with both. The hardest part of the job would be maintaining the up keep of the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is at the end of the day knowing that I have made some many people fell important by delivering great customer service."
good,"I was hired before the store had opened. Before it opened I worked on setting up the store, (ie shelves, products, images ) "
good,"Its a fun place to work when you are 16. I worked there for a while and i did get kind of sick of working there. I did because I was going to school and had another job that i really loved to work at. But the job is really easy, and if i ever needed to go back because I could not find anything else I would."
good,It was a great job to have or the season the pay wasn't that great but it was a fun work place and everyone was a team to get the job done.
good,Working at Target is a wonderful experience everyone is like family and it's easy going. We had certain week that we had contest between the employee's. Also enjoyed the company cookout my last year there had a ball.
good,I like working nights but the long hours till the next morning did a toll on me. The management could of been a little better with communication and time effort. Some honest co-workers at most part from what I seen others wouldn't care to help. The fun thing about working overnight for target the store was close at a certain time and you can work comfortable.
good,"Target is a Fast, fun, and friendly place to work. I have learned to develop and manage a hard working team. We work together as a team to unload trucks in a timely manner in order to stay within our allotted payroll.I collaborate with other leaders to develop plans to promote sales. I have learned so much from this company and have really enjoyed working here."
good,"I have had the opportunity to work for this company in multiple locations. All of the locations were professional, respectful, and full of dedicated team members who provide excellent customer service. It is a privilege to work beside them."
good,".Always busy."
good,"Typical day I punch in and immediately grab re-shop from the front desk, push the items back to there locations on the floor. Then i go and grab stock from the back room and push that to the floor as well so that our guests in the store will have everything stocked and able to purchase items that they want. Management is sparse at nights as usually there is only one or two there. whereas during the day there are five or more managers on duty. The hardest part is getting re-shop done because, guest service is the number one priority, second is making sure the store looks neat and clean and zoning your area. Then if there is enough time we take care of the re-shop. The most enjoyable part is the people i work with, its like were all friends when were working together and were working towards a common goal."
good,A great place to work. Target has taught me a lot over the years. They co-workers are the best to work with. We are all about team work and being a team player. Specially love how we get together for any volunteer work for the community and for each other.
good,"Great place to work with awesome co-workers. Help create great guest service everyday, and have support from other co-workers to help you succeed."
good,"I have loved working for Target. I have worked there for 13 years. I have loved all of the advancement opportunities. My co-workers are smart and friendly, and my team is the best."
good,"Target is a place that is very welcoming and does what it can to make its employees feel safe and accepted. Training is done by team members and reviewed by Team Leads. The Leads also oversee the day to day operations of specific areas and make sure team members are able to complete their tasks. The stores are ran by executives who each are in charge of a section of the store or an important operation such as Human Resources. Most days are spent making sure the store is a great place to shop for our guests by filling our shelves, moving sale items to easily accessible places, and cleaning the store. Team work is very important to finish the days tasks and emphasized everyday. Coworkers and management are friendly and helpful. All in all Target is a nice place to work that offers a great atmosphere, promotional opportunities, and a team culture that is open and challenging."
good,Target was a great experience! It was my first job so I learned quite a lot from this experience. It's still very unfortunate that the company has closed. It was a great place to work while it lasted!
good,Everyone would bowl packages out and work together to get everything done on time. We would all listen to our own music and talk and it helped get things done faster.
good,"A typical day for me being a seasonal cashier... I would come in before my allotted time to start work, I would say good morning or good afternoon to any of the managers that I would see on my way to clock-in. I would make my way back to the manager on duty to find out which register I am to start my shift on.  Once I get to my register I would clean the conveyor belt, and make sure that the register has money and is ready to go for the first customer. With every customer I would always greet them with a friendly smile and give them 100% customer service so that their last parting thought of their trip to target was ""wow what a great experience that was"". When my shift is coming to an end I sign out of my register and let my manager on duty know that my shift is over and head to go clock-out."
good,"As an ETL, I had the pleasure of working for amazing store and district leaders. Work days were typically 8-10 hours. Busy weekends and holidays you could easily be there 12 hours depending on the work load. Target focuses on leadership development and gives their store leaders opportunities to grow within the company. I love working for the company, the only downfall is the ""retail schedule""(weekends, nights, holidays) My family has grown over the past 6 years and its difficult for me personally, missing out on those special events because of work. Perfect for college grads and experienced retail leaders alike"
good,"I would clock in, go to t he back grab pulls/ reshop and put items back on the floor. I would help customers when they needed help. If they needed help up at the front for cashiers I would go up there and help out. I go on my breaks and lunch. Go back and work again."
good,"I really do not have a problem with the typical day at this pharmacy, in fact, for me working in a fast pace environment was part of every job. The management was great. The pharmacists that I worked with was really lenient to the pharmacy technicians, even with the pharmacy technician students like myself. The only problem that I have during my six weeks of working there is that some of the pharmacy technicians sometimes cannot manage the pressure. Also, I would like to let you all know that there was a float pharmacist with the initials of N.D. that I would consider the most unprofessional pharmacist that I worked with throughout my days working in the pharmacy. I work with her for two consecutive days(luckily for just two days, I don't know what's going to happen if I work with her longer). And from day, I can tell that this is a type of a person I cannot work with. She disrespect me on the job. She called me by whistling like calling a dog. Also from day one, she treated us students unfair, compared with the pharmacy technicians(she works with them before). She treated us strictly and makes us feel uncomfortable to work. Ever since I work on the pharmacy, I have not made a simple mistake, but when I work with her, as far as I remember I made five simple mistakes in just a day. That's really how bad she was with us. For me, as the pharmacist, she should act professionally with her team, especially she was the leader. She should be someone who can we look up to, since we are just starting with this career. Overall, I had a great time working at the pharmacy,even I worked there"
good,"I loved working for Target. I thought that my peers and leaders were excellent, the pay was great and the schedule (given that it is retail) was fair and the best in retail."
good,in 2013 I joined Target Corporation in a Leadership Training Program they offered for students at Saint Cloud State University in Minnesota. The training was helpful for all the students joined the program. I learned much more than I was expected and gained many skills that would help me in my future job.
good,"Balanced the cash drawer and handled multiple forms of payment at the cash register.  Offered friendly assistance to customers in need of service.  I learned how to work computer software while using the register.  My co-workers were always supportive and reliable if I needed advice, and I was considered a team player.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was getting to interact with customers during the holiday season."
good,"- A typical work day is fast pace due to the high volume of sales my specific store would have on a daily basis."
good,"i have excellent work experience in target.d management is so cooparatieve. team members are so supportive nd friendly. everyday i meet new challlanges in work  .and i try to willing  to complete those task. i have learnt  dicepline punchality team player guest service etc.etc, so its been good journey of carrer being as a employe of target."
good,"When I first started working for Target, I started as an seasonal employee. Because of my work ethic, within one month not only was I asked to stay, BUT, I was also promoted to a BRAND Team Member, which is that of Equivalent to Department Manager in Walmart. It was then I knew this was a good company to work for. Every day there is something to do here. If it isnt helping out with guests, jumping on the register, or handling your ""tasks"" . Target always keeps you on your feet. There are a few mis fortunes , as you deal with strong personalities and something management can be a bit of a hard time to deal with, but that is retail business. Still I recommend this job for everyone"
good,great co-workers and management who is eage to make a difference in in the retail industry. Recommend anyone who is up for a challenge and passionate about making a change
good,As a cashier the most important thing is to sell RED Cards it is easy if you know how to persuade the guest. It was a lot of fun I enjoy meeting new people and of course meeting the regulars is also a blast. During liquidation it was a lot of work and this is where you need the team in order to get the job done. At the end of day everyone got the job done and laughed at the end
good,"A typical day is fast paced, filling orders for the guest, Stocking product into assigned location, Researching discrepancies in the orders as needed. "
good,"Working at Target, I learned a lot about discipline, integrity and professionalism. A typical work day would consist of following the  schedule and meeting all levels of service to the best of our ability. Management was involved in our feedback, ideas, etc. Management supported our team in every way. My co workers and I were like family. We had our ups and downs, but we still worked together. The most difficult part of my job was trying to stay in level of service when we would have days of status's, meetings, career panels, etc...The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to follow my schedule without interruptions and complete all necessary work within the day."
good,"Working in the electronics department at Target was fun and rewarding.  Meeting new guests and helping them find what they need made every day at work a unique and enjoyable experience.  The coworkers and management are awesome people who all work together with a common purpose to provide a great experience.  It is a retail environment, so some of the assigned tasks get tedious and repetitive, but overall it is a great place to earn some extra pocket money."
good,"The days start at different times throughout the day. My availability is open 8 AM to 11PM so I pick up a vast amount of different hours weather it's a morning shift or nighttime shift. I could get scheduled to open or close. "
good,Target had great customers and awesome staff from management to employees. Target was the best job that I had ever worked at. The most enjoyable part working for target was the atmosphere and how everyone there had such great energy.
good,"Working at target is a fast friendly fun environment to work in. I learned how to pace my self when needed. There were times i had to be in several places at once while running the front end. My managers were there to help when they could, but for the must part me and my peers helped each other out. The most difficult part of the job when was i could not get a return done for a guest because it was out of my control. But i would always go above beyond for the guest needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public and getting to meet new people and a daily basis. And always being able to help them in any type of situation."
good,A typical day at work I would take problem calls. Solve and fix the issues I found. Complete required paperwork. Communicate with supervisors and coworkers.
good,"worked rain checks."
good,relaxing day at work. Very comfortable work environment. Fun co workers that do their part of the work. The hardest part of the job was the distance.
good,I loved going to work for the Target in Montana.  We worked hard but also had a lot of fun doing it.  I respected the leadership and made some good friends along the way!
good,"Target expects great things from its team members. Sometimes, it brings out the best, but there are always those that do not take the same paths. Target is great for a career path, especially if you're super friendly and can deal with frequent curve balls in management. There are many great routes to go. At the moment, Assets Protection is a volatile department and is going through many changes, but for the most part, Target provides stable pay and typically does not target you (no pun intended) negatively. Management changes fairly often, co-workers even more so, and those that stay either hate their life or love where they are. Target is a place to find yourself and where your passions truly lie, even if they lie outside of retail."
good,"Working at Target (Canada) was a joy due to the warm, welcoming and safe environment that was existent. A typical day at work looks a lot like interacting with loads unique people which involves getting to know them in that short (sometimes long) amount of time. As a cashier at Target, I knew I was the one leaving a lasting impression so no matter how tired I was or how long the shift seemed I knew I had to end the experience for my guests shopping at Target the best. "
good,Target has been a great experience for me to grow and develop my SAP background. I was apart of the Canada support team to ensure stability during Target's international Expansion. Today Target Canada is in process of closing its doors.
good,I enjoyed working here I was very sad to leave but was reassured by management I would always be able to return should I move back
good,"A typical day at work meant dealing with the Fast, Fun, and Friendly staff at Target (Pointe-Claire). Exceptional opportunities for growth as well as learning experience in a myriad of fields were abundant; from sales floor to logistics to customer service and human resources positions. The management was very motivational and involved with its teams on a personal basis. Despite the many challenges of the company's struggles in the Canadian market, we as a team accomplished many wonderful things by turning around our initial lack of fully stocked shelves and adjusting to the needs of each and every guest that came to the store. Regardless of our challenges, we at Target Pointe-Claire made the best of all of our days during the store's run-state, and even had fun while working our very hardest to ensure that the store was closed in as an efficient manner as possible. The hardest part of letting go of Target Canada will always remain with the loss of such an incredibly dynamic team."
good,Target has a great training program that takes entry-level applicants and transforms them into a reputable Target team member with an expertise in role.
good,"Target has a fantastic business, development, and team culture. I have been able to experience many different levels of career, upper and lateral. I've learned a lot about my leadership strengths and opportunities and how to leverage my abilities to be successful."
good,"A typical day was getting in at 2pm working to 10pm. on truck days I was mostly backstock, and a few pushes, plus any backstock from the early morning pulls. At 4pm there was pulls to completely pull push, and backstock. Also throughout the night guest/ sales floor requests had to be completed. I learned how to use crown stackers, waves."
good,Target was a cool place to work at I you love to walk. I learned alot the time I was working there. The managerment was on point and the co-workers was nice some of them but not all.
good,I actually really liked working here. The people were really nice and I already love Target so it made it easy to get up for work.
good,"Stock, set endcaps for sales promotions."
good,"usually busy ."
good,"Target is a major US company that decided to enter the Canadian market after learning a fair bit of their customer demographic comes to the US from Canada to shop for cheap."
good,"A typical day at Target begins with going to the back room and grabbing a shopping cart of re-shop to put back onto the shelves. By midday, all the products are unloaded from the trucks and placed on carts to be pushed out and restocked in the store. Each sales floor team member must take a cart and complete their designated areas of restocking by a certain time. At night time, after all restock is completed, it is time to ""zone"" which means cleaning up the aisles to look nice and neat for the next day. It is tedious work but it needs to be done otherwise the store will look messy. I learned how important it is to meet the customers needs and doing whatever it takes to make them happy. I also learned how to use a PDT gun which many other companies use. The managers at Target are very friendly and willing to work with you through any difficulties you have in the workplace. They are determined to succeed and motivate all team members to do the same while working together as well as promote great customer service. My personal experience with co-workers was both good and bad. Some co-workers are willing to help you out so that all tasks are completed at the appropriate time while others aren't so determined to be successful. But, it is important to learn to work around any bumps in the road. The hardest part of the job was getting from one side of the store to the other. The reason I say this is because the Target I was employed at was a Super Target meaning it was very big. When customers pressed the customer service button, I had to run over to another section of the store to"
good,"It was a over all good experience the culture was good and employees cared about each other, the management treated employees with respect."
good,"I loved working at Target. I wish I didn't have to quit but I went back to school and it would of interfere with work, cause I worked in a different city then where I lived. They have P and J sandwich's for you in the brake-room to eat anytime and cable TV."
good,I would preform regular floor patrols as well as exterior patrols. I was responsible for preventing theft on store property as well as writing regular reports. The management was very good and they where excellent with all there employees.
good,"Target company is a very fulfilling job, they have advanced my customers service skills so much along with my long term skill advancements in my career field of interest."
good,Target was a great place to work at. The team was very energetic and an overall great atmosphere at work. Everyone was very helpful and we all took care of each other. The managers were very supportive and helped me progress very quickly. I would not change anything about my decision for working for Target. The best people I have ever worked with.
good,"I only worked at Target for Seasonal. Except under Management and Job Work, which I gave 5 stars, I gave the rest 4 stars.  It is not fair to the store to give them low stars."
good,"Target treats their employees well."
good,"pretty good day"
good,"I learned a lot like,"
good,I have learnedf chasiers and stocking.They did teach to me how use cahsiers and stocking. I work of part time. I had enjoy working of cashier and stocking that cool.
good,"A company filled with great team culture, respect for environment, and humane management that constantly drives its workers to work up to their highest potential, to provide excellent customer service experience to guests. "
good,"Working for Sam's Club wholesale was one of my favorite jobs. It was a very large place with a huge amount of diversity and culture! Everyone was enjoyable to work with and the management team treated me well and I felt very comfortable voicing my concerns and needs. That was the most enjoyable, but the most difficult part for me was filling out the paperwork. I would forget sometimes, but I would make myself remember by leaving it in a spot where I would see it on my way out of my working area. Another difficult part of the job was pulling some of our product from the walk in freezer. With this job, I learned that it is always a better environment when you can make things fun for the customers that come in. There have been a few times where a co-worker and I would encounter someone who looked like they were having a bad day and we would use different voices and crack jokes just to make them smile. When I can make someone else happy and know that I was able to help and make them feel better about coming into my store, that always made me feel pretty great!"
good,it says alot when i have been here for almost 2 years in Jan. With every job there are things that can be better but its a pretty good job
good,we ran around the warehouse on pallet jacks picking every item on an order and dropping it off to the shipping dock.

good,manager of team the hardest part of the job is making sure everything is accurate and in place when others did not do there job
good,"If you walk into a Target and everyone is smiling and looks happy, most of the time they really are. Target take care of their people. Sure it is not all smiles, but no job is.

good,"My most enjoyable part of my job at target is when a guest tells me that they're happy and thankful for me to have helped them. Always leaves a great feeling. Co-workers are always fun to work with and friendly, along with all of the managers/supervisors. I've learned to talk a lot more and not to be afraid of what i have to say or to not be afraid to give my input or thoughts."
good,"Great internal events lead by HR, incredibly friendly and professional Store Team Leaders. Guests and Employees needs are both taken into consideration, it's amazing!"

good,"I had experience in sales in India but it was totally different at Target Mobile. I learned a lot of things about the mobility services and sales at Target Mobile. I learned that first we have to listen to the customer, try to find out what they need and then give them the various options available."
good,a typical day at target is like any other work day at any other retail store
good,"it was a good work place"
good,"Always active, from the time I clock-in until the end of the day. I learned to manage my time better and enjoyed increasing my soft skills. The challenging part was the fact that there is always something to do no later than tomorrow but on the other hand, task management takes place."
good,"A typical day at work is so much fun. I learn How to work different gadgets and organize different parts of the store everyday. I love my co-workers because everybody is so nice and friendly. The management staff is so powerful as a whole. They are all happy and they help in so many ways as well as encourage us to make Target a better place for not only guests but for ourselves. The hardest part of the job is standing in one place too long. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing people say ""I've been looking for this everywhere and I come here and you guys carry it."" It amazes me every time."
good,"A typical day at Target consists of creating ways to get cashiers excited about opening Target Red Cards. I have to be creative to get the cashiers on board with my new idea. I ensure that all employees in my work area get their breaks and lunches in time. While I am on lead I need to keep all associates busy with a task, ensuring that all guest are first priority. I am also responsible to helping guest if they for any reason are not happy. I am typically the first person that can resolve an issue a upset guest may have."
good,Sometimes i would open the store with the rest of the team. Most times i would close the store with the team.  The hardest part of the job was when it was holidays .
good,"They do a lot to reward associates for a job well done. A lot of responsibility regardless of your position, and not enough pay. If you seek feedback and demonstrate initiative, you can move up the ladder quickly. Great cross training so you can gain experience in many different areas."
good,I enjoy want at Target. The management team is easy to get a long with. I like doing what I had to do. My interaction with the customers was enjoyable and it was a good place to learn the do's nd don'ts of the business.
good,"Target Corporation cares about their employees allowing you to be yourself though still having to follow the rules of the corporation. I primarily worked in the electronics department. Though I was also overlooking the seasonal, toys, and sporting goods departments, and responded to alerts"
good,"Standing for at least 4 straight hours."
good,"I am a Flow Team/ Backroom Team Member at Target. Generally a typical day starts at 6am where we begin our truck unload process. The position I have been designated with is the ""toy"" section unloader. This means I go to the backroom, pick up pallets filled with toy boxes and put them onto the shelves. After the store opens at 8am, I go to several different sections of the store until all the freight from the truck is on the shelves or in the backroom. I also do ""backroom"" shifts which involves replenishing the floor by pulling items from our storage boxes and bringing them out to the floor and backstocking items from the truck that will not fit on the shelves. I have learned a great deal about interacting with customers and learning a large store layout in a short time by being immersed in the environment. I also learned how larger establishments work and how to perform a variety of different tasks to keep the store running efficiently. The management is pretty informal in nature and are always willing to help out with a problem of an employee. The co-workers range from incredibly bright people who are always there to lend a hand to some of the laziest people I have ever met. Most of the people are above average and makes the job enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is memorizing where everything is in the store and the most enjoyable part is learning how to do something new and broadening your knowledge."
good,"Working at target was a fun learning experience. I got to meet new people, management was friendly and approachable. the work day went by smoothly with little complications"
good,difficult to meet employees. this would help to give the guests a referral to someone that may be able to answer their questions if i was unable to.
good,"As a BA you are responsible for anything and everything that gets product into the store. It can be a bit overwhelming because there is a lot of reporting and sign-off steps in addition to the ""core job"" responsibilities. The hardest part of this job is learning what it's really like to prioritize conflicting tasks-when often all are important. The most rewarding part of this job is walking into a Target store on any given day and seeing the product that is there because of you."
good,"A very good place to work at. The only thing that makes the job a bit irritating is the management. but overall, Target has a great working environment, good pay, and great service."
good,"A typical work day was unloading the trucks, pushing freight to the floor, then backstocking freight. Everyone was friendly and easy to get along with. I learned a lot and my team leads were eager to explain something if I didn't understand. I loved that we could swap shifts or give shifts away to other employees."

good,Great culture of advancement.  Strong commitment to work-life balance.
good,"A typical day requires working on clearance ticketing, price adjustments, weekly promotional signing, price cuts, and auditing while supervising a team of ten. In addition to price accuracy's core roles, the team must be global and help in all areas that are needed, such as stocking shelves, helping the registers when a line accumulates, and providing great guest service. Above me are executives who supervise all teams and communicate where teams need support and communicate to me about a plan to accomplish store goals. While working there, I have learned how to be resilient and adaptable, manage talent/execution, and work with a sense of urgency while taking on more responsibilities. The hardest part is when there is a lack of talent on the floor (usually caused by callouts) and the workloads accumulate to overwhelming proportions, but luckily, there are always ways to make it work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team that I work with. Having worked with most of them for years, it has been a pleasure to have to reliable, hard working, fun group of individuals."

good,This was my favorite job I've ever had. I worked in the backroom and I loved the team atmosphere. Everyone was treated fairly and management did their job. I only left because I moved too far away and I could not do a transfer because my new place of residence was not close to a facility.
good,A typical day at work was long and hard but it payed off do to the fact that it was 12 hour shifts and i couldn't complain. My co workers where very helpful it was a great environment and had lots of team work going on at all times.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Target; however, my passion is not retail customer service.  A typical day at work includes passing off from the previous team leader, scheduling my team members breaks and lunches, prioritizing a list of things that need to be completed by the end of the shift and then tending to my team's needs.  If there were any guest issues, complaints, questions or concerns, I was the first manager that they spoke with.  If I was unable to solve to issue or the guest wanted to speak with another individual, I would consult the executive on duty.  The most enjoyable part of my job was developing my strong team members in leaders themselves and watching them grow and develop.  The hardest part of the job was disciplining confrontational team members by issuing written write-ups."
good,"-Target's mission is to achieve ""the vibe"". In other words be:"
good,I've worked for Target for over seven years and I can say that the most enjoyable part of this job is the coworkers/team. We create relationships here that last for very long times.

Washing my hands preparing to serve food if im at Target Cafe, or getting my area ready if im cashiering. Also, stocking and zoning and greeting guests and assisting them with any concerns or help to find specific merchandise. Ive learned how to deal with demanding guests and stressful situations alot better the worse thing about the job is around holidays its really crazy and breaks and lunches are given out late and team members get tired too. But overall ive met some incredible and fun people some who that even after they left target we still remained friends."
good,Target is a fun place to work at. Everyone is so friendly and easy to get along with. Coming into work all the employees smile and greet me. I think the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make random people's day.  After talking to certain guests they smile and thank me for helping them out; helping people is one of my biggest passions. I do not think Target is a hard place to work and cannot think of something that is hard about it.

You can work here, great place if you want to accept that challenge."

I have to say that all different things that we have to do on the daily basis, are normal for its on place, it all depends all you look at it. well in my opinion is when you know that you accomplish and the patient and or customer are satisfied with treatment that he or she received."
good,Target was challenging work at the Distribution center. Despite the high standard I enjoyed meeting all challenges given and will forever be grateful to the leadership and company for being fair and caring for all team members.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was greeting the customers and utililzing the cash register. I worked as a cashier in the beginning and then worked my way into the customer service department and then onto the salesfloor. So, when either department needed someone, I was ready because I was trained in those three places."
good,It is a very friendly environment. I believe it is the only place where I would look forward to going because I was always greeted by smiles and greetings from all employees. I learned a lot in my years at Target. I learned several aspects of Human

They are very flexible with my schedule and treat me as if I am a leader. Each and every co-worker is amazing, everyone gets along and is friendly outside of the workplace.

This includes keeping the area cleaning, inspecting the rooms for stolen items and reporting those items, as well as sorting, folding, and sometimes hanging clothes.

You will be required to work odd hours (i.e. close one night and open the next morning). Most of the time you know your hours in advance. However, it is important to make sure you know your hours as they occasionally may change in short-notice. Overall, this is an ok place to work. The people are mostly friendly, the job is not terribly demanding, and the pay is decent. You are trained on the cash register for one day, and then in the fitting room for the remaining days. Occasionally you may be asked to work in departments that you were not trained in. The people are friendly, and management is ok."

Taget was'nt a hard palce to work once you got a plan to how you are gonna handle your day."
good,Target is a great company to work for because of all the considerable amount of perks of the job. I have watched many hard work individuals reach their goals as long as they give what the bosses want. Management is fair for the most part and are over worked. My co-workers are wonderful people. The hardest part of my job is dealing with other co-workers mistakes. The most enjoyable part of my job is going to work and having fun with friends doing my job.
good,A typical day at target was very full filling since I was always busy. I learned how to market for the seasons. The management was always willing to work with the employees. The co workers were a pleasure to work with and I really enjoyed talking with most of them. The hardest part of the job was the physical demand but it was still good.

They work great with school schedules and any vacations that need to be taken."
good,"An environment that needed full attention everyday. Structure and planning was the foundation of our tactics. My immediate management was always there to assist me and kept me very informed on current training rollouts.

good,"Working for target was a blast during the seasonal time, it allowed me to be able to connect with guests with a more personal tone when we would discuss a product or they would ask me on my own opinion/experiences."
good,Overall decent company. Men and women are in management. If your not management you have opportunity to line up with company qulifications to move up. Better do it when you first get hired because you can't live off the current hourly wages.

good,Awesome time working with so many different people. Found out how to do and take care of basically anything anybody asked. Loved it!
good,"A typical day as a Target Flow team member began by unloading a company truck full of miscellaneous products. If I werent unloading the truck i would be on the back of the line along with one other employee maintaing 8+ pellets with products coming from the trucks which we had to stack in an orderly manner so it wouldnt topple over. The next step of the process would be to take the products onto the sales floor by department and place the boxes of product into the correct isles in the assigned department, after that the manager would assign teams to go to a specific department to stock the products, this was a very physically demanding job as well as dangerous considering how many box cutters were being used at once. the hardest part of the job had to be the hours it was a overnight shift. the most enjoyable part of the job would be the people yet again."
good,"they were understanding, always flexible with scheduling, supervisor will to talk and work with you. it was a good experience."

good,I overall say Target was a really good job. Some things I feel they could work on is flexibility for athletes but otherwise it was really good. The diversity also made it a very good job.
good,"Working in carton air is hard.  It is a warehouse position, and it takes time to adjust to, long hours and all, but it is a good job other than the difficulty level."
good,"I would show up to work at the same time everyday, the I  walk all the way to the break where I laid down my stuff. Then walk where everybody did stretches before work.

good,All around good place to work a. Recently remodeled and looks great ! Plenty of break time and a decent amount of hours. Great benefits and support of the managers.
good,"It was very enjoyable work.  I got lots of exercise in from the amount of walking required for my job.  I think on average I would get 15-20 thousand steps during my shift.  I learned how to be social and involved with customers.  Also I learned how to be organized because without organization, we could not achieve getting online orders done on-time."
good,"Working with this company was really nice everything was very organized every day, everyone was also friendly and there was always lots of communication and very specific directions on what your task was and how to do it."

good,I work as an apparel and accessories (style) team member. The pay is good for the work I do and all my team leads/managers are very friendly and helpful with any questions I've had so far.
good,"A normal day at target consists of you clocking in and walking over to a main area with a manger.  You talk to your manager and usually they just put you where they need you.  In this case, for guest advocate, they will place you at self checkout, register, or order pickup.  Your placement can change many times within a shift or once per shift."
good,I loved working for Target. The Team Members including the management staff really truly create a team atmosphere. I was able to move around the company within position and location with ease.

good,"Management should pls increase weekly hours. Weekly hours allocated is too low. But they pay Good salary, but need good hours to commiserate the pay. Aside that it's a good place to work.."
good,"Wonderful place to work for. Compensation is amazing. The only downfall is you don't exactly find out what you are doing within the warehouse until you do orientation and if you find for example you cannot operate equipment, you must see your doctor for a medical note to change departments so it's slightly inconvenient"
good,"Great job, good peoples but my job wasn't with the customer it was mainly behind the scene. It was always something different daily. Sometimes worked while store was closed to install cameras and the alarms that goes off only on our computers when some passes by"

good,"I like it here, I've only worked one day but the employee I shadowed was very helpful in showing me everything i needed to know and all the managers are equally kind and helpful"
good,"Target overall is a company depending on the location, I can only speak about the one I was working in, management was never on the same page with deligating to associates what task need to be done for the day, you can start a task deligated by a supervisor and it changes less than an hour by another supervisor, they never communicated with each other on the changes, and you are stuck looking confused... are a"
good,"Hardest part was trying to get the pulls done on time."
good,"Pay is definitely fair. Management is excellent. I never had any real problems working here. There is definitely work involved, it’s not a blow off job but with the company’s minimum wage going up to $15 you can’t complain too much"
good,Great work environment and great experience and culture. Management is visible and give you all the tools you need to grow within the company. You can really make this job work for you.
good,"Helping out customers. Learning how to work in the café. Making returns."
good,"Aside from assisting with the customers, you are able to enhance skills in organization and cleanliness. You learn as you continue working there and become used to working a certain amount of hours."
good,"As Target is a large retail chain, work was very fast paced and stressful. However my coworkers and bosses were all very friendly people that I enjoyed working with/for. As a front end attendant who spent most of his shift gathering carts from the lot I'd say the days with very high heat or very low chills were probably my least favorite part of the job. My favorite was probably the people I got to meet and interact with, both my coworkers and some of the customers I assisted."
good,Very fast paced your on your feet 24/7 sometimes you may have to work in other sections if needed others hours are early mornings and evenings...it’s pretty much chill just a lot of moving and organizing non stop
good,"Great place to work, great benefits, great teammates and supervisors. Plenty of training tools. Great vacation, personal holidays, 401k plan, pension plan, just overall great company."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target due to how comfortable the environment and how friendly the staff was. The work was fast paced and competitive, but there was always someone there to provide assistance if needed."
good,"Great company, but the hours are not good if it's not holiday season. The management team was in the process of changing and they are a little more strict now."
good,The hardest part on my job is only the customers it because some customer dont understand the job lwas and they feel like they are always right which is sometimes yes their right but mostly no... I am not saying this for every customer but some of the customer does this
good,"Honestly, Target was an amazing place to work and to grow. Very well organized, there was always something to do but never too much to be overwhelmed. Organization was really there and I always felt like if I needed help or had questions someone was there to assist me. The hardest part of the job was getting some heavy loads up on high places, some things didn't warren a lift so hefting things up on the high shelf was somewhat difficult but if it was policy that for things you can't do or need help some one is there to assist you so it was never too difficult to get the job done quickly and efficiently. I would highly recommend those looking for a part time or full time place seek Target as they have been the best experience working for an organization I've hand."
good,"I learned a lot about good customer service and how to deal with the different types of customers. Management was super helpful and kind since I started working there. Workplace culture, everyone was kind and heaps of fun to work with."
good,good company to be apart of might not be for everyone but it is a good company. Long 12 hour days but it was nice having 4 days off a week. Plenty of time on breaks throughout the day.
good,Daily guest service with customers and dealing with security & theft at the same time is quite fun. The management is quite strict but doable. Learned how to use surveillance cameras.
good,"A regular day at Target would vary a lot, as it really depends on what season you are in, what time you are working at, and the weather. I personally worked in the Winter, so I experienced both the fast-paced struggle of keeping up with customers during the Christmas season as well as the slow-down of work once Christmas passed and snowstorms occurred."
good,Work where you love is their main slogan. You are a team member from the get go so the culture is very team oriented and not individualized. You have the opportunity to cross train in all areas so that you have more options for work centers
good,"I love working for Target. Its funny, I read some reviews and don't really get it. They pay FAIR wages, but are ready to bump minimum wage. If you are smart, can interact with people and really have a good work ethic, there's really nothing keeping you from forward movement with Target.  I actually ended up at Target as an accident looking for a career job and just stayed there. I enjoy it."
good,"People were very friendly there, I almost felt welcomed even though everyone was trying their best to get through Black Friday/Holiday week. The hardest part of the job was that there was a time limit for each order. Sometimes the item wouldn't be in the shelves so that meant having to go to the back to search. Overall it always kept you busy which is something I like about a job."
good,Target itself was a very nice place to work in but the only things that ruined it was the managent. Most days it was nice meeting new people coming in and out
good,"seasonal work can't last forever and my position did not turn into a part-time job. I can honestly say between the co-workers I had and the managers there, Target was a really good place for experience for new workers. they(Target) leave a lot up to the other workers to help you advance in the job, and for me that was great, it really helped me get a grip in what I was doing during the job"
good,"Very straight forward interviewing process. Came to work about 3 days later. Handed me a device, went to the backroom for training which took only a day. was ready to be on my own within 2 days."
good,"Really great beginner job for if your just starting out in a new city, or if your looking for your first job. It’s a corporate position, so you feel a little overwhelmed that things might be bigger than they are. But you have lots of supervisors to look after you, and your coworkers are all super nice."
good,"Nice and relaxing but productive, hardest part was closing  and counting all the money from the day trying not to make to many mistakes. management is amazing."
good,The atmosphere was extremely warm and respectful. I definitely learned how to work hard. Hardest part of the job was communication within our Human Resources.
good,"Working at target has been rewarding. Advancing to a team leader position is very possible, however going any higher than that requires a very high level of dedication. As a leader you have a set schedule that is very comfortable- one closing shift a week with every other weekend off. My current manager has been with the company for over ten years and has been very supportive of my personal growth. For the most part targets upper management truly cares about my well being and that’s a wonderful thing to have. "
good,"Working in the stockroom is a very tedious job. The downfall to it would be that work seems to be repeated a lot because not all team members are on the sam page. This causes issues for team members like myself being that I have to fix the same thing over and over again. However,  when things are going smoothly and everyone is on the same page (rare), the job is not as difficult or annoying."
good,"The work setting was smooth. A typical consisted of organizing stock. The workplace environment was comfortable, being that the people were from my community."
good,Every day was exciting and fun.  I enjoyed coming to work every day.  I sometimes went to work early just to get things squared away ahead of time.  Our morning meetings were always fun and we always had recognition for team memebers so they could see it no matter what time of day the came in for their shift.  The management team was awesome they were very supportive and had the open door policy.  The hardest part of the job was relocating.  The most enjoyable part was the entire team we had at our store location.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target in the Executive level because they really promoted our education to be better. They valued us - their employees with opportunities for training and development. The hardest part of the job at this level was balancing home/work life when I had small children. That was the reason I left, but working there was the best work opportunity I have had."
good,"Our local Target has a great leadership team.  They are very involved with day-to-day processes, and most leaders work alongside team members on the sales floor every day.  Target loves to promote internally, and if you preform well, they notice and give you opportunities for advancement."
good,"Learned a lot such as how to train others, and how to be able to interact with multiple guests throughout the day. Fast, fun and friendly is their motto & you have to be able to keep up."
good,"I have met a lot of great people while working at Target, but unfortunately, the hours aren’t getting me by, and I just can’t afford living paycheck to paycheck."
good,"At $8 per hour with a highly variable commission, I struggled to make ends meet. The goals set by upper management, though possible in the scope of all things, were highly unfeasible."
good,"It is a very fast-paced work environment, with nice people and great benefits. Working there comes with great hours as well as great pay. The management is fair as well."
good,"The job as a Flow team member is sometimes difficult but it allowed me to gain work experience as well as go to school which was exactly what I was looking for, I worked there for 3 years but at times some of the team members I worked with were a bit frustrating and they seemed to never really acknowledge what you were doing but the management were very helpful."
good,"Having worked there for 8 plus years I've advanced to my position where I am now."
good,"good place to work, fun, great mangers. The staff are always in a happy mood, happy to be there. there can be some times were the job is stressful because of the amount of people  that come in but its a good place to work."
good,Learned a lot from this job. Had opportunities to advance and learn different aspects of the job. Learned different areas and gain a lot of skills for my new jobs
good,As like any job there will be stressful times. Especially if you work in retail.  But for the most part depending on your location of target employment. The job can be fun and relaxed.
good,It's was a good place for me to work the team members were okay but really didn't like too help out .  I loved the job it worked for me and I would recommend it for someone looking for a job .
good,I worked at Target for a total of 2 years. In my department the work is very simple and understandable once you get the hang of things. I learned logistics when I first started working there during the overnight tenure. Hardest part is organizing the shelves because some aisles can get tedious. Management is very understanding and kind.
good,Working at target has its ups and downs. I liked the people I worked with and the environment that my store had. I feel like we’re always understaffed and constantly busy. It’s espe hard when corporate mandates payroll cut on hours...
good,"Great place to work, good culture and good people. "
good,"A typical day consisted of working with people I became really great friends with and great managers for the most part. Dealing with all kinds of costumers from the non social type to the over sharing type even very difficult costumers. I learned a lot about the public, people, myself, what brings the community together or even our differences. Management when I first started working there was great I couldn't have asked for a better more understanding team. Slowly but surely almost everyone was either replaced, transferred or retired. The new set of managers were also pretty great but a lot of times seemed way too preoccupied in the company to care about their employees and their well fare. Even issues happening in store right under their noses. A lot of favoritism went on and for the most part I could handle it, because I knew how to do my job without asking too much of my managers help but there were times I needed to call in for family emergencies, or my son and was often told by a particular manager that my job, as a cashier at Target mind you, came before my son. While I realize the importance of my pay check and a company that helps the community I could never understand or agree with my job coming before my son's well being. Other than that the workplace was usually fun as we all helped each other out and were friends. The most enjoyable part of my job was when it got so busy and I was able to multitask and even help out costumers in different departments. I usually got appraised for it but it wasn't the reason I did it I just enjoyed helping out wherever I could."
good,"Target is a great employer, leading the charge in innovative, customer-focused, retail experiences.  Great place to learn and grow, although the retail life can make work/life balance challenging."
good,"At Target a typical work day starts when you clock-in, you are expected to open all registers as directed and set up your register."
good,•	Examine merchandise to ensure that it is correctly priced and displayed and that it functions as advertised.........................................
good,I worked 3 days a week. Ive learned the quality of team work & the importance of leardership. The management is great there & are good people to work with
good,Great work environment and flexible scheduling.  Keep your head down and work hard like you should on every job.  If you work hard they will have you learn more and more and be more valuable to the store and your future jobs there.
good,"I loved this job, the vibe at Target was always so nice. Target is all about creating the best experience for their customers, and employees. Everyone was so easy to get along with, and very understanding/accepting. A typical day at Target working soft lines is all about making the clothing look presentable and clean."
good,"I worked for Target DC for a little over a year. I worked graveyard from 6pm-6am. This shift schedule was tough to adjust to my daily life. Overall, the start pay was great and raises are received annually."
good,"I honestly enjoyed my time at Target and loved the people I worked with. This company is constantly changing to meet the needs and wants of its customers, though, and it became too stressful for me. Small changes happen throughout the store every few days which takes time to get used to, but once you get past that it can be a fun place to work that offers great pay and benefits-even if you're just part time!"
good,You must definitely be in shape and able to work at a quick pace. This is a great company to work for and they do care for their employees. Go target!!
good,This was a very great job. I worked in the seasonal time and it was great. Didn't give very much hours. I think you need to have patience because there would be long lines and there wouldn't be that many cashiers.
good,"The job is a great first job for anyone who considers it. Target helps one another grow not only as a hard worker but as a person. The whole entire team is a support group not just by being your team members but also creating connections and networking with each other. Starting this job has helped me become more aware of customer service challenges, utilizing my time, but also to grow to a higher level of sales. Within the short time I have been there I feel as if I'm able to take on challenges and lead as one with a sense of urgency."
good,During my time at target they did a great job of training me and reminding me of all my responsibilities for the position I was in. Whenever help was required someone would readily help me out.
good,I can honestly say this is a great job for anybody coming straight out of high school and looking for their first job. That is exactly what I did and it was good while it lasted when I was 18-19 years old
good,What I learned from working at Target is being able to make guests feel welcome and be able to communicate effectively among my peers. The management was pretty good when it came to times where I needed them for assistant.
good,"ive learned so much at this company and its really going to better me for the future, hardest part of this job is getting customers to buy things you wouldnt buy yourself"
good,This was my first job and I have to say that it was a great one. I met some really amazing people and my typical day at work was always fun. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude guests but there were very few of those as well.
good,very fast paced work environment.Staff and management were both very personable and patient. work was some times quite hard. Warehouse was not heated or air conditioned so depending on the season it could at times be extremely hot or very cold
good,Started at a cashier position and was able to be promoted to customer service specialist and be in charge of the front lanes in less than 6 months. Target has a great work environment and flexible scheduling.
good,"Target is a fun, family oriented store. Putting starbucks in was a great investment. The energy is always positive an they are great helpers in finding whatever you need."
good,It was a great company to work for I would recommend for out of high-school workers. The management was flexible when health issues arose and other personal issues.
good,Great culture to work in. Clean and Professional work environment.  Sometime there are workforce challenges as Target employees a lot of college students.
good,"My experience in retail definitely grew being an employee with Target. I was only there for a short period of time (college student), but while I was there, I learned a lot."
good,"A great job that takes care of their employees. They are business that cares about their image and wants to make sure customers are treated appropriately. Days can be long and tiring, but when it slows down it's relaxing."
good,"I would get there about 7 in the morning and stay till about 3 in the afternoon i would open up the electronics department (turn on tvs load the shelves ect.) work till about 11:30 take lunch then go back out and help guests find their electronic needs."
good,"This was only my second job ever, and it was a wonderful experience along with some rough patches, of course. A typical day of work at the deli would depend on the day, if a weekday usually helping slice deli meats and cheeses, or helping with the fried foods/rotisserie chickens. A weekend would mean mostly helping slice because it usually very busy. Hardest parts of the job would be helping customers that ask about different departments of the store, but you can always then use the walkies to communicate to different team members. The most enjoyable part, honestly, would be the different people you worked with, my co-workers were the people that made a stressful, busy sunday into a less bad one."
good,Target is not a hard place to work and they are always open to you wanting to change your schedule and extra time off but still make sure work is good
good,"Never a dull minute so did not get bored. Changing jobs though out the day and meeting new people everyday. "
good,"Target has been a great place to work throughout my college years. I’ve worked with some amazing people, and had a wonderful time meeting everyone. The only con of this place is working with customers, which is a given and to be expected."
good,Everyone was very nice and was easy to get things down. The management was good and it was easy to pick up shifts. I did train in a lot of areas which I didn't quite like since I just wanted to be a cashier but overall a great job
good,Target is a great place to work and they work well with students currently enrolled in school. Friendly environment with plenty of room to grow with the company
good,Love working here  its a safe place to be with great people around me. Pay and breaks are good and would love to continue working here as i have had the best possible training too
good,This is one of best experience for me because I do work alone as a DOM means that where I have to separate all of the items when a box comes with all combo.
good,"Target was fun to work for because during the holidays there are free snacks and candy for the team members and games to win prizes. The management is very nice and help you if you have any questions. The things I didn't like are the pressures they put on you to sell RED cards, Target credit cards. Also, they don't give you enough hours and,in turn, you don't get holiday pay. But over all, a very good place to work if you get a permanent position."
good,Love working here just trying to get a job in my career field. There are many good benefits to working here and I enjoy every minute. The only complaint is the hours wish I had more.
good,"Great company, good people, good balance, excellent benefits and working conditions were excellent."
good,I enjoyed working at target it was a great place the co workers are very nice. Enjoyed working as a group. I like there benefits and it is a good company.
good,"A typical dat at target we unload and receive 15,000 cartons I learned how to handle the receiving gun they have a strong culture at target the hardest part is dealing with the stress the best part is the time off with family and the pay"
good,"I was a cashier , nothing was difficult for me because i also worked for retail so i was able to handle situations based off of my knowledge . The most enjoyable part about the job was receiving extra hours."
good,"Target had such a high level of engagement from its team members. We felt like a family. From dealing with executives, to the new cashier, everyone had pride in their company and every one felt like they were part of the bigger picture and family that Target had built."
good,Although it was seasonal I wish it wasn't. Everyone at Target were very nice including the guess and they made work actually enjoyable. I recommend to
good,"Its a nice, clean, and friendly environment. Your start pay is very good and you get raises in between the Winter and Spring season based off your work ethic. However getting hours are a little troublesome but if you tell them to call you when they're down people, keep your phone on. You're likely to get a call back. Also a little difficult to pass the interviews so BE PREPARED."
good,Target has been an easy going job. I work in the Beauty section and I just straighten things and clean. I learned other areas of the store so that I could work more hours in different sections.
good,Great place to work for a part time job. Not very many full time job opportunities.  Very unbiased work place with a variety of cultures working there.
good,"A typical work day consists of team work and the opportunity to enjoy diversity. No day is never the same, they all come with different challenges its how you face them that makes each day better than the previous moment or day. My favorite part about this store is the ability to cross train. This made it possible for me not to easily burn out my enjoyment of working for target but also created the possibly of people taking advantage of your skills. Overall, Things were great. During my employment I worked as GSA, Ad, Soft lines, Cashier, Food Prep and more.  Wonderful atmosphere and people to work for. The hardest part about the job is dealing with guest who don't understand company policy. Although there were difficult customers i enjoyed the ability to assist people and create a fast, fun and friendly environment."
good,Target was a good place to work the hours for my position were excellent the only reason that I left Target is because one of our other stores had closed on the southside of Indy and so they took that technician and put him in my store since he had been there for such a long time and let me go otherwise I probably would still be at Target like I said earlier Target is a fast place to work you're always constantly busy working on the building changing light bulbs painting Etc all and all target was a good place
good,"My experience with Target is a largely positive one. Organization is top notch, management is for the most part reliable, and balancing work & school hours is straightforward and stress & drama free. I highly suggest this as a starting point to anyone."
good,"Target does a good job with work-life balance.  My schedule was 3 days a week, 12hr shifts.  The people were friendly and it wasn't stressful.  I left only because there was limited advancement opportunities on the Maintenance side."
good,"Target is a fun and interesting place to work,the people i worked with was great and a lot of fun to be around. It was challenging at times but i feel that's to be expected on any job."
good,"There was never a just typical day with Target, I always wanted to take more and more tasks on. Cashiering would include friendly greetings, making sure our guest was most definitely happy before leaving our store. Management was great and the most important but enjoyable part of working with this company was the fact that I was never just standing around theres always something to do or someone else to help."
good,Working on a ground to storefront project was fun. I got to see the making of a major company store and what it takes to open its doors. Working onsite gave me the opportunity to meet a diversified group of people.
good,I enjoyed working at target It is a busy and fast paced working zone I always stayed busy. I learned how to Manage my time correctly and how to work under pressure. The hardest part of working at Target was standing on my feet all day. I enjoyed my co workers they were very welcoming.
good,All of the staff was very nice and the management was very willing to adjust my work schedule since I was a college student as well. The pay was great and I didn't hate coming into work.
good,A typical day at work in Target was me going down to the basement and sorting carts of items the customers did not want. I had to work with the sales team on the floor in order to have items going back on the shelves on a constant basis. This also helped make sure that Target looked nice and presentable throughout the entire day. I would have to sort about 40 - 50 carts a day and put the items in the exact department that they belonged in.
good,Target is good place the work if you want part-time. I team leader work over 40 hours. I like that Target in each month with have special day on the calendar to celebrate. Also if you birthday you get a free Starbucks coffee of your choice. I like assisting customers for something they need.
good,Friendly and motivated environment. Management heard and considered employees complaints and issues. Procedures were executed with professional excellence when the store closed.
good,Fun place to work at. Huddle would commence before your shift to go over what needed to be done for the day or sales we needed to promote or we would have a tasting of something new that came to our food department. There were events you could volunteer for and sometimes we would play games. There was definitely room for advancement/promotions/raises.
good,Even though there is a lot to do the time goes by quick due to the productivity of the job. The job can also be fun at times because of the people that are in it.
good,"everything has a system and everything was always flowing the way a good company should be managed, along with good team members I could rely on to help when I did need help."
good,I spent 10 years of my work life at target the only bad thing was hours during slow times of years unless you were a team lead the hours were really bad. Other than that the vibe with coworkers was very good
good,Great team members and management.  It is a family at Target.  There is work life balance as well as great pay and benefits.  It is hard work but is rewarding.
good,"This was my first retail job, I loved it. It was fast paced and fun. Great for a first job. Always a chance to pick up shifts and help out. Loved my coworkers."
good,"Easy to work for, very flexible.  Gives team members authority to ensure positive guest experience.  Management is very engaged in day to day operations"
good,"Target is friendly retail corporation that promotes the quality customer service and sells the latest products that enter the market. While working at Target I have learned to accomplish a multiple of assignments at once. It can be difficult to do your job, assist customers and deal with managers who want you to do more than you're capable of. However, if you have a degree specifically in Business Administration or Mass Communication there are a lot of opportunities available for you."
good,"I stayed with Target Retail Store for i believe 3 years and mostly everyone I worked with was friendly and there to help one another out.a couple ETLs weren't all too nice but the majority of management was there to help their employees by showing them what needed to be done. Because it was retail, hours did sway, some seasons would would only have 15 hr work weeks and other you could have as much as 40 hours."
good,Good place to work. There is much freedom and mobility at work. You are not micromanaged are free to make decisions. I learned many responsibilities being a trainer and it is easy to move up in the company.
good,"working in Target is pretty exciting, you always have to be active and on your feet. you have to enjoy hands-on work and you have to learn to multitask at the same time."
good,Target is great for college students who need some extra cash. Managers are usually very helpful with customers and team member complaints. Team members are always recognized for their great work.
good,"The staff was great to work with. High energy, uptempo environment to work in. Rest was very important and if you didn't get enough of it, you were dragging throughout the shift. Supervisors went by numbers a lot!"
good,"Target is normally always busy, so you have to be able to adapt to moving faster than normal. Also, learning new aspects of the job is very helpful to the company. This way if any part of the store is backed up, you can give additional assistance in order to resolve that issue, much more quickly."
good,Target was a great work place! People there where great and always friendly!! Also had different challenges daily which I enjoyed very much!! :) :) :)
good,"I loved working at Target Financial Service, the staff were always in good spirit, and always willing to help. Only negative part about this job was working through another company, definitely willing to reapply soon"
good,my typical day working there is very hard . I learned that they go by speed and how fast you are able to  use the cashier everyone got along with everyone . my hardest part  was rude customers and cashier rating your speed and how fast you are in packing items and attending the customers sales . I enjoy most part of it was able learn certain sales and helping customers .
good,Wonderful start to the workforce. Very fun and easy. Non stressful and management was ok. They made it easy to try new positions and challenged your akills
good,"I worked during the holiday season from November to January. I would work 8 hour shifts cashiering. Time went by quickly due to Target always being busy, but standing and scanning for this long can become boring."
good,"At target my job responsibilities were ensuring and maintaining the freshness of products daily including meats, bakery, fruits and vegetables."
good,"Great place to work if you are looking to make decent money. Also you get a lot of hours & extra over time. Only bad thing is most of the people who get hired on as  seasonal, they usually get laid off before the 6 months time period is over."
good,Overnight job that requiered unloading products and produce for the entire store and stocking the sales floor with whatever was missing and putting away the rest for the next night.
good,"I start working as a part time sales associate but I got interested into other areas of the floor too so they gave me a training for cashier, electronic department, worked as an operator. It was a nice place to work also my management was really good always appreciate me for my work whatever I did."
good,"Overall working at target was a great first experience as a Softlines worker. It was my first time working in retail, and my coworkers and managers made me feel welcomed."
good,"Target has headquarter locations in AZ, unfortunately there is little opportunity without moving to Minnesota. Love team environment and diversity focus. Overall fantastic and collaborative environment."
good,"I have worked here for four years, and cant say that i have had a better job. It is fast , fun, and most the time friendly. I could not see myself leaving here any time soon!!!"
good,"•Responsible for shelf stocking"
good,"A typical day at work I would first greet guest as they came up to my line, I would ask them if they found everything okay. The things I have learned while working at Target is that you meet all kinds of people."
good,Working at Target can be an enjoyable experience for someone who is able to handle a modicum of responsibility and pressure. There are multiple opportunities to improve and further your career. Benefits are wonderful and in my experience they were supportive of those that wanted to further their education through college.
good,I loved the management. There was a clear chain of command and all higher level management were on in sync! There was never any gossiping about other employees.
good,"I learned new multiple skills like cashiering and customer service that is beneficial to my resume and future interviews. Really liked the co-workers but the the sales drive of the RedCard drove me to burnout real fast. I hear that other Target's are more relaxed and easy going so maybe one day I will apply again. I did like my managers but the higher management I felt were very unapproachable. Some employees felt that other employees were part of their ""Target Family"" but I never gained a sense of Family from this specific location."
good,"The job was easy. The only thing that I've experienced a problem with, was management. They weren't on top of things, i also got another job while working here. And changed my availability, they still had me scheduled to work on days i worked my other job. The best part about the job was that we had plenty of people to help stock for the night. Which made it easier on us and management."
good,"Great company.  Opportunity to develop and advance.  Teamwork is encouraged.  Training is available on multiple levels.  Volunteer opportunities, community service is also encouraged."
good,I liked working here but I did not like having to sell people Red Cards because of how many times they have been hacked. Management was great but was hard getting them to cross-train you in different locations. Co-workers was great and easy to get along with.
good,nice place to work as well as a great place to do shopping at. helping customers & meeting cool people fun working environment ability to listen to music while working helping your vibe & overall making it more fun to get work done
good,Fun friends and like family.I worked here until my sibling got very I'll and was hospitalized I would love to work here again in the future
good,"Great fast pace unload, and stock. I learn new things on the job about target electronics. Management is great. I just need more hours. The hardest part of my job is that I have to unload the truck and it can be very hot in the trailer. Most enjoyable part of the job are my friendly co workers and friends that I have made from working there in the length of time that I have worked there."
good,One of the right place to manage work life balance. Had a immense opportunities to learn and develop more as an individual. Colleagues were co-operative and had a similar mindsets towards company's goals and objectives.
good,"A great focused and on-task Management team made it so easy to learn and enjoy my work experience with Target. I learned the basics and more of Customer service, cashiering, and the general workings of Retail. Great friendly co-workers and our ping pall table had to be the best part. That and helping customers and seeing them satisfied. Hardest part was dealing with the overall amount of customers we would sometimes have, but we always managed to maintain our goals and work standard while handling our guests."
good,I absolutely love my job and the people I work with.  It is a fun atmosphere and I look forward to going to work everyday.  I would recommend young adults straight out of college coming here to build a great foundation in order to pursue bigger and better things in your future and if you decide to stay with Target then have great growth.
good,Although this job could be very demanding with all the standing and movement required there was always fun to be had with co-workers.
good,"Target is a fun and productive place to work at. The people, customers and co-workers, are all polite and easy to get along with. The management is also great."
good,"I loved the job i worked and my team leads often praised my work ethic, organizational skills, and time management. I am the only person in the store who holds my position, and I have learned how to work as an individual and manage my time accordingly."
good,"During this time, I started out as a simple cart attendant but ended up being able to run the food court, the photo center, the guest services desk, print labels, set of shelves, restock properly, zone sections effectively, and be an all around amazing worker."
good,"Very well kept and managed well."
good,"Typical day at work would be stocking ,cleaning, branding "
good,"Everybody was awesome there. It's just one of the LOD's (managers) was just really against me I felt and I have no idea why. The time I was there there, I was very punctual, never complained about staying later always took days that people really didn't want to. So to me I was a really good worker. I felt that just because I was seasonal that I wasn't good enough. "
good,"Love the company and most importantly the people. Very interested in helping people advance. There is a lack of transparency and you do need to do all the asking and digging when it comes to proper training and moving up the corporate ladder. Great team, great benefits, great culture."
good,"The staff is very friendly, management is always there when you need them. Everyone is organized and always working hard. It's very flexible and I enjoy working there. The hours are very flexible and if you ever need a day off, they are willing to work with you. The most enjoyable part is my co-workers, who are hard working and friendly and also meeting new people and making sure they leave happy."
good,"A empresa é ótima, sem atitudes prejudiciais ao trabalhador."
good,"Typical retail store, customer service, etc It was a good place to build the start of my work career to set me up for success."
good,I have worked for target for 4 years now and have had a great experience so far. The team is beyond great. Everyone is easy to speak with as well as work with and I have no complaints!
good,"Definitely room for employee growth and development within the store. Many opportunities to cross train in different departments to help with different jobs as needed. The stores are huge and the job is very physically tiring after a while (lots of walking, lifting, and standing for the whole shift), but rewarding. Team members receive 10% of discounts on everything the store has to offer, as well as extra appreciation discounts during the holidays, time-and-a-half, overtime, health benefits, special discounts (vacations), and more. Only end of the year raises are offered and are usually very small (10-20 cents max). High turnover in the store during the night hours as many people are young. Overall a fun place to work with room to gain lots of work  experience."
good,Typical day at work is helping guest and occasionally team members. Getting things done is a fast and friendly manner. I've learned excellent communication skills along with customer service skills and patience. I work with an amazing team who supports you in everything 100% and will always have your back. What i enjoyed the most about my job is making the guest smile and making sure they had a great shopping experience and hope that they'll return to shop with us every time.
good,wonderful room for upward movement and a very friendly look on school schedules and overall a very flexable company to be a part of
good,I really enjoyed working at Target the staff was very friendly and helpful the management allowed you the opportunity to work overtime if you want and showed appreciation for the work that you do
good,I liked working at Target very up beat good management good benefits but for a Supervisor position the pay could be a whole lot more better because of the work load and the duties 9.80 i mind as well stayed a cashier without the work load
good,"Working at target was something new for me. I've never done collecting debt before. It was a fun experience but, they need to upgrade their computers."
good,Great company to work for! Amazing at development and strong team based workforce. Very committed in constantly developing employees into leadership roles. Executives have constant communication with team and provide team members with straight forward development plans and career paths.
good,"I started at 4 in the morning and at first it was really hard getting use to it, but after I got use to the schedule and the routine in the morning the shift goes by a whole lot faster."
good,"It was always busy, never boring. The culture and environment was great. My co-workers were always upbeat; no dull moments. Management was good, needed a little work. What I learned was being a leader and knowing how much of a team player I am. Nothing was ever hard. What I enjoyed most was seeing how the guests would smile when I would help them out."
good,"Target is a productive and fun place to work.  The team engagement and work life balance as a manager is nice.  Target is always changing with the times, in terms of technology and speed for its' employees and guests."
good,"A work day at Target was never so bad, i learned a lot, especially  how to to be patient with others. Sometimes you may not agree with the boss or the customer, i learned to always just keep a smile. The most enjoyable part of being a cashier at Target was seeing regular customers and being able to have a great conversation with people. My co-workers were great but the hardest part to deal with was the nasty customers and trying to keep a happy face and keeping them calm ."
good,Fun and learning environment. Very supportive colleagues and management which provides a collaborative environment to work. The company strategies and policies are transparent so that one can see their future at workplace and believe in the organizations success.
good,Target has always kept me busy and on my toes. They are always changing and wanting you to learn new things. I have learned many things about this company and how to complete different tasks in different areas of the store in a timely manner
good,like the people i work for and with. it was fun learning how to scan the boxes to see which ones would go on the floor and what wouldnt go
good,"After a while the job gets repetitive and is no longer challenging intellectually. I got bored and it became mundane weekly chores. Wonderful benefits and salary, I loved my coworkers and always had a good time at work. Only complaint I had was having to work holidays, but it's expected because it's retail."
good,I woke up at four in the morning to unload trucks and stock the floor before the store opened at eight. After stocking and unloading I would move to the backroom where I would log all the extra items that came on the truck.
good,"Working at target is where i first learned how to work a cash register. i learned how to spot counterfeit money/checks and how to analyze customers.Typically i could tell if someone was coming to my register to try to do a scam and once detected i knew how to handle the situation. My co-workers in target where like family even the managers. We got along very well and even in the times of disagreement we handled the situation respectively. The managers pushed us to do better and strive to get red cards. We were rewarded by recognition, gift cards, and even free lunches."
good,Come into work at 10pm and unload truck. Place items on pallets coresponding to their section of the store. After unloading truck unload the products and place them in their place within the store. Clean up and organize as I go.
good,"Target Canada opened 2 years ago in Kamloops.  I was with the store from opening, initially in the Back Room, becoming a Guest Service Agent after 6 months. "
good,"Target Pharmacy was a busy, fast-paced workplace. Typical day at work required a lot of multitasking. It consisted of typing Rx's, filling them, drug inventory, insurance phone calls, customer service, cash register, counseling guests, etc. The coworkers and management were always friendly and everybody worked together well. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers. People can get easily irritated when it comes to their medications. Upset customer can be difficult to deal with. However, if you manage to turn angry customer into happy and satisfied one, when you hear ""thank you so much for your help"", that is the greatest reward."
good,"As a graduate of Institute of Integrative Nutrition, my goal is to help everyone take back control of their health and heal themselves naturally through holistic nutrition."
good,Target had a good team culture that promoted safety and stability. The wages were fair but the pay promotions were small. Management was attentive and happy to help. Coworkers were close-nit and very supportive. I enjoyed having the ability to assist other departments and have the ability to cross-train. However morning truck unloads often were stressful and an absent tam member could easily leave us understaffed.
good,Work at a fast pace and learned a lot of new skills.We had great teamwork. There were allot of heavy lifting involved. You have to make your goals everyday.
good,I like the safe work environment that Target had created. I had also liked how the employees were always there to help me out when ever I got stuck on something that i didn't know about the job.
good,"- A typical day either started at 6 or 7 AM, and I worked with a team of 2 other ladies whom assisted in cleaning mostly residential houses and a few industrial buildings. "
good,"A typical day consisted of; setting up items for purchase orders, performing maintenance on purchase orders, on-boarding new import vendors, working with merchants and oversea teams to meet purchase order due dates."
good,"will work anywhere from 10-12/day "
good,"As a former customer service representative I have learned that the customer always comes first.  My job entailed accommodating the needs of customers and going the extra mile to ensure they left happy and satisfied.  As a cashier, I learned to work in a fast paced environment.  Working on the sales floor I have helped numerous customers throughout the day while stocking the shelves.  Throughout all my positions at Target, I have learned to stay calm and organized in a fast paced environment, and that the customer always comes first."
good,"For working at Target, I am glad I had previous retail experience because it was a sink or swim environment. They expected a lot from their employees and there was a push to achieve a lot in a single day. But, overall I really enjoyed the work environment."
good,"On a typical day, I get my essential needs such as , walkie and an equipment gun. I find out who the leader in charge(LOD) is, because its important to report to the LOD to see if there is a different task that he/she would want you to do. Usually its a no, i would go to the backroom, and see how much back stock is left from the early morning truck. Back stock means product that no longer fits on the sales floor. Before i can start on any back stock, we have a scheduled CAF time that the team and I have to complete every hour.These CAFs start at 11am and end at 5pm. Between those time CAFs are completed early where it gives us time to work on back stock. Depending on my schedule, we as a team work hard to beat expectations and complete all of back stock and make sure there is nothing on the floor and reorganize. i would have to say that the hardest part of the day would be when CAFs need to be completed in a hour but you get called from the sales floor asking for products to be pulled out of the backroom. Honestly i like a challenge because it keeps you moving and never bored. Also gives a chance for the team a chance to meet one another and have communication with any obstacles that some up."
good,I would ring on the register and some times stock the dollar section. I was trained in instocks department. I would scan the shelves for missing or low inventory send a report to the back room where they would get all that merchandise together. I would then retrieve it on a big dolly and proceed to price and put it all away. I would also get to help customers with questions or finding things in the store . Management was very professional. My co-workers were nice for the most part some people didn't stay long. the hardest part was learning how to push a hole row of carts and getting them around corners but I figured it out. The most enjoyable part was working with friendly people and learning new departments.
good,"*	Managing team and preparing testing related documents - Test Plan, Effort Estimation."
good,"start at 4am unload the truck, stock the store at a fast paced manner. get in get done and go. over the time ive learned maturity. self growth, identifying that i should always give 100% while im there, go the extra mile, pushing myself beyond whats expected of me, ive learned that ive grown in many ways since ive been there, it will be a year in February. The Management, I love The ETLs i look up to them, i try to carry myself like them, i hope to become something like them one day. the team leads are OK. there are no hard parts to the job to be i belive i became immune to the work and its nothing more than a workout i enjoy doing, i enjoy my job at target, this job has been the only job i actuallly like and wouldnt want to leave, i havent found a (2nd) job better than target so far unless there oppurtunity for more or something better comes.."
good,"Although this was a very labor-some job, I really enjoyed and appreciated my experiences there. This job heavily relied on working together as a team. The hardest part of the job was having all of the tasks timed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment and the management having an approachable feel."
good,"Great work life balance."
good,Great place to work. But schedule never stays consistent. Also mandatory to work holidays and weekends. Also only 4-8 hour shifts.
good,"Day to day, my position as an In Stocks team member was great in the beginning because I had someone to share the work load with and to learn from. My counter part was fired soon after my time began with the company and it made things very difficult. My department itself shared a manager with another department and there was hardly ever time for questions. But the store and it's various departments were managed to the T. Management took care of every employee and made it a point to go out for all the stores' team members at least once a month to show their appreciation of good work and effort. Everyone got along and knew how to perform their specific duties, everyone was open to learning other specific duties and helped other departments. Every team member's basic responsibility is Guest service, and that's the best thing I learned through my duration with Target. The company's policy of Guest Service, going above and beyond for any guest and every guest, improved my people skills all around. This policy essentially taught me to be global and to be the one who approaches, not the one to wait to be approached."
good,"This job was very fun for me, the team was amazing. A typical day for me at work was zoning, restocking re-shop, and back up cashiering throughout my shift. I don't think anything about this job is hard. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers find items. I also enjoyed working with other team members to complete job assignments ."
good,"A typical day at Target consisted of meeting new guests, and helping them with their needs as best as possible. We wanted to make sure they had great shopping experiences, and to always come back to us. My two years being at Target I learned how to provide fun, fast, and friendly customer service. I learned how to stock product to the right shelves. I also learned how to work with a team, and how to work individually. The management at Target was okay. A lot of times I would have problems because they wouldn't work around my school schedule. But other then that it was alright. They would always walk through the departments to check up on you and ask you do you need help with anything. The co-workers would do the same. They always had a smile on their face that just lit up the atmosphere with kindness. The hardest part about the job is dealing with angry, or disrespectful customers. But you have to learn how to be thick skinned and zone it out. But still must help them as best as you can. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you can come to a great place to work with a great team. And to also know that you made a customer happy by helping them find what they need."
good,"- Expected to reach goal set at end of shift"
good,"Wed is my monday get my signs and print out my report to follow, get the signs ready for sat night, Make sure i have enough people and start my job about 10:00pm, put up all the signs make sure my team is done by 7:00 am and put up 7x11 signs. 8:30 go home."
good,Typical day would start around 5/6 a.m. We would unload the truck and stock shelves until everything was complete.
good,"Typically, I would clock in and start working on carts, which included but was not limited to: bringing them into the store, removing trash, removing broken carts and writing up work order forms, and handing them off to guests and providing great service for the guests as soon as they enter the store. I also check and clean the restrooms on an hourly schedule, would stock and restock spill stations, as well as provide back ups for cash register and provide carryout assistance for the guests. I learned how to adapt and help customers of many different backgrounds and experiences. I learned how to push freight and manage backstock, conduct aspects of inventory, and how to work as a team player to accomplish goals. The management was usually good, but there was often quick turnaround. This made it hard to build trust and a great rapport between the managers and team members. Overall, management preached the team mentality and helped cultivate it and did it in a respectful manner. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the ever-changing weather of Indiana. I would have to work in snow, rain, heat, among other things. The most enjoyable part was the team mentality and camaraderie that would build up among the team members and guests."
good,Great place to work at everything was ran in a very organized manner. Management was great and was willing to help during projects. Co-workers were great as well very diverse and easy going environment.
good,"Fun place to work at."
good,"Target is the best employer I've had so far. The work gets monotonous if you never cross-train (so I suggest you cross train for multiple departments and it won't get boring). Management at my  location (Port Saint Lucie, FL) is fine to me. I feel like they are great examples of what Target expects and promotes to employees and guests. My immediate co-workers are easy to get along with and can be helpful when I need it. My coworkers in general are always able to answer question that I may not know the answer to or can assist me with heavy lifting or tedious projects. The hardest part of the job is, quite frankly, not liking it. Sometimes the workload gets heavy, but with help from others and the vibe of the company just makes everything flow the way it should and things get done. My favorite is the guest service part of the job. Considering I work in the clothing department, I like helping guests find something extra professional for work or just a cute sundress for a date that they won't have to break the bank to buy. The coworkers and managers alike have great personalities and I ended up making a few new friends. Target's vibe is honest because although it's part of the job, you end up coming to work wanting to be that employee that does the job right and still can enjoy it and have fun."
good,"At Target Distribution I Loaded Truck Trailers & also loaded pallets. I learned how to work at a fast pace environment and how to stock trailers correctly. Are management was good, they worked hand and hand with the employees if there was any problems ect. The hardest part of the job was being able to keep up the pace for 12 hours every night but after a while you get use to it. The best part of the job was that my co-workers would help if i need it and that we worked as a team to get the job done."
good,"I started as a cashier and then accepted a guest services positions.  I would assist customer with generic cashier duties and help clean up and stock the cashier aisles.  I would also assist in stocking shelves after store hours.  As guest service associate, I would assist with customer issues/complaints, returns, credits, as well as acquisition of store credit cards.  It was a great job for me as I was still a full-time college student at the time of my employment at this company."
good,"Target is a great place to work, you feel like part of a team, the management is friendly and upbeat and understanding. The guests always come first which is a great example to give to people who may be working there as a first job. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, it's definitely a family environment kind of feel."
good,Such a great company to work for. Hours are great and the employees are fun to be around.
good,I only worked as needed but it was great. The pharmacy was well staffed and the work flow decreased the stress level.
good,times would get rough when other team members call in especially on truck days I've learned to operate a forklift automatic pallet jacks and pallet jacks also the wave some management were better than others some of them don't communicate with you on the activity that you are supposed to get done my co workers were very helpful the hardest part of the job was being in the freezer and cooler because it was only me the most enjoyable part of the job was being friendly we all had to be friendly to each other so there was a lot of laughter in the air
good,"Target is open to flexible work arrangements that help balance work and life.  Management is great, they are their to support your career goals.  Fast, Fun and Friendly best summarizes Target."
good,"check my schedule today I going work on the floors. At the area the clothes women. There I fix the clotes, look neat, but today we have to many costumers  I going the cashier i like the cashier  and  if is necesary my co-workers help me and me too. I like when I can to help to costumers whith  the items."
good,"target is an excellent comapny to work for. Within target there are plenty of growth opportunities. Like any other job it can become a bit overwhelming at times but nothing that an employee cant over come. I learned excellent communication skills, how to solve problems without going to a manager for help, etc. I can say i've learned and mastered my job."
good,"Customer focus is a huge deal with this company. Training is brief but mostly OJT is what it takes for things to click anyway.  Advancement is performance based, upper management requires B.A. degree"
good,What i learned most is how to work alone without supervision. This job taught me to be independent.
good,"i was a cashier. i love that job. i like working with people. i receive cash, checks, or credit cards for purchase items in the store."
good,"I started in seasonal, we had fun stocking and helping customer's.  I worked with and made wonderful friends."
good,Good opportunity for advancement.  Friendly working environment. Benefits were good. Movement between departments was encouraged for job growth.
good,"I have worked for Target for the past 5 years and I must say the best part working at Target is the Fast, Fun, and Friendly culture that is prominent in all the team members working at my location. The benefits that Target provides are substantial and the job wasn't too hard to manage with my lifestyle. Scheduling was always flexible and I always seem to manage to find coverage whenever I needed it (when letting people know in advance). The biggest issue that I have had at Target is that after becoming a Pharmacy Technician there was no opportunity for advancement because, being a specialist the only place to move up to would be a Pharmacy Technician Team Lead in which there were no spots available for the past 20 years."
good,"Work starts getting the job description for that night, then some warm up. I learned how to set up the store shelves, stock the merchandise, how to bail cardboard, disposal equipment, power pallet jack, facing merchandise, facing products."
good,"Typical day of work started with getting to the time clock at 4 in the morning. I would say hello to my team members and talk about the previous day after work. We would then organize the merchandise on the shelves until the truck unloaders needed us in the back. We would get to the back and start taking pallets off the line and throw our boxes to their proper aisles. After the truck would be finished we started moving as a wave and stocking merchandise until our shift was over. I learned how to talk to customers and help them with whatever they needed, learned how to work with PDAs, back stock, work with fresh foods, and cashiering. The management there was excellent, they were all so kind and helped me with whatever questions I had brought to them and dealt with negativity in the workplace. All my co workers there were not only co workers, but also my friends, we would always work as a team to get the job done fast and 100% accurate. The hardest part of the job was waking up at 3am and trying to get ready for the job at hand but the most enjoyable part of my job was the experiences I learned and the friends I've made."
good,i worked at the target in valley stream nyc and it was pretty busy when i was there. i worked insoftlines which is basically folding clothes they also teach you how to use the cash register so you can be a backup cashier (it seemed that all newbies had to be backups) One section i hated is Lingere ActiveWear and socks it was ALWAYS a mess there. Some of the coworkers are very lazy and others are very hard working. i picked up hours from everywhere so i didnt really have a social life. the managers are like managers lol hard on you sometimes cool the other times. They pay associates $9 an hour and the breaks are annoyingly short. If you work under 5hrs you only get one 15min break OR if you work over 5hrs you get a 15min break then a 45min lunch then a 15min break. no real benefits or healthcare for the associates not sure about managers though.
good,Had a great team. Really enjoyed my coworkers and managers.
good,Everyday is a joy to work with at store. I get to interact with our guest helping them to find the items they need. I spend my time working on signage. Putting up company issued signs. Making orders for supplies. 
good,"Work went by fast, the co workers where friendly. I learned a lot about customer service. I never had to be afraid to ask questions. "
good,I enjoyed this job. My co workers were great to work with. Great customer service. There were a few turks but I made thru the seasonal position. 
good,"Very Friendly and Helpful and most important Professional and Positive Attitude to Employees and Customers, fast and self oriented on tasks and skills as far as learning self starter, assist others as in employees and customer as best as I can, well organized and can multitask at varies skills and tasks, enjoy meeting people i am very friendly and positive at what tasks I may encounter."
good,"Typical day at work I come in either assigned to the service desk or as a cashier. I greet each guest with a smile and continue to have a conversation with them. Our goal is to be ""fast, fun, and friendly,"" and that we do give. I've learned to be more confident with my sales because every day we are set a goal of target cards to be sold. Management is organized and my co-workers are like family to me. The hardest part of my job would be the few angry customers with complaints.The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers that come in and leave happy because I did my job correctly."
good,"I have worked at Target for the past six years, honing skills in numerous capacities.  I have worked in multiple different departments and have acquired skills to help me develop in the future.  "
good,"I was lucky enough to spend a lot of time learning what the HR Team does at Target. They are very involved with every level of management, something I admire about the company. I learned everything from developing the schedules, to terminating an employee, to handling funeral pay. The hardest part of this job was seeing so many seasonal team members come and go, this is because the best part of the job is getting to know the team members on a one-to-one basis."
good,During my time at Target I was promoted on three occasions. I started as the food service attendant then became the cashier and eventually I was the sales floor attendant. My job duties changed daily which was not a difficult task because training was accurate and consistent. My manager was understanding and knowledgable. The most enjoyable part of my job was the job rotation.
good,If I had not gone through some medical problems I would still be working here. So many coworkers who show they care and care about their employees and customers. Such a friendly and amazing environment to be around. The management is very understanding and care for their employees!!
good,"I was a seasonal worker, but the job is great if your just starting out."
good,Target is a very productive and managerial place to work with wonderful people who exercise their abilities in making sure the said goals are met...
good,"Depending on your work hours and specific job you will deal with customer service, zoning, stocking shelves and normal department store employee activities"
good,My job is the same everyday. Whatever items come off the truck I put them away.
good,I enjoyed the organization of the company.
good,"Early mornings, late nights and sometimes weekends. The hardest part was the deployments."
good,My typical day at work was full of fun. I learned how to handle the guest in a timely manner and make sure they are satisfied with their purchases. The management was wonderful and so were my co workers. The hardest part of my job was trying to get the customers to apply for Target gift cards. The most enjoyable part was working in Guest Services and doing returns.
good,"Target pharmacy is a fast fun place to work that is for sure!! The opportunity for advancement is based on who you know, not what you can do. That is what I have observed after 5 years of dedicated, hard working employment for them. They will hire just about anyone and put them to work. Overall its a decent place to get a paycheck but dont expect much else fromt them."
good,"Target is a very friendly place between team members. The managment staff is always willing to help out with any concerns. Target definitely work with availabity changes especially if the team member is a student or have another job. The hardest part of the job is trying to get assigments done on time with very little staff, or help costumers when there is another guest waiting as well. The most enjoyable part is being recognized for an excellent job and get rewarded with free gift cards or small treats."
good,"Fun place to work, nice hours,employees are friendly. Good discounts."
good,My work day here was always a good and funny one i enjoyed my co-workers and management. Here i learned how to work in a team and appreciate my workplace to me the hardest part of this job was that i had to learn temperatures and how to keep this at the right settings. The most enjoyable part of this job was i made great friends and always had a good time while i was working here.
good,The hardest part of the job were the hours. They were too early if you had children.
good,"A typical day at work, I would be standing at the cash register greeting customers as they come in, ring up their sales, ask if they found everything alright, small talk. If the store is slow, close to 9-10:00pm, I would walk around the store making sure the shelves look nice and making sure the store is clean and there is no garbage on the floor. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a difficult problem, for example, if the cash register crashes while I'm in the middle of a sale, but I just get help and they show me what to do next time it happens. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the other employees and co-workers."
good,The starbucks located in target is very fast paced. if you cant keep up then you will find yourself failing. you develop a relationship with everyday customers.
good,"learn new things very day, is a fun place to work.everyone learns to work as a team."
good,"long hours, great team even though we had to be there at 4 am till 2 everybody was in good moods, i worked in electronics learned a-lot about cameras and computers, had to know latest gadgets,movies and books. the hardest part was getting up at 4am every morning but it was fun i got to work a bunch of funny people."
good,"Target is very fast pace , it is a great place to work great friendly customer,consistent mangement excellent store to work for ."
good,The managers always made things fun but at the same time made sure the work got done.
good,Worked with guest
good,Target has the ups and downs like every company. A huge positive that I love about the company is the relationships that you make there. Everyone becomes like family. A downside is the communication is not great.
good,"Management here was amazing! Easy to get along with co- workers, worked with cctv servailence cameras"
good,"Great work area,was my first job and I couldent wish for a better opportunity,they tought me alot of traits,guest service,cart pushing,returns,food ave,stocking,electronics and much more etc."
good,Learned very much from this company; was able to progress for a seasonal employee to a sales floor lead.
good,"I am a Team Leader at Target I run the front end , I am in charge of all the cashiers, guest service and target cafe."
good,"Fast paced, productive, fun employment. Learned many leadership skills through training offered. Management was eager to meet training needs. Hardest part of job was the lifting, which was sometimes heavy. Most enjoyable part of job was meeting all the diverse persons on staff and through work."
good,"I enjoyed working there but, unfortunately the pharmacy went out of business unexpectedly."
good,"Company valued their employees, The store was always well stocked and customers were pleased enough to leave reviews. If a certain area in the store was struggling, the store would help and look out for one another."
good,This was a very fun job to be at! I loved communicating with the customers and helping them if it were needed.
good,Spent about 23 years in multiple roles. Learned many skills and  had a wonderful time while there.  Collections presented some challenges but overall it was a great place to work.
good,very good work life balance with flexible timing and free food everyday. worked on different project and updated technologies and I feel it has very good Coordination within the team
good,"Target looks out for me the best that they can. They work around my schedule, and pay me well. They're very understanding of my mental health issues and support me."
good,I only worked at Target as a seasonal employee but throughout my time being there I had a great experience with my coworkers and customers. I would recommend this job to those who are able to work great with others and have a good attitude.
good,They treat you well there. Compensation is fairly good compared to other retailers. I was on the front end of the store and often got bored. I often asked to help in other areas of the store to help the time pass.
good,Its Like Most Jobs And Have Its Daily Problems But Overall The Pay And Managers Are Pretty Good. The Hrs Are Shxtty But If You Work Hard And Is Willing To Learn They Will Give You The Hrs You Need
good,I enjoyed connecting more with guests and gave me a much better outlook on what customer service really means. I really enjoyed making sure that all guests were satisfied with their shopping experience and over making sure they would reflect and comprehend with the fact that they would definitely make a come back.
good,"Decent job for a department store. My starting wage was $11 and in 2 years rose to $12.50, but starting pay was allegedly going to increase to $15 eventually. Management was friendly and supportive of employees. Incentive and reward given to make ‘my device’ sales & promoting Target Redcards (credit cards). 15 minute breaks every 2 hours. Quite easy to advance (become a teamlead)"
good,"I am involved with customers making sure they find everything they need and answer questions about items.  Also work with my peers helping them with questions about their job and quidding them to items they need to find for a customer."
good,"A day a target was pretty normal , Working overnight was the best part . I learned to be more team oriented instead of doing everything myself. My manager and supervisors was supportive and motivating ."
good,Target is a great company. The same love you’ll receive as a customer you will receive as an employee! If you are looking for a fun and energetic job this is the perfect place for you!
good,"Working can often be repetitive, but there is a friendly, open, and fun culture that has developed there. At the end of the day, a nice place to work."
good,"I loved my time at Target. Very good place to work at. They were understanding when it came to education and always gave you the days you asked off. I only left due to scheduling conflicts but would recommend to anyone. I worked as a cashier and at guest services. They don't give much training in the beginning, but it's easy to learn just through experience. Only bad part was the pushiness when it came to selling Red Cards."
good,"My workday is, I clock in, I go on the walkie and ask the manager where they need me. Usually, they have me work in Hardline sales or Cashier. I usually prefer Hardline sales. We push the product, which means stuff that comes in through the truck is but on a u-boats and the u-boat goes on the salesfloor and you unload the boxes put the stuff on the shelf in the right location, After stuff is done being push we zone, and that just making sure the aisles look clean and products look presentable on the shelf. "
good,"Working at target was fun because of the way it kept you at your feet. Your work area had to be clean and tidy at all times and you, of course, couldn't forget the customers passing by, to always greet and offer a hand."
good,"We work in a fun and fast paced environment. Stocking, setting and selling Target products is what I do on the daily basis. Knowledge of guest service fundamentals and experience supporting a guest first culture across the store."
good,Great coworkers and leaders. Every department in the store helped each other out when each needed. It was a great place to work. And met some great guests and would get to see regular guests who were happy to see your smiling face at the register.
good,A typical day at target as a sales associate is just helping our guest find the items that they are looking for. Towards the end of the day thats when things get really busy when we have to put the items back and reorganize everything
good,"Everything hands on, packer,putting and sealing items into boxes. standing for 10 hours and 30 minutes. great benefits, great people, great management."
good,Target is my second job and intend for it to be my job until I graduate college. They treat you like you are wanted. Everyone is so nice and flexible with my schedule.
good,"Everyone at Target was mighty kind considering I was a 16 year old kid who had no prior experience. They were patient with me and helped me improve as a cashier and person. There was 1 team manager, a smaller lady who was rude and understanding, but everyone else was fantastic. Overall, reat experience."
good,"A typical day at work would begin by clocking in and getting necessary tools  (box-cutter, walkie-talkie). Then the manager gives assignments for the shift. Do assignment, clock in and out for a 30-minute lunch break, take two 15-minute breaks between lunch and shift start and end. Customer service isn't always easy, so being able to express frustration with coworkers instead of customers was nice. Frustration comes with the job."
good,"I loved working there ,but they layed most people off.When I fisrt start working there I was nervous, but I got the hang of it. I loved the job working in the warehouse and stocking with good people they where awesome helping me out with the job."
good,Target is a good place to work for people who are going to school or just starting off in the job world. Management doesn’t stress you too hard to get your job done but they make sure it does get done.
good,"learned you have to pace yourself and don't get to involved into what your doing , because you just never know so you expect the unexpected. You have to be prepared to stop what your doing to help a customer or help another team member when required,"
good,the only downside is they don't give overtime :( they do give 10 percent off and are very good to their employees. they also give you free food every Friday.
good,Very fast paced work space and a lot of cleaning and management could be a lot better. Best part is lunch and the worst part is the scheduling made...
good,I loved working at target i loved the guests that came into the store. I appreciated the team members that stuck together as a team. I loved the work that i had to handle which was sales associate in mens department
good,"on a normal day at target i would go upstairs and clock in and then i would make my way to the back and start packing, at target i learned how to pack boxes and how online orders work. the management was pretty good if you need to take a day off for something important they will let you. But working at target was pretty fun and a relaxing work enviroment."
good,"I enjoyed providing customer service that resulted in happy ""guests"".  It is a clean and friendly place to work.   Team members and management were always helpful.   The most difficult ;part of the job is standing on your feet for long periods of time.   I have issues with my feet so it was painful to be on my feet for very long.  They often provided food for the team on special occasions."
good,Working at target is the most greatest experience. The environment is amazing and is great for young college students and also any high school students looking for a job
good,Target was overall a great place to work. People were friendly you learned a lot about the environment. It also gives you the experience you need for different opportunities.
good,"Felt like I fit in with my coworkers, and my bosses were hard on us, but in a loving way. They always pushed us to be the best we that we could."
good,i really enjoyed my time at target. i learned to operate a cashregister. i also learned about the sales floor. overall the management was great and i enjoyed every aspect of working at target
good,This job was very communication based. I was glad that it also reflected on the workers as well. Whenever someone had a problem the team members would be willing to help.
good,"I only worked here because I was planning on quitting a terrible job and needed something quick to replace that job until I actually found something permanent. The job was okay. I was just a cashier so I would just stand there all day and wait for a customer to come. The people were nice, my manager's were really welcoming and I was trained properly and efficiently."
good,"There was plenty of room at Target to move up and/or find the job that was right for you.  I was quickly promoted to Team Lead when they saw my work ethic and talents in merchandising, cash handling, and joy of working with others."
good,"I had an overall good time in Target. There were caring people and they had nice management. Almost all the time there were plenty of different food and drinks available for employees. They had many employees so the hours was not as many as they should have been but because of school their hours was working for me. The benefits were also good. Plus everything had a reasonable price with good quality that when were combined with discount, it would have make it even more reasonable."
good,"It is a wonderful place to work, good customers, fast pace place, always something to do when it's nothing to do it's always something to do, I would recommend this to anyone"
good,Target is a great place where tou can learn everything about retail. It’s a very friendly work experience and it is very fast paced. I enjoyed working there and I enjoyed my coworkers.
good,"The most enjoyable of being a seasonal employee is that during the busiest days of Christmas Eve and Black Friday, Target pays for food for the workers so we can be at our best to assist customers. They also make sure to make everyone as comfortable as they can. They are very flexible and accommodating to people and other things."
good,"A fast paced, fun, and friendly environment with many areas to grow and start a career. A company who cares about your personal and professional life."
good,"good staff and the staff will inform you on what need to be done, what will be done, and what project that are active if they need help. when it comes down to the codes like missing child everyone is holding the communication devices. checking there areas and still get a good or great rating, and still find the missing child in under 2 minutes."
good,"Easy going, but have to be fast. It is important to be both fast and proficient at what you are doing in order to make it in this job. You must have the desired speed but also the quality of work must be good."
good,"Very enjoyable place to work. A typical day at work was running the entire front end team, in charge of all Cashiers, Guest Service Desk, Food Court and Photo Lab. All of the employees were a joy to work with. Very respectful Upper Management. The hardest part of the job was writing the reviews for employees. It was a cultural environment to work at."
good,"Empresa Agradável de trabalhar, bons benefícios, e rotina desafiadora."
good,"A typical day at work for me was helping unload the product truck, getting the boxes in the proper locations, unboxing products, placing items on the shelf, organizing the items to look neat, and keeping your work area clean and tidy."
good,Target Corporation is very good company i learnt so many things in this company .And mainly there culture was very good and they treat people as their own family.
good,"It's a great job. I love all of my coworkers and seeing the guests. This job has helped me grow in many different ways. I use to have horrible panic attacks but seance working at Target I don't have them as much any more. In fact! When I do have one, I can control myself much better. I almost never have them anymore."
good,"It's easy for the most part. A majority of the managers were decent, I learned a bit not much since cashiering is super easy and its not hard to learn about some TVs and entertainment stuff. They're pretty decent with flexibility and time management. There is always a bad egg for managers but it happens. The hardest part of the job was moving very heavy objects all the way from the back to all the way to back of the parking lot. I liked during black Friday weekend they gave you very decent food while working."
good,Target Distribution Center is a great place to work. The pay and benefits are wonderful. They provide opportunities to progress within their company and even help with your tuition.
good,Working at Ihop i started out as a hostess then became a server. I absolutely enjoyed working at my job and providing guess with exception services while they wait to enjoy their meals.
good,This job allowed me to stay financially stable and support many of my needs. This job helped me keep all the extra spare time off of my hands and limited me from doing silly things with my time
good,"The job was fun, stress was minimal. The team members felt like family. A typical day at work was enjoyable and the Guest interaction was pleasurable."
good,I worked early shift was fun cause we worked when the store was closed so can listen to music on our phones as long as we didn't cover both ears with our headphones.
good,"Security in retail means that one is not only responsible for the team as a whole but every guest that enters the store, whether that be outside perimeter or inside the facility. "
good,"I would come into work around 10pm 3-4 times a week. I knew all the girls by this time. We would put a lot of carts together in order to ensure that we were putting items away in specific areas/isles. "
good,Best job you could ask for in retail. Everyone treats each other with respect and listens to your needs. They want to work with your schedule and life and make sure you are happy at work.
good,Work days felt very long but with how active you are during the day you'll glance at your watch and realize you have 30 minutes left of your shift. I'd say my customer service skills really developed there because ever since then I'm able to remain calm at cashier. The managers were nice and fun to work with. Everyone at work managed to get along and do their jobs at the same time. I'd say the hardest part was the inability at times to find where things were. Enjoyable part was I'd say helping guests.
good,Easy to get into the rhythm and a great team environment! Not for lazy people who don't like long shifts. Daytime shift seems to do most of the work
good,Great place to learn everything about retail. Target is the best place to learn from the best and perform at your best from mentors and leaders in that field. Great working environment!
good,A typical day at work was spent running back and forth to attend guests and keep everything organized. I learned that customer experience is really important and that in order to provide them with the best you have to be able to put yourself in their shoes. MY co-workers were great! I meet a lot of people that I loved! Target was my first job in which I had the opportunity to experience having co-workers. Everyone was nice and open about everything and made it a great environment to succeed in. The hardest part of the job was when I was the only one on the floor and I had to attend phone calls and run to the baby sections to help guests find what they need and gets pulls from the back while attending guests in the fitting room during the busiest days of the week(Sunday). The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling I got when all the work was done and I know that my team and I worked hard to get it all done because that's what a team is for. One of my favorite parts was when the day was about to end and a group hadn't finished their work and we all headed to help them. This helped me bond with my co-workers and know how it feels to be part of a team.
good,its  always  busy  and its  a  fun  environment  and everyone works well as a team i would love to work in more areas and know more then i see when i am at work
good,"Every day start with unloading semi truck, open boxes pickup your supply and go to your station file up shelves. The place must be clean and very nice organize for customer for next day.All trash must be removed from working station and put in dumpster."
good,Working at target was one of the most enjoyable jobs I've ever had. I currently do not work there anymore only because I had a baby and decided not to go back. Overall it was just a great experience.
good,"The company is big and beautiful. "
good,"Target is a great place to work for anyone. According to the Target that I was located at, everyone was very friendly and helpful. Target makes it a priority to satisfy their guests and make them feel welcome."
good,Fun place to work with supportive management. Great place to develop personally and professionally. The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside by colleagues and learning from them.
good,Target is a great company to grow in and continue to develop on a personal level and a leader. They work hard to make sure you have the training and development that you need to succeed and help you along the way. There are many opportunities for growth in Target.
good,"On a typical day at Target I have learned how to use the register and to ring up costumers with great service. The management was great! They knew exactly how to communicate with each employee and treated us to meals on our breaks when it most definitely was not required. The hardest part of my job, really there isn't anything I couldn't handle. The only thing that became difficult was if and when we would get so busy that it became overwhelming which was rare. Only on Black Friday was it overwhelming, but even then it was a great experience! The most enjoyable part for me was being apart of the team and making great friends who had the same goals and intentions."
good,"Opening the store, and checking inventory. In order to make sure the records match the amount of physical product and to know what is in stock for the customers. Checking account information for AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, and pre-paid phones. Activating phone devices and showing customers how their new device works. Also, constantly growing in knowledge as new technology is released. This job was not particular hard, only that you'd work alone for hours at a time, and that there was no coverage for breaks. Thus, sacrificing sales during lunch or dinner time. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help multiple customers at once, and helping make choices that best fit their needs for their new device."
good,"I loved working at target the people were great and so were the customers and co-workers. "
good,A typical day at work is somedays a fast going place. Everyone works together as a team in every spot. These always team work.
good,"A typical day at Target, I would come in check what register I was working for the day, Check break times and other tasks that I was in charge of completing. "
good,"A typical day at work for Target Stores is fun, fast, and friendly, not to mention supportive. However, there is just one thing wrong with working there and that is to encourage guests to sign up for their Target Credit and/or Debit cards. Not a lot of people want them and the managers put a little bit too much more of an emphasis on the amount of Red Card sales over your overall abilities to work the front end as a Cashier or Guest Service Assistant. If not for that one discreprency, I see no problems with working there or for anyone who is searching for a career in Retail."
good,"great place to work, good official first job. worked at starbucks, foodave and  HR. loved them all but hr the most. good coffee, good people, good stuff,"
good,"Typical day consisted of helping customers find certain items, extensive money handling, helping customer grievances and selling store credit cards. Management was very adept with dealing with employee grievances and given helpful suggestions to make workload easier."
good,I am partially into IT/Software now and I like to go Complete IT as I am very interested. Not for more packages but to reach my passion and to show my talent in that field. Else that everything is Absolutely fine at Target Corporation.
good,"A typical day working at Target was busy but not overwhelming. Customers were friendly and nice, and I never had a hard time. Co-workers and managers were always available if I needed assistance with anything. The hardest part of my job was when the store was not busy, and I would have to stand there waiting. I like to be moving and involved, so it wasn't always great. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers walk out with a smile on their face!"
good,"Target was a very good place to work, they always worked with my schedule when dealing with taking and picking up my children from school. I was able to advance in my job, and enjoyed the people i worked with."
good,It was an overall easy job as long as you can stand for long periods of time on your feet. Management was nice and very understanding and everyone I worked with was very nice and willing to help with anything you need! The hardest part would be standing on your feet in one spot all day especially if your like me and like to constantly be doing something and moving around. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the friends I made at work.
good,"Great place to work, really employee based. However, it is a retail environment so you must be able to work late, over night, early morning."
good,I absolutely loved working in the HR department; I had the opportunity to learn about people on another level. I goy a chance to make Managerial decision; even though I was much younger than some of those I had worked with. but I loved and admired the fact that they had trusted my judgment and character. And I had wonderful bosses who stood behind my every decision so that made things move smoothly...I absolutely loved my job.
good,Target has been responsible for my growth as a leader for the past 10 years.  They have spent much time and effort developing the best leaders possible for their stores.
good,"I loved working at Target. The customers were amazing, and very friendly. The co-workers are helpful."
good,Target is a great place to work because every one is kind and always ready to help both the customer and fellow employee's. At work you would clock in and immediately begin your duties and report to your team lead with any questions or concerns. I learned a lot about helping customers and what it takes to create a fun and comfortable environment to work in. The team leads or managers were extremely helpful and kind and very easy to talk to if you every had a problem or a question. The hardest part of my job was working on Black Friday because some of the customers got a little upset when we sold out of an item they were looking for or when the lines at the register got a little slow. My favorite part of the job was working the register because then not only could I talk to the customers and ask them about their shopping experience but I was also able to help them if they were unable to find a certain item.
good,Target really helped me with my people skills and the benefits were good and the staff was cool.
good,"working with the customer and other employees, and the product knowledge"
good,a fun place to work for a limited amount of time. the managers can be a pain at times but as long as you can speak to your work and what you are doing everything should be fine. The tms are very resilient & adaptable
good,"Working at Target was very enjoyable. Management is on top of everything. not just for customers but for employees. They do put Customers and employees on top. "
good,"I enjoyed my time here, and the growth from working here. I learned all areas of the work force including overnight, backroom, sales floor, cashier, food service, customer service, and office work."
good,Great team of management. Learned core values and had great oppurtunity for advancement in the company.
good,"Conoses muy bien muchas marcas pierdes el miedo para abordar al cliente consigues la facilidad de palabra  conosi barias tiendas como bodega aurrera , comercial mexicana ,wal mart, soriana  chedrahui conosi mucha jente y trabaje muy bien con las personas que manejan la agencia lo mas dificil es que aveses son mas estrictos el personal de la tienda que ni tu gefe directo."
good,I always enjoyed going there to work. Had a lot of fun on nights.
good,working at target was an amazing experience and I learned a great deal from my time there.
good,"Working at Target Distr, Ctr was very educational for me, I learned how to do so many new things like how shipping and receiving works, how to use product scanners, labels. etc. The management was great, always there when you needed them for anything. The hardest part of this job was the fast pace you had to keep up with, the best part of this job is the benefits."
good,"Sale Associate is this type of work. Helping guest around the whole entire store, having fun with the team members getting to know each and everyone's personality and also very flexible with there hours. Working with this company was like an open-minded environment. When you talk to a guest, you always want to make sure that guest can come back with a smile there face. And to be honest I don't think there was any hardest part to the job. It was just very well-manner,understandable and team work effort.   "
good,I had fun working there the discount was averaage and the produckts offered were good. Management was understanding and sometimes easy to work with...The oppuruntity to move up and advance was there.
good,"Target was a fun experience, great chance to advance and met new people everyday. I loved providing great guest service, and the opportunity to move up the ladder in the company. "
good,It's hard to give a definite typical day at work because it can change based on what day it is. Depending on how you prioritize your day it can be very smooth or extremely hectic. Pay is quite good in comparison to other retailers. As a manager though you may get bogged down with work because scheduling for coverage is very light. Overall though it's a great company to kick start your career and the job is certainly what you make of it. 
good,Target Corporation will truely invest in your development and it is a great place to work.
good,The company is a work place that values your right and desires to attend school and work other jobs if you are a part time employee.
good,Working for target is a great learning experience interacting with the guest and showing them you care is an important part of my job. I like working here and the other employees are great.
good,it was overnight we would try to make so it wasnt too quiet and boring or we would be sleep so we'd play certain games and get through the night
good,"Target has taught me a lot about working sufficiently and productively. My co-workers have always been there to help me and they are such amazing friends. On a typical day I go to work then begin at the register. I stand for two hours ringing up peoples items then going on my beak. Once in a while I will get to work in the clothing or electronics if I'm lucky. The hardest part of this job is when you have to stand there for ever when you work eight hours ringing up the large purchases. The most enjoyable part is break time, when you can sit with your friends and enjoy each others company for the time being."
good,"It is not what you would call ""easy"" work, but it isn't difficult. You show up, do what they tell you to do, and there are no issues. Working retail isn't as bad as everyone assumes. You may get the occasional unruly guest, but it's what you make of the situation."
good,Target is one of the best companies I have worked for. They are kind and understanding to their team members. If you have a problem they find a solution to it instead of blaming you. The team truly cares about one another and helping the guest. It is truly a family-like atmosphere.
good,"As a former employee of Target I would like to say one thing; I will always value my time there as a manager. The greatest part of the job was the people who worked there as well as the guests who shopped there daily. It was a great feeling everyday to know I was helping people either to learn their job, find products while shopping, or helping a person grow within the company. That was the greatest part of my job, knowing your teachings grew a person into a better, more efficient leader. No day was the same, everyday was an experience, and you never who was going to visit your store which day, celebrity or a regular which made it an adventure. I love customer service and helping others so my job was easy, that's what made me a great leader whom every team member wanted to work for. My teams were always available and eager to learn and do more than our goals. Target was an experience I will never forget, I miss it."
good,"Working As An Team Member For Target Can Be Very Fun, I Actually Love The Company."
good,Very busy
good,The whole store works together as a team to keep the store clean and looking great. Managers and team members get along well and communicate what they need done.
good,a really good work expierence. they make sure they can work with you and your schedule easy to learn and the people are great its a great stepping stole
good,The best thing about the job was the hours they had to work. It was only 3 days a week and 11 hour shifts. It was nice to have 4 days off work and make the same amount as working all week.
good,es un trabajo en su mayoria duro pero sobre todo con comunicacion entre  todos
good,"Customer service is great prides itself on customer success, gives plenty of hours to work, I didn’t like that my schedule was based off when they felt I should be available"
good,dommage que la compagnie a décidé de fermer ces portes.
good,"This was my first job and it was an amazing experience . I got complimented a lot by both customers and bosses about my positive attitude . I am a people’s person and l love to help others .  I also am a hard , good , fast worker."
good,Getting to know your coworkers make your days more fun. Everyday feels much more nice when you have someone to talk to at work. Being a loner will make your days torturous.
good,"This was a great job, but when we received our new store director a lot of things changed and many people did not like it, to the point of quitting. I do not believe he treated team members fairly."
good,The customers was so happy because of team work we respect each other and the manager inspired long time after that drove taxi for ten years my interest now whole foods I would be grateful if you would give me a chance.
good,Loved this job it was a very easy and learnable job. You would learn to talk to a lot of people. New problems and be curious very safe job. Meet a lot of people
good,Great place to work if you are a people person! Never a dull moment. Keeps you on your feet.As Asset Protection I was on my feet the majority of my shift
good,A typical day at work consists of being in an isle with pallets of stock to be replenished into that area. When done if able move on to another section and start to replenish. Management was very nice. There was no real hard part to the job because everything was self explanatory. The job was fairly easy in all.
good,"I worked part time evening shifts, I would come in about 5pm and would leave about 11pm-12am. I worked in a group but we all had different tasks to perform. Very fun place to work, was able to dress up for holidays and major events."
good,The best thing about working at target all the benefits. They really cared about you around the holidays. They made sure all employees were well dressed and fed and just brought up the target spirit.
good,"One of the great things about Target is their weekend hours, you can either do 3 12hr weekend days or 4 10 hour weekdays. Because I have a toddler, I went for the overnight weekends(6pm-6am Saturday, Sunday & Monday) for the higher rate, though the weekday option might be better for those with school-age children. They have an advanced weekend rate though and overnights pay $1 more, so if you are behind on bills or have a baby on the way the overnight weekends are your best bet. The other thing I love? The lunch and break are paid, though the fact that there is only one 45 minute lunch and one 15 minute break makes the night seem about 12 times more exhausting."
good,"One of my favorite places to work at.  Very organized company and reliable.  Very set on their goals. They take care of their employees. They feed us, gave us life advisors and made sure to get their employees trained in doing thing in an organized fashion. The overall experience of working there was nice."
good,All staff is caring and ready to help anyone with questions. Everyone is always productive and kind. To be able to be part of the team has helped me a lot with my fast pace and quick learning skills.
good,"Amazing work culture, free lunch, very friendly teams and colleagues, cabs to and fro and only day shift.Work life balance Free lunch and transport."
good,Target I can say is one of the most  organize companies I’ve ever worked for. And I enjoyed every single day I worked there the pay was good and the employees were very nice.
good,"I was only a seasonal associate but in the short time I was there I was impressed at how they ran things. Great communication, good service to the customers and are above all attentive to detail. I would work for these guys anytime"
good,great place to work the people are friendly and always try to work with your schedule to make sure you can get your hours. It was fun working there for the time.
good,"Awesome people, I wouldn’t ask for better people they help me through everything, every time I was asking questions those were answered immediately I learned a lot with them."
good,The management is amazing and you get treated with respect. The pay is amazing and all the team members are super kind and respectful. What you get in return for working at Target is why I applied
good,i enjoyed my job at target. I wish i could have stayed there but i moved to another state. the environment and the people i worked with was loving . Target is better than walmart
good,"Good work ethic, great experiences. I had great staff. Would recommend anyone to work with them. Had flexibility and caring management.  Everything ran smoothly with great energy."
good,"Really great place to work, times goes by fast and depending on the hours you work, you get 3 breaks which really helps because it is a job where you stand 8-9 hours constantly. Really great job 11/10 recommend."
good,"Report to work. Unload trailer by 6 am shelve products until 11 am. Help other team members if area isn't finished, or help guest locate items."
good,"Target is a sharp store. Here I learned how to stock, cashier, zone and performed instocks procedures for the store."
good,"Target can be stressful at times, the staff is so amazing and understanding, we get some pretty good guess also. they do accommodate me as a employee so much also the guest in my opinion."
good,"Still to this day i do not understand why i did not get pick to work for the company. They even told me that there were a lot of employees that loved the way a worked. However, the told me their was a time when it was snowing; and i did not have a way home i had to ask one of my fellow co-worker if they could give me a ride home. In from that incident the let me go cause they fell that transportation  would be a problem in the future. this reason i felt that it was unfair cause people get jobs so that they can build for myself. I started off with nothing, therefore i needed that job so that i could get me a car."
good,"I enjoyed working with my manager at Woodbury, MN for 5 years, learned a lot from him. The staff technicians were very nice & helpful. The hardest part of the job is telling a customer their medication not covered."
good,Target was a good job I just wish they let you advance within the store. I worked there almost 3 years and they didn't let me train in the pharmacy and gave the job to someone that was there less than a year.
good,It was great for me to get a chance to go and find another place I could work and have a great relationship with the employees at target and get to the manager.
good,Nice workplace and fun. The managers are hands on and the coworkers who trained me are patient and easy to work with. I felt welcomed and i had the best experience since this is my first job in US. I learned a lot.

good,love the employees there. very wise and always  willing to help. you will be updated throughout the day about what the goal and how that goal will be achieved
good,"working at target was a great experience, it taught me how to be independent and accomplish many things on my own. it taught me how to multi-task and how to work ahead."
good,"If I was a cashier, I would go on register and take guests and always greet them. I'd talk about how their day goes and inform them about our sales promotions or our red cards. We have daily goals and if we reach it, then we are rewarded with free Starbucks. If I'm not a cashier, then I'd be cart attending. My typical work day would be to push carts, check the restroom to make sure it's clean. Following that, I would collect the garbage and get baskets that are left in the check lanes. Sometimes, I would get called to help guests with a carry out."
good,it was a fun fast paced place to work and I miss working there great peoplegreat customers great experience hopefully I can get a job back there one day
good,Loved working for target.Great system and work opportunity.The pay is pretty good I hated getting paid bi weekly.Benefits are pretty good.Target has programs where you recieve discounts with certain companies.loved that.
good,Working at Target was a great experience they get you involved in so many different areas so you'll be able to help out no matter where you are in the store.
good,I was the youngest around my team everyone looked out for me and helped me the best way possible to make me a good worker.
good,"Working at Target was great, I would work from 3pm to 10pm everyday after school. My typical work day would be to clock in get the go backs from the front and head to my department. Start my day checking the lockup items."
good,"Over all target have fixable hours that's fix in my schedule."
good,Working overnight was the hardest part of this job. Adapting to a sleep pattern. But once I got past that the job was good. There was a physical component to it that was rewarding. It was like a gym membership that you get paid for. The management team was pretty much flawless in my experience. They left you alone as long as you got you work done. They always gave feedback about your job performance which I greatly appreciated.
good,this is actually the company that taught me and gave me my first forklift experience. the hours were great the management was nice. the best part about it I had determinations to be the best. so I worked with best and I ask all the questions
good,"Pulling a lot of cartons in a 12hr shift."
good,"A typical day at Target consisted of me, signing out my keys to start work. As soon as I had grabbed my keys I would take an hour to make sure re-shop was done. I would make sure that no end-caps in my sections were expiring or empty If they were empty then I would restock the shelves and if we were out of the product then I would communicate with my manager and provide ideas and products that could be used to restock the empty shelves. My team consisted of four people and we all had a great and healthy relationships and were dependable. My team worked hard and won Accessory Attachment Rate challenge in the entire district. This challenge consisted of each store selling the most Attachments with their products and my team came first in the entire district. Furthermore, the hardest part of my job was working long hours, I would work a minimum of 8 hours a day and over 35 hours a week to ensure that the work was done and my section was presentable. The most enjoyable part of my job was the environment, it would constantly push you towards success and knowledge. I would constantly get great feedback from my supervisors and customers regarding their experience in target with me and my team."
good,"When you own a business, you learn to work hard and I do no matter what task may lay ahead. Always on time, never late to work. I learned the meaning of hard work, to be dependable always there. Wherever I've worked or work. I have never been late or not to work unless I'am really ill. "
good,Dealing with a lot of questions from customers. Making sure all departments were clean and presentable. Working with co workers to help each others with question from customers. Lending a hand when needed. What i enjoyed the most was holidays feast yum.
good,This place was a great opportunity to work at. The managers were great and you can have a chance to move up in the company.
good,I learned to do plan-o-grams also being a cashier and pta.My co-workers was very helpful when I needed them.Well I never had a hard time at work because I was always a peoples person and I get along with anyone. The most I enjoyed on the job was meeting new people plus showing people things they cant find and seeing a smile on their faces
good,a typical day at work with me is coming in on time every day doing whats asked by my boss. willing to learn new things at the work place. working hard so that management knows that i'm a hard worker all was staying happy with my co-workers.a hard part of a job is when you get a customer or co-worker that is not very happy with whats going on for the day but you deal with it the best way you can with out getting upset. the most enjoyable thing about a job is when everybody is happy and doing there job and when management comes in with fun this to do for the day and when u can make a customer happy .
good,Great company to work for. Great staff all the way from management to team members.
good,Excellent to learn and grow. There is nothing further that I wish to disclose.
good,"Get place to work, many developmental opportunities with a strong focus on team and though leadership."
good,"Working at target it was a fast and safe environment to be working. Time went fast and I provided fast and friendly customer service there. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the customers was happy whenever they needed anything or asked any questions, and making sure they where happy and satisfied when they left our store."
good,They had no no respect  or communicattion thry treated  there  employees  like trash they mafe people feel lower than arr its very unhealthy  work place
good,"I had a good 3 years at target , I’m looking for development and advancement towards management & target Hilo was over staffed and had no room to develop ."
good,It was a okay job experience. I wouldn’t go back to work there thought if I am being honest. But I did learn some good working skills while I was employed there.
good,Got treated less then a worker mangement was poor. It was a seasonal job just to make extra money. i wouldn't recommend as a full-time job. I don't know how it is know but when I worked there a lot of people left.
good,"You learn to work as a team, and always have fun while you work. Great Job!"
good,A typical day at work was productive and nice
good,"right job wrong time, I was too busy with college and it was unfair of me to apply for the job when I did because I had a really bad experience because of other things going on in life do my opinion of this job would be biased base on the other things I was experiencing."
good,"The atmosphere was full of cliques. The store manager has favorite. If someone spoke out about his unprofessional behavior or did something he didn't like there hours were cut. The store manager also has a tendency to have one on one religion conversation behind closed doors which is also very unprofessional, especially in regards to the female staff."
good,Allthough target strives for inclusivity it strives for that on a very surface level and I personally feel as though the amount I work I did there I should have been paid more for.
good,I work in thw back room n its a MESSSSSS. No emergancy exitting if a firw were to occur at most time both hallway exits are blocked. And the leads see it and do nothing.  It is terrible working conditions but wveryone there is extremely friendly and understanding
good,the job wasn't a fun place to work at. the managers was unprofessional and really didn't know what they were doing. but the job did help me take care of certain bills
good,"overall really nice place to work. Days go by really fast when busy, and really slow when  not. Friendly co-workers, nice atmosphere and really great."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at target, friendly employees, good management, and good scheduling."
good,"It's your typical retail job. There's nothing too hard about working there. I did my job and helped my customers as much as I possibly could, I even helped a customer to pick out a few outfits for a little girl."
good,Most stressful environment i have ever been it. Get punished for guests yelling at you. Years of service and knowledge mean thing to anyone. Get treated like less than when you're the same level coworkers.
good,They really push for you to sell red cards to customers. In my experience I’ve been shorted on hours but on my “off” days I would get called all the time to come in. Could use better management.
good,"I assist or cash out the customers that come to the store, I cash them out, and I service desk if needed. I am a cashier."
good,"Target is a place for young kids going through college, inside the store there isn't many chances to move up in the company. With little pay its hard to manage personal life."
good,It is like any job it has its pros and cons. You take everyday as it comes and try and do the best you can with what you have. You make the day what it is no matter what management has or does that day.
good,"Good place to work part-time."
good,"I appreciate target for the basic experience, it really did come in handy. As far as making this an actual career it's a pass for me. I never really been a fan of working retail but it was a fun experience!"
good,"The pay was ok, but I felt my manager took advantage of her power and her employees, and singled out a lot of employees. I worked the early morning shift before the store opens or upper management arrived. (4a-9a) In my opinion the job was not worth it."
good,i really like my managers at the pharmacy. they were very patient and taught me everything i knew. very busy environment but behind the counter we had a system of organization which helped
good,"Very little room for advancement, unless you were a ""favorite""."
good,"Target claims to be a Fast, Fun, and Friendly environment. The company as a whole it a great company to work for but the store in Nampa, ID cares nothing for it's employees. The Management staff have removed any team leadership with longevity. The morale of the store is in the gutter and employees are afraid for their jobs."
good,not the best work experience  there really was not a whole lot of training and i was put out on the floor with little or no training and with me being the manager there was nothing i could do when workers werent doing there job
good,"I love Target overall, but I do not like the target I work at. The managers are not well balanced. They make promises that they do not keep. If my specific target were to change, I would stay."
good,"Target is a great place to work for.  Unfortunately They seem to think that the lower level managment team does not matter. If my boss was a more   Compassionate And understanding person maybe I would still be there. Target does really take the time to place mangement in the right  position, that will allow that person to be  successful. It’s more along the lines of tag your it kind of placement."
good,I am a hard worker and the culture is laid back. If the task gets done okay and if it does not get done okay. Now sense of urgency when it comes to their guest.
good,Liked working there.Meeting new people. I worked durimg Christmas time very busy. I like to stay busy makes the time go by faster and getting things done..cashier training restocking shelves ..cleaning..made new friends..and also getting discounts on certain items.
good,Even if you did your job a manager would still yell at you because customers would come in and mess up the tables. And you always had to smile sorry if your having a bad day no choice.
good,"I actually love Target as a company. They care for their employees. They are willing to work with student schedules. Also, have an internship program for buisness students"
good,"As a company, Target is great and sales great quality items. As an employer they are not as great. The hours, pay and benefits for the employers are not that great. the advancement to move up in the company are slim to none in the company, unless you know someone that can pull you to the top. The raises are pennies whenever they feel like you deserve one. They want you to work multiple shifts with multiple tasks in multiple departments for bare minimum pay. The benefits are only offered to full-time employees and they only hire part-time employees. They only hire part-time so they can still work you full-time shifts and weekly hours without having to increase your pay or offer you the benefits."
good,"Great company to work for, one of the best I've ever worked for. To many management changes, not all being good ones . Fair pay, flexible with scheduling issues for the most part."
good,Overall the job descriptions were on point. They were a wonderful team to work for. I never had any problems with anyone. Everyone was always available to help.
good,fun work with my flow team member and busy. I learned a lot about a different system same store different city. I worked Avon and North Olmsted Target.
good,Standing and walking around on concrete is part of the deal and I made it through my shift but it can take a toll on your body. Management here also lacked in communication.
good,I love target compared to Walmart!! You get the bang for your buck! Cartwheel is awesome also!!! I enjoy their clearance section and also the ethnic hair products
good,Working at target was okay. Didn't learn much on the job but it was fast paced. Management is still left questionable and my coworkers were okay. Working at a fast pace was the hardest part of the job. The best  part of the job  I really can't say. It was a job.
good,My typical day would be to come in and set my area up to store standards and unpack boxes that came off the truck while having great guest services possible.
good,it was ok working for target until the layoffs happened in the beginning of the year.
good,I love the time I was there its a fast raced place. just stay away from the problems then you will be fine.
good,Being a Cashier was really easy. I never had any problems with workers nor costumers. Everyone was friendly and easy to talk to.
good,Target is a ok company to work for. I don’t feel like it’s for a person/s that’s looking for a substantial amount per hour but overall it was a decent experience.
good,I unloaded truck and stock shelves for Halloween til Valentine's Day...worked from 2am til 12pm give or take...Christmas time worked more got paid higher overtime or pay rate for it...
good,Overall the job was decent. The work became too stressful and they weren’t accepting that I’m still in high school (scheduling wise). The management was poor and I started feeling unwelcome.
good,Its a good job but it really depends on the people that work around you and  how they make it for you but its a good job and your personality im verry friendly so it was really good for me
good,Target was a temporary job for me so i can not say a lot about target.I worked third shift and had to stay over extra due to no help. Was okay for a second job if needed
good,Target was a fast place environment with many opportunities to advance if you stay there long enough but the problem was that they didn’t know if I not benefits are paid the most
good,"i worked here briefly following in my older sisters footsteps as a customer service rep, part time cashier, and cart retriever. i was very young and used this job to fund my adolescent lifestyle. i enjoyed the upset in responsibility and working with older non family members to resolve problems for random individuals throughout the day. the culture was a very laid back one for a high school kid going to college. There was no intention for advancement and therefore was not determined to exceed expectations. However, i learned valuable lessons on how to work within a team, and also represent a large corporations value through my everyday demeanor and problem solving situations."
good,"I would recommend people to work at target. For those who are interested in working there yes apply. If you are not interested don't apply. But everyone and the managers were awesome.  Customers were great. It was a stress free place to work at. The only thing that got me upset is that when i went to work a manager told me that my seasonal time finish, i worked there for 10 months.  I was there on time, never called in, i worked on my days off. If they needed me to stay i would stay. I was told that they were going to keep me because they liked the way i worked."
good,target is an good job i enjoy meeting new people and working with differnnt people.the store is clean and the employees are nice. i learned more about target that i never knew about before. management is okay some take there jobs to serious and others work along side with you
good,I helped with the set up of the local target store and it was fun. I met a lot of nice people many of whom i am still in contact with today. I did not want to stay on after it was set up
good,"It's a friendly community with regular guests that love shopping their. Even employees love to shop their. Target has cookouts for everyone. It was really a fun job, and I consider them family. Sometimes the manager would get over whelmed and yell."
good,They treat there employees okay at Target for the most part.  But say goodbye to your weekends an family cause you will never see them again sadly.  All they care about are Red Cards
good,I don't have much good to say about this place. Their goal is to make a fast fun and friendly work environment but in reality everyone  is just looking out for themselves and don't care much for others.
good,Pros: Team based work environment.  Electronic equipment for communication to help locate products. Cons: insufficient number of devices to work with for number of people on shift.
good,"the compensation was great but 4am-8am is a tough shift. it went well while it lasted. Stocking was organized and specific, but went by fast when we worked at a certain pace."
good,This was my first job since leaving the Marines. It was a very physical job.there wasn't much of a community as I hoped. It was also over night. It was also part time so I couldn't grow from it personally or financially. It would have been nice to have while going though art school but not on to live off of.
good,A typical day can be fun and exhausting all at once. Another learning experience for me was not being able to work most of the store.
good,"a typical day at work, come in check my schedule, check my area of work and see what needs to be done. ask guests if they need help with anything and try and make sales. management was not too bad but needed improvement, and the most enjoyable part of my day would be all day just interacting with the guests!"
good,"i enjoyed working at Target just the same problem, there wasn't enough hours and we were always over staffed. Loved the people i worked with and the managers were nice."
good,"Working at Target was a really great experience for me. I learned to use a cashier, help guests, and stock items without a problem. The guests were nice and considerate. The environment was safe."
good,I was always doing something. There were friendly people I was working with.
good,"Co-workers are friendly and easy to get a long with, Upper Management is very easy-going and willing with work your outside schedule."
good,It is a good company. Its just not stable hours. Managers are very nice and easy to work for. I really like the fact that we had meetings to let HR know how are managers are. And I really liked the team huddles atleast once aweek.
good,"It’s a fine job the only thing I didn’t like was the hours they gave us, but it’s only the newnan location, but they give the hours to their favorites which is the people that’s in a supervisor role."
good,I loved working at target because it was a very productive job and a new experience. My first job was a custodial worker and there was a lot of customer service and a lot of cleaning. Being At target was great cause there is great communication and great people.
good,"Management does not appreciate a good worker. A consent turnover  of employees. "
good,"The first three months of working at target were nice but as management came about made the whole culture of the job stressful,aggravating, non enjoyable and what made me quit their to find something better suited for me."
good,"Working at target has changed since I got there. When I was first hired it felt inclusive when you had a disability, but now not so much since they changed with their modernization."
good,"Management could be so much better. It’s unreasonable to just disregard people for absolutely anything. It’s a great job to have with pretty good pay, but life outside of work doesn’t matter and you can be fired behind ANYTHING. Sneeze wrong and you’re fired."
good,very unorganized with multiple managers and conflicting opinions stressful workplace with reasonable pay difficult job with occasionally rude employees would not recommend working here
good,"I am currently employed at target . I enjoy customer service and being able to help guest find what they are looking for with out a hassle , but I would like an environment that works together ."
good,I opened the store and and set everything up for a good shift for everyone else. I also did shipping and receiving and ship to store. Packaging products and shipping them out to customers
good,"Was a typical mediocre college job. About what you would expect for retail. Nothing too exciting, but I have nothing negative to say bout the place. They were fair and I had a strong bond with my coworkers."
good,"Your coworkers make a job enjoyable, management is not your coworker."
good,Learned  a lot helped guest made them and me smile.would like to reapply. Flexiable hours. meetings held daily to keep communication open. guest help make your day if you help them even if it's easy one thing.
good,i believe Target was a very cool place and friendly. i would work there again. Very busy very demanding they train you for all positions fast paced...
good,The job overall is good but the management is horrible. The supervisors think they are more important than they really are. They have unrealistic expectations when it comes to doing the job.
good,I worked at two different Target stores the first one I worked at I loved. The team was able to communicate easily with anyone when necessary. I felt comfortable approaching any of my team leaders with questions. The team I worked with worked together to get things done and help if you needed time off. Then I moved and this new store has poor communication and a management team with unrealistic expectations. A task that would take two hours to complete if it was your only task they expect to be done in an hour and for you to assist guests and do other tasks that they set on you. If I ask a leader a question they say they don't have time or tell you to ask a different leader even if it might have taken less than a minute to answer.
good,"I worked at the registers, customer service, and the food court."
good,Target was a learning experience for me being that was my first time actually working on an assemble line and unloading trucks and stocking shelves. But it wasnt the type of job for me at all.
good,"It was a seasonal job but I enjoyed working there, I did not receive benefits from this job due to it being a seasonal job. It gave me experience in the customer service field and how to deal with difficult people."
good,"The people were all very nice, the job was fulfilling, hours were flexible. Overall, it was a really great place to work, despite the holidays being a stressful time."
good,"Great experience just not enough hours its like high school just like any other company the mangers have their favorites , more than willing to cross train as long as attendance and work ethic is good. Hardest part is when you put in 110% constantly and they don't see it so you bring it down to 100% and they complain they expect more than what they pay you for. Made a lot of friends along the way and most times the job is fairly easy."
good,I loved working there made a few friends managers where amazing Hardest part of the job was staying up late restocking things especially being short and not being able to reach
good,"target is a good company to work for, good benefits over all but the schedule leaves a lot to be desired. typical day is 10-12 hours 3 or 4 days a week. my job consist of order pulling and team member training. best part of the job is management, worst part is having to work every weekend."
good,"Everyday was different,  Face to Face contact with the guest, was different.  They come in with different needs, you have the  ones who price matched, returns, exchanges.  I enjoyed educating the guest about the Red Cards, and the Target Apps.  The work place was fun and exciting there wasn't anything hard about working there."
good,"it started out a fun job.  had a great manager .he left and things went downhill from there .had manager not qualified for job."
good,"I don't mind working for target, but I'm tired of not getting enough hours; weekly hours are barely 20 hours. I do like the diversity of the culture there, management is ok."
good,"Target was a pretty good job. I was an extremely great employee, I had a chance to meet a lot of great people. I still visit from time to time to see old friends."
good,Its A Fast Pace Job You Cannot Slack At All Because It Will Definitely Show Overall In Your Team. Team Members Are Very Helping And Friendly You Will Never Feel Left Out. The Management Is Not All That Communications Is Not Good At All.
good,Doing work placement here and it is enjoyable. Easy to pick up on tasks quickly. Friendly team members and very helpful department managers.
good,This job is good for high students who are just trying to have a job. my typical day was mostly spend in a different department because the store was all store handed. learned how to work better on a team. the hardest part was cleaning out fitting room with where guest change into clothes at the wrong time of there month. the most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"I had to ring out people and great them. I also had to help them find things they needed. The management was really bad. Some of the managers would tell the employees that they could not use their phones, but would turn around and use their personal phones to make personal calls."
good,"I needed something Part-Time, nights and weekends as I was home raising my boys.  I started out as a cashier and moved up to a management position.  I enjoyed the atmosphere, for I love to shop and talk to people.  Hardest part of job had to be working on Holidays.  Management always pushed you to work hard by doing nice things."
good,"I loved working for Target. I have worked at a lot of places and this one was really fun. When I was first hired I received a lot of hours, but as the weeks went on my hours started to drop until I was only receiving maybe 15 hours a week. My managers were really nice and I loved my co workers as well. It was really busy because...its TARGET! The place that has everything. Customers always told me that they came to just buy one thing and then they left with so much stuff."
good,There's to many employees trying to be the boss as well as no hours. You are treated as only a number and not an actual human being
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target except the fact that they had 30 trainers who showed you how to do the same thing 25 different ways and that I was terminated for calling out twice (First time was to be there for my daughters birth & the second was when the mother of my child was ill and couldn't take care of my daughter. A typical day is somewhat chaotic, not because of the large crowds of guest but because of the lack of communication amongst the leadership, not to mention just a lack of comraderie"
good,I didnt like this job very much. I didn't like the hours I was given. I worked from 4pm to 100am. By the time 100am came I was so tired. The end of the shift was the hardest becasue I had to go around the store and pick things off the ground and put things in there right spots. I worked with people who would use bad language. That really bothered me that I had to be around that. I didn't have a problem with the management at all.
good,The days were pretty quick there was always something to do. The people were nice.
good,"Big company who has to think more in people who need job. They have a good prices, good sales and more."
good,"A typical day starts off with the exciting task of being in the cash office,followed by my emergence back into the beehive of activity, at Guest Service."
good,"It's a challenge, when I first started it was joyful moments. Management is the biggest issues. Everyone need to go back to drawing boards. The pay keep increasing but the hours are beeing cut. Its not enough for the cost of living. Certain team members are getting more hours than the other. There's no rotation with cross training. Only certain team members are chosen. The most enjoying moments being able to continue to engaged with the guest with the sales throughout the store and discounts. The conversation of sharing with someone whom you never met is priceless. That's what I love❤ the most."
good,"no room for growth and empty promises for movement. Cant say it for all departments but mine, in particular, was empty promises and training is not there just told what needs to be done."
good,"Its an ok job if youre into retail. There is not many chances for you to move up in the store, so if that is what youre looking for then this isnt the place for you."
good,Was really excited to work here and the first couple months were generally alright hours aren’t really too good a lot of drama and gossip from employees no organization or great leadership skills on that note but a good first job
good,"Great job,some co workers are great workers others not so much.  managers  pick their favorite team members and ignore the rest it's not fair to the ones they don't give a fair shot to but work the hardest."
good,"enjoyed working with and helping guests.  company made many changes in policy and management which changed the culture of the workplace.  i am very conscientious, liked old motto ""fast, fun, friendly"".  "
good,"The job at first was wonderful. I had fun, and I enjoyed the fast paced environment and learning about how to handle different situations with customers. Until a new manager was hired. She was awful. She was power hungry and rude. Although I was not much younger than the other employees, she constantly belittled me and acted as if I was less than her simply because I was younger and only a cashier."
good,"Target kept me busy like the way i like ,There wasn't ever a time i was just sitting and not getting paid. The manager was nice to even let clock-in a little earlier than i was supposed too."
good,"As a cashier, you check guests out and put their things in bags. Some people were really nice, but sometimes it was very difficult to deal with mean people."
good,"At the time I was homeless, living in my car, and working another job on top of being a full time student. Target has a terrible way of communication with its employees. I was exterminated because I missed 2 days during my 90 day probation. Target and my other job refused to give me a fixed schedule so on some days I had overlap or would misread my schedule and show up for the other job instead of that one."
good,Love the hours In early out early . Collect Freight Push it out To the peace And Go home Best job ever .... Great team work nice store Clean bathrooms.
good,"Target can be fast paced , depending on the day / season."
good,"I like working there , the employees are nice and really helpful , everybody’s polite, but they just don’t give you enough hours and I can’t work like that ."
good,"great place to work, everyone is very helpful and friendly. Only thing is there are no benifits and the work day hrs are late. they are open until 11pm and the holiday hrs are open until 12pm."
good,"Mostly a great job but the hr manager was inconsiderate and back stabbing and was very unprofessional with a nasty attitude but store manger, other mangers and supervisors were great"
good,"The job itself at target was wonderful, always busy and moving so the time passed without a problem. I was not able to continue working the hours that they needed me as a single mother with a child in school so I was not able to continue working for them. The benefits were not worth it. You were not eligible for insurance unless you worked 40 hours a week but they did not make that possible with the position that I held with the company. We were lucky if we were able to get anything more than 25 hours a week, monday wednesday friday and sometimes on the weekends. Management was wonderful and fairly understanding if something came up outside of work but that did not help with trying to make up any hours that we had to cut or missed."
good,"Target is a great place to work when the right team leaders are in place.  Even then, Target is still a great workplace for the simple fact that the guests are very kind & come in to visit you with a smile.  If you are feeling bad on a particular day, they will put a smile on your face & that is something I will always remember!"
good,Great employees and management but the hours given and the little to no compensation you get every two weeks does not let you live . its hard to pay bills with 12 hours a week .
good,"Target was my first real job, however during my time there, I was not treated well. I always try to do more than whats asked of me, but target only wants people who are half-assed and really dont care."
good,"I loved working at target! The days went by quick, and I liked getting off early. The least thing I didn't like was not getting enough hours."
good,"It is a very good job if you are looking for many hours, but can be over whelming, coworkers are very friendly, and its a good very good environment"
good,"It could ve been a lot better thought. I worked under a tempt agent, that happen to be contracted with Target. that s all I ought to say"
good,"-Fast paced environment"
good,At Target I did many things. I started as a cashier and then moved to the sales floor helping and attending to the costumers we had. After a while I got moved to being the store operator and there is were i ended up staying. I picked several phone lines and distribute them to their proper departments as well as help to the best of my ability to help with any questions or concerns they had. At the same time I was in charge of the stores fitting room. I would sort and distribute merchandise to their appropriate department. I would also attend to costumers that needed any assistance. I also helped in stores inventory as well as processing merchandize to the company. For a month I covered of the of the Labeling and Resurfacing associates and was able to learn about the labels in the store and how it works.
good,Never a dull moment in retail. Every guest is unique and yes they are always right. Make them happy. Great place to work The hardest part of retail is your busy times of the day.
good,i liked my time there even though they let me go because it was a seasonal position.
good,I am a team player and I report to work to work. I am hard working and focus. I am currently working part time and seeking full time employment . My preference is night shift work in my local area.
good,"I regret working at this company. Imagine supervising four departments by yourself, and they pay you $12 per hour."
good,"Very flexible with family and work balance."
good,"Although I loved my time working at target and many of the managers I came across were performing to their highest level there were parts of the job I did not like. A typical day in the pharmacy was always a better day than working on the sales floor or for the in-house Starbucks. A typical day consisted of many of the team members working together to complete a simple goal, get prescriptions out and get home at closing time."
good,The management is very friendly. Its a pretty easy job. The busiest time of the year is only during holidays. Not great pay if your trying to make a living.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy. the holidays had customers EVERYWHERE! i learned a lot how to work under pressure which with experience made it easy. i was on the cash register my entire shift which sometimes made standing somewhat uncomfortable at times. other than the madness, i really enjoy working with people at fast paces and enjoyed my job as a cashier"
good,"I love love love working at Target.Working their you actually feel like you are on a team or in a family. Everyone wears different hats so,most of the employee are knowledgeable of other depts,however the pay is horrible.Alot of folks that work there do so because they love the environment.I believe if Target paid a little bit better and gave better raises,there turnover would be obsolete."
good,"They work around your schedule, but the pay is horrible. It's fun"
good,What ever you need you can find it at Target a kid and family store some one always available to help with a smile very large turn over with company have benefits for full time workers only
good,mangers at my store were super nice and sweet but the main manger was not that great. She would say hey come and “help” me do this and leave me alone to do what I was suppose to help with. Other than that working there was super fun and a great experience
good,"Co workers are the best, I enjoy the diversity of the customers that come into the stores, supervisors are very nice. Store is clean and ever changing. Good sales."
good,"Management isn’t that well set up, and their communication is poorly managed depend more on others than all, the job is easy when you know what your daily task is and what you’re there for but when they pile on others tasks onto you without notice is unfair"
good,"Target was diverse, fun, fast paced and a bit challenging. At Target, the managers were nice, understanding and hardworking they made sure that you were comfortable."
good,"good place to work but not stable for advancement within there company, hours are never steady, and management doesn't know the job as well as they should."
good,"I worked on-call as a babysitter for multiple families. I was responsible to watch kids ages 1-10, cook and feed them meals, clean, change diapers, play outside, and put them to sleep for a nap."
good,Target is a good company but they don’t keep you busy so you end up being side tracked by miscellaneous jobs but the way the managers are there I couldnt do it they were always so unorganized
good,I enjoyed it except there is favoritism which makes it hard. Its overall a good job with good pay and they are pretty flexible for the most part. You just have to be persistent.
good,Overall good experience working with customers. Loved helping customers and interacting with them. Friendly and safe environment. Very helpful coworkers.
good,Teaches how to work in stressful situations and how to deal with angry customers. The managers are very helpful and very one is overall very nice to you.
good,"Typical day at Target began by checking my work emails. This was a very important due to the fact that this was how communication between me and my managers was completed. Second was to take the time and take a look at my team and see if there was anything they needed from me or anything that I had to order. I learned to be independent at Target. Not much help from target managers, they just expect you to know and get it done. Culture was great. Nothing was hard about my job."
good,"company closed. wish it didn't. I don't know what you want me to say about this."
good,"Honestly dealing with management and the lack of communication is the hardest part of my job. They could be kind of rude also. HR is ""there for you"" to listen when you need to talk but wont do anything about it."
good,"You have to be a fast,fun and friendly team member. The guest are always first before any task are completed daily. You have to do what is asked and everyone is cashier trained for back-ups"
good,Was a fun place to work. Enjoyed the people there. They always made sure that you new what you were doing before they left you by yourself. Explained things well.
good,"Was a Fantastic place to work until they brought in a new supervisor who came in and treated everyone like we were beneath her and obliterated the positive and productive atmosphere. Sales are down ever since, losing good employees."
good,Good environment. Store looks nice inside. Products are nice. Just the pay is minimum wage and you all the people that work there live with their parents or a spouse.
good,I had to work for front desk and cashier and flow team. It was a busy day every day all day. I think overall working there has helped me be able to have a good laugh when I need one.
good,"I don't really have anything to say about this company. We worked normally and went home like we were suppose to. It's a job, it pays the bills. It's a fast paced environment."
good,"Target pays very well but you will pay it back in blood, sweat, and often tears. The works is often invigorating but will eventually burn you out. I met many incredible people here but many have chosen to go elsewhere. I was provided incredible learning opportunities from an amazing boss. I do not regret my time with Target but I am not itching to return."
good,"Awesome and I enjoyed working  fast paced, with great team members and sales associates. Fancy, fashionable and new modern day brands added to stores sales market at an affordable price."
good,I told ya so! No reall I told you the Canadian market and the Canadian employees would not be able to make you store culture and processes work her. Just a little flexibility will go a long way
good,"Friendly staff and we all work together. Everyone stayed busy with customers, stocking, cleaning or something. if  you don't have anyone in line then you move to make sure store was neat  and clean.  You went to help anyone who needs it."
good,I enjoy having to get up and look forward to going into my employment at Target. It is very pleasant and my fellow employees are wonderful and fun to work for and with. I mostly enjoy greeting and taking care of the guests that we have visit our store on a daily basis.
good,I work at Target as a second job. Every job has his good and bad. I have witness some team members get treated unfairly for something that another team member would get away with because they get red cards.
good,like i said its ok. the best thing is the people i work with. as far as benefits and good things about the job there aren't that many but its a fun job and its not hard so its easy to work hard and get stuff done.
good,Overall I was very satisfied and happy to be part of Target but unfortunately some of the management team should not hold the position as management though.
good,"I was fired for target for doing a job that needed at least 3 people by myself and they said I had poor performance, the people i meet at S#2011 were great but management was ditsy and rude"
good,"The training in my department was not all that great as it was fairly new.  Everything initially started out great, but management just kinda  of has you fending for yourselves as they mostly take off on the evenings and weekend.  Not a lot of help answering questions."
good,"Target is a great beginner job."
good,Target is a very fun to work it's a family orientated place with fun themes days lunches or dinners and outfitted days  opportunities for growth and chances to learn other areas in the field
good,"Learned to work with customers and accommodate to them while also doing my job. Management could have been better, they weren't always in sync with the other managers and employees."
good,"It's an easy job, but you don't get a lot of money. The company offers good health benefits, but only if you work a certain number of hours and maintain those hours."
good,"no benefits, only allowed to work 39 hours and that's if you pick up others shifts. you get annual raises, sometimes it'll be a dime,  sometimes a quarter. Worked here for three years and never earned enough for a paid week vacation since paid vacation depended on the average monthly hours worked."
good,"Great experience.Oppurtunity to expand your growth in your career, Help me to become confident with my work and open up to people and new challenges great work place and love the employee s"
good,i loved working for target as it was my very first job. they taught me a lot & the managers were awesome! the pay wasn't so great but it was expected since i had no working experience.
good,"Yes I gave Target a 5 star overall ranking. However, this does not mean that it is an amazing place to work at. The management is awful, and I am not talking about at the particular store I work at. The district, regional, and every other higher corporate team is fairly full of themselves. They walk around and act like they are so much better than everybody else and they do not deal with any actual problems. They like to talk about tiny little details, that sure they are important, but there are bigger issues to deal with. However, I do love working here. I have another job but I enjoy this one that I do not quit. The employees and management at my particular store are truly amazing, with the exception of a few people. "
good,A great company to work for. They don't pay enough. The discount of working there is great. Just the pay is not enough and the raises are literally in cents.
good,Helping guest find many different merchandise.The most enjoyable part was being able to meet new people and iteract in different ways.I learned that every one can succeed at anything if you try hard enough.Stock aisles and make sure everything was neat.
good,Good place to work if you are looking for part time work.There are no real benefits for part time employees and your schedule will never be the same.If you are looking for just a paycheck then this would be a good job.Not a great place for advancement unless you have lots of time to give and don't need benefits.management is young and mostly inexperienced when it comes to dealing with people issues.
good,Great company to work for. lots of opportunity to make friends and gain guest experience. Overnight shift can take time to adjust to. I work with many people of different genders and ethnic backgrounds . I find that I have lots of problem solving and time management experience.
good,"Great customers, and staff members "
good,"Friendly,outgoing, family feeling environment respected everyone's beliefs loved the staff management and benefits"
good,Everyone is so nice. Make arrangements in case something comes up. Allows you swap shifts to help co-workers. I loved working at target.
good,Would be a great place to work if you can get enough hours and benefits. Feel like your agitating customers by soliciting the Target Red Card.
good,"The professional work environment here is a great opportunity for young college grads to take on a challenging leadership role in business management. It was extremely high-energy and fast-paced. The company seeks young and energetic individuals as its store executives. However, the retail environment was NOT well balanced with an appropriate work/life balance and a professional job culture. In a logistics ETL position, I often worked 12 hour days many times per week. Training and leadership was sometimes lacking, and can vary a lot per store."
good,Overnight stock team member required store replenishment and working together in a team setting to complete tasks . It was over all a good experience besides the schedule conflict.
good,Meeting sales and being helpful to guests. Management worked hands-on with the staff to ensure we exuded wonderful guest service. The most enjoyable part of the job was volunteering at Target House.
good,"Amazing company that holds true to the mission statement. I have learned a lot in my short career with them, and hope that others will be provided the same opportunities that I have had"
good,"fast paced working environment, fast fun and friendly. handling guests, handling schedules, large amounts of money.  Room to grown within company.  Work well with all staff."
good,"Need to work on Work life balance and overall treatment of Logistics."
good,Loved working here. Loved my job. Supervisors were great. Loved the work environment. Schedules were fairly flexible.
good,I had an amazing experience during my time at target. The staff was nice and extremely helpful. The techs and pharmacists always helped when I needed it and answered any questions that I had.
good,I worked here for 1-2 years and wasn't really happy with the management or the team members..
good,i worked through a temp service. extremely hard to get hired on. must work your butt off for 6 months to a year to even be considered for a position.
good,Work starts early and can sometimes be a long night. You learn a lot of skills that can help you out in other jobs. Management is ok but sometimes they make it obvious that the store comes first. Great people but sometimes there are people who just don't like working. The hardest part of the job is working holidays when things get very heavy and very fast paced. Best part of this job is meeting great people and the volunteer work they do.
good,"over all i loved working for Target i loved my co-workers, but i wont miss the management only cared about making sales to make them selves look good, and hanging everyone else out to dry if they didnt make sales. the hardest part of the job was the constant sheduale swapping all the time. the most enjoyable part of my job was working with co-workers and customers, ive always been a people person and enjoy hearing peoples stories."
good,"Nice place to work. Great people. Learned to work with money, training was very good."
good,Never a dull moment plenty to do always on the go. Constantly working with guests and helping them with their needs.
good,"Supervise and create fast, fun and friendly environment for guest by leading our checkout team. Act quickly to resolve guest concerns and make sure they leave happy. Manage team schedules and talent to provide best guest experience and  manage checkout traffic."
good,"A typical day at work would involve making sure that all customers were satisfied with their experience, making sure all product is stocked and that all employees are following the proper procedures, and filling out paperwork. I have learned many things at this job, but mostly I have taught myself to be more outgoing and come out of my shell a little bit more than I was used to. My coworkers were great. It was a great place to work. The hardest part of the job is making every single customer satisfied. Sometimes it just cant be done, but I try my hardest. The most enjoyable part of my job is all the relationships I have created with my ""regular"" customers and how my attitude effects their whole day. I absolutely love making a difference in their lives."
good,target is a good place to work the experience I had working there was awesome and its a fantastic place to work for
good,"Like most retail places, started at 8.50 an hour and management encourages advancement."
good,"Check email/voice mail, then prioritize activities and be efficient."
good,It was challenging at first but once you learn what the company is all about it was great helping people and giving superior guest services. I really enjoyed this job
good,"it was a nice place to work, the employees were great to work with"
good,"Had a horrible experience working for the company. I was pregnant, and was asked to do things that I shouldnt have.Ex: Climbing on a ladder."
good,its fun and active exciting always moving face paced i loved it
good,worked independently and well with co-workers. Worked late hours which I enjoyed.
good,"keep the lot clean from all carts, make sure i the little things in the store done, as take the trash out, get the unattended carts that are left threw out the store, help guest carry there heavy items to there car"
good,"Fun to work and co-workers were friendly, but there was really no chance of advancement higher than a cashier of supervisor and the pay was not good."
good,I really enjoyed the team and the atmosphere! All friends I have made at work were great people.Everything was fast passed and your shift goes really quick
good,"Although Target is a luxurious store to work for, they sometimes lack the “human decency”. Often times they will over or under schedule, make promises they never meant to keep. It’s a challenging work environment designed only for the best."
good,Some people are nice but most of them are rude and treats you like a kid or a idiot. There's some much work to be done and sometimes there's not a lot of people to help and your lefted alone to do it all.
good,"""Good Place for a first job"" Target is a fast, fun, and friendly corporation that focuses on guests and their team members. ... We focus our time each and every day on making our guests happy and our team members friendly."
good,"I started off working soft lines for 2 years then once I relocated I was given the opportunity to learn how to do other tasks in other departments. I became part of the hardline team, cashiered here and there, worked in the back room, and worked on planograms. I appreciated being able to venture out into other departments giving me the opportunity to learn and be able to perform more than one task."
good,"I enjoy working at Target especially the Super Target the customers are great  they treat me with respect. Although I do think managment needs give more appreciation to employees that go the extra mile for Targets customers.  Also,  not enough hours given for gualification for any medical insurance.  Just under hours  alot of other employees are not happy with this as well as myself."
good,Management is a hit or miss depending on the location. So I suggest you visit the location you are planning to apply to and interact with management and the team members.
good,"Dealing with customer was one of my favorite things, helping people when they need it is great, cashiers are great and help you a lot when you needing help."
good,"Worked as a flo team member which requires to be able to pick up to at least 35-55 lbs, take boxes off the truck,sort out the objects between electronics, beauty supplies, and chemicals."
good,"The hardest part of the job was taking something heavy up the ladder. A typical day at target could have been stressful depending on the specific holiday coming up or just a normal truck day; however, it all depended on the team that you had for the day."
good,"I felt respected, accomplished, and accepted working here. The only downside was the inability to communicate with all of my coworkers effectively when there was personal conflict."
good,There is literally always something to do . Putting out stick cleaning your area helping customers . Always something it helps the day go by but it’s also fun
good,Target had the stress of working through the ranks with no real advancement as well as the management only set expectations that weren't enough for a single person on their own
good,I got burnt out and fed up with the favoritism n management. However its a good place to work mostly everyone is friendly..............................
good,Store at times can feel like a mess and very unorganized. Management is mostly reactionary leads and not thinking about the situation more clearly. Example: They see something and feel like that's the priority to do when in reality there's about 5 things to do before that actual task.
good,"I mainly got stressed out dealing with incompetent managers. They had the position, but not too much knowledge of work flow and had poor guidance. Not much was explained after being hired. Just get it done and push through the day. Slow to make improvements with backroom locations and back stock over flowing."
good,The work itself wasn’t hard. But the management had no idea how to manage their workers. So many people would be telling you to different things and they would make it your fault for falling short or needing help. They don’t care about the health of their employees either. Even if your dripping from the face and coughing up blood.
good,Working at target has been a good build of character and responsibilities. Management system could be improved greatly because hours and work schedules are always uneven and no seniority is provided for long time employees
good,It was pretty much the same thing everyday. I have learned to stock items and customer service and hoping people find what there looking for. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers
good,"Working here is a good place and environment, however the lack of hours are not working for me. Micromanagement is prevalent, and can be a tedious task to deal with."
good,"The only reason I left was poor management by the current Executive Team Lead.  She had little hand in day to day activities and I would not see her for weeks at a time.  She was nearly unapproachable and extremely rude.  When she was around, she put little effort into working with you on number of hours and schedule availability.  The communication was nonexistent.  The Logistics Team Leads and the Store Team Lead were amazing people but unfortunately, couldn't outweigh poor management by someone who was promoted because of seniority, rather than ability."
good,I liked working at my location.    Usually only was scheduled for 4 hours at a time.   I spent most of my paycheck on household items also.   Only part that I really could not get used to was the shift 4 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
good,"My management is amazing and I love the work I do. Each day I work I am kept busy without being put under pressure or stress. Although I was promised 20 + hours a week, kept closer to 30 and have not received more than 12 hours since I started."
good,"Fun productive work environment. I am easily able to connect with my other co-workers, as well as the target employees on the floor. I do a lot of face to face interaction with customers."
good,"It's fine. 30 min lunch. Two 15 min breaks. Nice coworkers. Managers are either great or awful. 10% discount for employees. Very flexible schedule. Recently started cutting hours, not a good place to work if you require 40 hrs a week."
good,It is a friendly loving environment to work for. I love it. The team always makes sure that we work together and that we accomplish everything we have to accomplish together.
good,"Great work hours and ability to swap schedule with other team members, also discounts were given. Had the opportunity to meet a lot of great team members and customers."
good,Being a cashier was pretty easy. You meet lots of locals. You try everyday getting customers to sign up for a red card your lucky if you get more than one.
good,Working for Target it is a good company to work for your hours might be from 15 to 24 hours a week. The pay is pretty good but the hour sucks. I am currently working there part-time and I get 27 hours per week sometime 22.50 hours.. when I first start working at Target I was getting 40 hours my hours have dropped down to 22 to 27 hours a week.
good,Very laid back but productive at the same time. Have a lot of inventory that comes in an expect to be put out on the floor. If there's no room left out on the sales floor we have to store it in the stock room.
good,Fitting room we're very chill. Most of the team members were young adults and college students. So co workers were easy to get along with. Lots of supporting each other and simple things such as asking how my day was every day.
good,I’m a food team member and as a result I and other members have what I feel the toughest drop. We have the tougest job because we are constantly moving or lifting items 75lbs or more. Target is always short handed people so finding someone to cover a shift is impossible do to the lack of staff.
good,"Up beat great place to work despite the fact that the manager I had was the biggest idiot I've ever come across. Great place to work, especially around holidays.I really generally loved working there though."
good,"The only problem is the many mini managers that are in the stores you are never really sure who to listen to, The job can be very rewarding with lots of room to grow and they do have fun activities for the employees each month"
good,Great place to work and develop. The Leader ship team always do the best they can to train and develop the team members. There is a continuous follow up between leadership team and the team members.
good,"Overall Target is a great place to work. Management is strict, but understanding. The corporation is always doing contests and offering incentives to put your 100% into your job."
good,"Was there as a temp. if you didn't do the things that management wanted you to do, you were fired. Only thing was nice is that you got paid weekly and discounts."
good,"I really didn’t mind this job , it’s not one of my favorites but I’ve got plenty of experience on speaking to people and customer service and also working in a fast pace to complete the customers needs"
good,"Its  a good company to work for they pay great for the work that you will be doing . The hours are great you can work more hours depending on your daily life status ,they are always looking for help,"
good,Great team but had no life.  I did not enjoy any holiday's.  You will work every day from October to February. Had no team members to do any of the work that needed to be done
good,"Had good people to work with"
good,"my experience at Target was good , i got to interact allot with customers and met people from all over, cross train in all depts after training was up"
good,Was overall really engaged in work and found it to be interesting. Job stress isn't too bad and found it to be a good opportunity to hone sale skills.
good,"A friendly smile and lots manners are required and needed. "
good,target has a great group of people. I work in the shoe department and at time guest leave lots                                           of trash and shoe boxes.along with other random items. it can be chalenging. i do really enjoy this job
good,"I loved working at Target, everyone was very nice to me and they helped me if I didn't know what I was doing. I would definitely recommend anyone to work there."
good,"Target was a fast and fun place in my opinion to work for at the time. There was always a good vibe in Target, all the guests was always smiling and happy."
good,I like this job it's a good way to get started for my future. I want to learn how to lead people and people look to me for guidance while working with me.
good,"my overall review for Target warehouse : I do not recommend Anyone to work there , the work conditions are unbearable, breaks not long enough ,and no air conditioning"
good,"I loved working at Target. I developed great friendships and learned the most working here. I learned how great teamwork works, how to have patience with difficult customers and how to resolve the hardest situations."
good,Was at this job for only a seasonal position. Was nice to be working for part of a team instead of by myself.  Was very accepting and overall it was a happy place to work.
good,"At Target I was a manager were I provided great guest service to customers. Everyday I was able to learn something new, from new procedures to learning from my peers. In a days work I would re-stock end-caps, checkout guest on register, help out at guest service, and help guest out throughout the store. The workplace culture was great I met new people every week. The hardest part of the job was dealing with short handiness. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making sure the guests had a fast, fun, and friendly experience at Target."
good,Target encourages to branch out and learn the different facets of the business. There is always room to learn new roles and take on wisdom from other teams.
good,"Part time employment on third shift"
good,"Target was amazing at utilizing specific targets to gauge development of its team members and leaders.  I was groomed and well developed in team building, recognition, service, and driving sales."
good,"I loved how everything was fast in the beginning with getting me started as a Target team member. Being a cashier was an easy task for me, I love to speak to all the customers to make sure there expectations were met."
good,"I like target, the pay is good and the other workers are nice. The hours very are flexible, management is pretty social, and firm. Target workers go above and beyond to make sure all guest have a smooth sailing visit."
good,"Workplace culture was pretty good. Management was very strict but firm, and made sure job was done. Learned a lot in shipping and receiving/stocking items on the shelves."
good,not a bad place to work in retail. Customers were fairly nice and management was cool with working around a schedule. Not enough pay during the time I worked there but not a bad job overall.
good,"this is a  great first job,  its a pretty fun place to work, but its not a forever work place.  they are really into making sure you upsell red cards so be sure to stay on top of that."
good,"Try it for yourself, everyone's experience will differ. I learned everything there is to know about the operations of the company, by working various departments."
good,"I enjoyed working there while I was in high school, but definitely does not pay enough to live off of. There schedule is really random and you don't have a set schedule."
good,I like everyone there but the job was seasonal position and only 2 people was hired permanently so I really dont have anything bad to say about the company
good,Target offered flexible hours and was great for students with unconventional schedules. Management basically let you pick when you worked.
good,Management are ok. Long work hours for little pay. Holiday season is like a mad house. Had to learn most of everything on my own. Training was bad.
good,"Working for this company has helped me manage tasks and helped with math skills and i learned to use the cash register"
good,Attività da promoter che mi ha permesso di entrare in relazione con il pubblico e coniugare il lavoro allo studio.
good,"either very slow or very busy, i learned how to handle many different types of personalities and provide excellent customer service."
good,Not enough hours. Management was not good. The only enjoyable part about working there is helping the guest. And getting to see the  new merchandise come in
good,"Had exactly what I needed and the lines went quick. The electronics dept employees weren't knowledgeable, but hey... It's Target!  No issues."
good,"I learned about the different things in the job and how a lot of stuff worked"
good,"Target as a corporation is great but your experience depends on the Management Team/ Executive Team.  If your store is following corporate directives you will love your store and stay, but if your store is run by someone that is not truly about the store family you will have a very hard time."
good,What I've learn from target is come in do your work and handle the task that's in front of you as quickly and productive as possible . the harder you work the further you can advance with in the company
good,I don't have much to say because i only did seasonal was not much to learn from. there always a lot of team players and that work well with other workers
good,Target is an outstanding company to work for with benefits and opportunities offered on a near daily basis to aspiring leaders. Target does not take the best care of their Executive Team and needs to fully train and equip them before holding them accountable.
good,Its corporate. Working here offers many opportunities to have one-on-one interaction with customers.  Management seemed to always be overworked and eventually bled onto their team.  This job requires the majority of your day standing  or walking.
good,"Was hired on as seasonal with potential to be permanent. I was kept on as a cashier after the holidays. I loved working with target despite the inner management problems. I was able to work not only as a cashier but also on the floor in clothing( women and infants/kids) I worked in the Pharmacy as a cashier and in the food court/cafe. I only left because I thought that I was being offered a job with more potential, I was mistaken."
good,"I Usually, work all day open and close, i get everything set up and when an appointment comes i check them in and start there photo session, then i sell the costumer there picture, and so on through out the day until close."
good,A great company to work for. Coworkers always willing to help in other departments and train you if needed.
good,"It's a good place to work, I got along well with my co-workers, but I left because it was a little too much with working my other full-time job."
good,Not enough hours and money was low. They left me alone the second day in food service to close with teaching me what to do.
good,"Working at target in the last 4 years has been a pleasure. The people there feels like family. Target supports education 100 percent, so it has been a joy and fit when it comes to my schedule changing every semester. There's only one thing I can say about target that I dislike is the hours. Only if you are a Department leader you are guaranteed to know how your hoursl look every week. Other than that you can't count on target to pay your bills because you never know how many hours you would get from week to week. they can go from 12 to 20, maybe 25."
good,"work calture is good but very poor management."
good,"Good place to work.  constantly helping customers, all day long."
good,"I have learn't project management, conflict management, defect management, collabration with partner teams, drive results, talent management, mitigation plans to mitigate projects risks and issues"
good,"It is an okay company to work for. I don't have to deal with guests at night, and I get to interact more with the workers."
good,I loved the fact that I was part of the crew who helped setup and open the store.  I enjoyed the 4 am start.  I was out by noon and could enjoy my day.
good,If you can get in a Target pharmacy you'll want to stay forever
good,"Generally speaking Target is a great place to work.  Benefits are great as long as you qualify for them.  The pay could be better but, it could also be worse.  The best part of my job is helping other team members but, the hardest part of my job is telling them I have routine work I'm in the middle of and can't be interrupted.  I've learned that working in human resources is similar to working in the medical field in many ways.  I've also learned to work with different learning styles while training new team members."
good,"It was long and boring, management was difficult to deal with at times and very demanding. Coworkers was easy to deal with. Hardest part of my job was dealing with management. The coworkers were fun"
good,"great place to work, great hours, great people to work with."
good,"The time with my loved ones was to short, I would of liked more time off"
good,"My day consisted of directing phone calls, taking messages. I also attended the fitting room for the incoming guest. The most enjoyable part about this job was the part-time availability for school."
good,"Typical day...Clock in and prepare, walking to the lane assigned. Greeting customers with a smile and asking if they wanted to save 5% with applying for the red card. Learning retail is different from other jobs I've had, but fun. Management is in all who you know of want to know to build up in the company. Co-workers fun and active. Nothing was hard, but the clean up and re stocking the shevles. The most important part about the job was I just wish I was still there."
good,As a cashier I mainly stayed in the front of the store and helped organize and check-out guests. Management was great. I enjoyed the flexibility of my schedule. They were willing to work with me on coordinating my work schedule around school. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with nice people.
good,I learned patients. It is important to remember that people have their own issues in their life. It is imperative that you are respectful to people regardless of how rude they are to you.
good,A typical day at work is helping guest find what they need and make them feel at home. I have learned how to adjust to many different personalities. Management is there when needed but most of the time i can handle most challenges on my own. The hardest part of the job is simply being understaffed at times. The best part of the job is working with my team in electronics.
good,"The company is okay, but the workplace is not a fun environment."
good,"typical day consisted of clocking in and going straight to your register. You stay there until you are off the clock, or unless you are asked to help someone else."
good,"Amazing co-workers! No questions! Like I say, I am very easy to get along with people :)"
good,I picked target because it help with my customer service skills and the flexible work schedule. The only issue was the lack of staff but for me that helped me out. I was able to gain more experience and feel comfortable working independently.
good,"Overall my experience at Target was good, Expect a great work enviroment including great and helpful management. Retail team was also very motivated to their job in a positive and productive manner."
good,Great company to work for. Great peers  in a fast paced environment. Work life balance can be tough some times. Company champions diversity  and inclusion
good,Make sure my section is in good shape. Learn to be resourceful with tasks. The hardest part of the job is when you run out of things to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with your fellow co-workers.
good,"It’s good, working at target was a great experience I loved it there, there were plenty of opportunities to expand my abilities and i loved being part of a team"
good,I was a seasonal worker for the season of 2019. I worked as a General Merchandise expert which was a job I had never done before but I was able to learn in-spite of the short training. I was also trained at the register. My co-workers were always helpful and had a great attitude. Target was a great environment to work at and I will do it again.
good,I enjoyed working at target. I started as a cart pusher and when I left I was helping in customer service. Everyone was very friendly and my managers treated me like a son.
good,Good temporary job great benefits constantly learning something new and kept busy it’s a easy job and good money it’s worth it to new workers who are looking for their first job
good,My Day to Day duties I would act as a cashier and help customers find items within the store. Also staying up to date on the current sales and coupons.
good,Was hired as seasonal employee would like to reapply. Great co workers and customer's. Work was plenty and made time fly. Learned a lot of different techniques.
good,"Working here is easy, smooth, the target system is admirable in the way it connects well, is easily accessible to guests, and comes naturally logical and comprehensive. The team cares, and they mostly hire on good people. My only problems are scheduling issues, the way we hire on too many people during seasonal times, months out of the year that we are short on payroll and hours are cut majorly."
good,I just don’t feel challenged enough and it is not what I was looking for in a job  my SD does not do a good job of telling me the things I’ve done right
good,Wonderful family friendly environment easy work great pay and benefits the target team is like a big happy family and we all come together to make the goal

good,"Target was one of the most organized warehouses I ever worked at! The management was absolutely great , the speed and pace was also great . The hardest part of the job was the heat"
good,"A typical day is folding, picking up clothes, making sure things look clean, putting new product out, and helping people with their shopping experience."
good,"At target the typical day of a sales floor associate depends on the section you work in. But for the most part all sales floor associates first check the back for what needs to be put out, then once that has been put out on the floor we do reshop and put things back from customer service. Then it is a matter of making sure your area is neat and guests are being helped. We also help other team members in there sections whenever needed."
good,"I enjoyed working there it was a wonderful experience, but they didn't have any hours most of the team leads in my department were very rude and unprofessional and they didn't care."
good,Working At Target Was A Great Experience! Great Coworkers That Are Very Helpful! The Work Environment Was Exceptional In The Fact That The Coworkers Were Kind And Helpful Whenever Needed!
good,The leadership is great and they are focused on making sure you do your job well and know how to succeed. As a company they are focused on making sure they stay on trend and are the best they can be.
good,It felt toxic to work there sometimes the co workers were wonderful but the higher ups were just very fake almost. I got hurt on the job once there I rolled my ankle and the manager just didn’t seem to care at all
good,They were understanding it was just a little bit of a problem trying to contact them through the phone to communicate other than that work was really easy they gave a great staff and they are willing to help you out
good,Everyone is helpful and kind generally. the work itself is not too hard but at times can be a little fast paced although its rarely that you dont get time to relax. Management is very easy-going in a good way and very supportive.

good,"Target is a great employer, however I was going through life issues that were not able to be worked around my schedule. If this had not happened I would’ve still been working for them. But everything happens for a reason."
good,Management is great. They support your career development. The company cares about it's employees interests. I don't have many if any complaints. It was a good place!
good,I loved working at this company. It was my first ever time working as a sales associate. There is a lot of promoting like their RedCard Debit/ Credit Card. Everyone is super nice and friendly. I made some friends while working their that i still see and keep in touch with.

good,I actually loved this job. They treated us all pretty equal and fair and there was always an opportunity to pick up extra hours and cover shifts. Great team energy and always someone to help if needed.
good,Target had shifts set up that required you to either work three days or four days. This limited your time at work and allowed for more time with family and friends.
good,It was actually a good job . The managers  were great & they treated everyone fairly . I really enjoyed working there . Wish I wasn’t seasonal . Around the holidays was busy but it was worth it
good,"Target is a great company to work for, they will work with you on your schedule and are always very kind and very helpful to meet your needs while working there."
good,I collected carts and helped cashier when the aisles were full of people that needed to be checked out. Collecting carts was my priority but I was radioed in frequently.
good,"The PG Location had great people, very understanding managers. Unfortunately Target Canada closed down.  There's no work left in Canada for Target and that's quite sad"
good,"I worked as a seasonal temporary closing expert. I basically assisted customers and answered their questions and helped them find products. I restocked products to all departments of the store regularly. "
good,it was good working there but as a contractor no much importance is given no benefits are given just work and go home. overall a nice place towork no stress.

good,They worked me so much that I couldn’t focus on school so I had to leave wish I could I stay but I just could because school comes first and that could be a main thing
good,"I really enjoyed my experience at Target. They were very hands on and helped with any questions it concerns that I had. There is also opportunity for growth, stay focused and work hard and you’ll be promoted in no time."
good,"The store I worked at didn't really accept employees input, requests and concerns weren't fixed or followed up on. They required too much for just a part time cashier. On the lighter side, it was a calm place to work, everyone was nice and got along well. There was no music playing ever which was awful , it was quieter than a library."
good,Pay is really not good. Work like slaves but the staff is very welcoming and understanding. Always had food for the team in the break room. Should have longer breaks
good,Getting to work in a place that supports you while you work to achieve your goals is exactly what my team at target did. They never failed to make me feel right at home when I was reaching for the stars
good,Starbucks was fun fillies with energy I loved it the drinks the guest and the co workers made it fun fast and felt like home we were close like a family

good,I worked there a short time but it’s a great place to work I had fun and would love to do it again maybe one day I wil try for part time or seasonal I loved it
good,I am only there as a seasonal associate but it is a joy to work there.  Great team members and a guest-centric focus where you are empowered to do what is best for everyone.
good,Your always moved around never in one area that wasn't the jobs for me management was horrible never answered there walkie talkies very rude some of them all cultures work there the hardest part was dealing with some of the coworker and management the most enjoyable part the free food in the break room
good,Typical day working is 50/50 fast or slow and the hardest thing for me was when I first started working their was not asking for help but I learned quickly target bring out best of employees when you need help or a question especially the management leader’s always there if u need some always helpful but overall I loved helping out the guests and talking to them target environment is great when you shopping or if you work there
good,This is a good place to work but they don’t give out enough hours. The location that i work at has very friendly staff and this company seems to actually care about there employees.

good,"Good company, good work environment, good manager, very friendly all. I recommend it one hundred percent. good work environment, good manager Good com"
good,"On a typical day I would be in charge of helping guest purchase their items fast as possible. Sometimes I was on register, sometimes I was at self checkout helping guest out, and other times I’d be in Pizza Hut serving customers their food"
good,Fast paced friendly environment to work. Management really appreciates good work ethic. Advancement opportunities certainly exist.  Competitive salary
good,"I have no review to give at this point as I Haven’t started working there yet, I can write a review after I start working there for awhile, I don’t know what else to say..."
good,"The culture of this particular Target is what made me leave. Upper management was extremely condescending, dismissive and made coming into work an anxiety inducing experience. I loved what I did, it's the best job I've had so far, and my coworkers became good friends. I wish the culture of a place could change overnight--I would've stayed much, much longer as I had become the trainer of new Online Fulfillment Associates as well as the most knowledgeable, efficient, and reliable employee in my field."
good,"Target has taught me a lot in the 5 years of being here. Great leaders, and so much room for development and growth with the company. Great pay, great work environment."
good,I cashed out customers helped with customer service stocking zoning did returns opportunity for hours in other departments 10% off for employees good benefits
good,"Working at Target was a fun first job, I worked at two sites, Escondido target in San Diego was AMAZING, great people to work with and fun environment. The second site in Redlands on the other hand was horrible, bad management and rude leaders."
good,I worked as a cashier and as a sales floor representative. I loved it. This was my first cashier job and i loved being able to communicate with different people.
good,Target is a fun place to work and everyone that you work with for the most part are amazing people who make it worth while to work there. It can be fast paced and everyday can be different.
good,Pretty much a very well operated DC..  Getting to understand an become familiar with previous history working such in past simply had to become a new student in a old class . Management nothing bad to express along with multiple trailers loading at one time require enjoyable previous experience ..
good,Good work environment My experience working at target was a good experience. The team leads were very helpful always. They gave me the wonderful opportunity to be the photo specialist
good,I’m hard working person i love to meet new people and I love to make hard working money ! Love to bring joy and peace . Great at following as I am told
good,"I loved working for Target, if I didnt have to move I would still be there. The people i worked with were amazing I adored my Team lead. I would recommend anyone to work there."
good,Work here if you have to and leave when you can.  They don't pay enough to hire quality people so your coworkers are not the best.  Management is lax and plays favorites.
good,"Pretty much your average retail job. Pretty good about scheduling around school or other jobs. Kind of lonely if you work as a hardlines team member, but closing shift is usually pretty fun."
good,"This place is a very hardworking, dedicated job to work for . There’s no games at this job there’s no playing around , I liked working for target everyone was helpful, flexible & easy to work with . We worked as a team for target I enjoyed my position."
good,great people very understanding and helpful staff and management it can be fast paste sometimes but the training really helps it was amazing and i was so sad to go
good,Advancement opportunities are always available. The hardest part of the job would have to be micromanagement. I would still recommend because of overall positive experience.
good,I wanna grow with the company and get more experience and show my hard working skills and show I can be a good Asset to the target company and my value
good,I would recommend working here just not in the front end. Front end gets very boring very fast. I recommend working sales floor or backend! Ping pong table in breakroom!!
good,I was just a seasonal employee but I had a great time working there. They have flexible hours and management is great there. I thought during the holiday season it would be really stressful but it really wasn’t. They also provided food for employees when they had to work on a holiday.
good,Very Fun Job Everything is understandable you just have to work there for a good week or two and everything is pretty self explanatory .. people very comforting
good,great job great company great paying job benefits I will tell any body to come work for this company we just work at a fast pace job so put your running shoes on
good,I enjoyed my time at target! Management was amazing and i met so many life long friends and people in my life. I only left because i needed more money and hours.
good,If you need a job this is the place for you because the hours are flexible. Guests are mostly nice and coworkers mostly get along. Management could be a little better. They could take care of their employees a little better as well.
good,Todo esta bien es buen trabajo muy bien pagado recomendado
good,"Great company to work for. "
good,"its good place to work. You are able to deal with customers, you got an idea about how to talk with the gust. All team members are very helpful. and they give you a full support."
good,Target in Nashville Tennessee in the Brentwood neighborhood was a very small clean store that's auntie love to come and stop frequently. Are managers were very concerned with cross training and teaching us employers have to be better so we can succeed and maybe advance. The store was always very clean an organized.
good,Nice location bad management and great environment  always something going on and fun people  overnight team is great and motivated. Nice place to work
good,i applied to target as a second job which they were well aware. but they didn’t ever wanna follow the availability i had gave them. i only wanted 10-15 hours i was repeatedly given 30-35 when it was my second job

good,It was a good environment I had a good time working here. Sometimes depending on the supervisor it was challenging but we got through it and the customers were usually good.
good,"I recommend this job; but is very fast pased job. As well is 80% of the time always busy, because target is always busy. It is pretty fun to work at; but the days are long of how busy it can get."
good,"Carts, baskets , trash, sweep restrooms, crush bailer, cashier, self-checkout, clean up throw up, brown stuff that comes out the back side of people, blood, do carryouts, try and fit big items into small cars, and help guests find items there looking for or get someone else on walkie."
good,Excelente target Everett los mejores jefes los mejores compañeros
good,"I enjoyed working at target, I wished there were more helping hands during the work day but it really taught me how to hold my own and be able to handle different typed of situations independently"
good,"Good place to work, warm and friendly people. The store was going through renovations while i was there so it was understandably more hectic than a finished Target."
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Work life balance. Very organized and management is very friendly, break rooms are very clean. You don't have to bring lunch on weekends."
good,"I’ve worked for target for 3 years and I have enjoyed my time there. They have been willing to work with my schedule, And they understand my wants and my needs."
good,"This was a great company to work for, numerous opportunities to grow."
good,"One is required to do hard work, but as long as you can do the simple tasks they ask you to do, you can make the days fly by easily.  Management was easy to work for, and the employees are friendly to a fault."
good,"1. No proper feedback in terms of performance "
good,"I really enjoyed working at Target, it was fun and fast-paced and the supervisors incorporated ways to make the cashiers a bit competitive with getting Red Card signups, but we all still worked together as a team."
good,I was always busy but never bored and the time passed by so fast great employees and work environment absolutely the best place to work. I had a lot of kind people who worked around me it was an easy to deal with job. And it was always fun helping the guests dress for an occasion love the store.
good,I enjoy my team mates. Love the friendly atmosphere and environment. Everyone is really helpful and courteous. Great sales on all products especially the the Target app with Cartwheel which is the Target coupons!!!
good,"I was a General Merchandiser for Target and the place gave a whole new feel to the word ""customers"". Instead of treating customers as buyers for the market, they are instead made to be guests of a house called Target. Everything from working there and being a customer is the best time that I will ever have as a job. Hopefully, I can join back again when given a chance."
good,The people that work here really make it worth going to work. It can be stressful with the amount of customers but they do a great job training so you always know what to do.
good,It was okay I wish it was a little more easy to advance your position but overall it was okay. Keep in mind they cycle people through and don’t care about you personally just if u do a good job
good,It was a good place to work enjoyed it. Interacted with customers and colleagues. Nothing bad to say about this job. Only thing was my kids schedule didn’t  coincide with.
good,The management was bad that and the managers would not communication that would cause the scheduling to suck also the pay was for the little hour I get while there.
good,"A typical day at Target Optical consisted of answering phone calls, assisting customers with glasses selections and verifying insurance to inform the customer on their benefits."
good,"Some days are fast, some are slow, but it's always manageable and the people there rock. More often than not, the guests are refreshing and kind, and easy to please."
good,very  good place to work at I liked it very much  a typical day at work was fun and exciting  management and wokplace culture the most enjoyable part of my job
good,I had fun working here because I was working in my favorite place of the store. I got to help customers find the best technology that fits their life style.

A Target team member position is a recommenced experience for anybody that needs a flexible part time or full time job where you will learn many things about how to contribute to a store's success."
good,"This company has a completely quota based work environment. You need to work very hard, for your entire shift with no down time to reach your numbers."
good,"Es un buen trabajo mientras sea un part-time , buen ambiente de trabajo y accesibilidad para estudiantes"
good,Overnight. I don't think this department exists anymore. It paid the bills. I got to do and learn a bunch of different skills. I couldn't do it again though.
good,Would recommend working for the company I loved the work environment and the culture within the company although it is tough to move up within the company
good,"I worked the Early Morning shift, unloading the truck with a large line of associates, separating boxes to put on pallets. Then use a box cutter to open boxes, place items on shelves. Job was ok, a few staff made you feel welcome, older men that worked there, very set in there ways, you stay away from them you were ok."
good,Target was my first job after high school. Great learning experience for customer service as well as dealing with the public in a proper manner. I got to start from the bottom and work my way up to a manager. Hardest part was keeping up with sales and credit card offers.
good,"Loved my time at Target, enjoyed being a team member and learned a lot working with great leaders and team members.  Loved greeting guests with the best place to be in retail!"
good,"Great manager, great workers, and a pleasant environment. I enjoy being with my coworkers. Although, it's great, the remodeling part was hard and it bought a huge pressure towards me and my coworkers."
good,Target was an amazing place to work I would still be working there had I not had a baby and had to quit. They treat their employees way better than any other place I've ever worked
good,Love this store so much. Everyone there is nice and really great at what they do. We work really hard to exel in our job and want to make customers keep coming back.
good,I worked from beginning of my shift to the end.  Management was great at putting you in areas that you would be strong at.  They were willing to work around your hours that are needed.
good,worked theres while I was in high school. it was very easy and very laid back. they hire all sorts of people so there was a good mix of personalities.
good,"Loved working there, even though I was there for the holidays only, I really enjoyed working there, the management were outstanding. I was there from October to February and I enjoyed the experience."
good,"I work in softlines(clothes), I clock in and go to the fitting room to check my breaks and fitting room shifts then I go to my zone(shoes&acc.) and I tidy things up and makes them look nice, then I go into the back(receiving) and load all of my truck and push them onto the floor. What cannot fit I back/upstock my items."
good,I loved the coworkers but management wasn’t great and hours were not always  guaranteed. No overtime was given. You had to earn sick and vacation days.
good,Target has plenty of fantastic opportunities for growth. I highly recommend this amazing work environment to anyone looking for a great entry level position.
good,I had an amazing experience working as a cashier at Target. I gained excellent communication skills and overall it is a very friendly working environment. Team members help you every time you need them.
good,"It's a nice, friendly environment where hard work is mandatory. The stores get very busy and to stay on top of everything you cant slack off. Overall an enjoyable experience."
good,Target really cares about their employees and it shows with the amount of time they invest in us. The benefits are decent and optional 401k plans help with retirement and they also pay for your education.
good,"Target was not a bad job within itself, In fact the guests were the best part. Management was more concerned with themselves and not necessarily the employees."
good,I liked to work at target i learned to git to know my customers and team player meant something. Working in the food court was awesome poppin that popcorn attracting customers.
good,"I loved working at Target, very family oriented job. They definitely teach you to become more social, I was taken out of my shell. Expect to turn into a jack of all trades, everyone helps each other there."
good,Love Target as a company.  They are good to their employees and always have their backs. I have become a subject matter expert in many areas within my job.  It has helped my growth and development.
good,Alright place to work. Sometimes bad scheduling and hours either too much or too little no in between. A little unorganized at times but overall enjoyable.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target.  It was fast pace, and a physically exertive job.  I am sad that I broke my ankle, and was unable to continue working there."
good,Working here was a great learning experience. It definitely put my abilities under pressure to the test. When I was a month in working retail for the first time; management scheduled me to open on Black Friday while also expected to train a new employee. There is a lot of cooperation and team effort involved in these big corporations. I enjoyed the people I worked with as everyone seems to be on the same page. I would suggest this field of work to anyone still in school as the hours are flexible and the community is very easy going.
good,Great place to work very flexible and able to swap shifts a lot to pick up extra hours. Time and half on Holliday’s also. Overall can’t complain great pay and can learn a lot
good,"Super nice, super relaxed, except on black friday. Superiors are really nice and caring, great place to work if you are in school. Highly suggested, honestly"
good,It was fast paced and a good working environment. I had great hours and a lot of days of work . The people were friendly and nice and organized.........
good,its place is awesome to work. they have great hours and the people work there are the nicest people. the only downfall I would admit is that they dnt have great shifts avail.
good,Target is a good place to work at because of all the opportunities there. Unfortunately for most of the positions their part-time which means you're going to be getting part-time hours at minimum wage
good,"My fellow employees were amazing and nice people, My supervisors were lenient and very helpful. I really enjoyed getting the chance to meet and help new people daily."
good,This was my first job and I was very excited to work here. I was also happy with the fact that they didn’t start me out at minimum wage. The Target team was always friendly and made coming to work enjoyable.

good,Target is on the rise with new ways of managing the store. Individuals are responsible for every aspect of their departments and they want you to do everything possible to maintain them.
good,The job really sucks managers are in fair and don’t allow you to be promoted no matter how hard you work. I was there for a year and got a 4 cent raise for all the hard work I did
good,This company treated me very well and I can not express how much I enjoyed my time while staying with them. The management was very competent and very good with communication within the company.
good,good place to work if you like to work and get good pay and a lot of time off great benifits. the shifts are 12 hours but if you do the week shift they will be 10  hour days

good,"You feel like you are apart of a team and it is a place were you can grow as a person as well as an employee.Good people they hire, they really care you as a person."
good,the work place is fast paced and you always want to be on top of things. while working sales floor you do get pulled aside by customers and often called to the front to help ring people out.
good,"good pay, good hours, easy going workplace. work is easy equipment is easy to get use to. 20 percent discount is great customers are really nice I love it"
good,The job is really fun. I learned a lot of stuff there and the employees are very friendly. The guest for the most part are friendly and the whole work place just seems like a right fit for anyone

good,"great work space, flexible schedule, good management. always made sure to give out breaks, made sure i was educated about my work duties before going on the floor."
good,Work was seasonal. very fun. Would totally work here again but just in a different position. Can be very fast paced but that is the type of work environment I like.
good,"very nice place, Managers and coworkers made you feel like family. super clean place and very organized. always trying to give their customers the best experience possible."
good,Target has an uplifting and enthusiastic group of team members focused on improving the overall customer service experience for its shoppers through above average customer interactions and sales floor product merchandising. This team is lead by a group of supervisors dedicated to maximizing the potential of their team and improving store image. It is an organized and uplifting work environment.
good,the environment is very friendly. they are big on safety.  there are a lot of opportunities for growth in the building. senior leadership is very helpful.
good,This was honestly the best job I've ever had! The management is so good to their employees. They have competitions to see who can do something better or faster and they give gift cards to the person that wins.
good,If you work hard and efficient the workplace is pleasant. some of the team leads know how to lead a team and others do not but they are still kept in their position
good,the work place culture was very well relaxed.it was very collaborative. the environment  felt like home. Constantly everyone laughing and smiling.I felt like it was family oriented
good,"Great place too work. I loved working there.Fun, hard work, fast pace. Learning experience.Have to be on time. Theres a point system.Have to be welcoming"

good,"As a team member for 4 years, I worked a lot of departments including the market team and  produce team. It was a good place to work with nice people."
good,Target was a good beginning experience for me to enter the workforce. Working at Target taught me how to interact with customers and how to handle money. I recommend it to many people for a first job.
good,It is a fun environment to work in. Training is easy to understand and to pick up on. Management is great with working around school schedules when possible.
good,Was able to learn everything at a steady pace and they provided a comfortable workplace and my co workers and boss were very respectful and would help me when i needed help
good,"Loved working at target there for 9 years, Just needed more hours than what were available, really enjoyed the customers did not like the mandatory thanksgiving work day where they advertised it was voluntary when it was not."
good,"Be honest, you know that you go to Target every week.  So get paid to be there.  Team is fun and friendly.  Guests may cause gray hair.  Team members have a lot of authority to make price changes, etc to accommodate guest needs.   Predictably, Christmas season and Back to School are VERY busy and stressful."
good,I love working for Target! They are a great company and very focused on a great work/life balance. They do a great job teaching and getting you ready for your task at hand.
good,I love the work environment and management team! They are always so encouraging and helpful. I have personally had a great experience with going to management and requesting any changes needed.
good,"Target was a great place to work at at the time because I was going to school and they were really flexible with my schedule."
good,"Target is an interactive company in which I learned how to be a multitasking person because you are always moving, giving excellent customer service and fixing merchandise. It is an oriented job at selling, and it is very exciting."
good,"It was a good experience.   Overall the company delivers a high level of respect to it's employee.   However it should raise the minimum wages some.  It still is a lot of hard work,  from the logistics area to the cart attendant."
good,"During the time I worked there, I was working another job and they we're very understanding. My hours were flexible, but never weekends. I prefer to keep my weekends for my family. I started as a stock person, and quickly moved  up to backroom associate. I routinely received a increase in salary, during the year I worked there. It was a great place to work, great atmosphere, great people."
good,"Working early morning shifts unloading trucks and doing inventory was my favorite part of working here. Managers were cool, and customers normally know exactly what they came there for."
good,"wonderful job place ,  one of my favorite jobs I ever had , breaking down the stock and sorting it by section was fun , then we would stock the items accordingly . also backstock  items that couldn't fit on shelves"
good,"Target has a corporate mentality and they do not treat their employees like family.  A team atmosphere isn't promoted there and the employees work very long hours on their feet, often injured, just to maintain their jobs."
good,"Working for target was so much fun and I honestly learned all the tricks and tips to saving money there. Not only that, but the employee discounts were amazing as well. Definitely would work for target again if I had the chance."
good,"It was an exciting time at  theTarget Corp in the 80's "
good,"Great coworkers, very productive job, good pay for starting off as sales associate. Had very good hours as a seasonal employee, and had good time off as well."
good,its good place to start off with a job because you learn to use the cashier and gain responsibilities. You meet new people everday. Although holidays due get busy the pay and hours are good.
good,If you have good management at your Target there is no better retail based business to work for. If your management sucks the Target can be a terrible place to work for with inconistent hours.
good,Target is a company that is very strict when it comes to the rules and regulations of its employees. But at the same time they are very flexible when it comes to hours worked weekly.
good,The scheduling is awful and if you have to call out ever they cut your hours. I had a death in the family once and they cut my hours a lot. Target is a place that keeps its employees by paying well and the discount.
good,"The work was decent and easy to do once you got into the routine of things. As a trainee, you learn about all the departments responsibilities and take part in helping each department (not including food related departments)"
good,"Nice people who are easy to talk to, not too difficult of a job, patient managers, good place to start off working if you’re in high school or college"
good,Great team. Human Resources is open to workers. They take care of the employees and try to make a fun and enjoyable working environment. I was pleased with my houses
good,always busy nice people good amount of workload free food sometimes customers are usually nice unloading can be stressful at times stocking was cool..
good,On a typical day going into work. I would go to my register and set up my register and greet people. I exchanged money along with giving them the correct change.
good,"A typical day at work was being able to constantly organize shelves, support the cashier department, and assist with customers on a daily basis. I was a nice work place in where i would constantly be getting helped by other of my colleagues and we would all work together in unison to keep everything in target moving smoothly."
good,From the start you need to be able to communicate with guest to be able to find out exactly what they are looking for. Having doing all of this you also need to be able to stock shelves and anything else that is asked.
good,"The pay is GREAT! The managers are really nice and helpful but the team leads could surely use more improvement. Employees there are all willing to help each other out to complete tasks. They are super advanced with the way they do things and the devices they use to check the price, availability, location etc. of an item is extremely helpful"
good,Really enjoyed working here while I had the time. Thankful I got to learn a bunch of new things and how the store work when it comes to setting up. I would come back if I could
good,"Management at this point here is terrible. There is no structure and the employees are rarely"
good,"It was a nice place to work, would have liked more overtime. The atmosphere was relaxed, but could be stressful. It could be busy, but also slow, depending on the time of year and day. It was my favorite job without a doubt!"
good,"Target is a great place to work with decent pay, flexible hours, and a starbucks right next to you. Would have loved to stay if I hadnt been a seasonal employee"
good,"Management was proactive in on the job training, with good supervision. Supervisors were supportive when customers wanted expired coupons to be accepted for purchased."
good,"At Target it’s all about getting the most done, out of the least time possible. If you’re a fast, efficient, and versatile worker, then target is a job that will challenge your strengths. I learned a lot at Target. It was fun."
good,Great for a part time job. Make sure you let them know that you're interested in moving up and making better for yourself. Hit or miss on the management side of things. Some are great some are terrible. Very consistent on breaks and lunches
good,You get paid more than decent for the work you do. The staff is friendly and always helpful. asking for time off is easy if needed. They are diverse and kind.
good,"Love working with good people of all backgrounds and just learning how to use certain skills people skills communication skills team leading team building good place to really learn a lot on retail , customer service , register skills , produce knowledge , clothes and all electrons you really learn a lot ! To help prepare you for other jobs !"
good,Target is a great place of employment. You collaborate as a team to achieve sales goals and execute floor plans. Awesome place to work. The management is great and they are very flexible.
good,"A typical day at Target was to greet customers at the Cellular department. Answer any questions that customers had about the deals for each cell company (sprint, verizon & AT&T). The hardest part about the position was there weren't a lot of people working there, so they weren't always understanding of taking time off for classes."
good,"At target, pay was great, there are a lot of benefits, everyone is very nice and patient, and you're never bored. There are lots of breaks too. There's plenty of different positions in the store as well."
good,This was a good starter job. I worked at a training location which meant rotating management. Some better than others but overall a lot of good experiences.
good,"working for target was probably one of the best jobs I had. I was making 15 an hr, the only problem is you don't get that many hours but overall a great company to work for. Very nice people."
good,"Target is a grate place to work for,flexible,lots of opportunity to move up in the company, grate costumer service."
good,Very relaxed environment with a vast variety of different cultures and people working together. Great place to connect with people and to advance social interaction skills
good,It was a fun place to work in college and you can work your way up the ladder. Hours were great at first then got horrible. Management wasn't great but it was bearable. Pays very well.
good,Great company to work for. Team run. Always helping others. Covering shifts for one another. Good upper management and co workers. Great Pay. Great Hours.
good,Target was awesome! Lots if incentives and the pay was very good! I really enjoyed working here over the two years! I would definitely recommend working here.
good,"I worked at the Target in Mooresville, NC as a Cashier. The job was awesome! I worked there seasonally so unfortunately I didnt stay long. Training was a lot of fun.  They sent me and another girl off through the store to find certain items (produce, items with locks on them, and alcohol). And when we got back we learned how to ring up the difficult items to prepare us for working alone. We trained for two hours and they sent us to registers. (I know, sounds terrible, but we learned a lot that way) The team and management was always so friendly and willing to help on the drop of a dime. The walkie talkies were great because youd simply say ""Hey team, can you tell me where I'd find *random item*"" and people jumped to help you. You had a 15 minute break every two hours (PAID), and a 30 minute break in the middle of your shift if you worked more than a 6 1/2 hour shift (unpaid). I loved that we got paid $12.00 an hour for such an easy job. Was able to save up over $1500 in the 2 months I worked there. The break room was huge, had like 4 fridges, 30 tables, 4 microwaves, a flat screen TV, board games, outlets by every table, and they even had a snack bar! everyday they had a new snack out for employees to enjoy on their breaks. and every Saturday they ordered in from either a pizza place or a sub place. On Thanksgiving there were huge platters of food. I think my favorite part of working there was that they didnt discriminate. You could color your hair whatever color, wear any face piercings, and no one judged you. The saying ""good management= good employees= happy customers"" is"
good,I loved helping customers. I absolutely love this stor and enjoyed spending most of my tome there! Stocking the products keeps you very busy and I love that about a job! There is always something to do!
good,Target was my very first retail experience in my career. I have really enjoyed the people and the environment. Every day is new and exciting. Love the experience it has provided me.
good,I enjoyed working at Target and gave me a chance to grow with customer service as well as the opportunity to meet more people. it gave me a chance to grow and expand my job growth
good,"Target is a quick paced environment.   Great people to work with.  you are trained in many areas and tasks.  Starting pay is competitive, hours are flexible."
good,"After i clock in and get my equipment needed for the day, I report to the sales floor and straighten up my designated area a little. For the rest of my shift, i help guests while making sure my area stays clean and the items that need to be put back are placed back in their proper location. Management is very good so if you need any direction or anything, they are more than happy to help. It's a very laid-back work environment but it is also fast-paced. The hardest part of the job is making sure you pace yourself so you can get as much done in your shift. The guests are definitely the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,The day goes as me and a couple of co-workers in the same department unloading trucks. Then place them in the section they are in. Other times we would decorate the store before the consumers see.
good,Working there was great for the time. During the holidays things are super busy so it was a little bit hectic but it was a fun place to come to work and it was easy work.
good,"It was okay, the work load was light and however we always had something to do. The hours were overnight which we rough but they were manageable. Its a nice place to work."
good,Not bad just slow. Learned a lot about sales and appearance.  My time spent here was brief the security made me safe working at night. The company is very optimistic
good,"Learned how to face a front end of the store, ring up customers, assist costumers with finding items they are looking for. Layaway and returns and store policy."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me punching in and checking with my supervisor for my position of the day. I find a device, sign into it, then I find a cart, scan the barcode and start picking or packing."
good,"Target is more of a job to have while going to school, or simply trying to get away from home for a few hours, unless you work for management then you actually have full time hours like a regular job would 20-40hrs a week, sometimes I only worked 12-16hrs a week."
good,Nice place to work. I have learned a great amount on how to function alongside otherwise and in collaboration with others. I now have highly capable social skills.
good,One of my favorite jobs that I have ever had. I really loved this job and I miss it so much but the pay would have to go up for me to return I now work for the government but would love to have this as a part time job if I had the extra hours to do so.
good,its nice to work at a place where you can get discounts on the things you buy a lot. its also nice to work at a place with a lot of people your age so you can make friends.
good,"Decent company to work for, not guaranteed full time hours. Competitive starting pay. Not much opportunity for advancement. Communication within management is poor."
good,I offered great customer skills that target help take to the next level! They offered consistent training on various phones and great competition environment!
good,Target is one of the best cultures I have ever worked in. I greatly enjoyed my time working with them. I learned a lot of useful selling skills and made friends.

good,"Its usually busy but stressful. Everyone is really nice to work with and they pay good. You can get more hours the more departments you work in, Its a very versatile job."
good,"The training was quick.But they offer more training if you feel you need it. You can get cross trained to do more area. Key thing to remember: always ask how you are doing to the managers, and how can you improve,they see it as a sign that you want to stay"
good,I loved working for target it was a very positive environment...they train their employees very well and you can move up quickly...they are very informative and tell employees everything they need to know..very fair place to work
good,The experience with target was a good one. The managers customers all was a pleasure . I would highly recommend this job to anyone . Good pay good hours .

good,Work place was good just to far to commute and the workers were good people .I just wish i had a car at the time but to bad i didn't. I would work there again
good,I wouldn't choose to work for another retail brick and mortar company other than Target.  Great team culture and college management training program help to develop you as a leader.
good,i worked 11 hours day at inbound for target manufactured goods. The pay is ok i always thought they should pay a little more due to the atmosphere. I would recommend it.

good,I really enjoy working at Target. There is always something to keep me busy so I never get bored.

good,I did not really work there fort hat long but the advocate position was pretty cool being able that you can actually talk to customers and find them instead of just waiting in one aisle for them to come to you
good,This was a job that I had while I was going to school. This was not a career path or a professional level job. I pursued career advancement opportunities after I graduated.

good,"I used to be a sales floor, I would help clean and re-merchandise all items. Create new outfits and style the floor. I also would be back up cashier and would help costumers."
good,Target is suitable for fast paced workers who enjoy worked with customer service and other employees to get the job done. Managers treat you with much respect as well.
good,Working here was a good experience. The other employees where nice and straight forward with me at all times. I was not able to make a huge difference in the store because I was not there that long.
good,Cool but I wish that the management was better the managers have favoritism and are mean st times. Everything else is cool I loved it and great pay easy breezy customers

good,some of the managers can be quite rude they tell the workers to put makeup on because we don't look decent enough and sometimes they can just be rude depends on how they're feeling.

good,It was nice working here. I would definitely work here again if the time arrived. I would recommend others to work here and they are very nice to one another.
good,"Greet customers on a daily basis. Respond to customer questions and request in a prompt and efficient manner. Complete all cleaning, stocking, and organizing tasks in assigned sales area."

I gathered carts during busy holiday nights and I was recommended by my Team Lead for permanent hire."
good,"I really liked the structure of the jobs performed. Every job had it's own certain steps. It was fast paced, and very hard on the muscles and bones. Worth it. It really was like a team depending on what ""team"" you were on. I was on the lowest of ""teams"". Still do-able."
good,Working for a factory or distribution center is NOT for everyone. The hours are long and it's a physical strain on the body. The pay is well but if you're older this may not be the job for you.

good,Great place! Received lots of training (and lots of icrecream)! Management really cares about you. Even the customers seem happier to be shopping there.
good,Had to move quickly at all times in order to obtain product efficiency and make rates of shipping out orders as well as training new hires in all departments
good,Very Productive and helping Company that interested anyone who is willing to join the company. I have a balanced work and life while I am working for the company.
good,I had no issues with Target. I was in and out. My shifts were short and I only worked one to two days a week. I never had any runs with anyone and I rarely talk to the staff
good,"During my time at Target I worked a seasonal job. I worked with the night crew from 4am until truck was unloaded. It was very easy, very laid back, and very slow paced. It was ok to take your time and everyone enjoyed talking and getting to know one another while working. Unloading truck was probably the hardest part, but it wasn't even that hard, and then restocking the shelves was the easiest. I would recommend the seasonal job at Target to anyone that was looking for a quick and easy job to work."
good,"Enjoyed working with the people that I had to see every day. All my bosses were very friendly, and would do anything to make sure that it was a successful and fun loving work place"
good,this was a fun job. honestly i would totally re apply if i had the opportunity to. staff was always cool and everyone was super friendly. only problem was that there were a lot of lazy people who just wouldn't do anything or wouldn't do work outside of their own area and the backroom got way too backed up
good,Working in target was a fun place to work and I have experience a lot in this job. I was doing soft lines and I was doing visual merchandise . But it was kind of stressful.
good,Your coworkers are fun to be around even the managers. I learned how to identify fake coupons from scammers. Management is very well done they all know how to do their job. The job only gets hard when you are short on cashiers but they always make sure you get the help needed.
good,The work is somewhat fast paced but it is not stressful. most of it is organizing and facing isles by section and helping customers find items. some days are more fast paced than others.
good,"For a seasonal job, you shouldn't expect much. And I didn't. I met some new people, learned some new skills, but retail is retail, and you have to know going in that your life and your family and your values mean ZIP to a billion-dollar corporation. Expect to be asked to work as long as you can stand and as long as its not overtime. "
good,"Fast-pacing job. A lot of working together with other people. And also alone...."
good,Great place to work and start off. Some people are really nice and practice the core values of the company. It was a very family oriented type of environment.
good,"Working either shipping or stock/flow was great if you like early morning shifts and leaving work early. Shipping was normally a 8 hour shift from 4am to 12pm and flow/stock was 4am to 8am sometime offering overtime. Shipping supervisor wasn't all great and always listened to one sided ""stories"" thus leading to some people dropping out of the shipping. Flow supervisor is GREAT, and listens to all his teams mates and works with you."
good,"Target is awesome. Some Guests are super warm and friendly, while others are not as forgiving. As a Cashier, use of the System to complete transactions is your main function, with a dual function of selling RED Cards to everyone who walks through the door. The leadership system is very well-structured, and most of the people above me were very nice and welcoming, like many of the other Team Members."
good,"I loved working here. Everyone was very friendly, and there was never a boring day. It is very fast-paced which I also loved so time would never be an issue for me. The only thing I didn't like was the demand and harshness for opening up new RED card accounts."
good,Target is a great place to work. They focus a lot on promoting from within which gives plenty of team members a chance to grow and learn many positions.
good,"i loved working at target, the team members were like family, every knew each others names and would always say hello. it was a quick paced place to work"
good,I worked at target all through out high school and summer of my first year of college. It was a realistic commitment for a student and I would definitely recommend it to other students.
good,The main negative is the push that you get to try to get people to sign up for the debit cards or the Target Visa cards. They changed the benefits of having them so people are not as likely to want them.
good,I enjoyed working at target in altamonte springs florida. It was great  for me at the time when i was at college. I never graduated so I wish I stayed
good,target is a great company. cares about its team members but sometimes the executives in store forget they need retail experience. other than that i enjoy the job completely.
good,"Helping customers, using cash register, stocking, customer services, greeting customers, I've learned how to use a cash register, some of the employers were friendly."
good,I loved working for Target. Very flexible with your schedule. Management was great. The only thing i didn't like was how obsessed they are with red cards.

good,"Target is an organization that teaches teamwork as the center of the operation. A typical day is like a relay race. We start off with the upmost sense of urgency so when the next team comes in, they can take off with a head start. I am continuing to learn that accountability is a big part of molding great employees. The hardest part of the job is staying ahead in the face of unforeseen circumstances, yet the most enjoyable part is conquering on those days."
good,If you like communication with guests? Helping out and being a part of a big team? This is the job for you! This is a face pace job that will have you busy at all times!

good,"I enjoyed working at Target, it was a very competitive enviroment but it made for a very fast paced and productive day. I left Target because you can only move into management if you have a degree."
good,Target has developed a culture of inclusiveness and has fostered that culture. The managers work had to instill the values of guests coming first and it will not change.
good,"Great culture. Many opportunities for growth, movement and advancement within the company. Must be flexible with scheduling and relocation options in order to achieve longevity with the company"
good,"Target is for the first-time job seeker mostly young adults still at home or the part time seeker who just wants a little extra change, unless you’re coming in with your degree and wish to climb the ladder.  Unfortunately, it has been forced to change a lot of what use to be fun to compete with the rest of the big chain stores... for a part time job yes, but not for a job that your looking to support your family on, at least not at this time"
good,Every day was a new experience. They provided training in each area of the store and provided the opportunity to lead a large team in a dynamic retail environment.
good,"Restocking shelves can be physically demanding. However, at the end of the day you feel like you accomplished something.  Target is a great place to work at and I would work there again."
good,I had a good experience working at Target . The Manager and the Supervisor were always caring and helping the workers. They remind us to take our breaks and lunches on time. I learnt a lot while working at Target.

good,I don not wish to write about my time at target. I am grateful for the opportunities that were given to me. I am also grateful for the skills and new things i learned a target. Target was my blessing
good,Very fast paced environment. Very customer based. Would consider going back if they didn't just offer minimum wage and it didn't take me 3 years to go up a dollar.
good,This was a very fun job. I learned a lot and this was my first job. I learned how to train people and  how to be a leader. I was working overnight and than switched over to 4am. I also learned how to adapt to change.
good,Target for an overnight position was very difficult. I could not attend any family events due to the hours but the job was rewarding at times. We unloaded a semi and stocked as much product before the store opened.
good,Very good workplace environment. The staff were nice and were always willing to work in a team. The experience gathered was amazing. Management was also very understanding.
good,"Working for Target  is a great new experience that I believe was great learning to better yourself for a career. To me target is not a career job however , it is very helpful and fun."
good,"I had worked there for 4 years and I unloaded trunks and stocked shelf's. For the most part I liked the because I was able to listen to my music, start work super early(had to be to at 4am) and a workout.I thought of it like a gym that paid me. with that in mind the job is very physically demanding but on the bright side I lost almost a 100lbs with target."
good,"Job tasks and goals were clearly defined. Management encouraged positive workplace culture and team member growth. The largest focus was customer service, from filling the shelves to assisting guests on the sales floor through check out."
good,"My typical day at work would be to start to work as soo as I clock in. I've learned in my six years of working in the North Bergen Target is to keep to yourself; don't share any personal information to anyone. Management is very detailed and knowledgeable of their duties. There's a wide culture base. In my opinion, the hardest part is lifting heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part is working with awesome team members in my department."
good,I felt as though it was a great experience and I would highly recommend the company to others looking for a retail sales representative position. It was great.
good,This is a fast growing company and there are always opportunities to grow. I loved being on the sales floor helping customers out. I even had the opportunity to watch the floor while the GSTL was on break a few times.

good,i worked on the line unloading the truck then went out to the floor and stocked. I learned a lot about being polite to customers and about how to stock right. The management was fine. Target was a very good workplace to be at. Only hard part about target would be having to be in the freezer for an extended period of time. I enjoyed everything about target.

good,"Worked very early shifts, at 4 am. I unloaded trucks and put the items off the truck onto the a pallet and set them in the area where the would be put onto a shelf. After unloading we go stock up the shelves."
good,A typical day at work involved helping customers on the salesfloor. Customers could either approach you or were approached by me and were willing to see if they needed any further help or questions about the item. Management was very helpful if I had questions and the walky talky system helped provide additional backup and help if trouble answering customer's particular questions. Most enjoyable part was helping a customer all the way from beginning to end.
good,My first job taught me time and management skills. It also taught me the value of MY dollar instead of depending on my parents. working at target is a great way to build people skills and team building skills.

good,Days were often hectic and long but rewarding.  They gave you the tools necessary to complete tasks and you never felt like you were stranded with any task or job.  The management typically is fresh out of college business students that do not have much retail experience working outside their office.  They learned quickly though to trust the ones out front and listen.

good,The atmosphere of working at Target is great. I was able to walk up to anybody if I had a question or concern. They really know how to treat their workers
good,I would walk into work and help customers. I asked my co workers if they needed help. I made sure the carts were all lined up and everything was clear of the front doors for safety.

good,A typical day at work wouldn't be hard at all especially when everyone is so nice to you. I think it taught me patience and helped get better at interacting with customers. Managment was very flexible with my school schedule. The hardest part of the day is when it would be slow. I would think the most enjoyable part of the day is interacting with customers.
good,"Target is a very busy place to work. You have to be very open to work with people. When customers come in they ask for help which is great because I love helping, but if you don't like being around a lot of people it isn't the job for you."
good,I think the only thing that gets to me is dealing with the nasty guest. I really enjoy the team members that I work fine. It is a good company that offers good benefit.

good,"a typical day at work consisted of doing pulls for customers and refreshing the floor. I learned a lot from this job for example how to hustle in my step. The management was very good always pointed me in the right direction, the workplace culture was super diverse which was amazing. Hardest part of the job was probably juggling all of the task at hand at once but you get it after a while. The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of super fun, hard working team."
good,After working at this company I've learned a lot on how to treat other with maximum dignity and respect. I've also learnt how to work as a team and put a fast fun and friendly approach to it. Management can definitely aim towards doing a better job because there is always room for improvement.
good,Great place to work! I would suggest it to anyone who needs a new job or is looking for a good first job to have. Pays well and teaches you great lessons you need.
good,Target is on the cutting edge of digital innovation and brick and mortar retail. The company is always adapting and changing to increase their long-term viability.
good,"Assisting customers with problem resolutions instruction, and direction.

The management at this company was very supportive in teaching me a new skill."

The management was awesome. They were really helpful with working with my schedule. They really made each and every shift fun to work. My co-workers were really cool. Everyone was able to work together and had no problems. I would say the hardest part of the job was working on holidays.

good,Know how to handle people when they ask where different things was in the store. Learned how to stocked shelf and was a cashier
good,"The very moment of stepping inside, there would always be something to do. Whether to step outside for shopping carts, or setting up products on shelves in my department, not a single moment is to be wasted. It was always time to get some work done, not a second spent on being inefficient to the job. My co-workers now the same, we render assistance when help is needed most. To know that sometimes we can't all do it by ourselves unites the team in its effectiveness. Free to express concerns or opinions, management allows us to speak our minds on whatever we so feel the need to address. However, the difficulty I face at work is when there's actually nothing to do. These things happen, but it doesn't slow me down at all. To know I've done my part in helping achieve higher goals is a reward in itself."

The hardest part of my job was going to get carts outside, only because the Arizona summer heat is unbearable. The most enjoyable part of my job was speaking with all of the guests."
good,This was a different Target Store I worked at than the one I work at now.  The typical day at work was the same as it is now and all of my experiences between the two stores are similar.
good,i loved working here but since it was a mega store there was no time to do anything but work which helps the day go by really fast

I work on scheduling, interviewing to help hire, performance management, customer service, maintaining stock and minimizing shrinkage, The most difficult part of my job is working with so many personalities and schedules (It is like a huge puzzle), however, this is also the most rewarding part of the job as well because I like to solve problems and make a positive impact on others.

If one department is dragging behind, we all are.  So, we help each other out by picking up the slack and making sure that we all can get our jobs done as quickly as possible.  The management is much better here than many other places, with the few exceptions of those newbies that want to run the place without learning the ins and outs.  Short cuts won't get this company anywhere, so take the time to listen to those of us that have worked here for years and learn how to work in all the departments before trying to do things your way."
good,Target is a very good place to work for. The work environment is fun and happy. The staff treats everyone with respect and there were relatively few issues during my tenure.

good,I went to work for Target because I loved shopping there.  I had a fantastic manager and great co-workers.  I worked there part-time and they were very accommodating because I had another job during the day.  I love the store brand.  It's bright and colorful and makes you feel good when you  walk in the door.  Customer Service is  extremely important and I am glad I was able to be a part of that.
good,"I found it an excellent place to work and to grow and advance.  I learned what it takes to be the middleman between ""corporate"" and employees.  The hardest part and the most enjoyable part were keeping my bosses happy while keeping the people who worked under me happy.  Earning everyone's respect on both sides is the main thing I will take away"
good,the work environment is light and friendly. Management always has a task for associates to complete in a timely manner so there is no down time.
good,Lead a front end team to achieve weekly goals while providing that great customer experience. Help solve any customer issues.
good,"A typical day at work consists of meeting as a group and going over the daily deals, following with opening our lanes, greeting guests and completing their transactions. I learned people skills and how to be a more fast and efficient worker. Co-workers sometimes found things to complain about but overall very welcoming. Hardest part of working at target is trying to promote Red cards because so many people already have them....The most enjoyable thing about the job is dealing with a wide range of people."

I learned how to drive for sales and put the guests first, the management is very productive , consistent and they ensure that your assigned task gets done. My coworkers were satisfying and I enjoyed working with all of them, the hardest part of my job was keeping an adequate amount of carts inside the building on a very busy day while staying alert for a register call, being that there is usually one closing Cart Attendant. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting the guests, helping find items and contributing to their needs."
good,I work as a cashier at Popeye's chicken I also made order so they can get out in the order in which they where received worked in the drive thur I also did some minor cooking as well
good,"stocking the back room with merchandise "
good,"A fast paced environment where the majority of your job involves trying to find something to do and how to do your job. With abbreviated training, you will be left standing in the wind by your supervisors (the many that you do have) and unexpectedly punished when trying to take initiative or try to learn a new skill."
good,"Great first job, coworkers and managers a like were great to work with. Fast paced and consistent as all be. Looking for retail? look no further."
good,"Early morning hours to unload a semi-truck which was very fast paced. Stocked shelves with the products working along side great co-workers as well as management.

good,"Great company, very great work environment. Team members get along well with the customers. Hardly ever got complaints about how are services."
good,I was a cashier at Target for 13 months and loved my time here. I made the very unfortunate mistake of leaving due to being persuaded by another company. Our team was genuinely a family and constantly looked out for one another. Every few months our store sent out volunteers to help with various projects whether it was going to read Dr. Seuss books to elementary school classes or packing boxes of food for hungry families in my community. It was definitely a rewarding experience. The only negative remark that I would have to say is that sometimes your hours from week to week could be sporadic; one week you would get 30 hours and the week after you may only get 11 but as long as you do your job well you will see a decent amount every week.
good,Target was a great job to work in a seasonal position. They really made you feel like part of the team and cared about your well-being.
good,"Due to the various areas I chose to cross train at and did well enough in to cover at, a typical day at Target for me consisted of store-wide coverage for back up, lunches, breaks, or any other needed help. Most of the top bosses allow me to work of the grid since they trust that I will get my job done while helping the rest of store. On rare occasions when needed I have had to cover them as well."
good,"Everyday is different, there are many challenges that will force you to be resilient and adaptable. Great opportunity for leadership development."
good,"Target is really making some great improvements right now. The work is hard, but it's innovative and exciting. It's nice to be part of a successful transformation."

good,"My team and I would come in and start our task every morning.  My task consists of scanning empty item locations on the sales floor to see if they are in our stockroom or need to be ordered and get them pulled from the stockroom or request an order from the warehouse.  I learned how to work with a scanner and work at a productive pace.  My coworkers are amazing, we all can depend and rely on each other.  We know what to do if one isn't there and we try our best to get our task list done.  The hardest part of the job I say is time management.  Sometimes due to traffic in the store it'll set your time table back a few, but to keep going so maybe you can reach the time goal before you take a break, lunch or leave for the day.  The most enjoyable part of the job I say is meeting new people."

good,"Working for Target was a great experience. I loved working with the team of great people and it made it enjoyable to be there. Even after the store closed, we still worked as a team, my boss gave me an opportunity to work for him again at no frills. I worked with him in many different environments and jobs and I was sad to leave."

good,"Most days were busy, even on our slow days our managers found something for us to do even if its not something we would normally do or maybe have never done, some managers are nice and laidback while others had different rules. The hardest part of my job was usually on the busy days while I would be the only one at Pizza Hut and there would be 3 other coworkers working Starbucks just standing around and would not help they would just watch. I honestly didn't enjoy my job there but I dealt with it to make sure I could take care of my bills and family at home. I didn't learn much from Target except coworkers that didn't know me judged me by what they heard and that no matter how much I helped my coworkers there I still wouldn't get any returned favors, I used skills I had already learned from previous jobs!"

good,Target was a great company-but it had horrible management. As a result-closed.
good,"There was a lack of communication in some areas, but overall a good environment. I was treated with respect and encouraged to reach out to management with questions, but I know others didn't have as good an experience."

I learned to keep a certain pace and I also learn how advance my communication skills and it made me and be more organize. Also I learned to overcome any challenges that came my way. My co-workers was friendly and fun and entertaining off site, but on site they were more business and organized. The hardest part of the job was falling behind in your work because it was so much traffic coming in and out of the store and it becomes hard to catch up with your other duties. The most enjoyable part of the job are seeing the guest happy when they find the things they need."
good,"A typical day at work for me is going in the store before it closes. Interacting with the guest, and pretty much waiting for them to leave so that I can start the major part of my job. I separate all of my re-shop into departments and then put it back onto the sales floor. It  is a lot of work but it keeps me busy. So busy that the night flies by quickly. What I have learned from this job is that everyone has their own method of working and someone's else's work method might not be right for you. You have to find your own method of getting the job done that is fast but at the same time correct. The management team is always there to listen when you have a problem that cannot be settled by the team leads or whoever is in charge of the departments. The hardest part of the job is when the holiday seasons roll around and the store is the busiest and there is a lot of re- shop and it doesn't get all done. The most enjoyable part of the job are my co- workers. They come from all walks of life. It is a very diverse company and it's nice to know that so many people can come together to make a business continue to grow."

As a result, I want to be more engaged with my coworkers and manage my own business that much better."
good,"I loved this place, the people and the customers I encountered.I enjoyed being able to work on my own to complete tasks assigned, and having the opportunity to prove my ability to take charge and research and solve problems that the customers might have had."

I also checked my lane to ensure that it was safe and that my conveyor belt worked as well. I greeted the guest with a smile and even held small conversations with them while scanning and bagging items. This job is where I learned the true meaning of Great Customer Service. Fast Fun and Friendly was the motto and with that motto I managed to move from a cashier to a Service Desk representative. There at the service desk I handled returns, normal check outs, customer complaints, and refunds according to policy. My management was great on carrying out task of the job but just in the social respect for others my management team weighed poorly. There was always small bickering among the team leaders and attitudes were not friendly at all. My co-workers added on to the nonsense by gossiping and continuing the senseless behavior. The hardest part of the job was dealing with and listening to higher authority stab at each others necks with derogatory comments.

good,"In the summer of 2006 I was accepted by the St. Louis Internship program to work as a intern while developing some strong professional workplace skills. Working as a intern during the summer was a new thing for me. Although, I found it to be the most fun I may have had in the summer in a while! Some would say that working in a warehouse setting in the summer is a bit much, but for me I was rather young at the time but found many things to keep me busy throughout the day. Management here was quite different than what I was use to. Since I was an intern I was given numerous opportunities to show ocular proof that I was the right person for the job. My skills there were proven worthy, since then, I have maintained a close and personal relationship with my supervisor at the time. Who would have knew, that I would leave behind such great impact!"
good,I loved working here because everybody got a long very well and the discounts were good especially since all my daughters summer clothes came from there and the breaks were good and even the food on my lunch breaks from target was good.
good,"At work I would usually be in apparel. I would be responsible for folding tables, sizing and finger spacing the racks in every department. I was also responsible for helping the front end by cashiering if they were in back up. I loved the people, and they make everyday fun."
good,i was seasonal here so i dont know much. ring through customers with a smile on your face. stock up candy.
good,"Overall Target is a decent place to work and to learn hands on in the retail fast, fun, and friendly industry. I would not recommend it as a career."

good,"When I first started I was on the registers, the I moved to guest services and finally I went to electronics and recieved a pay raise. I learned how to be paient with people in a fast paced stressful evirovment. Management was excellent."
good,"Target was a fun place to work, I was in the Electronics Department where I met a lot of different cool new people. I learned a lot about the retail business here. I must admit, it has given me valuable experience in retail. The management was tough, they had very high expectations for us that we had to met. A lot of co-workers were not always up for the challenge, But I always wanted to show them I was a better worker then my manager/supervisors. Which I still do believe. The hardest part would probably be the lack of a consistent schedule, I work hard and smile harder, but it can be tough sometimes to work crazy hours, not knowing what days you will work till 3 days in advance. What I enjoyed was the overall experience, met cool new people, got stuff done, lots of smiles."
good,Very good place to work and shop I also learned how to use some of there hand devices.

good,"Responsibilities included making food, food prep, cleaning area, and mainly Guest service. I learned how to prepare the food for the areas i worked in and how to handle guests with different questions for different things. Management was exceptional, accepted me wit hopen arms when i transferred from Texas. My co-workers made it a fun and friendly place. Hardest part of my job would have been having to get up to speed on how different the store was from my store in Texas and other places I have worked. Most enjoyable thing about my job is the food anf guests. You meet great people and I enjoy working with food."
good,I loved working at target but one of the reasons i quit was because of the anually lose of customers due to weather
good,"My managers were also kind and upbeat, I always got right work in my department. I was a very fast worker so I was usually ""in charge"" of my department stocking in the food section. Nothing was really hard about this job, I'd love to get back into the same kind of work."
good,A typical work day at target during the christmas season is very busy and exciting. There is a large variety of guest that shop target stores. It's always work to be done. A great seasonal job.

good,"I worked at Target for 7.5 years, and I had enjoyed every minute. I learned how to work every department within the store and was in charge of shipping/receiving for 2.5 years of the total time I was employed there. My co-workers were fun and interested in learning what I knew of the company because I helped open a new store close to my home. I was the ""veteran"" and had a lot of knowledge of the ins and outs of the company. I taught myself how to receive products and chargeback products by myself before being placed in the department full time. The hardest part of my job was dealing with outside vendors who tried to get around how Target runs its receiving department, however with consistent communications on what is expected of them I was able to get all my vendors on track with what I needed them to do."
good,"What a great team, and group of people who guide you through this experience, working at Target was always enjoyable, and full of energy."
good,"Great company to work for, lots of great people, great career atmosphere."
good,Aday a work is very satisfying and fun I enjoyed every minute of it and the clean environment. The management part they were very freindly and helpful when you needed help. I learned to keep my score above 90% I learned how to do tax exempts. I love meeting all kinds of people in the retail field. I was moved around to different locations which was very fun. I enjoyed learning new things. My co-workers were a joy to work with all different types of personialties. The hardest part was not being able to stay because I moved back to Alabama to be with my grandmother. Now I want to find that enjoyable field of work again.
good,"I just worked during the Holiday season and I was not treated any differently. I was able to use the employee discount card while I was working there.

good,Target is a great company to work for and was my first job from when I was 17.
good,Target provides great opportunity for development and growth.
good,I enjoy the working with the customers.A typical starts off very fast paced as the inventory trucks arrive at 3am. The supervisors are not very knowledgable in how to get the most out of each persons skills.

good,It was a great experience I loved my team leads and and most of the people I worked with for the most part I went in happy every day cuz well I thought everyday would be a good day
good,"It really depends on the store.  The one in Quakertown  pa was absolutely hands down the best store to work at.  The people,  the store,  the management they all listened and took into account your ideas.  The one in Charleston SC everyone there was not fun to work with.  They made it more of a chore to be there. They never listened to your ideas.  There was no room to move up they had their picks."
good,"Everyone I met was very nice and chill, but there were definitely biases towards people.HR members in certain areas acted a certain way towards others"
good,A lot of politics when it comes to moving up! Coworkers gossip and there is a lot of drama but its overall a good place to work and the hourly Is great
good,"good first job, learn to deal with the public in a positive manner. Teaches you problem solving, customer service and a positive attitude. the benefits could be improved."
good,"The management was fine, could use work on scheduling. The workers where split between great people and people who are rude and talk behind your back for not exciting expectations."
good,Seasonal job offer from target. Expected to be picked up for more shift after the holidays but it didn’t work out that way. Great work environment but hours are scarce
good,Target Corp is a great company to work for the only thing that is not great about working at target is the management at the store I work at in San Clemente. A lot of the workers and even guest have complained about it.
good,I never once felt like I wasn’t accepted by my coworkers or employers. I don’t think anyone ever made me feel unsafe or uncomfortable in any situation. They always made sure to be extremely open and available so that if I ever had an issue with something it was extremely easy to approach someone and ask for help
good,Very diverse and pays well. There are very flexible with hours and the people there are very friendly. The people’s are like a family and will welcome u in open arms
good,Target was a great entry level retail environment to learn and test different tactics for ensuring results.  They provided me with the tools to test my ideas for profitability and allowed me the freedom to make decisions for my team and my departments.
good,"People there was very professional and didn""t  tolerate trouble makers. I think if you are serious about where you would like to move up at Target  you can get there  ."
good,Fun and uplifting. Always busy everyday. Management was great. The hardest part of the job was probably finding things in the back. The most enjoyable part was probably Black Friday and how every holiday they would always have food for their employees in the break room. Good place to work.
good,"The job itself was great, although the customers were a bit hard to deal with due to the management being very lenient and the customers always expected treatment that other customers were not given"
good,"I worked there for one holiday season with guaranteed me 120 days of employment, not more or less. If they liked you enough, then they would keep you beyond the holiday season otherwise your were let go and paid your final check in cash."
good,I had a great time working at Target. I learned a lot about having a good work ethic and how to talk with guests. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
good,Good benefits to work at target there hours just enough but it's nice for ppl thts in school and need something to help with in college. But overall it's a good place to work.
good,"I wish they had  more ample hours .I enjoyed my position  as a dedicated  business owner in the pets dept. I also  enjoyed  helping  guests with  their  questions and suggestions  about life advice  at times , because  I came to meet the same guests that would have  a shopping experience  patterns."
good,"Good company, it’s a ok job they management team where. Work suck but overall target is a great company to work for , you have to really have great guess service and be patient"
good,"While at target I was part of a team that worked together to ensure a tidy shopping environment for guests, while providing a friendly face to our shoppers."
good,"Target definitely provided me with great first job experience, with sales experience and guest advocating. I recommend the corporation to all my friends to work for as they are accepting, welcoming, and provide excellent building blocks for future job potentials. I love the relationships that the store has brought with my bosses, co-workers, and the guests I get to assist everytime I work."
good,"I started during the seasonal hiring event "
good,"management was extremely helpful with scheduling, i enjoyed the fast paced work environment. the only thing i didnt like was the scheduling of 34 hours one week and 16 the next.."
good,I would go into work at 7am until 2pm and stock pets and paper section. Those were my sections i handled everyday and took care of.  I liked my managers they were easy to get along with and it made everyday working there not so bad.
good,Something new everyday. Meeting new people and seeing different views on life. Enjoy putting smiles on everyone's faces. The scheduling is a little difficult but its still good to be busy for most of the time.
good,Target isn’t the job you want if you want a career - target is a job you work at temporary- I don’t see a living with target it’s a very stressful environment
good,Love working here everyone for the main part is very friendly and helpful.. the doors to management and HR are always open for any questions or concerns you may have..
good,I would work the cashier wait for customers to arrive at the cash register then proceed to check out the customers and the items they had chosen to purchase.
good,"Good customer service ,it’s a lot working at target with people target is all about helping people with things they look for and need target is a job that u dnt have no kids target work u a lot you on your feet alot"
good,Loved working here but not very flexible. Great team building everyone helped their team members. Friendly comfortable environment to work in. Target was an overall great place to work at just lacked in flexibility!
good,"Team members are friendly and inviting, pay is above average for retail. Flexible scheduling. Paid holidays and good benefits.overall not a bad job!!!"
good,"Target is a great company to work for. They are always evolving trying to keep up with the demands of the guests. The hardest part of the job comes around the holiday season, dealing with twice as many guests, but its also a fun time."
good,Target aimed to provide amazing experiences for families. Target does a great job of supplying multiple needs. The clothing and home decor produced by Target is always on the forefront of current trends.
good,"Target is a great company and offers many benefits to those who are looking to work long term. Though when I was working there, long term was not my goal. I didn’t have much choice as to the responsibilities I would take on, and as someone with chronic back pain... that was a challenge."
good,"A typical day would be just going into work and getting started after waiting for our supervisor."
good,This job is a little too far for me which makes it hard to get more hours. I think it’s a little too big of a corporation for me to actually like it. Other that that it was alright.
good,Target is great! I loved the friendly environment I was in. Everyone was always helpful and nice to one another. The guest were always our #1 priority.
good,Since working for Target I have enjoyed the work but the hours have been a little stressful. I want to work for a company where I can have set hours and be able to advance.
good,"love working here, high pace environment. Very enjoyable people to work with. Management is great with felxability for hours, especially with team members who are going away/local colleges or universities."
good,"Over the year and a half I was there, I got several ""regular"" customers that would always try to find me to check them out and chat...there were also quite a few regulars that you wish would really shop somewhere else. The staff were mainly great; one front end manager was a bit of a tyrant and micro-manager, literally only 2 or 3 people didn't despise working with her--she refused to change my job title from cashier to barista after I trained and was primarily at Starbucks because she didn't want to pay me the higher barista pay ($10.75). No one had a set schedule, no benefits as everyone was kept part time (under 38 hrs/week) pay was pretty good (was upped to a beginning pay of 11/hr as I was leaving for relocation)."
good,"I love working there because mostly the managers are a great help. We were like family and helped each other. A very positive working environment. Careing, loving and understanding."
good,Working at target was very relaxed and slow paced it wasn’t hard at all i enjoyed my time working there i enjoyed helping customers locate items and i enjoyed stocking shelves
good,"Fun place to work most the time. Hours are varied for each job. adamant about team members taking their breaks during their work shift. Fast, Fun & Friendly"
good,"working at target is fast paced, fun and demanding. it demands excellent customer service and going above and beyond. I truly enjoyed my time there and would recommend target to anyone."
good,"I loved Target and what they stood for.  The company has a lot of great things to offer and there are a lot of great people there. However, there are some people in which you must watch which almost bring the high school drama of gossip which starts story telling in a professional work setting.  Unfortunately this is what make companies lose good talent"
good,"Everyone is helpful. "
good,Real laid back but you have to ride management in order to get cross trained and get more hours. Usually under staffed but since they aren't open 24/7 and it wasn't a super center it was easy to get things done.
good,"If you never worked before, this is a great place to start. Dip you toes into a bunch of different areas of retail and knowledge you can obtain to take to other jobs."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target, even if the hours were not entire consistent enough to maintain our finances at home. I enjoyed working with people, including the other works and management, they were very kind and cooperative with their employees."
good,"it was a great place to work for a second job, where i was i was never considered for any higher employment. which is why i went and got my MA certificate. i couldnt live on what they paid me"
good,"A Typical Day At Work Was Either Very Busy , To Slightly Busy , To Very Slow-Paced ; I Learned A lot From Those Who Worked With And Around Me , But I Also Learned A lot From Each Guests , And As A Whole I Got That Retail Exprience ; Management For The Most Part Was Very Easy-Going , And Everyone Was Treated The Way They Wanted To Be Treated Based Of Their Own Actions So It Was Fair"
good,"Full staff bottom to top are inviting and charming, however, communication is lacking across the store and out towards other branches. They don't care what color your hair is, if you have tattoos or piercings, if you have disabilities or anything, which is very nice and inclusive. Employees are attentive to guest needs. Clean working environment."
good,"A Typical day is answering inbound calls and performing outbound calls."
good,Always follow the rules of the store & be a team memeber. You will like the job of helping customers around the store and the rooms only team members could go.
good,"The management at Target was such a pleasant change to previous jobs, they actually care about their employees and guests. Feels much more like a family environment rather than just employees working together."
good,"Cashier/seasonal. Repetitive, but day went by quickly. I really loved how they did not immediately dismiss you due to piercings or tattoos. Great place to be yourself."
good,The  day to day of a logistics team member consists of pulling and back stocking merchandise to ensure a full store for customers. Accuracy helps in order to provide a level of consistency for items withing the store. There are many team leads leading to many different ideas and interests that can affect how the day to day operations are completed.
good,It was a fun place to work. The hours were flexible and there was opportunity for advancement. The management staff was nice and there was always opportunity for over time during busy seasons.
good,"The company was fast paced. Helping the guest was priority #1. Most people will not succeed, on your feet all the time. Some managers were fantastic, others had a an attitude and a lot of favoritism."
good,"There is always something to be done, and things to learn. Doing your job the right way the first time can make the work day much smoother. Unfortunately there are some workers who take shortcuts or intentionally not follow training and it directly effects your efficiency. The management is appreciative of hard workers (they all have high expectations) and will personally show their gratitude the same as show their disappointment if they catch you slacking in any department."
good,"I liked working for Target, you make friends really fast, and can also move up quite fast. They are pretty flexible and can accommodate school schedules and second job schedules pretty well. Great experience for customer service!"
good,"Outstanding friendly supervisors, good starting wage,  advanced notification of your schedule.  Appreciation for job well done.  Many little perks, like extra pay on holidays."
good,This job was a part time job for me to get extra income.  Enjoyed working there. Management worked with me to do the job I needed to do for them. the job was not hard at all.
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Target. Worked my way through school. They had flexible hours that allowed me to focus on studying, and even helped me take a Leave Of Absence (LOA) when I needed to focus on finals."
good,Working at Target can be challenging yet it pays off once you realize its for the best. Id advice anyone who plans on working at an establishment like Target that they should be prepared to know that theyre dealing with the best of the best.
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are ambitious and not opposed to working 10+ hours on a daily basis. If your store is running well, it can be a cakewalk.  If it is not, managers can expect to be scrutinized by district and group leadership.  Company has lost some of the focus it used to place on constant development and promotion of its salaried managers.  Overall, I loved working for Target because I believed they worked hard to innovate over the last five years and make themselves a brick-and-mortar force to be reckoned with, despite a drastically changing retail landscape."
good,Great place ! Very relaxed work place! As long as your working while your talking tgey will have no problem. Great breaks and great people to work with.
good,"Great place to work for entry level and competitive retail pay. Hard to advance if hired on at entry level, unless works for extended amount of time. Management, overall, is supportive."
good,"Hardest part of the job was pushing costumers to apply for red cards. Great place to work at. Typical day at work as a cashier was pretty consistent. Management isn't the worst, but it is biased."
good,"i hated working at target, very under appreciated."
good,with in an days work its mostly busy around holiday time There are learning opportunities all you  would have to do is ask . management is ok. the hardest part of the job is mostly the schedule.  enjoy about the job is that the benefits are great
good,"I love working at target. It's my favorite place that I worked because I'm doing what I like to do, I get along with everybody I work with, and it's my favorite store!"
good,Target is a great place to work. It’s fun and busy. Yo get your most hours during 4th quarter which is back to school and holiday time. But after January your hours get cut to about1-3 days a week. Which is not good if you got bills to pay. If the store doesn’t make sales.hours get cut.
good,"Great people, good management, friendly environment. Should offer more benefits to part time employees. Difficult to balance work and a personal life."
good,"Great, this company set me up for many future endeavors as it gave me a solid working background in data entry as well as other specialty areas, I learned how to be a team player as well as learning how to lead. I learned that I am an asset at any company I join because I am a fast learner and can mold myself to the position I am appointed."
good,"I was surrounded by lots of other high schoolers, so really liked that. I'm better at small talk because of cashiering. Holiday times can be stressful."
good,"Provide a variety of services, from helping customers pick out items to ringing up your purchases. As being a cashiers retail sales associates use cash registers to process transactions. You are responsible for keeping track of all the money inside and keeping ackeaned restocked area at all time's, including other tasks when called upon..."
good,I really enjoyed my time at target. The management was awesome and the team was actually a team. I didn't have to interact with customers on the sales floor but was still able to make sure that all their needs were met.
good,"I worked at Target in upstate NY as a seasonal employee while I was far into a pregnancy. As a cashier, I was on my feet for hours at a time but management was wonderful on ensuring I got adequate break time and was fair on scheduling regardless of the pregnancy. Working during the holiday season is fast paced and overtime pay is included if you worked on Thanksgiving night and Black Friday or any other seasonal holiday.  Pay is minimal. Not an optimal long term life career."
good,As a cashier at Target I would stock returns and to make sure guest was checked out promptly and correctly. And at closing time I would re-stock the store and make sure that all guest were gone out the building.
good,"Working at Target was one of my best jobs. The managers were both good and bad equally. The time spent there felt long, but you felt accomplished at the end of the day. Pay was meh at the time, but I'm sure its gotten better since 2011."
good,"Target was awesome i enjoyed my co workers, i enjoyed going into target to work, they give you enough breaks, they feed you and give you old out of season stuff instead of throwing them away. target is great"
good,Target had some flaws and cons. My job there was pretty easy. For the most part other co workers were nice. Management sucked. Benefits are okay. In all target was a pretty okay job to work at.
good,"I loved target and working there , I just didn't like the hours and the pay we received. Depending on who you worked with, they would play with your breaks though and I hated that."
good,"Target was probably my favorite job I've ever held. The managers were always friendly and the atmosphere is heavily ""team"" based. I never had any complaints towards the company."
good,The staff is very helpful and the environment is very welcoming. The pay is worth the work from working in the clothes to being a cashier I enjoy the job. Although the management is changing.
good,"A CMM level 5 company with strong rules and regulations. Strong organizational and ethical culture."
good,"I love what Target stands for. They are very accepting of a diverse group of people. The pay is good for the work they have you do. Starts off a bit more than minimum wage. My team leader was very rude and would say how replaceable people are. She would create drama amongst the team members. Once I joined the new food team I felt underpaid for the amount of work they expected me to do. Raises are very small. Great coworkers. Everyone is quite friendly. Used to get free food that would of other wise been wasted in the break room before they changed that. Occasionally they hold fun games you can participate in. You might have to work with people with no common sense, as they seem to never want to fire anyone that should be. I found myself often fixing other people's mistakes. I don't agree with creating the food team especially when there's not enough people on it to get anything done. Too much is expected and my store was very opposed to ever helping out our food team. My logistics team leader would often say rude things about the food team and create tension."
good,Atypical day would consist of keeping the store clean and greeting the Guest.  Management was good. The workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything was always in place.
good,Started as a part time cashier and was asked to join presentation team before my 90 days was up. They seem to recognize when they have a hard working employee and try to help them advance.
good,"Fast paced, fun, and changes a lot, sometimes too much. Having a team to navigate these issues is the exciting part. Great place for advancement and development."
good,"fast paced gotta keep moving the hardest part of the job is the lifting "
good,Good place to work if you handle working on the weekends.   Sometimes you have to get too much out of the team for what upper management expects.  All in all.  Good place.
good,Target was a great place to work. The managers and employees were very fun to work with and usually everyday I worked flew by because I was enjoying myself while working hard. The hardest part of the job was probably when I just started because I did not know anything.
good,Great place to work if you are straight out of high school or even still in high school. Not a great job when trying to get through college unless you are a great multi tasker. Managers were not the best I've dealt with. Job culture didn't really exist. You worked hard if you care other wise you could slack off and no one really cared.
good,They will higher any one over 18 years old. Easy work. Nice boss.short breaks vary strict rules. Will only hire full time employees only. You get a discount on everything.
good,Target was a Great Job. I really enjoyed being an employee of this company. i learned a lot from the experience working with the Target company and the corporation.
good,Great place to work the environment is nice. great diversity in the company and throughout store. Great team environment and would love to work for Target corporate headquarters in brooklyn park.
good,Great job for people who want guest service experience and are not looking for consistent full time work. You must be able to adapt to very frequent policy and rule changes.
good,"Open environment with traditional workplace values. Advancement possible with hard work and effort. Will always be required to work holidays, and hours can be difficult."
good,"From the moment I started working at Target, I enjoyed the hard physical labor, combined with a large team working  and communicating to execute their goals. "
good,"I start working at 6 am so theres not a lot of people yet. I am just enjoying my work, seeing new clothing designs and new stuffs which were invisible to me then.  The hardest part of the job is when we have nothing much more to do because the holidays are over."
good,Wasnt a bad work place to start off. Being promoted to logistics was a great experience and opportunity. The management made sure i understood that i was replaceable. Hardest part of the job was figuring out the pda procedure.
good,a typical day at work would be lifting boxes in warehouses. i learned how to manage my time with the work and also the company's management is nice and understanding. fun and nice co-workers. hardest part of the job is lifting heavy boxes and the enjoyable part is working with nice people.
good,great place to work at but the way they train people needs to change and give a little time for training the individual. Also needs to improve giving an equal chance at the job
good,Working at Target has given me the opportunity to perfect my own time management and has also let me take care of a variety of different guests so I've learned how to give superb customer service as well.
good,"Target was Absolutely one of my best jobs, Customers were always leaving with a smile, because at Target everyone worked together, and we all had good vibes."
good,This was my first ever job. It was interesting learning new things. But management is corrupt. While I worked hard to earn my place other people were being recognized because they were friends. Everyone else got an amazing raise while I got a penny as a raise. You must think I didn't do my job well to earn a raise. I beg to differ. Lets just say if you aren't best friends with management or agree to kiss... you know where I am trying to get. You wont be able to move up in the company. Which is unfortunate since I do love the company and what it stands for. Corporate needs to take a look at who they hire as their management.
good,"Great management, great staff. This was by far my favorite job. The pay was good, the job was fun. there wasn't anything I didn't like about working at Target!"
good,"I really enjoyed this job. I was always busy, my co workers were amazing and very helpful when i first started. It was a great environment. There wasn't anything too hard at the job, the only thing that was difficult was selling as many red cards as you needed too."
good,I worked at the starbucks inside target. The duties included opening the register counting cash and brewing all coffees and preparing the store for the day pulling pastries. Direct managment could work on emotions better co worker better then manager rush time andbdrinks taking to long and best part was when we made it through rush and didnt lose customers
good,The managers are great. Nice schedule and the work loads isn't too bad. Everyone were very considerate when you needed personal time off. The company is very diverse.
good,My typical day was   i started off  as a  customer service floor rep i then  worked hard  and became  jewelry assistant specialist. The  jewelry department was  my section as well as helping my team leader.. I  was in charge of the  soft-line team during open or  closing
good,"A typical day contains providing great customer service, making sure that the shelves are stocked, and Helping out where needed.  I've learned great customer service skills that have helped me in other jobs I've had.  The management team is great to work for and are always looking out for us.  The coworkers I work with are a great team and are willing to fill in wherever is needed."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, I met many different people from all walks of life. It was very busy during the holiday season and is fast paced."
good,"great company to work for, great hours and people. target gives back so much way more than any company I've worked for.  it my become overwhelming during the holidays with the longer hours and the stores always being and crazy but it helps pass the time"
good,Target is a pretty decent place to work. The job itself is ok...the hours are LONG. Pay and benefits are great. Management is probably the biggest complaint...could DEFINATELY use new people to fill these positions
good,"You had your long lines and your short lines at times, but you always got to stay productive. You learned things everyday about new people coming through your line. The management and co workers was great. My most enjoyable part about my job is getting as much Red cards as i can. One day i got more than everyone is the store and almost more than the website."
good,"Very busy, fast paced."
good,"The days varied on who was in charge, being the front end manager, I always aimed to make my team happy. Not all leadership felt the same. I learned a lot of key skills that will help me long--term."
good,"As one can expect, it's a retail enviorment. The co-workers are wonderful to work with, and the managers can be okay to work with as well, unfortunately a lack of communicate between managers. I have been fortunate to learn better customer service and to be more personable with people and guests as well."
good,"I worked overnight stock, we had to work fast and neatly."
good,"I worked for target as a seasonal worker.  The workers there were very nice and friendly, but everyday coming into work for me was a blur, because I really didn't know where I would be for the day. One day they would have me be a cashier, then the next I would stock, and then after that I would be in clothing, folding clothes, picking them up off of the floor, and hanging them. It was as though I was a filler for anybody that called in for the day, and I'm a person that likes change, but not everyday."
good,unloaded trucks and stocked to store floor. how situate products according to their product numbers to desired isle location. could eat lunch in the food service store. excellent friendly bosses who were very helpful. after showing good work ethic and report they offered me more hours.
good,I love my co-worker and their support. It is a fairly enjoyable job but you must like retail and people. The growth in the company can be a little slow but it depends on the job you are looking forward to moving to.
good,"A once loyal and great company and brand is going through a needed transformation.  As a result, layoffs and organizational changes are creating discontent on teams. Not a very engaging place right now."
good,Target provided a great environment to learn. The management was supportive. It was great to work in a team focussed store and the recognition culture was remarkable.
good,Strong Management with success in mind.Strong team members with fast paced abilities.Good organizational skills creating a top level sales floor.Which gives guests an enjoyable experience.
good,"I really enjoyed working there, didn't really have any problems with any guest. I really enjoyed my time working there."
good,this is a job where I never minded going to work. Always smiling faces and team members willing to help when needed. the biggest thing I've learned while being employed here is self confidence by having to work directly with the public.
good,Target was a place where I learned a great deal about customer service.  I met a lot of great people that are my co-workers.
good,Meh.. it had its good days an it also had some very slow days seeing as i was a target mobile employee. so all i could really get commission on is selling phones and accessories
good,Customers make the days great they make them go by faster. Working here I was a made sure we had everything we needed. I was in charge of ordering things and keeping everything on the shelf
good,"I have made some of the greatest friends working at Target. We all work hard to get the job done, but you might hear some laughter in the process."
good,learned to prep buses before time to paint in the booth. manage my shop area supplies in order to complete my daily task. paint 44 buses on a daily base. learn to work in temperatures that could exceed 117 degrees or go below 30 degrees
good,Unpredictable job function each days.  Changing regular and rotating everyday.  Getting along with co-workers and Group Leader. Just like to move on with some better job.
good,"I learned allot working at Target. I enjoyed the people whom I worked with,"
good,It was a great experience. I learned that customer service is a priority. I also learned to do the best that I can . I also worked closely with my co-workers and we were always available to help in switching shifts or taking shifts over when needed. The hardest part of the job is when a customer is upset but I learned to accept that the customer was not mad at me and just listen.
good,Everyone gets along quite well. Some people have their clicks. Its a very fast paced job. I like fast paced. I have learned so much through Target. My skills have gotten so much better.
good,"Set up and maintenance of Import Vendors"
good,"Backstocking, POG, MIR, my daily duties. Coworkers are fairly friendly and fun to work with. Management is very uptight and does not compromise well. Hardest part of the job is finishing up the calf pulls and being called to do a flexible fullfilment and help a guest. Enjoyable part is no supervisor constantly over your shoulder."
good,"Fun workplace, always something to do. Learned the cash office, where all the cash is distributed. Great customers, co-workers and management team. Hardest part, was around the holidays with all the crazy sales. Most enjoyable was seeing all the different customers and how friendly they were."
good,"Have worked with a great team to accomplish tasks assigned.  Have learned new methodologies and equipment data processing, retail business and management processes."
good,pay not so well the hours were okay and the customers were aweful to deal with
good,"arrive to work at 4am set up our department which was soft lines pallets would be brought out to floor and then I would unload pallet and bowl boxes into the right area. the open all boxes and stock shelves, put cloths away on tables and racks. learned a lot about being a team player and how to merchandise all clothing in the store to use the price gun and walkie talkies. management was different there was a lot of them I had a wonderful lead manager he was always there to help or teach us new things. my co-workers were great we all worked as a team member. I think the hardest part of the job was the all nighters. the best part of the job was the way you couyld make a customer feel welcome ."
good,"This was the first job I worked overnight, It was another great experience as it did relate to warehouse environment. I would replenish shelves on the sales floor during off hours of operation. I moved from location to location from the Toy department to linens to sporting goods, electronics, home entertainment etc. My night started at 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. Needless to say I slept the entire day before going to evening class or resume back to work"
good,"Not a job seasonal job, can be somewhat crazy busy around the holidays. Team members are fun."
good,"Target is a fun, and fast pace work style. The tasks are easy as long as you pay attention to what you must do. The instructions are plain simple and guidelines are easy to follow."
good,"lots of contractor interaction ( which I like )"
good,their management isn't very good.  On a typical day i work in a section all by myself. There are not enough people in my section at one time.
good,constantly something to do. sometimes we are so busy its hard to get caught up on what needs to be done. I've learned a lot working for this company mainly I would have to say patience. The managment there is great. Take a real interest in their employees and do just as much work if not more. My co workers are great very helpful. The hardest part of my job would be having to deal with those customers that are never satisfied no matter what you do or say. The most enjoyable part of my job is the atmosphere.
good,Good company but upper management was terrible on how to balance out workload and other situations
good,"Target was an excellent place to work.  The compensation and benefits were exceptional, and they believe in a development culture."
good,I stocked zoned and worked as a cashier when it got really busy. I pulled products from the shelves in the back room and stocked
good,typical day at target would vary between your day an the customers day I learned how to be detailed an how to work around different personalities management was great very helpful work an personal related my coworkers were great all the time very tem oriented the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers attitude
good,"At Target you could be doing anything on any day of the week.  The primary goal is to work together as a Team member and provide great customer service.  You could be a cashier one moment, and then switch to Guest Services.  You then may need to go to the Cafe and work a few hours.  You could also be asked to put out inventory. I love being part of a Team and celebrating our success.  I feel that if the store succeeds, then I succeed.  I take pride in any job that I do, but I am looking for a future within a company."
good,great customers lots of regulars. for a regular shift i was at my registrar all day long on down time i would restock my surrounding area
good,I worked at Target for a few months to get the store prepared to be opened. It was a great learning experience.
good,"Cashier Team Leader"
good,cashiering and handling customers choices. learning the overall flow of a large department store. management was helpful in training. co-workers were a lot of fun. hardest part of this position was learing to keep area looking presentable for the next customer. speaking with customers about thier clothing choices.
good,"My typical day at work involved meeting new people everyday. Everyday was different, I did enjoy it very much. Met challenges everyday. My coworkers were great. I had a few that looked up to me for a lot of different issues almost like an extended family. I enjoyed learning minimal management duties that I learned."
good,Employees are great to work with but management set you up for failure
good,"typical days' work: unloading trucks, stacking products on pallets, delivering pallets, and stocking"
good,target shows its customers great individual customer service
good,"I deal with too many customers a day . Usually they are good and generous, and funny as well . sometime, or rarely , I deal with mean people who give me hard time with no apparent reason ."
good,My typical day consist of onboarding new team members an showing them the way Target operate. I learned that your first impression is everything. Management is a great group of people to work with. My co-workers are very helpful to me an others. The hardest part of the job is the last hour or two of work. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the new hires learn an utilize the things I showed them.
good,Some days where better than others. It was a little hot every now and then. Some of the managers had the worst attitude.
good,"A typical day at work was busy and most employees floated to different areas until a manager designated everyone to each department for the night. I learned how to stock items, organize them, how to talk to employees and train others to do the same job. My co-workers were ok, they talked to each other but nothing too personal. The hardest part of the jobs were the long hours. The most enjoyable part was being able to say that I worked for such a great company."
good,"I worked in the middle of the night from closing to opening time. We began by scanning the shelves in our assigned departments. Counting the items sold the previous day, we pulled merchandise from the stock room and stocked the shelves.  In the early morning the new truck would arrive and we would then stock remaining outs and lows from inventory coming in on the truck.  Then log in the back stock  in the warehouse. "
good,"You really learn how use cupons, the management is good,and co-workers are cool."
good,Target is an excellent company to work for. The store is very busy at times and the team members get along well. I have learned working with the public requires a lot of patients and you can not make everyone happy.
good,"The morning is very fast paced, and everyone gets along well, I work on the flow team which is the largest team in the store. I have learned how to read schematics, and how to process dairy and frozen foods. Although the job is repetitious, it also has variety which allows for more flexibility in my job."
good,upbeat work environment
good,"In short, an average day at work consists of arriving a little early and greeting staff/employees. Clock in and sing in at the Cash Register assigned to me for the day/evening. I ring up customers items and make sure that they are completely satisfied with their visit to the store. I like the assistance that the co-workers are able to give me when I come upon a difficult/new task. My co-workers are very helpful and kind. I find that the hardest part of the day is when the day winds down and there aren't as many guests to cash out as earlier in the day. I like it when it's more busy and I get in a constant rhythm."
good,Laid back work environment.
good,"Typical business day at target was as soon as you clocked in there was a meeting of the goals for the day, you met with your partner and team lead."
good,"As a cashier, I loved meeting and greeting guest. I loved working in the different departments inside the store, meeting new workers and assisting guest. Hardest part store closing and putting the things back guest didn't want."
good,This is a job only to pay bills. The pay was low. The good outcome is u get paid every week
good,"There are plenty of small incentives designed to keep employees motivated and the management works hard to keep the environment fun. In the retail stores, there is the normal hassles that come with trying to keep a good balance in your schedule. In my store there is a lot of segregation between departments so issues are not easily resolved."
good,"The 3 years I work at target, I never got cut this bad. I know they cut hours, but I need more than 4or 5 hours a week. Other than that I  love my job."
good,My overall time working at Target was pleasant. I had a great time learning new skills and learning how to exercise them on the job. I would recommend Target to others seeking employment.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in and going to the front-end of the store to work the registers. I learned about the difficulty of being a cashier. I liked being a cashier, but it could be difficult when guests were unhappy or if I made a mistake ringing an item. The management team at Target are very kind and always willing to help. The workplace culture is busy but fun and relaxed. The hardest part of the job is trying not to overwork yourself at the register. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the guests."
good,The environment in store is family friendly. They help with your flexibility for students. They offer great benefits for yourself and family. Management always works with you to accommodate your schedule
good,"Pay is good"
good,General merchandising is just stocking items from the truck into their appropriate location within the store and taking the remaining items and stocking them in the back room.
good,"Team leaders can be unprofessional and make certain things a joke. "
good,It was a pretty good job overall I just couldn’t work 2 full time jobs at the same time so it wore me out really quick and I asked them for less hours and they didn’t give me them so I had to leave one of the jobs so that’s the one I left
good,"Great work life balance, compensation, and progressiveness. Not a great company for growth as they prefer to pull from outside rather than invest in their current talent."
good,Everyone is easy to get along with. Occasionally we have themed food days in the breakroom. Management really cares to learn about you and solidly support the operations of the store.
good,"managing team was a great challenge, most enjoyable part was building my teams. Learning the company standards and achieving the goals i had set for me and my teams."
good,"Target trained and educated me the importance of the job. From cashier, customer service, to security; I learned all the important points target focuses for their store. Security enforces safety of guest and store, with those combined it creates organization within their system."
good,Loved working here. The reason why I left is other job opportunities and better pay. You can get sucked in to the amount of hours they can ask you to work. As long as you were on time and did a good job they would train you in other places. If I could get a job there that paid more I would.
good,This was my first job and i really enjoyed the atmosphere. Working in a warehouse and having personal responsibilities and tasks to complete for the day.
good,"I don't just have one type of a typical work day, it depends on where I am scheduled in the store. If I am scheduled for the front end, I could be doing  front end team lead, guest service, order drive up, self check out or a cashier. With any of these duties I am helping breaks, helping find items in the store, helping my other employees with any issues or needs they have. I also help stock the dollar spot area at the front of the store, and I have been trained in back, packaging shipments and loading them into the trucks. I very much enjoy the sense of community or family the store has, everyone is willing to help each other when needed and we all support one another. The management has seen how I like to be busy and learn new thing. They have helped me learn new things about the different areas in the store. One of the hardest part of the job I would have to say would be dealing with angry guest and having to not let it get to you. Or just the busyness of holiday seasons."
good,"It’s a great place to work and I had awesome people who I worked with while in Cape Coral Florida, wished I could continued working with them. But it is a great place to start off if you are in school or in between classes"
good,I honestly loved working their it was amazing. I worked with amazing people and learned alot. would not ever trade the friends I made working there .and my team leader was the best.
good,Honestly wish this place was a lot more understanding when it came to not having hours to work after the holidays. You're basically living with just eight hours a week after.
good,It was a great company to work for. Great hours to work. Good discounts. Very friendly and relaxed job environment. I was able to train as a cashier as well as in the snack bar area.
good,The culture of Target Super Stores is at par with other companies this size.  The management staff has been promoted with in and is very knowledgeable of their enterprise and supportive of new team members.  Many management roles are help by tenured employees (9yr team member hired me).  Strong culture and great personnel. Stay off your cell phone during your shift if you plan on working here. very long
good,"I learned quite a bit from target after working there for 2 years. But honestly I’m glad I don’t work there anymore. They changed everything, they don’t give you enough hours, and they are stingy about it too. They changed management and are still making up new things to make the business “better”. Honestly I love shopping there, most of my checks would go towards clothes and makeup from target. But I hated working there after it all. The employees became my friends but it was for the best that I stopped working there."
good,"Target is a great place to work. They make it very easy to develop leadership skills that you can carry with you throughout your career. The work/life balance here is terrible, and is why I ultimately chose to leave. They need to do better by their employees with insurance and benefits. Having insurance was almost the same as not."
good,Im a fast past worker and learn fast .. Everyone work as a team.. I like helping people out.. I love that i get to learn something new everyday good place
good,It was a great  work  environment   work was fast paced  there  always  a chance  to move up on the company's  ranks   they always  willing to  give  over time if necessary
good,Very friendly environment. Coworkers are always there to help you. Worked as a barista good night have in-store experience learned a lot about Starbucks.
good,Target is a great place to work that is ever changing. The work you do everyday is similar yet changes. Some days could be slow others extremely busy.  They like when you take the initiative to make efficiency and quality over quantity and stagnant.
good,I really enjoyed my bosses and made a great impact on my life I was sick and they were understanding and I very much miss my job I worked for target for 12 years until I had to move away to a different state
good,"Target is a fast paced fun but professional place to work. Coworkers at Target are friendly and become family. I highly recommend working at Target. There are lots of different areas you can work in, including cashier, team leader, guest services, order pick up, fulfillment, beauty, and much more. There is a place for everyone of all backgrounds at Target."
good,It was a great experience while I was on school . I would work there again I loved the atmosphere and the people that worked there and they were so family oriented
good,I really enjoyed the dynamic at target. I had a lot of freedom to get my tasks done in the order and likeness that I preferred. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the overall environment they established at Target
good,"Management plays favorites, and can ruin your day fairly quick. They expect a lot with not enough team members. Pay is good, and you get the hours you want."
good,I really enjoyed working here. very good work for anyone who is organized and friendly. coworkers were very helpful all the time. lots of folding and hanging up clothing along with organizing and stocking.
good,"Great company, my managers weren’t the best at hiring reliable employees. Work was always busy.. we were super understaffed. Management wasn’t great, but they were nice and understanding."
good,Would recommend as a first job. I would like to work somewhere different. i want to expand my knowledge of many things in life that could be a career for me.
good,"I really love working here the people was great and they work around my schedule.  They have great benefits; like 401k, health and dental retirement funds."
good,"This Target is in a college city, so we get a lot of business when school is in session. It can be pretty hectic but because of the structure of management and responsibilities, the hard work is spread across many people instead of falling on one person. Fun atmosphere, constantly have something to do, shifts usually fly by."
good,Glad I was able to secure a job at Target.  I learned that being patient and the job you want will come but you must fill your time wisely.  The workplace was young and live yet inspiring.
good,"It was a seasonal position,  so I did not work with the perminant workers everyone who worked there were trying out to see if the company would hire them based on their performance."
good,Target was a fun place to work at. You can learn so many things from different people. I've met so many people from around who thought me about their culture. It's always nice to have a good team who work together without any problem.
good,It was an okay job management would put a lot of responsibility on you but pay doesn’t match but other than that it was a good job and was very flexible with schedule
good,"In this company you will really push yourself to work hard because there’s a lit of stuff needed to be dine on a limited time of work. Tiring for some, and challenge on others."
good,"I worked multiple positions, the best ones to have are inside in the front. You meet and greet a bunch of new faces but you also have to work at a fast pace."
good,They were good I love it because it was over night an I had something to do all the time while Am was at wok. Work was easy so night I feel when you work in groups work goes by fast an we get the work done on time.
good,"This is an amazing job, I like working here. I have no complaints. My co-workers are amazing and make working here more fun. But, its not secure as sometimes they might only give 6 hours per week"
good,"Overall, Target is a great company to work for! Flexible shifts, ability to learn different areas of the store, simple work, great coworkers, opportunities for advancement etc. Management could use a makeover, though (especially upper). They sometimes take advantage of the best workers, giving them unreasonable amounts of work to complete in an unreasonable amount of time."
good,I left because management was trying to force me to work and I had another job. Target hours are based upon the employee availability not management. I may have stayed if wasn't for management.
good,I worked on the floor as and associate. I returned clothing to the floor from returns and clothing left in the fitting rooms. The management was a good team. The hardest part is dealing with customers when they are unhappy with anything not being available when they want it. The enjoyable part is doing a good job and getting along with other employees.
good,"Great place to work and good training, enjoyed helping customers. Clean environment, organized store.  Management was easy to deal with they understood where I was coming from."
good,I love how we had meeting everyday and talk about how we can improve the day and how to be more productive and what flaws are we doing and what are we doing right.
good,"I began work on October 7th at the beginning of the Holiday season.  The only time that it was semi-quiet was in the.early morning."
good,"Had lots of fun experiencing a lot of jobs while I worked at Target. I did many different jobs and really enjoyed my time there. After having trouble with my first pregnancy and they were there for me and helpful and then lowering my hours after child's birth to help me out, I finally decided to be an at home mom and babysit other children and watch my own child grow up."
good,"I spent 6 months working softlines at Target. It included folding and cleaning the clothing section, working the fitting room and occasionally assisting the cashiers at the front. It was stressful when busy but with a good team it was manageable. Unfortunately at the time I was working the rest of the softlines team was made up of high schoolers who went to school together all day and instead of doing their job in each area, spent their shifts huddled and talking. It left me in an endless mess everyday and unable to keep up which is why I left. Not targets' fault, just not the location for me."
good,"I worked in customer service, and cashier. I also did online orders and pick ups. I worked during the last Christmas season. It was always so busy. But that's what I like. I love to be bisy"
good,"The most successful people on an hourly pay scale at Target have open availability, are willing to learn any position or cross-train to be able to work anytime a need comes up. The only full time employees are the Executive management. The hardest part of the job is getting hours since the payroll is tied to the sales goal for the store. "
good,Target as a company and a community are absolutely great but labor  intensive jobs at target pay the same as non labor intensive jobs and most of the time have less hours due to time frames. I believe labor intensive job should paid more than a job such as a cashier but overall compensation is good.
good,laid back. friendly. professional. supportive. great part time job. opportunity to grow. team support.just wish we could sit at times instead of standing the whole shift
good,"The most enjoyable part of being at Target was how supportive they are of Team Building and the culture of teamwork."
good,"Target is a cool place to work at but the hours are inconsistent when sales are not up, so I was suggest only working during the holidays. After the holidays the hours drop tremendously from 40 hours a week and maybe overtime to 12 hours or less depending on your work ethic and seniority."
good,Target was a great place to work . It was a very comfortable working environment. The hours were acceptable and flexible. They were very organized and helpful there.
good,Everything would be organized and set for each department to work for their duties smoothly with everyone's cooperation. Alot of of walking is necessary to carry out work.

good,"I worked as a cashier, at times it was very busy.  Although it was fun especially at Christmas time. I am very friendly and accommodating. The coworkers and managers worded professionally together."
good,shifts consist of 3 12 hour days or 4 10 hour days. with a 30 min lunch. The people and management are nice and will help when needed...........................
good,If you enjoy flexible hours good pay you will like Target. There is not much room for advancement but you will learn a lot if you willing to learn....
good,Target was a good environment and very clean environment fast paced. Learned how to stock shelves in a fast paced environment. Learned how to use forklift.
good,"I love working here, but I wish I had more time off on weekends. Sometimes it is hard to work with certain people, but that is just life.  I love the people I work with and this company is willing to work around school schedules."
good,"Working at Target has many benefits. It has taught me different levels of the customer service experience. From face to face to talking on the phone. It has taught me how to handle difficult situations and how to maintain composure under pressure. Overall, I’ve learned how to make sure the customer leaves with a great experience. It’s great for people who are just beginning to enter the work environment."
good,"A typical day of work at target for me is , to come clock in and be work ready to perform and completing all my tasks before my work shift is over. Which included making sure my area is clean for when the store opens , pushing out all new merchandise , helping guests find the things they need , and making sure I help make sale goals."
good,I loved working at target! Target was so much fun even getting the job done you had fun while doing it. Theres a starbucks and pizza and many more things you can eat while on your break or lunch.
good,it is a great place to work with loads of opportunities to progress. the wage is not amazing as it is on the bottom end of the scale. overall it is a great place to work.
good,"This is the perfect place for someone who has a desire to hone retail skills. This job required me to to learn how to push myself to do more technical and physically taxing tasks, as well as learn how to prioritize the guest experience while working efficiently and neatly. I've learned about how to collaborate with people with many different points of view and priorities and making sure that all the work still gets done within the allotted hours. The culture is extremely educational and supportive and if you ask to be trained, you will be trained."
good,Delightful place to work with great people both workers and customers. Flexibility of schedule was great and managers were always there to help. Holidays were especially nice because of the customers and upper management perks.
good,Target as a company is very fair as far as treatment of team members. I've worked for the company for a total of 5 years and i always recommend it as a great place to start working.
good,"This was a fairly decent company to work for, although they held a certain view of employees of a certain age.  Very fast paced somewhat aggressive atmosphere."
good,Have to open up to help guests. The job is easy but a lot to do. Coworker are friendly and helpful. Managers are nice. Company works well with postpartum moms
good,"Working at Target has been an amazing journey, I’ve learned so much over the years I’ve worked but most importantly, I’ve leared how to become a leader. Once I became a Leader, I Managed and Developed Talent by spreading the knowledge I’ve leared to others."
good,Great place to work but not to stay very long. Great team work. Flexible schedule. It can get overwhelming at times but for the most part it isn't so bad. Everything is pretty straightforward.
good,LOVED IT super great people to work with the managers aren't the best only some of them are cool. Give really good hours and pay is great compared to other places
good,"No music to play and the workers was very rude and no respect and also was alot of favouritism therr so thats why i left and they also was making fun"
good,I absolutely loved working at target! The employees were outstandingly nice! The work was easy and pay was great! They work with your schedual! Super nice people!
good,it changes from fast past to snail pace in a heart beat.  The people are fun to work with and customers are great.  The hardest part about the job is standing on your feet.
good,"The management and the staff are great people to work with. I never felt unhappy working here, they always honored my availability, and it was close to home."
good,"I as most who were hired for logistics for season, were treated very well, to the the point that I could only find one serious problem besides not being asked to stay and expand into other departments. The training I received was sub par on a level that was incomprehensible the "" my device "" alone should have had cbts  for it. But I liked the crew the managers, the customers, the work environment. The only real problem was the training."
good,Great place to work. Great customer service. Clean and safe work environment for employees and the customers. Great management. Cares about the employees.
good,"Great place to work for a stepping stone of a corporate atmosphere. "
good,I went to work for 5 hours a day. What I learned while working at target is how to work with people and how to interact with costumers. I was a beauty supply worker and I stocked the shelves the job was not hard at all and I really enjoyed the experience I got from the job and Ii got to experience this as my first job.
good,"Great Customer Services, Retail , Hands On Learner , Great Listener , Creative , always Got My Work Done On Time , Attended Work On Time , Always Had A Great Mindset."
good,I loved this job. It was my first job as a cashier something that i always wanted to do. The relationship that I was in had so much stress on me and getting to work was a big factor of my qutting so i quit. Not because of the stress but because of the time i could not give in to it. If I cant give my best I would leave it to some else who can.
good,its cool to work at you can walk around for ah min to clear your mind but also get your work done. also some of the workers are nice people and its a layed back job
good,"Loved my Job there. I was sad to leave but I needed more money and just felt I was stuck in a position that was going no where. But as far as my management team. they always listened to my complaints. Tried there best to accommodate me. They were always so understanding. This place became my second family "
good,"I worked at Target during the holiday season, and it was fast, fun, and just overall exciting! The customers were great to work with, and the team members were very nice, and loved to boost up the others confidence."
good,"To start, the only negative is lack of advancement. It's very hard to move away from the dreaded closing shift. "
good,Working there was fun and easy.  I enjoyed having this as a part time seasonal job.  It helped me earn extra without too much stress.  Management was very helpful in working my hours around my regular job and family needs.
good,"·	Organize various departments in Softline including all apparel departments, including replenishment, re-shop, and returns."
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are in school, or as a second job. The pace is pretty even, so you never feel like you have to rush to get everything done. All store managers and lower level managers are great people to work with and they never make you feel subordinate (in a negative way). They are always ready to help you out in any way necessary. Target is a great company to work for."
good,I enjoy working at Target because they are very friendly and always have a warm inviting welcome. A typical day is great. I learn something new every time I work. Management is awesome. Always engage in a friendly conversation. The culture is diversity and I love it. Cant really say a hardest part of my job to be honest. I mostly enjoy engaging with my guest on a daily basis.
good,Target was the best job I had and I believed there were some negative things about working there. It was very fast paced and I had plenty of hours at first. I loved the people I worked with but some of the leaders weren’t very good at working with the people working underneath them.
good,"I was only seasonal at the time I was there but it was a good experience, fast paced with an emphasis on working together as a team. Flexible work hours."
good,It was okay if your open to the long hours. Early morning late nights. My experience overall was good there simply left for career growth. Would recommend others.
good,Great pay for college student who need to pay rent and have a bit of spending money. Hours are flexible and it is easy to find people who will trade shift with you/
good,There was no topical day while working at Target. The staff were always professional. Target  gives a variety of  times on your schedule but works with those who has schooling and or other jobs.
good,I wouldnt recommend the target in Merritt island Florida because the managers are super shady. I worked as a seasonal employee but I had 2 1/2 years of experience in target. At first I was kept and after all the seasonal employee was cut I was cut. I had a week left to work but they removed me off my schedule without telling me so when I went to clock in it wouldn't let me. One of the managers finally came and said oh yea someone took you off the schedule but didn't tell you. Smh I literally drove for 45 mins to get there and clearly I wasn't important enough to be told I was done. Never again
good,"it was ok, until they switch managers around or alter hours cause of sales. benefits were decent and their were shopping and other kinds of discounts."
good,A typical day at work would be just pulling things from the back of the store and placing them out for customers. Then I would be asked to go through aisles and clean them up. Often I would be moved to other areas such as to the grocery section to restock shelves.
good,Target strives for excellence during my tenure their. They focused on the customer and ways to grow the business. Leaders were forced to grow and develop which made future development easy for me.
good,"working at target was a great experience when i first began job.  i liked the ""fast, fun, friendly"" motto.  as a cashier, you often are the only employee the guest has direct contact with and i made sure it was a very positive experience.  "
good,"Depending on where you actually work in the store, your experience is going to be different. I work in softlines and it is one of the more fast-paced areas to be in. You always have something to do. The discount is only 10%, but if you get the redcard you get an extra 5% too."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of managing the cash register, cleaning up the area, helping guests, and putting away go-backs. A very easy-going job, especially since it was my first one ever."
good,great starter job for coming out of high school. great people to work with and an all around great job. cashier could be difficult by standing in one spot for many hours but the time would fly by because of the fact the being a cashier you were always busy.
good,"very competitive work scale they watch your productivity very closely"
good,I worked at two different Target locations and overall its a great company to work for. There are a lot of opportunities to be cross trained to widen your knowledge on a lot of aspects of working in a retail environment. The pay doesn't allow me to pay all of my bills without having a second job. The management at the first location was always rewarding people who went above and beyond. You never had to question your worth. They also had a wii in the breakroom and had free lunch available every other Friday that we weren't paid. The management at the second location I worked at had a tendency to be very condescending and weren't great at encouraging and telling their employees when they were appreciated. If you find a location with a great management team I definitely recommend it as a place to work.
good,I enjoyed most about the job was the guest. Meeting so many different people from different places. So were regular guest and also building reports with the guest was fun. Making such people that needed helped were helped. The hardest was just the holiday seasons just the rush time when the store would be packed with people. So it can get fast pace at times.
good,It’s really hot in there the ac does not work the people I work with are really nice everyone works as a team we all help each other out when we need it
good,I've honestly learned many new things while working with my immediate management and store leadership. Target aims to empower team members and allows for growth.
good,Good place to work nice people. It was a good environment to work at. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place I had an amazing time with all the employees .
good,It was a great company with great people. I really enjoyed my time their and it was a great learning experience. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,Ok place to work just require alot from you from stocking shields of merchandise to helping out with cashiering up front  helping out in market when truck arrive pushing  out outo-fills
good,"Target is a very good company to work for. Management very open and welcoming. The company is making great strides in compensation, the goal is a base pay of 15$ an hour by 2020. Target is also very open to letting you be your authentic self, you are able to show off tattoos, piercings, as well as multiple hairstyles and colors."
good,"It's a nice place to work at but not for me anymore."
good,"It was a relaxing work place. "
good,"The Joplin, M.O. location severed not only Joplin but also the surrounding cities. The team members where all fast, fun, and friendly, loved working here."
good,Fun place to work at. You meet a ton of new people and you get nice discount. Hours are not given a lot as they are strict on not paying over time and strict on taking lunch on time as they covering their backs from a lawsuit.
good,"I had fun working here because I was able to meet different customers everyday and I got a lot of hours in. This job was mainly chill, unless I was working a holiday."
good,This store was a pleasure to work at. Lots of work to be done and a wonderful staff to get it done. Open door policy with management was much easier at this location then some I had worked at previous.
good,#1 customer service. It was very fast paced because of the volume of the store. The days were eventful. Never a dull day. Employees are kind and with good sense of humor.
good,"Learned exceptional listening, and resolution skills.How to be a productive, and a fast learner while working as part of team or alone to produce high quality results.Need skills and the ability to work effectively under pressure. Perform high levels of customer satisfaction and meeting goals.The workplace culture is very open and diverse. These is a great job for college students need flexible hours."
good,"I was only a seasonal employee and was let go after their busy season, but I enjoyed the people I worked with and the supervisors were friendly and informative."
good,it was a good place to work paid my bills and left me with plenty of extra money. management was excellent and always made sure you were in safe working conditions.
good,There are great people to work with there. The pay is fair. Team leaders are great and will help you when you need it. The day starts by unloading the delivery truck and sorting boxes/items on pallets. the rest of the day i usually putting things in the right areas and on shelves.
good,I have worked at Target for a long time!  It is a great company to work for.  It is a fast paced job.  Great team to work with!  Expectations are high and resources are minimal.
good,"I worked through the Christmas holiday. It was face paced work, with familiar tasks everyday. It was fun having a team that you worked with everyday to stock the store."
good,"I believe Target is a good starter company to help buld resume up. If you are willing to work hard and act like you care, you will have job secuirty and have the possibility to get cross-trained in many different areas."
good,I wouldn't mind working at Target Superstore again it's just that working overnight was hard. I worked in the backroom unloading trucks most of the night then had to work the items onto the shelves.
good,"Working for Target is pretty alright. It's not the most exciting place to work in the world, but I always have felt secure and cared for. I would recommend working here to pretty much anyone."
good,"I’ve work as a cashier/sales floor. As a cashier, I greet my customers, ask if they want to sign up for red card.  Then as a sales floor,  I organized, fold, and ask our guest if they wanted any help or any information needed.  I enjoy being a cashier because it allows me to work on my customer service."
good,"I really enjoy working for a business that is so willing to let an employee develope in learning the different areas of the business.  The overall attitude of the co-workers are all positive and happy.  They are a great place to be employed at, and  also only offer part time work which is what I was looking for at the time.  They work really well with their employees on meeting the needs of their work schedules."
good,"a typical day for me is to clear ""Z-Racks"" and if i am finished i will help out with re-shop. When the store manager is around everything always seems to be really smooth as far as him making sure everyone is alright. there are a few coworkers that makes the day go by and fun to work which is also a plus. the hardest part of the job would be definitely fourth quarter only because it is constantly busy day and night."
good,"Willing to work with your schedule, very helpful and nice. Good team set up. Great pay and worked well with me. Most managers were really nice and funny."
good,Worked early in the morning help to unload the truck. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers as you were trying to stock. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with a group of people around the same age as myself.
good,The job was good with good coworkers. Everyone i met was nice to me even tho my training was bad and hard but overall everyone welcome me. My training wasn't good because i got to many people to train me and i got confused.
good,target was a great place to work but there is a lot of politics going on among the young management team. they pick favorites and its really unfair that the team leads don't look out for ALL their employees
good,"Target is a really great place to work.  All of the supervisors are kind, considerate and very efficient in their jobs as supervisors.  I really enjoyed working during the holiday season."
good,"I worked at Target while going to college. While the official training might be a little...lacking, it is easy to learn what you feel like your missing by asking the other team members. "
good,"Fun job, great attitudes and great training. This job was more for a college student. The paid days off take forever. The benefits takes forever as well."
good,A basic labor. Fun with a lot of communication. Fast paced and different obligations. Multiple orders from multiple leaders and my position gave me a consistent skill set and learned the value of routine.
good,"Working at Target was an interesting experience. I worked during the holidays as a seasonal worker. The shifts varied, which became an issue for me because I could not guarantee when I would be able to make plans with family."
good,You should work here. Great team. Decent hours.....You have a chance to advance your career also..... Flexible with your life schedule etc. I would work here again
good,"Very good team work"
good,"Target hires a lot of Type A, highly motivated individuals. Working with like minded individuals can be a blessing and a curse.  Work life balance could have been better."
good,Worked at a cashier all day. Sometimes out on the floor I would help straighten up departments. Great place to work. Hardest part of the job was people would call in sick so I would work split shifts. Best part of the job was meeting a lot of different people daily.
good,"Target is a great place to work. It can be very faced paced, however the team members are very supportive of one another we the culture promotes diversity and upholding great guest service to everyone walking through the doors."
good,"It was okay even though i was  seasonal  team members and that i got to work with new people everyday , i work at softlines which is manly the fitting room and the clothes"
good,The employees were fun and the managers very understanding. The costumers are usually very kind and understanding of you being a cashier. The pay for being a cashier is very good as well.
good,Thos is a great job with great training and the wages for working are just as good as the management that trains you. Wide selection of opportunities with great customer service.
good,"I enjoyed my employment with Target as well as my co-workers. Management was not always great but, the ones who knew their stuff were awesome!! I worked with some amazing people and I hated that I relocated out of state because they were fun and a joy to work with!!"
good,No attempt to balance work life . Waited 3 to  4 months to get a Saturday off for family reasons. Good place to work when it comes to people and the work getting done on a nightly basis
good,"Honestly for first time employees its probably a great place to start. One of the best jobs Ive worked since joining the work force. The hours are okay, bbut it really depends on the department you wanna join. Always ask how the staff is for where you want to go because if its short staffed youre going ti be in cor a hard time."
good,"Awesome place to work at, the crew members are all friendly. Management would celebrate our excellent customer service by rewarding all staff with snacks in the break room room"
good,"Great place to work. Always worked as a team. They tried to work with you concerning the schedule. Management was OK some were very good some no so."
good,"I learned how to handle cash and use the cash register, handle customers requests and clean up the store for the next day. I also made sure all my customers were happy when they walked into the door. Making sure the customer is happy is what makes the day go smoother"
good,Because I worked for the Mobile branch i was not employed by Target directly. But working in the stores I can tell you have I would've rather worked for them independently. They have a good family vibe.
good,Fast paced retail pharmacy that kept u busy and on your toes dealing with customers medicines as well as their store needs. As a pharmacy tech we take pride in helping customers get their medicines in a timely matter.
good,everyone gets along. always something to do. the customers were always friendly. never really got around any advancement opportunities. all in all its a great starter job for anyone.
good,"Great discounts and a lot of interesting interaction with guests make the job different for day to day. Rarely is this job boring. The management team, at least at the Fishers store, seem to be interested in the employees."
good,I loved my experience working there and I'd definitely work for the Target Company again. I would definitely recommend Target as a great first job to anyone.
good,"Working her is always something to keep you busy. People are great, discounts are okay also you get too see what is on sale before others do. Amazing job."
good,I love the day to day contact with customers. My co-workers are great to work with and are always willing to lend a helping hand. While the management team is focused on making sales and providing a clean environment they do understand when their team members have health issues or family issues and will do whatever they can to help.
good,Good company good hours a lot of work . Doesn't offer that much overtime unless for holiday easy they work with your schedule so that's a plus . Only I wish pay was more for the amount of work u do
good,"Had a lot of short breaks and long working hours, I started that job once i graduated high school, so i was extremely excited to work at target. I've became really sick while working there and had to leave because of their rules and regulations."
good,Target is a good company to work for. There are many opportunities to move up in the company. The pay is great if you choose to take different opportunities that are offered to you.
good,"I loved working at Target. I didn't feel like I was all over the place because of the order in there. It's an okay place to work if you don't mind being part time. I've never been full time but I enjoyed working there. Management isn't perfect. No one is, but they are awesome in admitting to mistakes and fixing them with you. The hardest part of the job is when the you are not pleased with your work by the end of the day."
good,"Great place to work, no benefits, inclusive culture. Friendly leadership and good training programs. Loved the diversity of working here. Would be nice if they offered benefits."
good,I  enjoyed my time at Target. Most managers were friendly. Some managers did not like helping other employees. I was often all around the store after I was done to help others.
good,"I am a hard working person, really enjoy working with the public am a people person. I love helping others out an learning new things as I go. Make a good team player get alone with everybody."
good,"A typical day is just coming into work and heading to the cashier dish and helping patients check out. However there is a system at target with R's and G's. They use these to see how well you do."
good,I use to love working at target when I help every customer save 5 percent when they sign up for a red card they joy I have in my heart when they save and bring a lot of coupons and shop more at our store and give us feedback
good,While employed at target. I am have been a good experience. I love the experience and the people that work there. Although some things need to be change
good,Working for target in general its ok. As the years progressed it was a good paying job. Management some people were ok and others weren't. The hardest part of the job Is the hours isn't always the same which isn't a good thing if you have responsibility.
good,Great environment to work. Customer service oriented and quality. However the pay was an issue they only started at minimum wage and rarely gave raises. Hours were sparatic.
good,"I was responsible for stocking merchandise on the shelves, unloading trucks with merchandise and helped customers when needed. I also was responsible for cleaning my work area and helped maintain a safe environment."
good,"I've worked for Target for 8 years, and learned everything about the store from being a cashier to joining the Planogram Team which was responsible for keeping the store clean, and putting together shelving and isles for the merchandise. I enjoyed greeting guest and guiding them to the products they were looking for."
good,"Had A Blast Target We LoveYOU"".WhoWould HAd Known we'd Be At the source Awards or turning up only thee lord knows so target you the best  ""o"" and one mo thang  keep them pizza's hottttt!"
good,Target is a constant and stable company to work for. Your work/life balance is taken into consideration. Your Job Work/Life Balance is taken into consideration and vacation day are given to compensate for this balance. Management is fair and easy to approach about concerns that you have. I am overall satisfied with my time and experience at Target.
good,Working for Target is very rewarding. The company really likes to take care of their employees and the company is always looking for ways to help out the community. There are lots of opportunities for volunteer work.
good,"Target is a great beginners job, but it is hard to grow within the company. I've learned how to manage a team, make decisions quickly, resolve any guest complaints, manage time, multitask, and go over and beyond for the company."
good,Some of the new members of management should not be in the positions they are in but the majority of the team members are awesome! Amazing friendships were built.
good,Target was a big company to work for they had many management issues that affected the employees not to work there they did not train people very well a lot of improvement can be done
good,Very good job if its your first job. Flexible hours great for going to school or for college. Downside is the pay is very low(minimum wage) and management looks down on some employees
good,"Target is a positive and fun place to work. However, it can be stressful at times especially when you are trying to help a guest and meet zoning timelines during your shift. Most of the team members are very friendly and help contribute to a fun atmosphere."
good,Target has a great policy for giving recognition to one another no matter how small the task was. Leaders make it easy to talk to them and working with teams makes things easy.
good,"Kind of has a high school atmosphere. So much room to grow though, but people like to condratict themselves. It may just be location, because target itself supports so many things in the community."
good,Great company to work for especially when you have a work schedule that you need help with.  They always work with you as long as you work with them and let them know
good,I learned so much at target but the customers was the best about the job. The management was amazing working at target is like working with loving family best place to work!!
good,"Check out various different customers, interact with customers, make sure have clean and safe work area, stock.  Managers and co-workers enjoyable to work with"
good,Very accepting environment and easy to get the hang of the job. Managers are nice and scheduling is flexible. Hardest part of the job is remembering where things are in the store in order to make the customer happy.
good,"This job is what you make it. Push the red-cards and you might get a free Starbucks every once in a while. Be friendly, management usually has an understanding side."
good,It's all about team work and making sure the customer fine what then need and be  satisfied of what they got. Target to be honest was not good it's just that target is to unorganize and sloppy
good,Co-workers are helpful. Enjoyed working with others and by myself. Had daily meetings to catch up on new information and regulations.
good,The job can very tiring.Get you good walking shoes because there is a lot of walking and moving around involved. Make sure to invest in a back brace because moving all this heavy cartons and boxes will make back problems occur.
good,"8 years good place.. friendly people.. flexible schedule"
good,"The day goes fast because we always have customers looking for something specific or trying to learn how to use our saving app, coupons and Red Card"
good,"Nice people to work with."
good,"I love this company, because I started off as a cashier and within a few months I was promoted to the pharmacy as a technician and eventually promoted to Team leader. The management when I left was excellent in turning things around as far as sales and promotions. I got ALOT of experience working here and for that I am grateful. I also liked the incentives of being a TL, which was guaranteed 40 hrs work weeks regardless of volume of prescriptions and workload and holiday pay whether you worked them or not. I also met a few co-workers who are to this day still friends of mine, even though we no longer work for the company. The only downside that I have about the location that I worked at were the messiness of some of the team members, those whom I had to consistently coach on doing things the Target Branded way and working as a team, instead of the childish he said/she said and gossiping about others."
good,"I worked for target for 6 years, I walked in just hoping to be a cashier, knowing no other trades or department. they literately built me from the ground up, put me in photo, then electronics, and then guest services, it helped me show myself my true potential, and I am forever thankful for them to do that."
good,"This job was a fun work environment, a diverse place . This is a company I believe you can advance in if the time and effort is put into it. The starting pay has changed since I worked here so compensation is good now."
good,Great place to work fast paced get to meet a lot of new people and learn a lot but the pay and hours are really bad and customer harassment is very bad management of course will agree with the customer even though what you said is the correct policy and that's how you were trained.
good,"Easiest job i ever had, mostly just unload truck and stock shelves but I work overnights. Managment is subpar, and several coworkers dont understand team work sometime, but it is still a job and sometimes a fun one at that."
good,"The days was really good. You work a 10 hour shift, it felt as though you only worked 6 hours. Work 10 hours a day Tuesday - Friday. "
good,"As a general manager at Target, you assess the needs of the business starting with instocks. You walk the floor with your leadership team and determine the plan for the day. Weekly you meet as a leadership team to determine upcoming plans for the business and to discuss trends and overall team performance. Utilizing daily and weekly reporting, the leadership team determines the priorities for the day to meet current objectives."
good,"cashier, guest service, sales floor, fitting rooms & answer phone, garden area. I worked all over the store so learned where everything was in all departments. I enjoyed helping guest find things they needed and was interested in.  worked with great people always busy."
good,this job was very fast paced but had great management and great co workers the pay coulda been more but is was still a good job
good,St. Vincent may have been one of my most favorite jobs. The workers all over the hospital we all so nice and so helpful. If I could ever go back I'd go back quickly.
good,Great place to work with friendly co-workers who are always happy to assist. Connecting with customers about their problems and solving them.
good,It was a great opportunity! I gained more experience in being organized and working well with a team in different aspects to accomplish one goal.
good,"I learned that Target is a Great company but the managers there need some better training but it is what it is."
good,"I made a lot of friends with co workers, however the management was not the greatest. i wish they would have worked more with our scheduled and allowed people to have rotating weekends off."
good,I truly enjoy the customer contact and management was very helpful and happy peoples. I liked working for Tatget but it was seasonal job would like to go back.
good,"Rather than helping you with anything, they would rather sit around talking, and bending the rules to meet their own needs. Only reason I rated 5 stars; $9.00/hr retail position."
good,"I really like the company and the benefits that are offered. I really enjoy working with the other team members. Overall I have learned a lot while working at Target,"
good,"It was a fun job working as a cashier, got to meet a lot of new people and make sure their shopping experience was wonderful. I enjoyed getting to know how to do other things besides being a cashier, like grocery stock clerk"
good,"A typical day of work is usually very demanding physically, but as a cart attendant I'm able to move about the store to assist other team members who require assistance , say with a heavy box or retrieving an item for someone who is unavailable to obtain it at the time."
good,Productive and fun. The day to day workload was reasonable for the job position. It was great getting to meet new people everyday from all over the country. Very busy environment.
good,"I love the management team at my store. Most of the team leaders here are great as well, there is a team leader who speaks to people in a way that is very inappropriate. "
good,"Lots of labor work. Repetitive work, Get to see the newest inventory stores are receiving. Real big on personal safety."
good,"Target is definitely a great place to work.  Target has allowed me the flexiblility in my work schedule by changing my work hours so that I could study & attend college classes.   Working with my local HR Manager at my Lennox Center I was able to change my work schedule up to three or four times a year.  It allowed  me the time to acquire my Associates in Applied Science in Paralegal Studies degree."
good,Not the easiest job out there but it was fun. Unloading the trucks and stocking the shelves could be physically exhausting. All of my coworkers were nice and helpful.
good,"It is a good place to work. The only things I disliked is obviously the rude customers and the guest service team leaders who take 3 hours to get you change for your register. Another thing I disliked is how they push selling the red cards on you, you have to ask EVERY customer when it honestly should be done at guest service's with how long it takes. I was hired for Seasonal but I ""didn't make the cut' along with several other people who were seasonal, we were all told that there are no open positions. But guess what!? They are hiring for part time now that we are all told they don't have any positions available!!"
good,Its a very fair place that you can work from the bottom to the top.they dont give to many hours and they pay low.and i was only working there as temp.
good,"target flow team is such a great place to work for, co workers are amazing, no hard part about stocking... the most fun part about target you go in a 4am and get off around 2!"
good,"A typical day at work is so exciting and unpredictable, i get to greet customers everyday, and assisting them with whatever they need help with. I love working with all my co-workers, they are all so very helpful and friendly. I would say the most enjoyable part about my job is just getting to talk to new people every single day and getting a positive report from my leads."
good,"I love working for target, its a good starting place. I love how target has positions that you can really grow and develop in the company. there is always a place for you."
good,"Employees that you work with can a pain in the neck for the majority of the time. Where I worked, not really flexible with school schedule while working."
good,liked working  with computers  very  interesting  and loved working  with a large company  like nationwide insurance and  and  people were   great to work  with  to bad it only  temp
good,My first job because of there leadership i was able to grow and learn my skill set. The team that I was trained by were extremely memorable crew. The events they hold are excellent and they truly do care about there people.
good,"For the past few years that I've been with Target.  I'm seeing that working for Target is just stepping stone to where I want to be at. My character of working with the public has grown a lot and I'm comfortable in my own skin when it comes to any disagreements and able to stand my own ground. My immediate coworkers I work with are simply awesome! There's never a dull moment, we work hard, but we always bring laughter into the workplace. It keeps everyone in a uplifted mood. The hardest part of my job when I'm on cashier is having customers sign up for Red Cards (Debit or Credit). The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my regular customers every time I'm in at work, being able to make their drink before they pay for there drink."
good,"When hired in, I worked a lot of hours.  I enjoyed working here.   I learned how to deal with upset customers.   They did rotate me on different duties of the store which gave me a lot of experience."
good,Typical day at work here was to stock shelves with product. This is where I learned that I really enjoyed doing this type of work.Management was great. My co-workers were very helpful.The hardest part of this job was not being able to work for them permentaly. The most enjoyable part of the job would have been stocking the shelves
good,"I enjoyed working for Target with creating relationships with the employee's and the customers.  When you are bored you can move to a different area of the store.  Flexible hours, and if you aren't getting enough or have too much, there is always ways of getting more or giving up shifts to others.  Upper management was less to be desired since they all thought they are high and mighty and that they shouldn't work out on the sales floor but to be in their office doing who knows what."
good,I work at Target night shift and enjoy many learner. always I listen to supervisor what she or he want me do right thing. My coworkers were great and cooperation as team. Not really hardest at work just flexible jobs.
good,"although it was an extern sight for me it allowed me the opportunity to hone in on all the possible skills I had studied for in school, it allowed me to adapt in an actual environment of a fast pace setting such as the process of receiving the prescription to filling and having it ready for the customer rather then being in a class environment were it takes a bit longer to practice the steps of being a technician."
good,"Be ready to start working once you got there. Prepare your attitude to assist both hard, and easy customers. I was taught how to conduct my time wisely, to finish my designated zone in a certain amount of time. Not to get distracted by fellow co workers, but to get the task done. My team leader was present in assisting me when I had questions on my work ethic. This job was an amazing experience all around, working alone or working together with my co workers was a great opportunity."
good,I was only there for a short time but the experience was fun it was a fast-paced work environment and was able to adapt. I learned a lot about working in a store and the customers expect.
good,"If you like being busy this is a great place. People can be fun, but every now and then you have a bad day and everyone gets grouchy. There is always something to do to keep you moving,"
good,What I learned was to inventory and stock different departments of the store never a dull moment. It was quiet and peaceful since we had to stock overnight hours.
good,If you have the opportunity to work here I would jump at the chance. Target has great business practices and it is a very controlled environment. Do what you are supposed to do and do it well and you will be rewarded.
good,"I work early mornings, unloading the trucks, stocking the shelves, and helping customers as needed. I enjoy my co-workers, as they have a great sense of humor."
good,"Target had a great working atmosphere. Everyone was willing to help others learn and succeed, and we worked together to get the best and most reliable information possible. There were some really long weeks, and some really short weeks. Either way, the culture at Target was always warm and welcoming, and it was a great place to work."
good,"It was a great experience in retail, worked in a friendly,positive, helpful and team oriented environment. Multi-tasked every department, dealt with"
good,A positive environment and opportunities for growth. Managers are excellent and professionals. They were very patient and helpful during the training process. They offer genuine support for both work and life. It was a very good experience for me.
good,"I loved working at Target. Although, my stay was brief I met a plethora of genuine people. Everyone was always happy, caring, & well mannered. This job helped me to attain a greater respect for retail workers"
good,I would gather carts and put em in the store for people to use. Year round so the winter is the hardest time of the year. I liked the fact I didn't have to deal with as many people as my co-workers who work on the register.
good,Good steady work place where safety is top priority. Co-workers were all good to work with at busy times. Managers would also offer assistance on an as needed basis.
good,it was a great enviornment and u enjoyed every second of it the people there took the time to train me. i could always talk to people
good,"Great experience ,being a team flow member is very fisical.Great excersice. It takes a I want to succeed type personality to preform and strong team particepation to succeed."
good,Working at target has given me the opportunity to experience what it means to be a working class citizen. I was able to learn so many things I never knew and able to grow with the company. Management was understandable with my journey to and from school and allowed me job security.
good,"My duty at Target is off loading the trucks and pushing the product on the shelves. Also, zone the store and assisting customer in selection that they wish to purchase. At times I work at the cash or the backroom."
good,"Excellent team work, good guidance, manageable work hours, great experience, how to be organized, satisfied customer needs, sometimes short staff, the well environment with co-workers and appreciation of management, it was a great experience and hopefully in the future jobs I can find a same work environment."
good,"Great place to work with team skill developing.  The hardest part of the job is training the youth of today, they want the money for a least the work."
good,"A typical day at work would include a huddle. A huddle is when all available team members get together in a circle and talk the importance of the day. After huddle, the day will be filled with heavy workloads done in a fast, fun, and friendly way. The hardest part of my job is to tell a guest that we don't have certain products at the store. What I've enjoyed most at Target is working with the most caring team ever. :)"
good,"teamwork "
good,"I am a smart professional with a lot a positive attitude & a strong believer in myself. I believe that ultimately it’s my hard work and perseverance that is going to help me achieve my goals. I am quite open-minded & flexible towards my work profile and believe that no work is small. I feel immense pleasure in meeting new people and experiencing diverse cultures & adapting it. I eagerly look forward for roles and assignments that entail responsibility, offer opportunities to tap my potential to the fullest and make an impact by adding value to the firm"
good,"Making sure the customers are finding things that they need of their interest. Making sure I keep a smile on my face and the customers face at all times. My management team was well put together, well organized, and always working as team players. It's not a hard part as long as you are making the customers happy you will be happy with a job well done. I loved working in the baby section of the store."
good,Helping the company for the holidays hardest part was making sure merchandise was clear prior to opening the store
good,A typical day at work starts at 7 am ends at about 3:30pm with no surprises .company has room to grow
good,You are just just giving a helping hand to the secertary helping make sure she has everything backed up and is not missing a step.
good,"I worked for a great group of people, got to do many different duties, as well as working the cashier. It was a good place to work."
good,I enjoyed working for Target.  The drawback was not being able to advance in the company without a college degree.
good,"tutor kids"
good,"Replenishment for whole store following company based on "
good,seasonal job flexible schedule good pay and opportunity for advancement.
good,"Overall, I good place to work. If you don't want a typical office job. Very demanding physically, peoples personalities tend to get in the way sometimes. Management is more concerned about payroll then performance and morale. No advancement from within the team itself, most FLOW team members are unable to move into more senior roles."
good,Great place to work staff is very helpful you can learn a lot from working at target it was my first job
good,"The Target store in Emeryville would be a nice at i shop there,.it would be nice to work at,it's close to home,.i could walk there from home."
good,"A typical day at work is not really fun because the store is empty and the job is just not fun without customers. "
good,good job and long days. Management rarely interact with associates.
good,"i learned every job in the store i was a good employee, the pay at the time was lousy but the staff were great."
good,target was a great experience for me dealing with many different people. I learned how to work with unhappy guest and how to make them happy. Co-workers were very helpful at times. There were no hard parts at target.
good,"I loved working with all co-workers and guests. It was always a fun and friendly environment. I liked the fact that I was able to be myself with such a positive attitude and just make it comfortable for guests to get along with me. I did very well selling bundles for game systems, televisions, and etc. As well as having more experience in the store, as to operator and service calls. I was in charge of electronics products, as to what new product was coming out and making sure my department was on top. It would get a little difficult at times when we did not have back up and I couldn't get things done that same day. The best part I loved of working there was having the guests satisfied with the service i provided and just the new things I'd get learn."
good,Great place to work. Taught me many things that are going to make me successful.
good,We started the day taking items from the backroom where the merchandise is kept and stocked the sales floor. We made sure the sales floor had plenty of items and made finding what customers wanted easily.
good,The team unloads the trucks and stock the shelves in a timely manner.
good,"All  the shifts vary , they work around my school hours. I was hire to be a cashier but did a little stocking and human resources."
good,"Really fun environment, the only thing was that at times it seemed you were in high school, too much drama"
good,"The pharmacist was very helpful with my training, I was shown how to inventory controlled substances. Every day I had a chance to familiarize myself with the pharmacy's structure."
good,"overall its okay, but I am highly motivated person who wants to do better."
good,Worked there while in High School - enjoyed the experience - learned a lot about retail - customer service - stocking - presentation - working a register - it was a fun first job.
good,Still to this day i shop Target about 4 to 5 times weekly. Love the atmosphere and the outlook the company has on its employees. Company discount was great as well.
good,The people who worked there were one of the companies greatest assets.
good,I worked for longer hours.  have learnt that handwork makes a person professional. i have the ability to manage my work n my personal life.
good,"Great work experience for high school students. Great source of time management skills and multi-tasking abilities. The hardest part of the job was separating work and fun, due to this being the first job I had ever had. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with youth and help them gain life skills and extra-curricular activities. I was able to gain formal and informal communication skills. Also, leadership abilities, and knowledge of program development."
good,"It was a great job to work at, good employees and was well manged. "
good,Target was a fun place to work. they always take care of their staff. a little hard on work ethics but thats ok. very very flexible with school schedules and personal time off. they help celebrate birthdays and special causes.
good,"I would provide customer service and help cash them out. Fill prescriptions, type prescriptions, order medications, clean and keep stocked the pharmacy."
good,Unloaded a truck at the beginning of the night then stock the shelves after word so customers can buy those products we offered and then back stock any excess product not needed in the backroom.
good,It is the best customer service job I have had.  The management knows how to handle its employees through good and hard times.  The story that I work at has been chronically understaffed for about 3 to four months and it has been rough with workloads backing up.
good,this was the first job that I had while I was still in high school. I enjoyed my first job
good,"My days at work are composed by hard work, keeping your customer comfortable in there shopping letting them know how great are our items and the prices, make sure the section is ready for a next day. Well done replenishment, update the planograms as soon as possible. My day by day consist on giving my best, and always keep my smile and my sense of humor. the best part is when you walk out the door knowing that everything you did was well done and the best."
good,"I worked with a helpful and energetic team, from mangement to my co-workers."
good,"I enjoy working at target there's always new and fun things happening there. I love the fact I have build relationships with guest that shop in my store on a day to day basic. On a typical day I'm helping my store maintain a fast fun and friendly environment which  includes helping guest find things they are looking for, returns and exchanges, and making sure there is product shock for our guest. I've learned a lot my years working for Target I think it shaped me into the person I am today, I learned time management skills, the importance of customer service and making sure guest leave happy just to name a few. I feel my co-workers and the management push me to work hard and want to be a better person everyday we help each other out and get whatever issue or problem solved. The hardest part of my job is the super busy times when I have a million and one things going on with little to no stuff to help but even those times I see a opportunity to use my skills and get the job done."
good,"everyday varied"
good,The customer service standards at the store where I worked where not up to my standards or that of the standards they where when I hired in.
good,"I loved going to work every time, i get along very well with others and im a good worker so i really never had bad days. the hardest part was the heavy lifting and back stocking in the freezer! brrr! my managers were great! then they brought in new managers and it felt like i was in boot camp and the hours dropped big time!"
good,"A typical day at work is managing all the employees and taking care of all issues  that may occur with customers. What I have learned while working at Target is to always treat our customers with the highest respect and make sure that we offer the best customer service. I have great leadership skills. I am able to manage multipe areas in the store such as Guest Service, Cashiers, and Target Cafe. I manage at least 50 people on a daily basis. My co-workers value my opinion and have great respect for me as I have for them as well. The hardest part of my job is making sure every customer leaves the store happy that they chose us to shop with today. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting many different people. Going above and beyond  helping our customer fine the perfect gift for a friend or family member seeing the smile on their face when they came in the store clueless on what to buy."
good,"Management is on board for honesty, team building efforts. great job to learn how to develop core values and concepts working within a team setting."
good,"Fast, fun, and friendly positive attitudes with all team members. Great team leaders and executives who are always there to help out."
good,I made sure the customer is happy and made sure they find everything they needed before i ringed them out and I also did a little bit of customer service
good,Cashiering. Guest services.
good,meet and greet the new employees i learned customer service skills
good,"A typical day at target was always exciting. My co-workers made it a fun experience for me, and made my shift go by fast. I enjoyed assisting the guest with transactions, or with questions and concerns. It made me feel good when I could help solve a problem for them without having to ask someone more experienced. I enjoy the management, although some of them made the work place seem tense when they wouldn't say hello to some of the team mates and not greet each guest as they walked by. Almost as if they thought they were to high up to speak to anyone. Overall I enjoyed working here."
good,"Typical retail environment. Not a career for me, but got a lot of my management skills from them which prepared me for my career."
good,Even though I had only worked there very briefly I thought that it was pretty easy going though I don't think that I would like to work during the holiday season that much. Too many people coming and going doing last min shopping kind of annoys me to the max I personally try not to be like those people
good,Happy place to work. Would be nice if they paid more and made benefits easier to get but overall its a good place to work. They seem to genuinely care about the employees.
good,"Working at Target is not a life long career but it is a fun job with great staff to keep you going. Management is there when we need to talk to them and they are easy to work with. To work nights like i do most times, you must have a sense of humor. The hardest part about the job is the stand on your feet for hours at a time."
good,"It was fun, and they believed that it was all for one and one for all. I learned a lot from them. But they downside is that if you displease some one they are quick to try and get rid of you, and even though your are not on commission, you have to make attachments with all sales you do. But all an all It was a nice place."
good,"My day starts with me informing my team on tasks for the day, Than I would get on the computer to check for any messages from corporate. I also would follow up with management about any concerns. The hardest part of my job was to make sure that our workload was completed on a daily basis. I got along with all of my co-workers even when they just started to work."
good,"Stocking merchandise, helping customers and supporting other teams of the store."
good,Day to day operations stocking merchandise an getting store presentable for morning customers
good,"Great overall work space. I worked in the electronics section and I loved the people, the surrounding and the overall customer satisfaction I gave."
good,A day of work at target is fast pace. I learn in day how to move frieght in and out the store. Management is fair and treat its employers good. My co-workers are great workers and nice.Hardest part of this job is the holiday season. The most enjoyable pary of this job is the discount.
good,"When I Was In Highschool I Had The Oppurtunity To Become A Office Assistant Which Allowed Me To Get A Receptionist Office Type Feel. I Filed & Managed Paperwork,Greeted Guest etc."
good,"I worked in a office by myself, so this was a great job, not everyone will have that ability, the staff was amazing, I still have friends I meet there years ago. The pay was okay, and if you are not in management the hours are not plentiful."
good,"Assited customers,Wrapped, weighed, labeled and Stocked Meats and other"
good,"I always looked forward to working, I love working with people. I learned when to be easy going and when to be very serious. The managers were great always had everythin on track. The hardest part of the job was when we were very busy it got overwhelming. I always enjoyed serving people and knowing i did everything very good. My co-workers were always helpful and friendly."
good,"My job was to unload the truck and properly stock shelves in orderly manner. The management was typically easy to work with and talk to. There was no hard parts to this job, it was enjoyable while it lasted. Coworkers were there usually to come to do their work and go home"
good,It was always busy and meetign different kinds of people. the coworkers were nice and fun to work with. never boring at work.
good,I was able to help many people find what they needed. I learn how to work at a fast pace on Black Friday. management was friendly made sure had everything I needed to perforn my job requirements. They were also very fair. My co-workers were very nice. The hardest part of the job was Black Friday waking up so early to work with a very hectice crowd but I got through it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts and learning al the new stuff we got in.
good,I had a blast when I worked here. Great co-workers and atmosphere.
good,"The hours are plentiful and the customers are fun, but there is very little job security."
good,My personal review about Target was an excellent experience they presented me with an opportunity when they did not have too. I met some very nice indivisuals during my work time there.
good,"target is a good working place but they should identify good employees and give them a opportunity to advance in their career in the company."
good,Days are pretty routine. Nothing really changes. Except for new products or guests. I've learned how much it takes to make a target a target. Target is very inclusive and non judgmental.
good,Excellent place to work. Management is kind and understanding. Hours are flexible and everyone is extremely helpful. There are a lot of different jobs for different people. Very inclusive environment.
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with and I also enjoyed working independently when I had night shifts. There was a routine that I got used to and it was easy to learn. I also enjoyed learning about new products. It was easy to stir women in the right direction when it came to showing them a product that was similar to what they were looking for. I also really enjoyed taking control of the beauty sampling event because I learned how to really sell products.
good,"It’s a good job with benefits, but the managers sucks a&$!! Other than being slow in January (like most retail jobs) and the managers it’s cool. Sometimes $13 is not enough though"
good,Target is very welcoming. When I started I was a bit nervous but I then realized how family oriented my job was. I loved this the most about my job . Also every understanding company.
good,"A typical day at work for me involved placing items on shelves from carts. For me, it was mostly toys and I was able to further enhance my customer service skills. My managers were very instructive and supportive of me and appreciated my personality. The hardest part of the job was that, sometimes, I might have had to move heavy objects down from high shelves which is a chore if you're on a ladder. The most enjoyable part was being able to interact with the customers and really make them happy."
good,Flexible hours was a great benefit in the company. Hard to sell customers on the store credit card and customer appreciation program. Breaks during the holiday season maybe delayed.
good,Had a great time working there and met great people. Working here prepared me for every other job. The potential for growth is great but you have to put in the work and be willing to learn.
good,Target was a very fun place to work. I loved my job. It didn't feel like I was at work when I was there. Loving what you do is a plus when looking for a job.
good,This job gave me a lot to take with me leaving it taught me a lot about responsibility. One thing I liked about my job was that there were a lot of people that I met that I enjoyed meeting.
good,"This was truly a phenomenal company to work for, they took care of us really well, had great hours and breaks however, no matter your job performance you will get laid off"
good,My review on target is a good place to work. Working there i only got about 2 to 3 days a week and i kept asking for more hours they just wouldn't give us more.
good,"The management were really helpful and this is a great job if you are attending school. Life can be hard balancing it all depends on the person but working at target was convenient, easy, good work experience especially for learning what customer service is. I was hired seasonal and was let go but I wouldn't mind working here again"
good,Target has a great atmosphere centered around guest experiences. If you like making people smile and laugh this is the place to work! If you apply expect to work anywhere between 20-40 hours depending on what your store location needs. Some days are easy and simple other days you'll be pressed to work harder and faster to keep up with guest demands. My favorite part of the job was being able to build networks and relationships with other team members. Granted not all locations are the same so be prepared to either love it hate it like any other job.
good,I really enjoyed working here. The employees were very friendly and helpful. The supervisors were kind and eager to help when needed. The customers were friendly. Great work environment.
good,"Open with salary flexible work hours"
good,The best day at work is where we all came together as a team to help out the back when they was overload with a truck . We came as a team to help out as we do at our job
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work with great compensation. Hard to get hours, and difficult to advance in the company. I worked in 3 different departments."
good,I learned that a great attitude and positive energy can get you far. While being at target I received employee of the month. It made me feel like I can do more with my time to help me be able to support family.
good,Come in get the day started by clocking in and go straight into what needs to be done that done. The environment gives off good energy and vibes which can cause the day to go by smooth.
good,Working as a cashier and customer service member I have learned many new things quickly. You are taught to do new tasks and apply them to your work skill almost everyday. I loved getting the opportunity to adapt to new things and love every new task I was assigned.
good,"The team leads and members are all very supportive and fun to be around. It is a good environment to work in, and for the most part I enjoy being there."
good,Better hours if your schedule is open ended. Must gca team player. Must be flexible with job duties. Must be outgoing and very comfortable with guest interactions.
good,Good company to work for just need to increase pay and give employees more benefits but overall great company to work for and they  will work with your availability
good,"Target is a great company to work for. There are many oppurtunites with this company. Holdays can be challenging, but that is common to all retail jobs."
good,"Depending on management, the culture could be fun and fulfilling, or stressful and not fun at all.  I worked with both scenarios, obviously enjoyed the fun and fulfilling.   Raises are determined by team leaders, could be unfair since it depends on how the person likes you.  There is also the culture of being able to get rid of someone even if they are doing a good job.  Favoritism plays a big part, again depending on management.  There seems to be a tendency to purge the older  people.  They can target one employee, set them up to fail and fire them.  I've seen this done many times, I managed to make it eleven years before my time came."
good,I love working for Target and experiencing the everyday challenges to bring our work culture to a new positive level. Team unity is very important to me and working together to achieve that.
good,I absolutely loved working for this company I left due to poor management but this job was a blast I learned so much about customer service and cash management. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"A day at Target unloading trucks consists of being; quick, accurate, and stamina. You have to put the boxes that come off the truck on U-boats. They all have signs with different locations throughout the store. There is 3 levels on a U-boat helps organize ever aisle in each location. Once the truck is done you have to grab a U-boat for whatever area your in that day. Work the freight out in to the area it goes to. Aisles usually consist of 5-10 sections and 3-6 levels in aisle. After your done working out freight you back stock and throw your cardboard, recycle, and trash."
good,I worked. At the northeast Philadelphia location for about a year.My team leader who taught me a lot about retail and you could not ask for a better boss.The rest of the management team were pretty great too.Everybody there from the guys and girl that worked on the line just a great place to work.
good,"Management is nice, co workers are friendly. I like it there, but if your working in general merchandise be prepared to lift! Its retail so it has its pros and cons!"
good,The job is extremely easy with the right team. Unfortunately in my experience I'm left alone to do all the work. The managers are are way to busy to help us out especially in my electronics section. Iv been managing for now but every month or so another responsibility is added on to my already long list of tasks.
good,The hours they give you are not enough. You’ll need a 2nd job if you got bills to pay. But overall nice people and very organized. There’s a lot of order and regulation.
good,Good overall company as a starting job to gain experience and skill when needed to gain more experience for a better job opportunity and plenty of room to grow with in the company as well if desired
good,"When the Cashier line is busy especially during the holiday seasons. The manager or supervisor are always there to help the lane, which it makes easy for the customers to not wait for long."
good,"Target is an absolutely wonderful comapny to work for! I landed a management role on the store side right out of college, and the leadership, organization and operation management skills I gained from my time there have truly shaped me as a manager. I loved my time with Target, but the schedule was not something I was able to continue with. If it weren't for that, I would 100% still be working there!"
good,I only worked at target as a seasonal employee but I don't have any complaints. I feel I was paid fairly for my job title and was never treated unfairly in any way.
good,Target gave me a great experience. They helped me achieve some of my goals. They were a great team to work for nothing but much love for the target employees.
good,"I learned a lot working at target, they were involved with the community, the management was fair and understanding, I got ahead I didn’t just stay in one position"
good,"My typical day at work consist of laborious, confusing, intricate work. However, once you see through the poor management and lost coworkers, you enjoy your job."
good,"Good, friendly team environment and mentality. Large variety of jobs and many locations to work at. Possibilities for advancement limited. Work/life balance very dependent on position."
good,"My experience working at target Ansonia was both fun and hard work. I took calls, sorted, zoned, and pushed items in the soft lines department, I just wish I could have worked there longer."
good,"Sales floor"
good,"For a first job, I can confidently say that my job experience at Target was great! All team members were very welcoming and always willing to help without even asking. The GSTL's were easy to talk to and very professional. Everyone was productive and always on their feet helping guests. There was never a moment where we didn't have to do anything, and if there was, our management gave us a new set of tasks to keep ourselves busy and professional."
good,"I worked at Target DC 589 for almost 2 years. I absolutely loved the people that I worked with! The culture took a downward step the longer I was there and as good people left and they replaced them with lazy, negative individuals. You will work for your mp ey here! But the pay is pretty good. Management could use a little work, they aren't terrible, just not great. Overall, if you don't mind working hard, this is not a bad place to work."
good,I loved working there and all of the different areas i was able to work in. I had no issues while working at target. I wish the pay was a little better.
good,"Mostly fun , organized good management good co workers nice location dress code ok fast paced business with lots to do make time go fast great part time job"
good,I love the respect that everyone gives to one another.  Also love working as a team.  Love the cleanliness of the store and the friendly staff.  As well as the store management comes out and starts to help in different departments.  Store management now doesn't and or even see's employees as much like she should.  Some employee haven't met her at all.  And the location is perfect.
good,Target was a good learning experience to advance to better jobs it was great for me when I was younger until I had a child the only problem was it wasn't enough hours everything else I could've delt with
good,I would recommend Target to anyone looking for a seasonal job. I was let go for a personal reason but over all I enjoyed my job. How ever I would not recommend my old store for the management is not fair in their judgment.
good,"When i first started working there, all of my coworkers were so nice and friendly. if you needed help, they were there. they would converse with you even if you were new, made you feel like you were at home or life long friends. i would love to work for the company again!"
good,"I honestly have always loved Target as a company. I was employed at Target twice in My life and My first time being employed with them in auburn Hills, MI I had a great experience and learned so much. I only stop being employed due to a High Risk Pregnancy . It wasn't until I was Employed again at the Dearborn , MI Location on Ford rd that I experienced Poor management which pushed Me to Quit eventually . "
good,"The pay is competitive and they actively have raised the minimum wage company-wide since I have been there. There are a lot of great discounts and benefits available to you simply for being a Target Team Member such as discounts on mobile phone services, in-store discounts, etc. Management can be horrible at times but there is usually at least one person with power that you can count on. I interviewed for general sales floor and was offered a job in Electronics due to the way my interview went and my previous work history. They try to place you where they think you will thrive."
good,"i liked working at target. my co workers were nice, my manager was easy to talk too, it was a really good experience. it was also during the holidays that i worked there, so it was always busy."
good,Target is very well oiled machine. They are more strict than expected for work that’s not that hard honestly. They make sure you are compensated sometimes. The only problem with the establishment was that the schedule would change and no one would be until the day of their shift or favoritism.
good,"Was a good first job, they hired me without any work experience. I was able to work as am nay hours as I wanted essentially and was able to cross train."
good,"I definitely liked the Environment I worked in as a cashier, very fun and exiting experience with the other co workers and also the guests that had come into the work place."
good,"I love target, its been my favorite  since I was a kid. Something that bothers me the most about working at target is how busy it can get especially  in the area I'm in. They really need to do more studies on which days of the week and times are the busiest for target so that every register can be open and operating. I think they need to scatter registers all throughout their stores instead of in the front area"
good,"The management at Target was never helpful.  They were only in it for the money. I loved working with some of the people there, but mostly I worked by myself even on projects. The benefits at Target were great. You earned vacation time, even if you worked part time."
good,"pretty good, sometimes stressful when not a lot of people are working and some team leads are better than others, but an enjoyable job overall. The hardest part is when you start working, they will put you in many different places and then you'll get the job they promised you in the beginning. Very cliquey though, have to be in with certain group to be respected and well-liked. management was sort of messy, very nice but seemed confused a lot."
good,Great working there fantastic I got great customer service and it's amazing the work is easy and fast to pay is a lot it's just great the managers work with you the shifts are okay.
good,"Worked during the holidays, so it was always busy and made the shifts pass by faster. I enjoyed keeping clothing areas tidy and organized, and helping at the register whenever needed."
good,Working at target is fun it’s chill so not to crazy it would be if your just staring to get into the work force it would be a perfect Kobe very simple and nice pay if you can get the hours
good,"I loved working for Target, and I really would love to work for them again. I loved the environment, it was relaxed and everyone knew their job well. Everyone was on top of what they were supposed to be doing. They pay extremely well, I was never stressed over lack of money. I loved it."
good,"This was a great job and I was sad to go.  The entire team pulls together every day to get the job done.  Retail is hurting all over right now and unfortunately, online shopping is really hurting these big box stores."
good,Has its ups and downs but once you get through the first week its pretty easy. All I would say it to work hard and be determined to get the job done at all cost.
good,Working at Target can get stressful very quickly but it is definitely worth the pay. You must be goo dat standing on your feet and bending over a lot to be on the sales floor.
good,I worked at Target as a seasonal cashier. I loved this job because it was fast paced and the days went by quickly. My job consisted of ringing up items the guest was purchasing and handling money. I also organized the dollar section and my aisle when it was slow.
good,"Working as a Backroom Associate is gathering inventory for the primary stock crew and setting up carts and u-boats for them.  Then placing all back stock into warehouse area.  Expect to be in -40 degree freezer daily to get inventory.  Overall fun job, doesn't pay much more than minimum wage, but the team environment is very satisfying.  You will meet a lot of people and learn many things."
good,The typical hours that I work as a Target associate are 8am-4pm (sometimes 5pm). I float between the front end as a cashier or customer service representative at the guest service desk. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with unsatisfied customers but the most rewarding part is the flip side of that.
good,Target is a fun and fast paced place to work at. The people and environment make it a fun place. I’ve learned how to work as a team and how to interact with people on a daily basis. The only down side is that the pay is very low. Which is really the only reason I would think of leaving this company.
good,This was one of the best jobs I have worked when it came to the camaraderie between your co-workers. They were very supportive to each other and the environment was relaxed. Management was also fair and treated everyone with respect. The criticism was constructive.
good,"Worked at Target as ETL HL and LOG."
good,"you are always being put to work, however it consistently feels as though the LOD's (leader on duty) haven't worked in a full section in so long that they expect a lot more than i'm able to give in an alotted time slot- typically 4.5 hours"
good,"I enjoyed my job for most of the time I was there. I wound up leaving for a promotion at my part time job."
good,"Great people, desireable job, but very hard to move vertically. Despite efforts from Target to appear to encourage vertical movement every employee around me has gone to an external company after frustration with vertical movement."
good,Target was a great place to work the organization pays its workers well and the systems in place are fairly simple to use and rarely crash. The only issue i found in work there was dealing with managers that didn't relate to a majority black workforce. Were condescending at times which upsets some employees and lead to awkward work place enthronements.
good,"Foundation in customer support/service begins here. Plenty of reasons to apply, both for those with experience in upper management and for those seeking easy, seasonal employment opportunities."
good,The environment is very friendly and positive. You get employee discounts. Will give you a lot of hours and then will cut them once they begin hiring more people so beware.
good,"Target was a very enthusiastic , high speed, upbeat place to work for . Managers were welcoming and helpful , could definitely work on evening out hours and being more on top of handling shifts ands hours. While working at target there were always task to keep yourself busy and help time go by. There are no stupid questions at target if your ever in need of help or have questions of any sort there is always a helping hand . Overall great place to work for ."
good,Days at work are fun and easy. Target taught me great work ethic and basic skills to advance to a full-time career. The management at target is alright.
good,"I would walk in the beautiful red doors at 9 oclock am, I would usually go to the break room to get a soda before I clocked in. I would then clock in and go to my work station. I would begin to prep the foods , and then serve them. I did this for 8 hours until I clocked out."
good,"Greeted the guests, unloaded the truck, re merchandised the sales floor, operated the phone and fitting room, restocked and straightened the sales floor"
good,"definitely a good place to make friends and learn how to do the basics of cashiering."
good,"Good working environment , safety protection , a good place to grow with the company working hard being there everyday would highly recommend working at target dc"
good,"I loved working at Target. I had a variety of different jobs that I had and it was never the same day twice. I was able to learn a trade that was not only fun but had a depth I didn't think it would have had. The only down fall was that I had a schedule that never had consistent hours and I was offered a job that paid much more and Target could not accommodate the difference in wages, even though they seemed like they wanted too."
good,"Overall from my ratings Target is a great job to work at. It best fits individuals that are used to repetitive work. Personally, I got interest in forklift and decanting. My weakness at Target was productivity. For example, I like to learn different skills that’ll expand my knowledge. Willing to practice a skill that’ll better the world around me."
good,"It was a great job first job, the team members were all friendly making work enjoyable. The management was also was very good & cooperating, they always were willing to work with your school life/ other job."
good,"Working at Target was not too bad, but since I was working during the holidays it did get a little stressful at times. I didn't have any other real problems when working there. Everyone works together well and are very collaborative."
good,Be competent and this job is easy. Stock shelves and be smart. I worked my way from cart attendent seasonally to a Senior Team Leader. I've opened and closed locations.
good,Friendly and welcoming environment. Helpful team members. Fast paced job. Everyone treats each other like a family even the guests (customers). Fair pay.
good,Loved working for target until they told me I wasn't allowed to take care of my mother in law because they said she wasn't related to me. I told them she was because I was and am married to her son.
good,"I worked Christmas seasonal as a cart attendant and had a blast."
good,I would like to find another job because the cost of living is getting higher.  I don't find enough hours working now. I'd like to work for 40 hours and more. I'd like to do another experience.
good,Being the smallest Target in Michigan we sure do exceed expectations. The team is super friendly and helpful. A typical day at work for me would be something called Beauty Box which is when Target samples out specific products for the month. I learn daily how to build relationships with new people.
good,"target is great place to work, this is my first job that i worked longer than any other in my lifetime and that says a lot. Target is good because you can pick your hrs so that you can do other things in your life with no problem."
good,"Work included but was not limited to assisting Store Manager in responsibilities for the store that ranged from consistently creating a welcoming environment for the customer by greeting and assisting them, quickly responding to customer inquiries and needs, demonstrating desired behaviors for staff including driving sales, handling difficult and/or complicated sales, cash management, inventory, and following up with customers to address concerns and using company tools to diagnose opportunities and develop action plans to improve performance."
good,"What I like most about working at Target is that they treat you like a responsible adult.  You walk in and go to work.  You don't have to wait to be told what to do."
good,Working at Target for asset protection was fun.  Everyday was a little different as some day's would be all day on the floor well other day's would be reviewing a lot of video.  The benefit of the employee discount was also nice
good,"It's a very fast paced environment, however there are some good moments there. Helping guests is fun because you get to help them create outfits and stuff like that. If you work in the clothing department of course."
good,a lot of place for advancement. Great management and good pay for positions. You receive the hours that you want during most of the year. The few months after the holidays are hard because you don't always get enough hours
good,"If you get past the seasonal hire you will find the hours vary throughout the year; however, management will work with you to schedule around your second job. Unfortunately, Target is not a single career, in other words, you can't make a living. Work atmosphere is a working family; they are friendly and very helpful which reflects when you are the customer."
good,i work in apparel & accessories and it’s a good paying job just can’t get too many hours. mostly do morning trucks and fixing clothes but taxes take a decent chunk of money. you get a lot of breaks depending on your hours and team leads or lod’s are always checking in on you. i learn a lot everyday and lots of things are always changing so it’s a new environment often.
good,you must be able to work fast must be productive at all times supervisors are very helpful a strict code of ethic must be followed at all times great pat  great people
good,"Target in my time there has rolled out a ton of new operation plans and doftware updates,and new,ways to just generally do the job in a more efficient and safe ways. Which has caused some minor,tension between managers and supervisors. But it is a,temporary tension."
good,"It was a very easy job, all it requires is for you to be a people person and to handle cash. Maintaining the lines to be checked out was probably the hardest part. The guests were always my favorite part of the job, I think the people I helped always made my day better."
good,"I only  go shopping at Target for home essentials. Target has good stuff in the grocery department and other areas of the store. The only thing is that it would be nice if they had more employees in every area of the store in case you have a question about a product. Sometimes you have to go looking for assistance with a product. Target is usually the first place I will shop, I go when they open to get what I need and then I'm done by the time it starts getting too busy.  I had a great boss and friends whom I had fun working with. I liked going in early and the hardest part of the job was sometimes lifting certain items.  Target is a perfect spot for everyone that lives nearby. I had a very good experience when I worked there."
good,"I loved the working environment at Target.  My managers were always kind and understanding, and my colleagues were equally so.  No matter how busy things got, we were always able to work effectively as a team to get the job done.  My overall experience left me with a very positive impression of Target."
good,i love working at target its such a great environment to be in the teams member are like a little family. Arrangement for improvement is always there.
good,Ok place to work alot of false promises made to people im trying to get away from retail and try something new and exciting looking for new opportunities
good,It was ok just too far and no hours had a great staff and great customer. Great team love store director very understanding good h.r team. Just to far would love to work there some more just need it more hours
good,"I love Target , has good culture, and diversity, community volunteer events and gives to the community, for example gives to local schools. Also have best team survey of you agree or not."
good,I loved working at target. The only reason I quit was because I wanted to go to school full time. The atmosphere was great. The pay was decent. I enjoyed my time and job that I did.
good,"I enjoyed the environment, the customers, the managers, and the products were fun to look at when I rung them up. They hire pretty decent people to work here ."
good,"A typical work day would be to help push stock out, cashiering, inventory, organizing, helping customers, putting up ad signs and helping set up displays for the soft lines department.  Hear i have learned to be organized, and how to take inventory.  The hardest thing i had to do was have to wake up at 3 in the morning to up sale advertising sign.  The most enjoyable part was getting to help customers with there needs."
good,it was a really tough travel for me and metro got even higher if i had a place to get to that wasnt so far away i would have made it far in target my work ethic was great even when i couldnt make because of the train or bus stop running i looked into other way i was fired for not being able to make it everyday i was scheduled but it was a hassle for me and i have kids as well but working at target was a great experience and an ideal work environment for me really would like to work there again just somewhere in dc where i can mke it too with out any problems and i would progress
good,It was a great temporary job. I loved my direct supervisors although the higher ups were not as great. There were a lot of politics and the people who received promotions were the ones who were in good with the various managers and not the people who were more qualified or had been there the longest.
good,"Target close down warehouse in Arkansas as of March 31,2009. Was really a sad time, lots people were without jobs. The good thing  was everyone got a servants package. Also had job fair to place people with new jobs, that was nice."
good,"Being a major brand in the consumer industry, Target is always busy, but I din't feel like it was ever too overwhelming. I mainly worked in the backroom, pulling orders and making sure that the Hard-lines and Produce workers had what they needed to keep the store restocked. The days were fast-paced and organized and I loved it. The culture was a GIANT melting-pot of awesomeness and it was really inviting and fun to be apart of. The hardest part of my job was having to make up for everyone else's slack. Turns out you can't show that you work hard and get you stuff done quickly, because others will see and they'll end up slacking off, resulting in the management making you stop what you're doing and help out the ENTIRE store. But, despite all that, I really enjoyed getting paid for the work I was doing and being able to make a decent living."
good,"I had fun while I worked there, I really only had to leave because I needed to focus more on school at the time of my employment. But the pay was great."
good,You get to work you do your job and go home. Overall it was a great place to work. The people and management was good. The hours were kinda bad but thats because at that time there was the remodel happening.
good,"Target is a great place to work honestly, everyone is friendly and you’ll never feel left out. Always stay on task when working in this field you need to be ready to help customers at any given moment. It is very important that you greet your customers accordingly and give them your best attitude."
good,I enjoyed working for Target even though it was a short seasonal position. Customers are great and atmosphere was nice to work in. Everyone helped everyone out. I would recommended this job to anyone who needs work.
good,was a good place to work for i had no problems. pay was OK hours were short. people were nice and friendly and everyone tried there best to provide good service.
good,"I really like the atmosphere at target , great teamwork, good with acknowledging employees contributions , the one thing i didnt like was the hours were being cut back from 37 to 29 hr per week . not enough hrs to support family."
good,"The job was chilled and laid back, it could get busy most times but getting paid 10 dollars a hour was worth it.The management was fun and they treated you well also ."
good,When you get to work as a cashier you pretty much already know what you're going to be doing the entire shift. You check guest out all day and the manager tells you when you can take your 15 min break and then you come back and do the same thing until you leave.
good,"good place to work as a starting job, to many chiefs always looking for the wrong in you instead of the good, if they know your good at something they will pass you up for this position and give you a job you will probably fail in,  two faced team leads will talk nice to you then stab you in the back and the special/pets people get special picks of hours, and time off."
good,A typical as a sales associate at target consisted of opening and closing the registers after each employee shift. You would have to wear the hats on hat doing everything even if it wasn't in your job description; helping customers locate merchandise they saw online or merchandise that is not on the sales floor . Using excellent customer service to deliver the  best experience for the customers. I didn't have nothing i really didn't like i am people person ; customers whom were difficult to others were my most favorite always kill them with kindness and smile.
good,"You better be wearing comfortable tennis shoes, have a charged walkie-talkie and ready to jump in wherever the store needs you.  We work as a team operating with a mission to make sure the store is always clean and well organized while delivering extraordinary guest service."
good,"Target is a decent place to work, especially for a starter job. Flexible hours, and they're very understanding if personal issues/situations come up. It is possible to move around in the company, but you have to show initiative and ask about open opportunities."
good,"When target pharmacy was self owned it was the best company ever that i had been with, now its CVS inside target so I don't know how things are now. I left when the buy out happened"
good,"You can find everything inside this store! You can grocery shop, gift shop, and pick up a little something nice for yourself! I grew as a more understand person working here. I grew more with my customer service skills and as a leader. I learned new skills I can take on with me in life."
good,"I was promised full-time hours when I was hired as a Cashier at Target, and tried to advance my placement into other departments, but my managers wouldn't train me. My full-time hours for the first few weeks slowly began to dwindle to barely part-time with 10-12 hours a week, and I wasn't the only cashier. I can't live off a salary like this, so I had to leave."
good,the hardest part of the job was basically trying to up sale the target credit card and try to satisfy the customers it is really hard to work when the customers have attitudes all the time but I mean that's any where
good,"For the most part, working at target has been a positive experience. On a typical day of work, I would be in the front end, usually at the Guest Service Desk, or working the cash register. During this job I have learned great communication skills, as well as time management skills. The toughest part of the job has definitely been trying to stay calm when dealing with rude or un-ruly guests. However, the overall culture and work experience has been positive."
good,Target is a great company and it hires people not on any disciminatorial basis.Rather they are hired on their ability to perform all functions of their assignment.
good,"Work Life Balance does not exist if you want to succeed. "
good,"•	Serviced existing accounts, obtains orders, and established new accounts by planning and organizing daily work schedule to call on existing or potential sales outlets and other trade factors."
good,"I loved working there even if my job was when the store was closed. I was able to see the new items we put out before anyone and was able to buy them the next morning if I wanted to. While I didnt get to interact with any kids, I still got to find ways to rearrange their clothing items so that the most wanted would be most visible."
good,it was a seasonal job. it was very busy and i liked that. after the Christmas holiday was over i was laid off. i would like to work at Kroger because it is located right across the street from where i live.
good,"The years I worked at target was a good experience, I got to learn how to operate a forklift while I was a backroom shelf stocker. Most days if everything is already on the floor I would help my fellow co-workers stock the backroom and check inventory."
good,great for my first job. managed to buy my first car and get a lot of first time work experience with this job. Learned how to manage time and money and work with customers.
good,"Good company to work for. "
good,The hours were cut and team members were expected to do more then intended. employees were responsible for taking care of 2 departments during the week.
good,"Target is a great place to work. The management (especially the ETL's) are great. "
good,"I worked food service and retail, I would open the cafe and provide customer service there and if we were slow, then provide customer service as a cashier. I learned how to multitask and run a cafe without supervision and keep my designated area looking professional and clean. The hardest part of this job were working around holidays. The store would super busy and help was needed in all areas of the store, so working the cafe and being a cashier became really stressful for me. The most enjoyable part of working at Target was the bond I made with co workers. Liking everyone you work with made the day even more enjoyable."
good,"Typical days were never too difficult or stressful, as with any job you will run into those types of days though. I learned quite a bit during my time here because Target really appreciates having well trained employees who can work in any position in the store at any given time. They never had an issue with you taking a shift and getting trained in a new department. Overall, I would go back if I needed to."
good,"Typical day: Receiving, packing, wrapping, and tracking shipments, using pallet jack"
good,Target was a great place to work and very flexible. I truly emjoyed the environment. management could have been more welcoming but I still had a nice time woking there although it was only seasonal.
good,"i would clock in say hi to everyone. the work environment was very friendly. the most stress i had was on weekends but everyone was busy so i cant complain, They would leave to me myself for the most part."
good,Management treated me well at this Target. I enjoyed being cashier here. I also loved my hours. I had every Saturday (and I think Sunday) off somehow. The management made me feel better if I ever made a mistake.
good,"1. Following guidelines prepared by corporate everyday to keep up with the constant changes that they're going through."
good,"Consistently uses college recruits to fill their area manager positions.  For retail, it pays well but at the price of a 10+ hour day, frequent visit culture and endless emails.  Great resume and skill building but know that less than 1%  will make it past five years."
good,"I'm really happy in this job. As a student it's nice to be able to work a few hours a week so I can save some money (and spend a little too). The job itself really isn't hard, though you do have to have some patience when dealing with customers. I like most of the people I work with. For me, the downsides (like no free drinks or tips) are outweighed by the awesome $11/hr starting wage."
good,"A great place to work for."
good,"I enjoy working here a lot, flexible with hours. Work with my school schedule. Management is amazing and encourages us to do better everyday. Listens !"
good,"This was years ago- mid late 90s.  Target had revamped their culture to the Disney model encouraging empowerment and team culture.  no more customers, they became guests.  Fast, Fun, feeling oh so Target friendly!"
good,I have learned a lot and improved my both professional and social skills by interacting with the customer by helping them answer there inquires. so it was a job that helped a lot.
good,They don't offer enough hours for me but the job was enjoyable. The management is amazing! I get along with everyone. All the employees are accepting to everyone.
good,Target is fun to work at and the employees are awesome to work with. It's lots of work available so you never get bored or have nothing to do. The work environment is very busy and it does slow down productiveness when you have to stop constantly to help a guest but as long as you get back to work there's no issue.
good,"Target was a great place to work, they work with your schedule and if you are interested in moving up in the company they help you do that. One issue with working there was the amount of hours they give you when its no longer seasonal. Other than hour cuts, it was fun and the team leads were all nice and like one big family."
good,Outstanding management and team work environment.  Very organized and focused on customer service.  Quality products and great communication between staff.  Lots of walking and during peak seasons can be challenging to meet all of the store requirements in regards to visual appeal.
good,"I had little issues with Target beyond its obsession with pushing credit and debit cards at everyone (literally everyone) who passed through my checkout line. Your managers will measure your success and compliance by how many of these cards you sell, regardless of how you perform your other duties."
good,"Target provided a friendly atmosphere. Co-workers were helpful. Was busy throughout the entire shift. Options to get overtime, pay was great. Was only a seasonal job."
good,"Target is a pretty fun and engaging place to work for. In the two years I've worked here, I've gained valuable customer service experience in working/running the register, as well as a diligent determined work ethic in collecting and recovering grocery carts for customer use. The managers I've worked alongside have also been extremely helpful and fair in many things, weather that be helping me with tasks, assisting with time off, etc. Target is a considerably enjoyable place to work for, and I'm glad to have called it my work place for the past couple years."
good,"This was a nice job to work for, nice pay and coworkers. But no benefits, plus hard for advancement! It is a good company ti work for though and you get a team member discount."
good,"I enjoyed working the overnight logistics position, it allowed me to work full time and still continue my college education. The managers were easy to talk to. My only complaint is that with minimum wage increases, it wasn't long before newly hired employees were making a higher wage than seasoned employees were. The company never gave the seasoned employees compensation for the minimum wage increases."
good,Working at Target was very fast paced and for the most part was a pretty good work environment. However there were times when I should have been better informed as to how the would like things done and sort of threw me on things that they didn't have done due to them trying to cut everyone's hours.
good,"Overall a very enjoyable place to work at and make relations. Management and workplace culture very supportive of what the goal for the store is. May often get repetitive but if you do your job correctly, there shouldn't be any issue. The hardest part of the job is dealing with numerous tasks and little time to execute. Management often orders for too many tasks that are not a part of the job description due to under staffing and lack of hours."
good,Target pays well with great benefits. Target is making moves to stay successful in today's industry. Fast paced environment. Able to gain leadership skills and develop others.
good,It was a great place to start and get a good foundation of learning how to sell makeup and cosmetic products. The staff was very nice and encouraging!
good,"At Target there is also something to do so you are never bored on the job. Coworkers are very sweet and you make a lot of good friends making the work place more enjoyable. I almost always finished my tasks, and when I didn't it was because I was helping guests find items and direct them around the store."
good,I love my work or place but it is time to find a career that best fits me. All co workers are very friendly and easy to get along with. Work schedule is very flexible too.
good,Great place to work and some what i good place for development. Pay is better than minimum wage and by 2020 the company is planning to pay $15 starting rate.
good,"Each store is a different atmosphere. Management differs from store to store. It could be older crowd, or fresh out of school. The hardest part is management that acts like they like you and really they don't. You may think you're moving up when you indeed are not. My second time working for them i was seasonal and they did not release me very professionally. The ETL-GE told me that they weren't going to keep me while i was assisting a guest. I love how when you do get to work, the store is like a big family."
good,"As management at Target, we had rotating shifts. Everyday management was responsible for payroll, and upkeep of the store. I learned how to deal with different kinds of people, and how to handle difficult situations."
good,"I enjoyed working at target, but needed to move on for the money. I had a family to support and the 3rd shift hours didn't work for me. I would go back though if needed."
good,Target is a great place to work with friendly staff & management. The lack of benefits & full time positions is cause for seeking other employment. All in all I would recommend this job to anyone looking for seasonal or part time work.
good,"It was different compared to my other jobs, but nothing I couldn't manage. It was very fast-paced but I enjoyed working in a different atmosphere with others."
good,It’s good place to work they pay fine. The only problem you will have is with scheduling and working tuntill close other than that you should be fine a
good,"target is a retail chain in America. Learnt a lot of the employees are managed, how the pay cycle is managed."
good,They said they would hire me back but I like to try to find something closer. I really love working there and helping the customers and making them happy and keeping the store looking good.
good,Target is a fun place to work at especially at the end of the year. Sure its hectic but its better than a slow day. A little challenge is always better. Only thing is the team leaders sometimes contradict what they want.

good,Target is a decent place to work there is room for advancement working guest service means you handle returns answer phones clean restrooms and handle the damaged goods mostly interacting with guests it's an easy job to get the hang of.
good,"Responsible for transactions and friendly customer service at a quick pace. This was my first employer where I learned sales and quickly gained top credit card sales within 3 months of launching the Target REDcard. Very high energy, excited managers and team. Difficult to transfer when I had to relocate. Enjoyed working with the public and learning how to articulate words for better sale outcome."
good,"I worked chose Target as the place I wanted to work for my first job, I was expecting it to be harsh but it was pretty relaxed and it was extremely easy for a shy person like me to deal with."

good,Great place to work. Overnight managers really took care of their employees. The company was about keeping their employees happy I felt like. Pulling product for the floor team was easy.
good,I liked working for Target. Sometimes I just could not get pass the management. I really wanted to stay but I had to move and could not transfer. I'm hoping I can get back to working for Target because it is a fun and exciting place to work for. There is room to grow and to learn different departments.The hardest part of my job was just having to say goodbye to a job i really enjoyed working for.
good,"Helping customers pick items to match their life style, some cashier, stocking and cleaning after the store has closed. Employees try to help each other in their departments."

good,Pretty decent place to work. Ever since we changed over to end to end is been a hassle and for the pay its not that great. Love the people though.....
good,"A very diverse job where you are asked to do alot of different tasks"
good,I gained beginner's photography skills here in a relaxed atmosphere even around the holidays. We were able to be creative and self directing once we demonstrated independent knowledge.
good,Another solid first job for a teenager. You learn what it is like to be in that person shoes and teaches you life skills. The days weren't hard but they do help you improve on your communication skills.
good,"Fast Lane as far as the front end for to be  cashier,  working in the signing department was a rewarding job, it was over night changing the sale signs in each department."
good,"You learn on the job! Great team work! Able to work in different areas."

good,Customer service is an amazing progression especially if the people and co-workers have the same goal in mind. The company had a great environment and culture. I was disappointed to leave since the environment was so special and positive.
good,"cash handling."
good,"My time working with Target was fairly good I enjoyed the work environment and the management. This was probably one of my most fun jobs I have had and leaving was not of my choice, so if I could go back I gladly would."
good,Fast pace and fun environment to learn and hone leadership skills.  Plenty of opportunity in an ever changing environment as long as you're willing to grind.
good,"Productive and friendly work environment. Very challenging, you get to work with all types of people. Meet a lot of different faces and grace, by all in all great place to work."
good,Target is a very good place to start a career. It was an amazing place to work with good people there! The management was always available to help you out if you needed it.
good,Working at Target was interesting to see the stock and fashion before it went to the show room floor. Lots of great people to work with and a challenge to supply great  service to our customers.
good,A day at work would be coming in and checking in with a manager to see which department I am being assigned to. I removed everything that didn't belong in the department and then refolded and hung up any messed up clothes.
good,Working at target is very different from most retailers. Target has a family feel amongst team members and our guests. I have been with the company for almost four years and have lived every minute of it.
good,"Target is a good place to work if you like to stay busy. you are constantly dealing with customers and making sure your section of the store is neat, clean and organized, the managers are extremely pleasant and are good leaders"
good,"There were many new hires while working there and many of them came from the out side in, but those who were promoted with in were willing and able to do their job."

good,Fun to work at if you like closing/ late night working. Most Managers are very nice and helpful. Most Team Leads are very presistent. Co-Workers are awesome.
good,Once clocked in employees are giving the stores goals and are given personal goals to achieve to help them advance while on the clock.  Employees are also given the chance to advance by learning other positions around the store as a way to advance.
good,"My co workers are always warm and friendly, makes for a very good work environment. I appreciate how the employers will often to go great lengths to make sure an associate is satisfied with working at target"
good,It was a fun place to work.  As a pharmacy technician I learned many enjoyable things and had great opportunity. I enjoy working with the staff and the public.
good,"Poor management at my location, easily failed to motivate non-driven employees to work."
good,"It was a nice experience working at Target. I worked there for 5 years. I loved that we had to keep the store fully stocked and neat. My hours in the beginning were perfect, it was early morning. I was giving a specific job and section of the store. I had to make sure to push as much merchandise as it can properly fit in shelves. I had a time goal to keep and sometimes I would put my own time goal to finish everything. My first boss was a nice person, she taught me how to be more efficient and faster to beat my goal. It was hard but I got the hang of it. After a while, I knew what to do. Every time I went to work, I knew where to start unless my boss needed me somewhere else. I met great team members there, most of them very friendly to work with and I learned a lot from them too."
good,I loved working at target it was my favorite job by far The managers And fellow employees very polite and helped me through training very easily
good,"A typical work day at work would be to get there and first restock the items the customers did not want, what I learned from Target is communication and speed the management would be bit crazy when it comes to the holidays. As for co-works depends on again communication and team work because without those two the work place would not go well. the hardest part working at Target was having to continue to work on particular days like Sundays when you prefer to have those days off and as well as dealing with some unsatisfying customers. But the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people whether its customer from different places or new co-workers."
good,This was a part job for me while starting school. I loved it . The people I worked with was great. I love being able to see all the merchandise and stocking.

good,Target is a great fun fast pace place to work. Room for advancement and opportunities to work in all areas. Flexible scheduling and works around school or outside activities.
good,"Only had one day of training and often not enough walkie talkies for everyone.  Extremely limited amount of MyDevices."
good,"A typical day at Target for me would be assisting customers, making sure customers are happy, telephone operator mostly dealing with inbound calls. Management was poor I would say not very good at scheduling accordingly. My co workers made the work environment fun with still getting the job done.Nothing came hard for me at Target any department I was put in or a new task I was given I was able to accomplish without a problem. Last but not least the most I enjoyed about Target is satisfying customers."
good,"It was a good job to work, Great people and great learning opportunities. "
good,"Helping customers, also working in guest service. Working in the food service and ringing guest up for purchases.. Locating items for guest around the store."

good,"Working as a Starbucks Barista was very enjoyable. I loved making new drinks and getting to work with the customers, who were usually very happy to be getting their hand crafted beverages. Most people were very pleasant. Management did great. They worked around my scheduling needs. Christmas was the hardest part of the job, as we were very busy. But it made the work day fly by, which was great. Staying busy, and getting to work with people was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"hours could be tough but pay is great"
good,"when I worked for target. I loved the challenges as well as the culture that was there. A typical day consists of several projects or tasks to complete, while keeping an eye out for quests who need assistance and ensuring they receive ""fast, fun & friendly"" service. it was a great company to teach organization skills."
good,"Working for the company over the last few years has been such an amazing experience. The team has grown together so much, being able to teach one another the tools that we'll all need in everyday work life and life in a whole."
good,It is a great work environment but little to none chance of advancing from your current role. Management has a high rate of rotation so it is never really a stable environment for the average worker. Must stay productive while working.
good,"It was always a nice place to work, only bad thing was at the time I was working it was only min wage. The hardest part about my job was lifting the heavy boxes, other than that I loved working there."
good,Excellent place to work that is flexible with students and hours. Learned different operational tactics vs previous Target experience that allowed for me to excel as a team member. Excellent overnight leadership that made the job fun even under stressful environments.

good,"made wonderful friends and had a fun atmosphere to work in, also advanced pretty well the first year but didn't receive acknowledgement of hardwork or feel appreciated"
good,Unloaded truck and moved stock to sales floor. Started early in the morning and after store opened we stocked the different departments.
good,Its was a disappointment when they closed us down. I was invited to learn every aspect of retail dealings as well as behind the scenes management to some extremes
good,"Beau milieu de travail, chaque employé est valorisé dans son travail. Beaucoup de soutien, beau travail d'équipe. Soutien présent en cas de besoin."
good,"the job works very well with my schooling as they are flexible and will work around your schedule, the people are very easy going and make working there a fun experience, very good job for college students"
good,Working at target pharmacy is very productive. I learned so much in the past 3 years that I have been there. Target is big on brand so we clean a lot. We also have to meet the expected goals in the store since it is still retail. The store is busy everyday but time goes by fast and there is never a dull moment working there. You learn a lot about people and learn how to deal with certain people.
good,fun work place enjoyed the work also taught me alot about using hand on tools far as how to scan trucks using PDA. also taught me how to train new team memebers .
good,Target it's a great company to work for in most States. EAS great benefits company. The company was sold to Nestle and move to South Carolina.
good,nice place to work even though the warehouse was too small but I was able to by best. great working there and hope the keep it up.
good,It was a pretty cool job especially since it was my first. Only thing I had problem with is how they wanted you to be on the costumers back about applying for a red card ( especially around the holidays ) other than that pretty cool
good,"Target has been established for many years as a growing company.  It is constantly growing and improving in the industry and it encourages it's employees to learn and grown in the company.  Whenever I show for work, the leadership team is eager to have me sign in and begin my day.  Often due to the bus schedules, I might get to work early and management welcomes me with open arms and allows me to sign in a help our customers.  My favorite part of the job is I get reward monthly as one of the top Red Card sales members. The rewards are always something I can benefit from using at home.  Target is a great place to work."
good,I had lot's of fun at target! The guest would always give me the highest of regards on yelp and the the executives. I loved my fellow team members and it was genuinely reciprocated. However there were some executives who had nothing in mind but self advancement and the GREATLY hindered not only my advancement but my fellow team members who were most deserving of it!!.
good,A typical day working at target was coming in to find out what duty you were assigned that day. Oce you checked that get your equipment and start the day.
good,"I loved working at Target.  I sometimes wish I was still there.  Everyday I would do the same thing; clean the back room, re stock the produce, dairy, and frozen foods, give great customer service, and keep myself busy on the hourly tasks.  The only issue I had with Target was the hours were never guaranteed, no benefits were provided, and management lacked communication"
good,"i worked mornings so it was pretty easy, and also had the rest of the day to myself to do other things. The schedule did not get mixed up with my personal life."
good,"i worked at target for three months as a seasonal distribution of sales items onto the floor, work started very early and i enjoyed the team members that worked there. management was continuously positive towards team members and participated in unloading the early morning trucks. i learned time management and its importance to a job that everyday had a deadline to meet. the hardest but most enjoyable part for me at target was the continuous moving of items and packages and always having to be on your toes."
good,I have worked for Target for a while nice place to work but management and lead are not always good or fair. Most of the co-worker are friendly and nice. My hardest part of the job was dealing with the management and team leads.
good,"Great culture. I learned how to manage processes. Extremely organized, sense for team work. Caring for their associates and offer great compensation plan."
good,Everyday was busy from start to finish. Great coworkers. Management was excellent and supportive. An extra perk was on occasion getting a free lunch.
good,Loved working at Target but the communication between employer and employees isn't the best. However loved the atmosphere.
good,"I really enjoyed workng at Target. "
good,A typical day at work was feeling tired and sleepy by going to work @ 4am everyday. I learned new things reference to the store. The managers are very amazing nice people. My co-workers were nice to get along. The hardest part of my job was having the leader get mad because she didn't want me to take a break. I only enjoy working the certain people.
good,Co-workers and management great! The hardest part of job was throwing away left over food. The most enjoyable part serving customers and having them smile!
good,"Target may not pay much, but it is a fine place to work with a flexible schedule and plenty of hours offered. I loved my team as a cashier working at Northland Mall. Management was #1!!!"
good,one day i was helping a guest and she was having difficulty and i helped by suggesting something from the menu and the guest was thrilled with my work ethic and later on i was recognized by team leader
good,I worked at Target for five years and would have continued to work there if they had one close to where I moved to. They are the perfect company to work for if you are parents and very understand. If you are looking for a company that treats you like family and truly cares about their employees then I highly recommend working for Target
good,A very busy retail environment.  Customer service skills are highly appreciated.  Cross training is favored and I aggressively pursue every opportunity.
good,"Overall Target is a good place to work especially in my case starting after high school. They were good at working around my schedule at school. Everyone was very friendly and when I needed help, they were quick to help me. The co-workers were nice and friendly to me and fun to work with. At first i was intimidated by the management, but I soon became really close with them. They were easy to approach and willing to help when needed. Target really helped me with my scheduling for school and other needs."
good,Hard to move around from your current position  .Great benefits very flexible however it can get repetitive.Very fast atmosphere which is exciting
good,"A typical day at work was making pizza's and pasta fresh everyday.  Topped and panned 100 pizza's, waiting on customers,"
good,Closed down in Canada due to poor planning -- Canadian market is not the same as the American market. It is quite sad to see it going after approximately 2.5 years of existence.
good,A typical day for me is just helping out guest. I help out around 10 - 30 guest a day and try to keep everyone happy while going about my duties. I make sure the store looks great while also helping out my other team members with task. I also go up to the front to help check people out also because guest come first. What I do is make the store look good while helping as many people as I can along the way.
good,"Target has a friendly atmosphere, hence team members and senior team members have an open relationship in which you can share and express growth and concerns. A regular day at target includes ensuring that my area is clean and presentable to each guest. Serving each guest with a smile. Ensure that proper safety standards are met and start preparing the area for the next day or for the next member who has to take over"
good,"A typical day at work begins by arriving early by unloading the truck that has arrived with new merchandise. After the truck has been emptied I do pipo's. These are pallets filled with a particular item that I have been directed to deposit to a proper location within the store. I then, throw away all boxes that the new merchandise has arrived in. I instruct the team on any duties that have to be completed. The management team at Target is composed of highly educated individuals that they do their job in order to insure we have the best Target in the area. The co-workers are hard workers that are dedicated to their job. The hardest part of my job is having the leadership of assuring the team is staying on task. The most enjoyable part is the relationships you are able to build with the costumers."
good,"They are very friendly, make you feel good, always saying hi, good job. They tell there workers they are good, hard working team members."

good,"Typical day is Id clock in and find my register. Id make sure it's all set up and ready to go. Through out the day I have many guest where I could check them out, answer and questions they had, talk to them/ set them up for our REDCARDS or protection plans. When it came time for them to pay I would handle cash/card and check. "
good,"great company to work for, great people, great management, lots of travel away from the family, which is hard at times. good pay and time off"
good,"It was my second family, everyone was nice to each other, always willing to take on new tasks. All our managers cared for us and were always willing to  work around schedule."
good,"I was usually scheduled to work by myself in the studio once I was comfortable and trained with everything. I would have appointments scheduled back to back and manage timing & consistency. The times I would work with co-workers were around the holidays and busy days. My co-workers were all very easy and fun to work with. Sometimes though if a co-worker was running behind in the studio it would run everyone behind. That was probably the hardest part. Overall, this job was fun and a great hands-on experienced workplace. I loved working with children and making them laugh and have fun!"
good,Worked with team member's to achieve daily goals in the various work centers I was responsible for. Coached and trained team members in all aspects of roles throughout various departments
good,"Working at Target was great."
good,"I work from 5am til the job is done. My job is fun, stress free. I enjoy working as a team with about 15 other people. I have learned alot about recieving, stocking, schematics for shelving products, what the numbers mean on a shipping label. My co workers are helpful and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is lifing heavy items, but someone is always available to help and waking up at 3:15am. I enjoy helping the customers when the need arises."
good,"Worked here for just under a year, really enjoyed the environment. The Starbucks was a popular destination for customers shopping, which kept myself and team very busy. I left the company to pursue a full time opportunity with another employer."
good,"Management turnover is high, recreating the wheel as new management comes in."
good,"A normal day at Target consisted of opening up cash registers and adding money; checking the temperatures on the refrigerator and freezer, completing the cycle counts on specific medications for that day and entering the data into the computer. Contacting doctor's and nurses for patient refills or clarifications on medications. Inputting all new prescriptions that come through and accurately dispense and fill the medication. Assisting guests with their medication purchases was a big factor and also, make sure that the service is fast, fun and friendly."
good,"I loved the work environment of target because it really was to their model of ""Fast Fun and Friendly"".  My day consisted of taking vendors and acknowledging there product order for the day. When acknowledged they would take the items to the floor. I would maintain a clean and safe environment. I would also organize pallets with merchandise within the receiving area. The work gets a little overwhelming during the winter season but I believe that's every job. I learned how to take vendor product, correct invoice and manage inventory count. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep everything in order since I’m not there the entire day to keep it in place. The best part was working with my other co-workers that was in the same department as me. Was a small staff of 4 including me and was great that way."
good,Very good job.  Good pay and benefits.  We stretch each day before work.  I have learned how to use tools and equipment.  The hardest part is long hours.  I work twelve hour shifts.  The most enjoyable part is the pay.
good,A typical day at Target is a fast pace environment where the employee is always on their toes to help guests. I learned great communication skills and time management while being employed there
good,"What I have learned over my years at Target, is that your store is only as good as your employees from any level to management. I have worked is several different Target stores, and each store, is a little different, and you can take some practices you learned from one, and apply it at another location to to maybe help there process run smother."

good,"Typical day at work,  normally a fast paced, on your feet. Most of our time and attention goes to our guest."
good,I love working at Target because it was dealing with the customers face-to-face and I excell at that. Customer service is a great job to have if you are great with people. I have learn a lot in the retail industry and I have gotten even better in dealing with the business side of it as well. The managers are great and I loved them. Very understanding and thoughtful. My co-workers were a group of people (older and younger) that was great and very helpful as well. There wasn't any hard part to the job because dealing with people is what I love to do. It was all enjoyable. Meeting and greeting.
good,The team I worked with I enjoyed working with. I loved the work i was doing I just wished it paid more than minimum  wage to start and the benefits were  better; other than that it was a great place to work.

I learned so much from working at Target, I set endcaps. to set the whole store! I also learned to read all the signing numbers to go on the aisle or on the computer! I loved learning from my team leader everyday. They showed me news things and I would even show them new things! There were never really hard parts of the job, it was simple as could be! The most enjoyable part of the job, like I said was helping guest, working with my team members everyday. We all worked as a team, to get stuff done/ help a guest find what their looking for!

good,"At typical day at Target was very fun and right on track. I've learned s lot about customer service working for Target. My co-workers were very funny and honest with me, we were like a family. the hardest part about Target was the drama that working for Target came with. It was sort of like High School all over again at times. I loved the customers, they were very polite."
good,"Target gave me a broad understanding of medications. I became doe good at them that even as a pharmacy technician, i was able to provide hands-on training for pharmacy students. Customer service was always a great deal. It was retail, so we had to see customers and patients everyday."
good,"worked at target for 3 years, worked as cart attendant, food ave, cashier, sales floor, Planogram team, stockroom, pricing team, overall a nice atmosphere."
good,"My time at Target was wonderful and never a dull day. I learned as much as I could with my short time being there, I was cross-trained in cashiering, taking care of the café (lounge) area, and did costumer returns in customer service."
good,"Working during the holidays is an experience I think that every person should experience no matter what their current job, education level, or pay grade is."
good,"great management"
good,the most enjoyable part about working on the flow team at target was knowing that i had control over the overall apperance of the store and if it wasnt up to standard then id be help responsable.. this i enjoyed
good,Inclusion is what I learned at this place.  Make sure you are a solid communicator with impeccable organizational skills.
good,A well structured organization with responsible action and accountability to the local community.
good,"A typical day at work for me is a 4pm where the whole team meets for start up. Then we sign up for what job we would like to go work in that night. We then work the night with a team member for 10 hours with scheduled breaks. I have learned a lot working for Target, especially how fast the corporation is growing because of us team members. Our management is great! They are always there to help when needed and they give constructive criticism in a professional manner. My co-workers are also helpful when needed. For example, when lifting a box or figuring out how to fix a problem. The hardest part of my job is leaving my children home with a babysitter, but I know that I am working for them to better our lives. For the most enjoyable part of my job is the great team that we have and the hours."
good,"A typical day at work is challenging  and rewarding."
good,"Not really any typical day at work, always faced with new obstacles and challenges. Learned patience, time management, delegation, drive. Management was supportive and focused. Co-workers were driven for success. Hardest part of job was the hours of operation early am. Most enjoyable part of the job was rewards for completion of tasks."
good,"Target I worked mostly on the flow team.  We would work early morning hours or overnight unloading the truck from the distribution warehouse and then stocking the shelves or storing them in the back.  The work was fast paced and demanding, but the goals were attainable and team leaders were flexible if you needed help.  I enjoyed the people I worked with, most were friendly and everyone could work together professionally."
good,"Run a 48 million dollar business annual. You will directly lead a team of 150 people. You will dabble in all different areas- HR, Financials, Operations, Customer Service, etc."
good,"was my first job so i was trying to get the hang of it, good place to learn how to work witht the public"
good,"I enjoyed working for target,more so cause its more of a family, then a job"
good,"I did a little bit of every job there I was cross training all over the store so I would say a ""typical day"" was running around helping customers and other workers as i could. i learned many skill sets with leadership. management for the most part was pretty good. no problems with co workers, hardest part was just keeping up with needs of customers. most enjoyable was getting to really help people get or find what they needed."
good,"If you were a cart attendant like I was than your day consists of going outside and getting carts. That's pretty much it. Sure you go and clean or help out cashiering, but your main job is carts which seems boring, but not when people can't seem to drive correctly. You have to stay on your toes and watch for people blowing stop signs. Pay is decent for a teen, but not sufficient for an adult."
good,While working for Target I got to do what I like the most and that is interacting with customers. I had a great co worker Shawn. he really made my day. Target is a store that cares about their guest. I love that.
good,"My normal day I would get in contact with my manager to talk about my duties for the day. I'd then resume helping guests while completing tasks that were given to me ranging from dusting off shelves, setting up T.V.s, or setting product in correct locations. My co-workers were amazing and I still keep in contact after leaving the company. "
good,"Putting clothes back onto the floor, cleaning the area, answering phone and helping guests. I learned how to ask for help instead of taking on to much work, and how to create mutual work relationships. My co-workers are friendly and very helpful and informative and answered all of my questions without getting annoyed. Hardest part was only working on weekends there was a lot of traffic, and the most enjoyable part were team huddles."
good,"During my time at Target, I worked in many different areas of the store. During my time in Back room, I was in charge of renewing any out of stock items on the sales floor, as well as maintaining the inventory and updating the inventory system and getting any items for the guest that is not on the sales floor but kept in the back room, As a cashier I was responsible for handling guest as they paid for their items, providing change, and informing the guest on the Target Credit Cards. P-Fresh was the company fresh produce section, during this time I worked mainly in the freezers throughout my 8 hour shift, making sure that the older items were being set out first and that all of the meat and poultry was kept separate from each other. On occasion I also assisted in setting the fresh produce out on the floor and taking any expired items off of the shelves. "
good,"Target was a fun place to work, alot of great people to be around. Got alone with everyone there. Learn alot about reatil business and how to stock merchandies."
good,"check for new applications, pull out the ones who passed the test"
good,Target is a very nice place of choice to work . From the staff to the management this was truly a nice company
good,"nice environment to work in. Great supervisor's, who dose'nt mind helping out. and nice customers too."
good,"We come in early -- 6 am. I usually start by checking my e-mail and my work order inbox.This Triage, if you will, allows me to get after anything that has happened which is most urgent first and otherwise adjust my plans based on priority. I make sure I partner with anyone in the store that needs to be involved in my days work, or future work, and then get right to the tasks I have before me, organized in their priority."
good,Enjoy my work and the prople but no further for advancement.
good,Very busy workplace. Always standing on my feet. Very friendly co workers
good,"Conversating with customers, Assisting them with what ever they may need help with and checking them out at the cashier"
good,Provide supervision and direction to vendors for the completion of maintenance and repairs to the facility.
good,Management was fantastic. They were very positive and great at recognizing accomplishments. I enjoyed my coworkers. They ranged in age and ethnic backgrounds. Most difficult part of the job was standing on my feet while 8-9 months pregnant. My favorite part of the job was assisting guest.
good,"Target is a great place to work only if you have the right management who acknowledges your talents and achievements that you give to the Target stores. Ive learned to multitask by taking my own projects at work and finishing no matter what it takes. My co-workers were all great from the time I started til the time I resigned, hardest part of the job was maybe getting the furniture pulls out in a timely fashion because items are heavy, you have to use the Wave(machine used to get down heavy items from high wacos). Overall Target is great, fast, and friendly place to work."
good,"the jobs allows you the feeling of being a part of the company. you interact with the public and are allowed to be helpful to them. advancement is not only encouraged, but it happens. being encouraged to learn and be trained on other positions in the store is a real plus."
good,Long nights especially during the Holiday season. People Oriented and Friendly atmosphere. Fast pace work flow. Team Member Orientated.
good,"In a day at target there is a lot to do. It's very rare to have a down time. But that's good, it makes your shift go by fast. I've learned how to set up display's and properly price them. I also learned how to use the PDA to look up item and see if maybe another store has is. For the most part management was great. The only down side was that you didn't deal with the same person in charge everyday, so things got done more thier way, than the way it really should have been. The only hard part was running to meet everyones needs. For example, if you are on the floor trying to clean it and keep it neat, you would have to stop what you are doning and help at the cash register should the lines get to long. Howevery, my team mates were awesome. Some of the best people I could ever work with. People were usually up beat with a great sense of humor."
good,A typic day at Target mobile is me as the employee answering questions on or off the phone about our product that we are selling computer work and just talking to people in general to help spread the word about our company its not fast paced so we do have some down time. we are usually advised to upsell all of the products that we have
good,"I go to work at 7:00am, get my work equipment, take inventory from 7:00am-11:00am of all items that are low in-stock. Then I usually help the back room team with the pulls that are generated from the inventory that I had just conducted. After the batches are pulled I then push the product to the sales floor. All the while I also help our guests that are in the store who may need help finding an item or with any questions they might have. I also help with the guest service desk and cashier if back-up is required. I answer phone calls regularly. Any given day I might pull batches from the backroom, set planograms, create rain checks for missing ad items, provide great guest (customer) service, greet people, re-stock shelves, help set the ad and other tasks."
good,"My typical work day is fast pace, I've learn hoe important team work is, I work with some great people that have been with the company for a long time. The hardest part is working every holidays, 12 hours but it still enjoy my job of course there's always changes & I like that it changes, keeps me on my feet. Over Target has been great to me and my family."
good,"A typical day at target is very fast paced, with lots of guests to keep the AP extremely busy. I have learned to follow suspicious and known offender via a PTZ camera system. The management realy make your feel like a family with the way you are treated, the co workers are also extremely friend people. The hardest part of my job is watching children get arrested. The best part of my company is the camaraderie among my team."
good,Target is a fun place to work because of the management and also the regular emplyees. I loved seeing the facs of customers after I successfully helped them.
good,Fast paced at times..but great team enviroment all the people are great co-workers. Management at target is very good with team leads being fair and helpful.
good,would work thye cash register kind of boring at times i think
good,i loved that we helpped each section out during the middle of the day. i worked alone in my department which was a plus to me i was able to work hard while assisting customers.
good,"muito tumulto,movimento de pessoas,telefone não para de tocar..."
good,"Cashiering at Target was okay. The schedule was never set, the hours were consistently random, I could close one day at 10 in the evening and open the next day at 8, and this could vary every week. I learned how to deal with difficult guests who were rude and obnoxious, I was expected to deal with it, which I did well. The management was well played, I got along well with most of my coworkers and supervisors with few issues. My supervisors were understanding and helpful in almost everything. The hardest part about my job I believe was that I had to deal with difficult guests at times, I also began to realize that anyone can be a cashier, though I was a good cashier, and my supervisors liked me, I felt as though I was unable to advance from that position. I was also drafted to be a cart attendant, and there would be days where I had to do that all day, that is not what I was brought on for, and while I adapted there were periods where I was doing it by myself for 8 hours, and it became very draining and difficult, especially when the weather was unpleasant. Still, I enjoyed working at Target, and I know that my supervisors valued me and whenever I go into that store they often ask if I've found a job and if I haven't I should come back to work there."
good,"A typical day at Target is very exciting. There is never a dull moment, the crowds arehuge and the guest keep you on your toes at all times. I've learned that a smile goes along way. Guest feel more comfortable when you smile and greet them.The management team is good but growth in employment opportunties arent so great! My co-workers are the best they are fast,fun,and friendly! The hardest part of my job is having patience. I deal with so many guest with different problems and patience is virtue. The most enjoyable part of my job is the enviroment. Target makes there woking place comfortable for everyone."
good,Enjoyed interacting with a variety of people. Enjoyed the fast pace of job.
good,This was my first job right out of high school. Yet it was still a learning experience as I was taught the proper techniques in the framing business as well as ordering and maintaining stock.
good,I usually work 6 to 7 hours a day with 2 technicians and a pharmacist about 4 to 5 days a week. Target is very customer oriented with that being their number 1 focus. The hardest part of the job is dealing with insurance companys. The most enjoyable part of the job is making sure our patients get the most information possible to help them with their pharmaceutical needs.
good,"The typical day at work for me is making sure stock levels are filled to drive sales, placing signage in the correct spot, and provide assistance with store guests effectively and efficiently. While working at Target I have learned to listen first before giving input especially when working with difficult/challenging individuals, and have an open communication with upper management with any concerns that I may have. The hardest part of my job would be that some task are not that easily followed because of miscommunication with different managers expecting a different output. However, what I enjoy most is helping others with whatever I can at my max ability and if I can't I try to find the answer in a different approach."
good,Great company great people however the pay was peanuts hardly enough to substain life on
good,"The coworkers were always nice when working, I learned how to deal under stress during the holidays. Ex. black friday. Love being able to make my own money and be responsible."
good,Company truly cares about it's employees. Multiple team functions & perks including meals provided in break room & constant rewards for job performance. Best company I've worked for.
good,"Thier motto is fun, fast, friendly and it is. I enjoyed my fellow team members and the challenges of who could get the most people to sign up for credit. I had all great reviews the 7 yrs I worked there. Still I was only compensated $9.40 and hr. I felt my time there alone was more valuable. So I am relocating to be closer to family and a better career choice. The hardest part of the job I would say is leaving my fellow co-workers. All though we still keep in touch I will miss the team work and the fun we had while working."
good,Good company to work for... The management are nice and treat you equal..
good,ok i learned a lot of things mangement i like my boss the co workers was cool
good,"I encountered a poor manager here, but that was the exception to the rule. Overall, everyone was kind and looked out for one another. There was a friendly rivalry over who was the fastest cashier every month, but no one took it seriously. Personally, I didn't see anyone get promoted, so I can't vouch for their advancement potential."
good,"I was lucky enough to start work here when they were building the store from the ground up. It was a lot of hard work, but it paid off when we opened the store and saw all the shiny happy faces come in and start shopping."
good,were a wonderful asset to the team. They treated the guests with respect
good,"great place to work, very flexiable with schudule, friendly employees, great enviorment to work at"
good,"loved working there, just wish better hours were available"
good,During the seasonal time they really care for their workers and make sure they are taken care of. You do work longer hours but they provide lunch for you every day during the holiday season.
good,Just be willing to work hard especially on truck days and peak season..if you work hard and catch on quick during unloading 9/10 you probably get an better position
good,They are very dedicated to their work but lack taking care of their employees. I work very hard but hardly get a break for myself  . People there are very kind.
good,A good thing that stands out about working at Target is Target’s customer service towards their guest. They make sure every guest leaves satisfied and that every guest has a good shopping experience. All the employees are friendly to the guest and helpful. A bad thing stands out about working at Target is that they always switch employee’s positions without asking if it is okay first.
good,I was in a seasonal position and am very sad I was let go but totally recommend applying there. The job kept me busy. The people were nice and were willing to help out at all times
good,"I enjoyed my time working for target. It was a seasonal position. I didn’t think I wanted to work in retail again, but I hope for the opportunity to work for them in the future. I really enjoyed my shifts and the fulfillment work."
good,I worked at target for 3 years it was a good company to work for I have 20 years of retail experience and also have worked for other retail companies and also have business experience too
good,"Doesn’t give a lot of opportunity for hours, the company likes to keep most of its employees part time. A good diverse work environment with opportunities for promotions and raises."
good,The most enjoyable thing about this job was the pay it was really good. A typical day was very busy you defiently had a deadline to meet and it did add a bit of pressure but nothing i couldn't handle.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of standing and checking guests out, which improved my understanding of working a cash register. Everyone was caring and wanted to help, but what made the job tough was attempting guest to get a red card. The most enjoyable part of the job was communication with others throughout the day."
good,"Any retail store can suck or be great, it really just depends who you work with. GM was definitely not the best but the leaders there helped employee moral and and control the chaos. Again, just depends on your coworkers. Retail is easy, and Target as a company is very fair and inclusive."
good,I was hired as season hire...I returned each season for 3 to 5 years. Many benefits. Great group of people to work with. Many perks for the job. Wonderful training also!
good,I had some awesome co-workers and people who helped and taught me things. HR was nice and considerate and helped me with scheduling. My GM sometimes assumed I was slacking off though so that kinda annoyed me.
good,"The most enjoyable part of Target, pardon the cliche, would be the people. I have had normal conversations with upper leadership (VPs to the CEO Brian) and all are ""normal"" approachable people."
good,"They're a good company to work for, but don't provide full time hours to any one and you can't support a family off 20 hours a week and you are unable to qualify for benefits because you have to work 35 hours."
good,"To start off, with the good. First, you get treated with respect. Second, they treat their workers like family. Third, the pay is good. Fourth, the hours worked are pretty much straight forward and easy. The bad things about the company are (1) Some workers not always recognized for all the hard work that do, while others and (2) Some of the management is not so good."
good,"Target its fun. One of the best comoanys to work. But the schedule are not flexible. They want a owrson to have an opend schedule. But not give full time hours. So if someone have a 2nd job. Target, most of the time cant work with that. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
good,"It's honestly about the hours. If I would get 40 hours a week is stay there, but because I was hired as seasonal I'm now getting 12-17 hours a week if that. And I just can't pay my bills with that."
good,At most jobs people aren't so friendly & won't usually be so open to saying high and asking how everyone is doing who passes but there is a sense of i am noticed at target but the management is just two stressful at time especially over the holidays
good,I loved working at target as a cashier I came in contact with so many people and all of my guest were nice and also managers was always nice and helpful
good,Target is an amazing company. The main focus are the guests and it is a very family-friendly company! One of the best things is working with your colleagues as a team!
good,"Its a nice place work. The management is very friendly. You can have a very flexible schedule. You can work mornings, nights, day shifts and weeekends"
good,Need to increase pay to 15.00 per hour for ALL employees that are loyal to the company!!! Overall enjoy my team members. Need more training for other departments
good,Typical work day would come to work with piled up orders when management been there 3 hours before us then only one person comes in on the early 8a shift. Then management wants to get mad when the goal isn’t met.
good,"Pros: different shifts and times. Three days on and four off and four on and three off. Paid weekly. Chance to make OT."
good,"Nothing Special. Good people. OK management. A very hard job. Target does not have the proper equipment to handle the back room. People are nice there, though. They are fair and the customers aren't bad."
good,"Ultimately, it's a nice place to work. Everyone's experience differs depending on your department and availability. For example, one of my coworkers only works 4hour shifts, so she comes in unloads the truck and leave. Whereas I'm open availability so I work a full 8-hour shift. The most enjoyable part for me is my crew members. The hardest is the amount of work demanded of us do to the $13 minimum wage we receive, and I'm sure it's only to increase when they eventually raise it to $15.If your serious about this job I suggest learning everything you possibly can to ensure an adequate amount of hours during offseason."
good,I started working at Target in November as a seasonal fulfillment team member. It was alot to learn in such a short time but I caught on quickly. Management was firm but very nice and helpful when we could not find something. The only downside is I wasn't asked to stay after the holidays which really crushed me cause I really liked the team members I worked with and liked my job.
good,I enjoyed the time I had at Target. They trained me quickly and I began working lots of hours right away. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who thinks that they cannot manage lifting heavy boxes throughout the day.
good,"I enjoyed the job overall, its a great job for someone in school or who has recently got out of school. Very flexable for someone in school, just the pay wasn't all that to me personally"
good,This has been the best experience with higher ups and co-workers I've ever had. Would recommend working here to anyone looking to enjoy their work experience and meet cool and fun people while doing it.
good,"I was happy to go into my work each day i was scheduled, as I was given a work load that wasn't too excessive. The team of managers were great and the team members were not too discomforting. I enjoyed the company's break policies and permits."
good,"In short, Target is a wonderful place to work, with opportunity to grow, and learn from many experiences through the variety of positions available there."
good,I absolutely loved working for Target amazing people very competitive salary and a fantastic way of doing things. It’s too bad all Canadian locations closed down. If they ever come back to Canada I will be applying again.
good,Wonderful work place and always room for job enhancement with the company. Always look for advancement and something new to learn qithin the company. Work hard and enjoy the pwopke that you work with. If you take carw of them they will take care of you.
good,Wouldn’t allow me to switch to a non lifting forklift operator position with my back problems that qualify as a disability. They are lucky I haven’t sued them yet
good,Target is a great company. They care about their employees and the management at the St. Louis Park- Knollwood location is excellent. They needed to pay more especially at that location.  That location is busy 24/7. Hardly any breaks. Even through snowstorms!!!
good,"I worked at 3 different stores and it depends a lot on the management. Store leader can make it fun and challenging or it can make it unbearable. The corporate culture is designed to be fun but there was lack of applicability at store level, I worked until they were transforming their logistics process to a more lean system which I was looking forward to but the store manager made me hate it, at the end it was only about my team."
good,"my experience was a tad bit challenging considering my situation. great communication and undertanding, grateful for the opportunity. created, challenged and successfully completed my own course of My Role as employee."
good,"The Most Enjoyable Part Was Interacting With The Customers And Knowing I've Helped Them Or At Least Made Them Smile That Day .. Target Is Really Easy To Get The Hang Of So There Really Wasn't Any Hard Or Frustrating Parts ,  Because I Was A Cashier Or At Self-CheckOut."
good,"This is the best part time retail job you could start. Im sure things have changed since I left but even when I was there it was great. Great pay, easy to check schedule online, and management was very easy to approach"
good,target is a wonderful place to work for. the rate of pay has the potential to be better than awesome and the customers are fantastic. target can become very busy especially during the holidays and sales.
good,Management could be better. Plus the hiring of better employees would be great! If they improve upon those things the company would be great! Truly feel that would make the company beyond perfect.
good,"Great place to work but low pay"
good,I was on the style breakout team I would have loved to still be working here unfortunately things happened where I had to go. But I loved everyone working there fun times!
good,"It was nice working here , I was an seasonal employee at the time so I only worked 3 months all together but I loved it. The managers were nice and on time with everything"
good,"Management here is great, as well as the workers. They’re all very nice, supportive, and helpful to each other. They try to meet your hours as best as they can, and actually send you home if you’re sick. They don’t expect more out of you than what you can give."
good,"It was a seasonal job and I had another job which I worked also so I was let go probably because I had a job and others didn't. But I would have liked to worked there full time and had some needed benefits, but I could understand."
good,"Overall great work environment "
good,"Target is a great start for those who look forward to working in the retail business. Target helps meet the needs of guests who visit everyday, or once a year ! Making sure no guest leave unsatisfied"
good,Target was a great company that took pride in having the right candidates as managers. Ensuring this one aspect made the job meaningful as the managers were all people oriented and looked after the team.
good,"Target is a very good inviorment to shoppers and good cuality merchandise stoked for home owners and a large amount of toys for tots for the holidays to come, and a good time to speak with nice friends and family to get together and have fun shopping for the kids and home products"
good,The pay and compensations were very good and it was one of the better warehouse jobs I have had. The hours vary depending on the seasons so you never really knew how many hours you would be working a day.
good,"The management at target is great , everything is very well put together. There really nothing hard about the job actually it’s very great I love working at target.  Everyone is very polite , understanding always welling to help."
good,Target has been a home and offers opportunities to advance.  They are always willing to teach and train you to ensure you are where you would like to be.
good,The experience at Target was one of a kind. The coworkers I had were always welcoming and helpful. This is a place you are happy to wake up and go into work. If I hadn’t relocated I would have reapplied for this location.
good,Target is an upbeat and productive environment to work in. There is a lot of interaction with guests and your fellow team members. You work together with your team everyday to assure you can give the guests the best experience possible.
good,"Target is a great starting job, however it did feel a little bit difficult to be able to move up from where you start if you want to stay. Management was a bit uncaring and dismissive of employees."
good,"Loved working at target! Everyone was always professional and polite. There  was always positive energy around, it made it so much easier to get up and go to work I would definitely recommend it especially for people looking to get some work experience it’s a great place to start."
good,"it can get stressful, but it is fun. many interactions all the time, either with co workers or guest. there is ability to go up the ladder there and pay is well."
good,"During my time working at target, it was a good experience getting to learn different things and peoples views on fashion. i would definitely recommend a friend to work there."
good,"Target had a good culture to work within, where different areas of the store helped each other out to make sure the work got done.  They treat their employees pretty good."
good,Just smile be polite work hard be on time don’t call off if you can avoid it dress properly good hi-gene bag items in right order try to keep your money correct try to push the Red cards
good,Every thing was okay the only problem I really had was being stuck by myself or just two ppl doing more than one department and they expected everything to be done by the end of the night. Plus I was pregnant. But other than that it was good started making 11 then it went up to 12.50
good,Higher up could use a little work but other than that is was great working there. The people i worked with were all nice and patient. Everyone helped each other out and made work fun.
good,"Target is a great company to work for. There is a lot of ability to grow and elevate in this company. Great people to be around, and work for. Amazing benefits for everyday life for their employees, all in all a good company to work for!"
good,"Target has always been good to me even before I was an employee, after I became one I just had more bonuses! I recommend this job for young job seekers who are looking to get solid experience."
good,"I loved my experience working with target. They were really friendly people, Great personalities, and HR was very understanding when I made a mistake."
good,One of my favorite jobs . Very organized. A great business to work for . Tiring at times but also fun . The company loves and really looked out for their team members .
good,I use to work there it was a good job for kids in high school but the employees that work there are very nice. I wanted to to stay there but I needed a hirer paying job but the store has great customer service
good,"A lot has changed over the years...less payroll... more work to do... but my store has excellent people...who have worked there for years... and are constantly putting out 100 % everyday..."
good,"Target, like other retailers, has it's ups and downs. Management can be a little more caring and sentimental. Overall, I Love Target! and say yes to T"
good,Its the best place to work with work &  life balance. People can grow in role internally. The management is great and helping. Lot of opportunities to learn and grow.
good,"Bad part is that hours are not consistent, you can work 38 one week and maybe 20 the next. That is not ideal when you have bills to pay. So just keep that in mind when applying."
good,"Very pro employee company ,  it has great benefits and pays well. It is long hours. Employees didn't appreciate what they were given. The company put too much emphasis on opinion surveys"
good,"Managers and co workers are amazingly friendly and always wanting to help, teach and make the job fun. I was one of the best at making Red Card sales at the time I was an employee as well."
good,Good place to work. They will work with you on almost everything. They make you take your breaks which is good. Very fast paced must have a lot of energy.
good,Professional management to work side by side with. Worked with multicultural friendly crew of all ages. I learned logistics seeing new products I would like to come back for with my discount was not bad.
good,The manager are very nice and very helpful. The gave me enough hours for the week. Finding items without a price tag was easy because the managers was always close to find it. It's a very nice place to work
good,"I enjoy working with my team members, that are always willing to jump in and help you achieve their goals. "
good,"Target is a good place to work but you just have to make sure you want the position you're applying for. Softlines mostly has gossip going around, hardlines does their jobs, and cashiers/guest service is relatively easy. Management tries to work with you as much as possible with scheduling. Transferring between Targets can be a little bit tricky but as long as you go up there to check on your transfer your ok. When corporate comes in you will be asked questions about your job but don't sweat them. Just be yourself and don't forget your training. Ask questions if you don't understand something.  Target can be fun with the right attitude."
good,"The company gave me the opportunity to enhance my experience in the office environment.  With them I also improved my communication skills, management skills.  The feedback given was well taken and helpful."
good,Working at this school gave me an opportunity to grow as an educator.  The hours are long and the workload is challenging.  I found that management lacked in communicating exactly what they expected for job requirements.
good,Employees can be trained to do lots of different departments. Worked almost all departments during multiple years of employment. Management quality varies by location.
good,"My  store manager was really discerning when I hired in as far as placing in the best position for my talents and interests. Paul, from the Jackson Target Store, was an awesome manager! I feel like he was very observant as to my work ethic and strengths, and tried to place me accordingly. I was challenged and verbal commendation was freely given. Overall this was a great place to work."
good,The workplace culture is amazing! The daily meetings are time consuming for the sales floor team. I believe that our meetings should be sent to our e-mails. We can read our daily e-mails at home or anywhere else in order to maintain productivity inside the store. It will also help increase our time on the floor by assisting our customers.
good,"Working at Target was very exciting. Some days it could’ve been overwhelming especially around holiday and back to school season due to high volume of customers, but I loved because staying busy and productive made the hours fly by."
good,Overall it was a great place to work beside the pay. It is a non union company and your required to do a lot of jobs for less pay. Over all the workplace was a fun environment
good,"I worked at Target as a seasonal Inbound worker for a month between semesters and they made it easy for me to start there and blend in during that time, which is what I wanted. The pay was great and basically the highest in my area which was super nice."
good,friendly healthy environment that allows for growth of peers encouraging teamwork and work ethic as well as the will and desire to exceed and pursue further leadership
good,Great company that listens to its employees. They often volunteer for their surrounding areas. The only thing i didn't like was how you had to appear to be social with other coworkers.
good,I enjoyed working for Target they put me on a trail period of about 3 months but I sadly did not meet their expectations. But when I asked how I could improve and performance they told me I had to figure it out for myself.
good,"A good place to start out, meet new people and learn customer service skills. I worked as the backroom guy just stocking and taking count of stock, my position was very physically demanding so be prepared."
good,servir les clients et maintenir le département propre et bien rempli.faire du service aux caisses quand il y a un besoin.Faire le remplissage des tablettes .
good,Target was one of the most understanding and welcoming companies ive ever  worked for. I enjoyed all of my coteam members and management. Best  job ever !
good,The company as a whole is fun and competitive. The drive and expectations are very clear in what they want from their employees and the direction in which they are heading. They teach you many things there and dns me you go make quick decisions and learn to problem solve on your feet.
good,"Target stores are very flexible with their scheduling. Management can be hit or miss but are mostly friendly. It is a fast paced environment and one must interact with customers, or guests, on a regular basis. Thus, a positive attitude is implied. The work needed to be completed by an employee is sometimes unreasonable and can be overwhelming."
good,"Great company has some work to do as far as employee happiness goes, but other than that I enjoyed my time there. I would recommend working there but you have to be tough and resilient."
good,"I love being a teachers aid , my only weakness is that I like everything perfect and organized. Plus side is that I got to take some leftovers home with me. I miss the teachers that I gotten used to."
good,"The pressure is on when you have three semi trucks to unload by hand in 4 hours. With 40 team members to both unload and stock the store is a logistics ballet. Fun, fast and rewarding to those who appreciate the process."
good,I had an amazing experience working at target with every single one of my co workers they were all friendly and very respectful to everyone but sadly I had to put my 2 weeks in because I needed to stay focused in high school and worry about graduation.
good,While it can be fairly monotonous it is a very secure job and very hard to mess up. show up with a smile and ready to work and youll never have a bad day.
good,Target is where I learned about leadership and providing good customer service. The company does an outstanding job of training  new executives right outside of college.
good,Target taught me many things and growth was mentored by most manager.  I will always reflect positively working with this corporation.  I also am a fan of the brands they carry.
good,"I've learned a lot with Target with problem solving & great customer service. My average day is spent either fully resetting an aisle or simply just revising it for new products. I've also learned great customer service through Target in handling guests in every manner, & being able to send them home happy with their experience."
good,"I started to work at a Super Target 8 months ago. It was great and all, very flexible schedule and a good environment. So I moved out of town because of college, knowing that I still have a job, I just need to transfer to another Target. I thought the process was going to be easy with no problem. Then, here am I in that town, calling the office everyday trying to complete the transfer. After all this problem, they called asking me a bunch of question, and told me that they were sorry because they don't have any open position at the moment. It was understandable at the time, after that I started to receive notification of current open position, I applied for a many of them, and I called again. The HR told that she was going to ask the Team Leader of the departments that I applied for, to see if I can get at least an interview. I called them back, now I was told that they don't have any open position. How ridiculous this can be? When you have someone that is dedicated to work in your compagny, a member of your team that put everything on the line, trying to get in. I waited for 3 months for a transfer and when the position is available I can't even get an interview?"
good,"My work space is spacious and clean and the entire building is beautiful.  I love the fact that I have the ability to interact with guests and address their concerns.  Also, I am able to read the guest's reviews and see exactly how they are feeling."
good,"It’s a good place to work if you’re in college or high school, they are very flexible with students, and will work with you to get you hours if you want them. Very friendly staff, can be boring if they over schedule or it’s not busy but it’s usually pretty easy to find something to do if you just ask."
good,Target is a great company to work for! They work with my school schedule and give time off. Employees are friendly and helpful. Team leads are very dedicated.
good,A good place to work quick paced so it makes your day go by faster. I started as part-time but made a good impression on management so I got more hours. So if you work hard and make a good impression with management you can move up. It was a temporary job for me but it was a good job.
good,Was a great experience loved the customers as well as the employees. It was a very fun job interacting with customer and employees getting the job done at a appropriate manor.
good,"As a college student, Target was flexible with my hours and availability.  Target offered help when you needed it at work, and I could rely on my co-workers outside of work if I needed someone to talk to.  Target develops a great culture for their workers in and out of the work place.  I am glad to have had experience working here."
good,The managers push and motivate you to achieve daily tasks. If you work hard enough and put in time and effort you will be rewarded and also the managers will trust you more with bigger and more important tasks.
good,"we would work all night just unloading trucks, to unboxing the products to stocking them, I've learned a lot it thought me how to manage a team of 10 or more. hardest part of the job was time management."
good,"I enjoyed working at target. It involved organizing and stocking shelves, helping customers and other workers. Management was great. The culture was very friendly and just a happy place to work. Most enjoyable part was definitely working with amaing people and customers. Hardest part is working during holiday seasons such as black friday."
good,I love working for Target it was very peaceful to work I met a lot of people in the store and it was a great place to meet wondaful team member and guest.
good,Long hours often balanced out with a different day off. Stressful fast paced for leaders. Company is invested in your growth and a lot of opportunities for advancement.
good,working at target has been great even though I am a part time employee I have been trained in all areas of the store so it has taught me many things. Being one of my first jobs I have learned to be responsible and punctual so overall it has been an enjoyable experience.
good,"I have worked at target for a while now. Its not bad as a new out of high school or college job. The only complaint I have ever had is with management. There is always one LOD who will be less than amicable, and when they are your departments head, well turnover becomes aparent."
good,"Target is a excellent job I recommend it for anyone that want over time hours ,Anyone that looking for a group steady job to learn new experience that in any area of the company"
good,Target was a good job with some of the nicest people. Target has some very great trainers and very supportive managers. Target is wonderful job with flexible hours.
good,target offers all kinds of benefits for employees in relation to personal needs and support. it is stressful at times but Target does a lot of things to show appreciation towards the team. Functions to providing food. They really support team members.
good,Target is a great place to work at. A typical day at work would be fast paced and making sure every guest is greeted and to be able to help our guest as best as we can. Management is happy to help when sales associates have done all they can to help the guest. Working at target has taught me to be able to work at a fast pace and under stressful situations. The hardest part of my job would be when we would be understaffed. What I most enjoyed about working at target is the friendly environment and understanding management.
good,I am a people person and I like working with the public. I like serving the guests and solving their problems or answering their questions. I like the teamwork at Target. It is a fun place to work. It is clean and well managed.
good,"I liked working at target a lot, it was nice coming to work and the management treating us to Olive Garden, and always having water bottles stocked up, also loved that they gave us breaks every two hours."
good,"i loved working at target, you meet so many workers of all ages giving out many different variations of work experience. i met some life long friends working at target."
good,"Target has given me the opportunity to gain experience that has allowed me to promote twice in less than a year and eventually outside of the company. I am eternally grateful for the opportunity afforded to me and the matchless culture of diversity and inclusion. It is not only branded throughout the company, but carried out in hiring and company offerings. "
good,"Couldn’t ask for better bosses, they were leaders and worked with you instead of just bosses telling you what to do. Easy and fun job. I’d unload truck, open boxes, stock shelves, also have backroom/back stock experience."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was having free food brought to us in the break room usually every day. The management and co workers were very friendly, this was the best job i ever had."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, the staff was very friendly, majority of the customers were very sweet, great pay, and awesome discounts that come with employment,  good break timing as well."
good,"I would have stayed much longer, and, though I was given the impression that we would be given the option to stay after the holidays, we were all let go and I was heartbroken"
good,"Great place to work, friendly  and fast laced environment. I loved how it felt like we were all a team. Management was amazing and really tried hard to accommodate needs to best of their ability."

good,"I really enjoyed my time at Sun Prairie Target, as a Seasonal TPS, however the job was just that, seasonal.  Everyone was friendly and work there was nice."
good,Target is a great company tobwork for. They care about their employees and make work fun. I love what target stands for and how incredibly inclusive they are.
good,"The company was awesome, they definitely take care of their employees. If you are willing to work, they will give you the hours, especially if you are a hard worker. I only worked seasonal so I only have brief experience with them. Management could have been better, I feel that really makes you want to come to work or not. I feel the management could’ve been better organized and communicated better."
good,A typical day at work included helping provide guests with the best shopping experience possible everyday. I learned a lot of sales experience and how to work with guests. Management is always there to help provide service and help you whenever you need it. The hardest part of the job is sometimes dealing with guests that are having a hard time. The most enjoyable part of the job is working to help guests in every way possible.
good,"I loved working at Target. Unfortunately I was not chosen to stay after seasonal, but I enjoyed my time there and made many friendships and it feels like a second family there. I would love to return to work there again"
good,Great starter job for someone who needs experience. As far management retail is always stressful but it can be managed as long as you have good leadership skills
good,"a typical day at work is unloading merchandise off of company truck. stocking shelves with shoes, jewelry, apparel, and home products. management was awesome."
good,"I trained lot of of my coworkers, help developed them into trainees to help wit the establishment. I leaner first in first out while working in the marketplace. I was an assistant backup cashier. Making the clearance items of the day while zoning and being accountable for my workplace."
good,Great starting out job. Lot of amazing people you will meet at target. You will feel part of a team or like a family. They are only two days of the year.
good,"Target is a great place to work, it’s challenging yet enjoyable, and they pay great. Some managers could work on helping other employees when they need assistance. But overall target is a great company to represent."
good,"Target is an amazing store, everyone is very nice and willing to help. Management is strict in the best of ways, the guests come first and that I loved. If you want a job that you will look forward to going to everyday, Target is the place for you."
good,"One of my better work experiences , never had a single issue here aside from one employee I had an issue with, but the money was good I was able to make a living off of my pay, would definitely recommend a friend to work there."
good,"Honestly, I enjoyed working at target, I got along with everyone very well, only issues with management seem to be that some managers or team leaders are very inconsistent, you work hard and they don’t notice or appreciate it. Other than that the work is simple but very big, goal is to leave the area zoned and with little to no strays."
good,"A typical day on the job looks like; meeting for a huddle as soon as the doors open and before the day gets started and another huddle when the shift rotates to evening. Throughout the day, the team places priority on being productive and task-oriented while maintaining a fun a friendly environment."
good,I really enjoyed working for Target it was fun and enjoyable.my co/workers were great to work with it was a great job.i only left because I got into Nursing and got a better paying job in my field of caregiving.
good,Target is a great place to work at. I work there while attending school and they are flexible with hours. The management is great and allows you to grow in your position.
good,"I worked as a FLOW Team Member at Target on the graveyard shift. We would get the boxes off of the truck and take them out to the floor  for stocking. It was very easy work and I lost a lot of weight due to all of the lifting that was sometimes required to stock heavier merchandise. Everyone was given an area to work in, it was either Softlines or Hardlines. Softlines was usually something like clothing or makeup. Hardlines would be something like pet foods. I always ended up having to stock pet food. Kitty litter is not a joke when you have to lug several of them onto a shelf. It certainly wasn't a pleasant experience to accidentally have a can of pet food accidentally fall on my head. But I liked the job very much. If you do not wish to work during the day, then this would be the job for you. The downside is if you have children who do not understand that you need to rest for a few hours."
good,"I enjoyed target, I like their culture, the only reason I did not work there any longer is because they did not pay enough for me to be able to provide for myself and I needed to be able to provide for myself."
good,"Target is a great place of work. I walk in there and i feel like i’m at home. Friendly environment as well as flexible hours. Benefits a great, and you get paid time in a half on holidays"
good,As a first job target was very enjoyable as training was extensive and management was always forthcoming with the tasks the expected from you. Their was only professionalism in this work environment.
good,Seasonal worker and had a great time working there. Promoting the red card is the top most thing that all supervisiors and managers want lower level workers to promote
good,The hours were irregular but the work was decent. You are on your feet all day. They pay well compared to other retail stores. The work culture is nice and the people you work with are always friendly.
good,"Wonderful place to work if you prefer to learn and keep a position, yearly raises, however there wasn't much room for employment growth. "
good,"Target corporate does a good job with their locations' setup and stocking, but the team and work culture you are introduced to sets the mood for your entire work experience. I'd recommend this job for anyone with a hard work ethic who also enjoys joking around with their coworkers on the side."
good,Working at target was enjoyable. There was a lot of different people to interact with. The shifts were flexible with school and they were ranging from 4-8 hrs a day.
good,Target is a great seasonal job to have. It has decent pay as well as employee discounts that come in handy during the holiday season. I enjoyed the staff as well as working with the customers.
good,"Consistently busy with price mark downs and once an item(s) are sold, they're donated.Also, I work in ship to store department during holiday seasons."
good,Target starts you off at a good pay but you can’t get overtime and if you work in multiple areas you’re not likely to get paid more for it. All the team members were nice and hard working.
good,"Target is business savvy, they react quickly to changes in the market and their guests' wants, this is why the are posting positive comps while others are closing. The culture is all about self improvement and team work, instead of disciplinary action management always holds a ""seek to understand"" whenever possible. Management is patient and instructive and every day is something new. THe hours may be long, but they go by quickly."
good,After being here for mor than 10 years I'm very comfortable here so I will say I had ups and downs but when I need hours or jus anything this job always get me the help
good,"ring up merchandise, speak to customer, smile and ensure that customer go home with the merchandise and a smile."
good,I worked there for 2 years. I shouldn't leave because i has other new job offered. Because Target doesn't offer benefit. That's why i have to leave the Target. I shouldn't left first place.
good,"Planning to apply direct through company website to work for target if they can offer me a chance."
good,It was a nice job I just couldn’t balance things with and I didn’t like the position they put me I. I didn’t apply for it I had 3 Jobs at that time and had checked back into school
good,working at target was a great customer service experience . target was a very great experience other then having bad managment other then that i would have staid
good,Target is one of the best retailers to work for. They care about their employees and take care of them. The culture of taking care of the guest is evident. They work with work life balance.
good,"Very good environment to work in. The hours very and are not always consistent. Although, if your willing to learn new things you’ll have more opportunities to work."
good,love working at target great work environment had lots of fun did a lot for their employees. i was in-stocks so i had a set scheduled from the hours of 6am til 230pm

good,I was a seasonal worker.  The pay was fair for the job I did.  It was organized. I recieved training for each area of my job.  The management was always respectful and I was treated well.
good,My job at the target in Norman was very fun and friendly. The co-workers were very kind and the tasks were not difficult. For 8.00 an hour back then you can't beat that.
good,I personally love target and working there was a joy. Being able to be on the other side of the register was neet. I enjoyed seeing all the things that were actually in the store once people came to purchase them.
good,"This is a job anyone can do, it’s great for first time workers or people that just want an easy extra paycheck every month. They have tons of different departments."
good,"I loved working at target, it was one of the best retail jobs that I definitely learned a lot , sometimes management can be rude it just depends on where and what target your working on"
good,"Target is a fast pace job, where you are assingned an area to work & help guests. At target we are a team where everyone come together to help certain areas that need help."
good,"Positives: Has a positive and organized work environment. Shifts between 4 and 8 hours. Supportive and encouraging management. Good pay. "
good,"Working at Target was a pretty good experience for my first job, I worked in the food avenue area and did different tasks such as cashiering cooking and cleaning.It also helped me develop customer service skills and communication and things of that nature, the environment was very nice for the most part with awesome and friendly co-workers, it made going to work fun and enjoyable and the people were very helpful"
good,"I have loved working for target! I work in A&A(clothing). Over the last few months there has been some changes to our daily schedules and routines, but the leaders and other team members help and try to get everybody on the same page. With that being said it has been a little rough because we are trying to be more efficient and still provide excellent guest service. When I first started it was a very laid back job where if you closed then you would zone an area all night, lots have changed, so if you are considering a job with target, I hope your okay with change. Target also works very well with other job or school schedules, only a few weekends and holidays where they dont allow you to request off."
good,"It had a friendly environment, it wasn't too stressful and it was easy to understand in a short time. I would recommend it to anyone just entering the work force."
good,"It was one of my favorite jobs. I had to leave do to relocation. Other than that, ill probably still be working in that setting. It gave its workers room to grow."
good,Only was a seasonal employee but was my first job. I absolutely loved it. Would’ve stayed longer if given the opportunity. Was glad to venture out into serving though.
good,"Started out as a cashier and picked up other opportunities."
good,"it was fun. The staff members are like family. They have an open door policy and they are generally concerned about your well being. Loved it here! They pay was great, they are good about promotions and raises. They are very flexible as far as scheduling is concerned. Guest Services is a bit overwhelming when working by yourself, but overall it was such a great experience and they are a great company to work for"
good,Target has great and affordable benefits but the pay is near minimum wage. The culture at Target is like a family and they let you earn PTO and get vacation and sick days.
good,"I loved working at Target, and interacting with my peers. Target is a fast paced environment, and it is there to provide incredible customer service to guests."
good,"I would highly recommend this as a first job and that is pretty much it. Target is a great company but like every company it has it up & downs. I learned a lot while working at target such as communication skills between my leaders, team members, and also many guest. The management is well is some departments I would say there isn't much fairness within target. Honesty there isn't really anything that is hard about the job but if i had to say anything about it but if I had to say something about the job being hard would be the uncoordinated work schedule. None of your weeks of work would look the same for longer than two weeks. The funnest part about the job would be the team members you get to work with fir the most part is is a good job community."
good,"Great people, great hours, fast paced. Have to have good people skills. Must be able to lift heavy things. Multitasking is a huge must, because there are customers while you work."
good,"It great communication with team members "
good,"Shopping at target is one of my favorite things to do. Working there was a different story. It would have been one of my favorite jobs if only we didn't have to up sell the red cards. Being a cashier is fun! You get to meet a lot of different people everyday. But i'm no sales lady, maybe the cashier position just wasn't for me."
good,"Although my job at Target is easy, the people I work with are wonderful. The management is very supportive, and the guests that shop there are wonderful and over all very friendly. There is a lot of equality at Target, and for the most part everyone gets along."
good,Cool Place To Work. Besides dealing with the rude customers it’s a great place to work.  Management could use a little more sensitivity training to deal with employees.
good,It was stressful when they use to only care about your red card number and would only favorite people and not protect their employees. It was good for learning skills as your first job.
good,"Target was a fast paced but fun job. Great management, paid time off, even for part timers. Always had what I needed to perform my job. decent raises."
good,I would recommend someone to target because they are good and embracing new workers and teaching them well. The pay is getting better as time goes on so it only depends on how much you work.
good,"* great environment to work in"
good,"Target is a fun place to work at. As with any other retail job there are times when it becomes very hectic but the team members help each other. "
good,I enjoy working for target. It’s fast paced sometimes and can get stressful especially around the holidays. It’s a pretty simple job & they pay isn’t to bad.
good,"Team-based, fun, and productive.Target is productive because it is team based. There is a good communication between the managers and team members. Target cares about their guests."
good,Fast start ups beginning with stretches and follow by anouncements then continued with fast pace working in the first few hours and increasing pace. two 30 minute breaks between the day.
good,"This is a great job, management is great. It is always something new. You have a lot of opportunity to cross train in other areas if the store. Family oriented!"
good,"My only tip would be to do the job you're required to do, show initiative and you will get far.If you want to move up, learn as much as you can in as many departments as you can. Cross trained employees tend to get more hours."
good,was a very fun place to work met a lot of great people there got to learn how to work in a fast paced enviroment and got to learn how to help strangers
good,"I only worked at Target for about a week so i really don't have anything to say but it was a friendly, comfortable, fast paced, fun environment. The staff was outspoken, helpful, organized, and focused on their assignments."
good,"the glendale target in denver was a great place to work. it was avery busy location so i was never bored during my work day,  but the inflow of shoppers was never a strain in my nerves."
good,"My experience at Target has been a very positive one. I work closely with the management team and there is a pleasant and professional work environment. The management often celebrates the employee's accomplishments, as well as acknowledging each members' birthdays. Hard work and dedication is always noticed and management is very generous with their praises. I have to say overall Target is one of the best companies I've ever worked with."
good,And understanding company that values you and your time. They strive to make sure you are comfortable and know what you ware doing. Great company for those looking for work.
good,"I liked what I did there. Everyone was great. There was some down time, but you always had to do something or help someone. Management was good. The store manager was kind of a jerk. As in being kind of rude about telling you what to do. Talking to you like you're an idiot. But you didn't have to see him too often. If I did, I would do my best to avoid him."
good,Everyone is very nice and willing to help you if you're in need of it. Your peers are usually around High School age to about 30 which is an ideal situation for anyone who gets this job for their first job.
good,This job is very nice as well if you like doing cashier work dealing with the public and other things that come along with customer service. Working at Target gave me alot if skills that would help me along way in the future.
good,It was a fun workplace. The team members and managers are easy to get along with. I would recommend this job for anyone. This is a job worth pursuing.
good,"Regardless of being part-time it was fun. People were very helpful and fun. Constantly, pushing to do better, with great morale. Manager and upper staff were awesome teachers"
good,Everyone there is there to help you grow as a employee and person. They are very family oriented and they care about one another. They make sure they give you your breaks and they are there if you need help.
good,"A typical day was stocking sales floor, zoning and picking up and re-shelving merchandise, and responding to backup on front end. "
good,Target is a good stepping stone job to get you experience in just about everything like customer service working the cash register and other skill are there to learn but not sure if this would be a place to have a career very unfair because when it’s a slow season they cut your hours and make it hard to survive
good,Target is working experience place to be at when you need a job. You can go there for about 2 years and move on or maintain Target. It's all about helping people.
good,"Fair job. They do have favorites, the jobs are easy if you show up and do as your told. can be a fun. Working holidays does suck and the pay raises aren't that great"
good,"Clock in on time, do your job, management ensures you do your job properly and smoothly, HR tries to get employees involved in activities about once a month or so. Hardest part is probably making bales of trash in the back of the store. The hours are the most enjoyable."
good,Target was a great Company to work for. My current position that I worked in was being illuminated and that is why I had to seek employment elsewhere. I had no intentions on leaving.
good,I really enjoy working here. Wished I started when I was 18 just starting college instead of 20 and graduating college. Great pay and great people. Love my coworkers and managers.
good,Some tips would be to always show a good positive attitude towards your co workers and guest because you should treat people how you want to be treated. Also work at a reasonable pace when it come to your work.
good,Target taught me how to distinguish between a'lot of items. With their large selections you really have to have a good memory to know what to do and where to put items at a fast paced environment.
good,"look advancing if you are a hard worker is easy, but be sure you are passionate about whatever position you want to advance into.I loved working at Target, but when there was an opening for AP i took it only because they needed to fill it. In retrospect I wish I never had agreed to take it as the position (not target) was not right for me. but having gone into that position there was no way for me to demote and stay at that store."
good,Really nice work experience just not enough hours I love my job very nice place to work get along with everyone good working relationship with the bosses
good,"A typical day at target was fun, stressful, and fast pace. The customers made us both laugh and scream. Your co-workers became life long friends. My favorite thing was how we made teamwork more than just a phrase."
good,Great place to work with lots of benefits. Target is a retail company that has a passion for serving their guests. They are willing and ready to change the way they do things to fit the ever evolving retail demands. Target has done many things to stay ahead and they will be around for a long time.
good,A day at target; you have to do all your working duties and also be called up to the registers if they need you. other than that all the managers are great. they have flexibility on your schedule.
good,"Typical day was restocking shelves, managing orders, or interacting with guests on the sales floor. All managers (or LODs) are long time Target employees who advanced through the ranks. Benefits are amazing. Hardest part would probably be when guests get upset or the long time walking/standing."
good,Everything was always moving fast at Target. I would punch in then get right to backstocking or pulling batches. I learned that punctuality  when it comes to completing something on time should not be taken lightly. The place always had employees everywhere it was hard not to see a friend every shift. Talking to other workers came easy. The most difficult part was LOCU'ing the backroom because it was a lot and you were always expected to finish. The most enjoyable part was going on break with a friend there was always something nearby.
good,"Super friendly co workers and managers. Everyone seems to care about one another. Easy to make friends and there are great discounts. Awesome, upbeat Atmosphere, never a day I wished I stayed home."
good,Target was a great place to work. I just needed more time with my kids. The hours weren't bad. I had every other weekend off and one closing shift plus a closing weekend. I just didn't like the fact they shifted upper managment so much.
good,"good place to be if you want to work hard.Never a time to be idle.Plenty of task and cleaning and lots of guest interaction."
good,"I enjoyed working there, my coworkers were positive and the management was good they have their moments but my overall experience at target was good ."
good,it was busy on most days but that was becaues of the holiday season. I learned how to move quick and how to treat guests. management was alright their was one person who just wouldn't get off my back but I managed.
good,Target was a relaxed place to work except for when as a cashier you had to maintain a 25% sign up rate for the Red card. If a person is not a good salesperson this could be very hard.
good,It was a fun place to work. I cashiered and took inventory off the truck to be put away. I worked mostly in soft lines with the clothes. The people there were nice.
good,Working in target was a nice experience
good,Target was a fun place to work.  All the employees and management got along great.  They had great opportunities for advancement.  The work environment was easy and stress free.
good,Recently receiving poor hours so finding a new job. Overall a great place to work. The payment and benefits are good as well. Fun and friendly coworkers and staff
good,The job is repetitive. Easy work but lots of work for one person especially during the holidays. You primarily work on your own even though you're a team. You can make great friends and work buddies and management is ok.
good,unloading trucks - must have a degree to advance - the hardest part was standing on feet all day - time went by really fast - benefits were great - learned how to use different machines - discount was good also
good,Target is a fast paced job. In the receiving area you have to move quickly to keep with with the conveyor belt. You cannot take your time you have to move quickly lifting heavy merchandise as well as light.
good,Love working for this company..it was a very nice involvement.takes no time climb the ladder if u are trying to get somewhere in life..and was really good team members
good,"I truly enjoyed my time with Target. A typical day in any leadership position is going to involve department or role-specific duties (i.e. as an HR Team Leader I performed Human Resource duties and functions for the location in addition to various skills and abilities around the store.) This is an important thing to consider in any specialized retail role! I will say that at the time I was employed, I did not feel as though the pay was adequate in relation to the role and responsibilities but I cannot speak on how that pay scale may be today. I'm sure federal minimum wage has even increased once or twice since my time there. Overall, the experience and opportunities available to you are worth exploring and the company culture cannot be beaten! I will always be proud to say this organization had a great deal of influence on me as a professional."
good,"i got worked like a dog and never made a cent over minimum wage, but it was still a good place to work. after my seasonal time was over i was not asked to stay on which was upsetting since the ones who they DID ask quit or got fired within a few months, AKA if you get hired as seasonal dont expect a part time offer even if you work hard and love the job. it was nice when we had to work holidays because they would always provide us with snacks or even full meals in the break room."
good,"It was a nice place to work at, they are very understanding with school and try to work with your schedule. If i asked for more hours they would try their best to give me more hours. Overall a good experience working there."
good,"Working at target was awesome. Everyone was caring, fun to talk to and supportive. There was great teamwork and collaboration within all departments and everyone loved helping eachother."
good,"Everything was going great, I even helped with the store remodel from 9pm till 5am.  Crew and staff all got along with no problems. I would work there again."
good,Enjoy what you can do and what you can get from a place like Target. I loved being part of such of a amazing team like Target. The work was always something new and fun. Come to work as much as you can
good,"I loved working at Target, It was a very fast paced company.. i did stocking and reshop.. All the things that customers returned or didnt want i had to put them back.. i had to first sort out the carriages , i put items in their correct area cart so they can go directly there"
good,"A typical day at target is always very busy & upbeat so you have to be quick on your feet & keep a smile on your face while doing it, going in you would think a cashier position would be an easy task but you take on a lot just in that one role. I've also grew in the workplace being put in bad positions but working my way out of them and being a great help/addition to the service desk. I would say that the hardest part of the job would have to be trying to help the guest out in situations but also helping the company out at the same time, finding that balance is hard & takes a lot of experience, patience & assertiveness. The best part about working at target is guest leaving pleased & just happy with everything."
good,Typical work day was to make sure merchandise was priced correctly. Management was great. The job was easy. The most enjoyable part was being able to comunicate with the public.
good,"I was hired for seasonal employment at Target and I went in kinda dreading the job, the management, and basically everything about it. But it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought. "
good,"Working for target was a great opportunity,  fun loving and charismatic individuals, with a drive for improvement. This was an exciting experience with so much potential to grow in the company.  Understanding and compassionate managers."
good,The environment was very friendly. Everyone was quite energetic. I learned a lot about customer service and how to balance that with meeting certain quotas. The management was very good in my opinion. The hardest part of the job was dealing with certain types of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the great people I got to meet and work with.
good,"Productive work environment, fast pace type of job, great team, flexible work hours, the management is great, I got to meet and help customers that were in need of assistance, and it's just a wonderful place to work"
good,"Target still has one of the best management trainee programs which is why so many good candidates are poached from the company. They require a lot out of managers but compensate you for that with base salary pay, bonuses and career advancement. A company is only as good as its leadership and thankfully target trains theirs adequately."
good,"I enjoyed working here for the little time I did. The higher ups were always there to talk to. Always was treated with respect, and felt like I could ask for help whenever."
good,"There is a lot to do on any given day, but it is all easy to understand how to do. But the management is not given enough hours from corporate to give most everyone full-time hours."
good,"Very professional and well organized. A wonderful position for anyone, either in their first role or last role. Everyone should punch their Target ticket."
good,Target shut down all over canada. but it was a fun place to work. staff was very friendly and had great benefits too. I wish it never shut down. miss that place
good,"Target offers flexible hours, especially   for those people going to school during the week. They work with you to make sure that you are not over stressed"
good,Fix management this place will run smoothly. When you have issues they say they willl help but no one actual helps they push it to the side and keep on moving.
good,"fun experience, team members were awesome customers easy to get along with and work hours was good fun environment will love it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,"working there is fast paced and you deal with all kind of customers. i learned how to be more patient with people. "
good,"loading trailers, 4 breaks with an hour lunch, clean, go home. management was amazing, if you struggled they'd come by to check on you. they would personally help you or grab someone to help until you caught up"
good,"overall, i really liked it there. The people were great. They were flexible with scheduling. i have no complaints about my cashier or guest service position. I would go back."
good,"No job or company is perfect, but I think Target (mostly) tries to do right by its employees. I do like that it's encouraged to involved with the many business councils/groups (ex. LGBTQA and African American business councils)."
good,"job keeps you busy"
good,This was a great place for me and to work just unfortunately there's no more photo lab due to technology and I relocated.I would love to work in a place like this but no more
good,"I had a great time working with both team members, guest, and the supervisors. Most of the supervisors that i had were nice to me. I was welcomed there."
good,"This was a temporary job working during the holiday season. The company kept if interesting, offered lots of fun events and benefits such as drawings, and kept focused on their staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was that all of the employees were happy and friendly."
good,"I loved my job. Child care got in the way. Everyone is friendly, the store is fast paced, but the discounts, cartwheel and coupons I really miss the most."
good,"A typical day will start of by receiving directions on multiple tasks that need to be completed for that day in addition to helping guests to have a welcoming experience.  Tasks consist of scanning out of stock items, stocking shelves with out of stock items, backstocking, and assisting other team members."
good,"typical day is very busy and around the holidays. management was good , you work with a lot of many different cultures and the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you helped somone"
good,Just a seasonal position that I held regarding the holidays. People were pretty easy to get along with. The job was fun they just couldn't offer me a permanent position due to lack of space.
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with multiple team leads, each have an area they are in charge of with a goal to complete and expect you to be single-minded in achieving that goal... All three of them currently in the building during that shift. Team members run the gambit from amazing to infuriatingly useless due to Target's reluctance to fire someone just for being awful at the job they are being paid to do,"
good,"I loved working at Target. If another company did not offer me a promotional opportunity, I never would have left. I liked my colleagues and the work that I performed. I always knew what my role was in the larger scheme of things."
good,"I loved target, it was always fun and refreshing work environment. the management really looked out for us and would give neat incentives. id recommend it to anyone who won't mind the work and will show up."
good,"Good company to work for, but changing positions in the store felt almost impossible. Training was amazing and they tried to help you succeed at every corner."
good,I liked my experience though it was the holiday season when I began so it was a little stressful at times but working in the floor as a stocker I was able to help with setting up decorations in the area I was assigned for the shift. My days went by fast because we were always busy and there was always something to do.
good,Target is a great place to work. I have learned how  to be a thoughtful business owner through partnerships and collaborating with team members. The most enjoyable part about target are the team members and the bonds you build through working towards the same goal
good,I really enjoyed working at target during my younger years.  The staff was great. The only thing I would change is the management had a few short comings but nothing is perfect
good,The pay is really good but their always changing management and they don't communicate irate the way they should. I loved my job their but they change things around to much.  I'm good with change but not every other month changing managers that's just to much.
good,"I am crossed trained in over half of the jobs at Target. Everyday is different for me from back stocking, being store operator, cashiers, working sales floor, helping out customers, pricing, resetting, zoning, and stocking."
good,"ok place, It was only seasonal . 12 hour shift and off 3 days I really didn't mind. I would have really enjoyed keeping this job but like I said, it was only seasonal."
good,"Every day I close and most the first to do is grab all the items left by the customers and put it back to it place. Then, we clean up the store and make it look nice to the next morning."
good,"its a good started job for teens, the pay is low for the amount of work you have to do. but I did learn a lot about dealing with customers and working in a fast paced environment. everyone was super cool on the team even management . you will get the hours you need especially during the holidays"
good,"The staff was very nice and friendly, everyone got along. I enjoyed it very much never had a bad experience working here. Nice neighborhood & good hours."
good,I really enjoyed my time working at target. The team members  believe in team work and that made me a better working an a better father. I will love to be apart of a team again
good,"I enjoyed being able to meet customers from all walks of life, various countries, and differing backgrounds. The culture is very fast-paced and strenuous, but there is never a dull moment."
good,"Pros:"
good,its a cool job if you like being on your feet. hardest part of the job is obviously dealing with rude customers but that is all apart of customer service
good,"early morning around 4am get there we all gather up to see what the goal for the day, to unload truck and do our stretch.try to bet the time are get a goal to unload saftly.once we unload it goes out to the sell floor before the store open"
good,"A typical work day for me consisted of walking in through the front doors at 12am-4am to unload the trucks carrying various items and then stocking them for the next 4-8 hours depending on how many trucks there were and how many pieces they contained. I learned a lot from working at Target, and one of the things I learned was to properly time manage myself when it came down to having a constricted time frame. Management was great. The people are what made the job full of life. The hardest part of the job was keeping a level head when wanting to get the job done on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that the people there were kind and the laughs which ensued as the day went on."
good,Best company to work for women with flexi hours and great work life balance. Have worked for close to 8 years and never had any issues. It is specially best for working women.
good,"Target is a great place to work.  You will get flexible hours, decent pay for the work you do, and managers that are willing to work with you to deal with whatever may arise."
good,Target is a fun place to work with great benefits. The store I am employeed at give opportunities for volunteer experience and also for each of us to gie target vibes to each other. Target vibes are for those of us who may want to give a team member a recognition for something we've seen a team member do.
good,"Stocking, shipping , was most what I took care of unloading large semi trucks from target. There was times where it was very strwfull but I made sure I got thew it regadless"
good,If you looking for a fast paced then this the jobs for you. I really like working here its fast paced and physical. I loved to unload trucks just because its physical
good,"Co workers are friendly, and HR gives a decent amount of hours. I have never had a problem with scheduling around other obligations and vacations. I've enjoyed my time with Target."
good,Great people to work with and work for. Much room for advancement and places to grow. I would recommend anyone coming out of high school to start you career here.
good,"it was a good experience with target, until it became cvs that's when everything went down hill was with the company for 6 + years I love target just don't work for cvs inside taregt"
good,I LOVE Target! But standing the whole day waiting for customers to go to the register kind of tiresome. But nothing to complain. The payment was indeed wonderful.
good,"i liked it . it was an overall good expirience, would go to work and start my daily routine, most enjoyed part of the day was just being able to help the coustumers and my team ates"
good,I was hired as a seasonal team member and was offered the chance to stay. I'm glad I chose to stay because I've met some of the nicest people. The days I work sometimes go by so fast because its always busy and theres always something that needs to be done.
good,"It was okay what can i say it was just a job honey. Nothing to brag about to the folks. It payed me okay, could have used more for the type of work i was doing but whatever to need to get salty over the past."
good,"coworkers are friendly and kind, all are helpful and help you learn how things flow. On a downside not many hours for part time employees. Work hard enough more hours will be giving if possible."
good,Would go to work n help put the new department in the store. The manager was net a very friendly person to work with. The job was really hard sometimes.
good,The team members and management were amazing and friendly but the work was really time consuming and stressful. They always offered words of encouragement and free snacks!
good,you get to meet a lot of interesting people whom you work with and who are you customers and you go above and beyond to make sure that they are satisfied.
good,a great place to work at as a first time job to gain work experience. flexible with scheduling if going to school full time. good hours and able to pick up more hours.
good,Working at target is an overall great experience. Everybody there is really nice and we all work together as a team. You also get a chance to work in different areas and also gain extra hours.
good,Usually spent my days either working as a cashier or as a cart attendant. Occasionally would work the floor and stock the floor. One of the hard parts of the job was there wasn't much room to advance.
good,hard but ok management hires new recruits who dont know wats all really going on straight out of college   thats retty much all i have to really say i guess i can go on
good,I absolutely loved working here. My manager was great. The environment was safe and great. The work was easy! I loved the pay! I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"I was part of the Human Resources Team an I really enjoyed my time working for Target, the only reason I had to leave was because my family had to relocate,  and the Target in my area didn't have a lot of hours to hand out, due to it being a low volume store."
good,Good place to work for a first job. They dont really work around school schedules so you have to basically have an open schedule. The company itself was good and really encouraged their staff.
good,"Working at a Target Starbucks Franchise might not have been my first choice, but it was fun nonetheless. Customers might be rude occasionally, but what job doesn't ave that? Just keep a smile on your face and bear through it."
good,"The good things about my job were because of Starbucks.  The not so good were the Target red tape etc.  I very much enjoyed working for Starbucks in Target.  Starbucks (at least at this location) had very high standards and a great training program.  We opened our location, so it may have been more formal training than if someone walks in by themselves to an already established Starbucks.  Anyway, the atmosphere was great, and the people were too."
good,"It is a good place to work. It can be a challenge at time but you get used to it. Long hours, good pay and pretty decent benefits. People are friendly."
good,"Target is a wonderful company , very organized , very friendly , great atmosphere , great staff , they are not good with giving hours but for the most part everything is great at target"
good,"Great place to work for, awesome people (teammates) and great benefits. At the end of each quarter we would have a celebration, play games and free lunch."
good,"The work-space was clean and efficient, the shifts were nice and the pay was good. It was kinda hard to get to know my co-workers but that might have been due to how busy it was."
good,Very fast paced job. We had to make sure that shipment was ran and also make sure the guest was getting the help that they need. Also help each other in everything very big team.
good,"Target was a great company much like the Air Force it is family oriented and has tons of great benefits. The hours were great, the store was clean and  the customers were nothing like the ones at Wal-Mart!"
good,"I liked this job alot. It had alot for me to do so it was never slow and it kept me busy. Nice co-workers, kind customers, I enjoyed it very much. Would definitely give someone a reference."
good,"A great company to start out at during high school/ college, the hardest part of the job was the management, HR does take a long time to follow up about your concerns on management. Loved my coworkers, they made the day easier despite how management would behave or despite their lack in communication."
good,"Great place to work  very transparent with communication and always ready to take  in ideas. "
good,Target was a good working environment. I like the constant grind of unloading trucks with my forklift . The people was great it was a great team environment.
good,"learned about target red cards "
good,"The employees, managers, and coworkers made working at Target the best. Everything worked fairly easy going, your trainers were willing to explain things, and if you had a question there was no fear to ask! They loved people who pushed forward and tried hard."
good,Very nice company to work for. When I was there everyone got a birthday cake on their birthday. Nice and friendly staff. Also plenty of opportunity to advance.
good,"I had a lot of fun working for Target and, for the most part, have nothing but good things to say. I enjoyed my job, enjoyed the people I worked with, and had good relations with all of upper management. "
good,I learned that I love working with the public and that I enjoy being part of a team. I learned how to place food supply orders and I also learned how to make the best beverages around. The hardest part of my job was not having enough time to spend with my guests at Starbucks/Target.
good,It was ok but when they see a person who is willing to work they will work you. Sometimes it's a headache to work there but every job has its good days an bad days.
good,I've been with target five years I wanna find something extra I just need a dependable secondary job I know I'm a hard and productive worker I love working for target I just want a second job morning shift is a plus.
good,I loved working here because I got to work with customers and learn new things everyday. stocking and unloading trucks from the warehouse every morning was a daily task. cleaning and organizing surrounding departments. giving great customer service.
good,Great place to work. Great environment and you grow and learn with the employees as well as the customers. Very east to multi-task if you have never muti-task before. I loved working at target!
good,"A typical day at work includes checking out the customers while engaging in brief conversation with the customers, I learned a lot about customer service through working here. The management was great people to work with. There really wasn't any part of the job that was hard and the most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers and getting to know them through and by them coming in often."
good,A really awesome [lace to work when you love books and giving recommendations. It's hard to go up in position there because people work there for so long.
good,"A typical day at work could be unloading a truck, setting a pog or brewing a fresh pot of pike and verona in the morning. I learned alot of how each position plays an important role on having a succesful day at Target. Management has been pretty rocky at the Laburnum Target but I figure it is because they need to find the perfect people for the job. My co-workers are like family. I love them all. The hardest part  of the job is woking at a pace they want you to work. they want you to hurry and do a specific job, but they also want you to do it right, but they want you to bend the rules to get it done at a timely manner which is impossible. the most enjoyable part of the job is holidays, especially around Christmas, each team does Secret Santa and participates in any extra activities we have going on."
good,"70+ hour work week if you want to get Promoted. "
good,"everyday i would clock in Answer customers' questions about merchandise and advise customers on merchandise selection. I learned to have patients and to problem solve.the managers was understanding at times,the hardest part about target is solving conflicts with misunderstanding customers,and the most enjoyable part was getting problems solved with angry customers and seeing them smiles."
good,"Target does a really good job of separating workers into their own fields. Such as, customer service people stay strictly to cashiering and front area, and the soft lines strictly to clothes and stuff. Your job is your job. Most of the people there are of varying ages, and there isn't really a life associated with working at target, but everyone there is typically very nice and you'll get plenty of hours. Hardest part was probably just the long amounts of standing, in this massive store you will stand a lot. The job in itself was just super easy. Nothing to learn except where everything is."
good,"Management fun and friendly. Lots of opportunity to learn new processes and skills. Plenty of great moments with peers, and employees. Hardest part of the job is honestly dealing with corporate changes with very little follow up or communication on implementation."
good,"Package outgoing orders into boxes with bubble wrap to secure items, Scanned items to print customer information for shipping information, maintain work area and station, maintain and stock work station with any supplies needed to complete job task."
good,"good place to work"
good,"it was OK working there. depending on the in store management, that will determine how your stay will be with Target"
good,"My favorite part about being a Cart attendant at Target was to be outside getting the carts. What I really like about my job, was whenever I worked to my best effort, my boss's and supervisors notice it and then I'm trusted without worry.  "
good,"Great work environment,leadership guarantee 40 hours, none leadership less than 25 hours. Leadership at times need to get challenged"
good,Target was a fast paced work place. Everyday consisted of pulling and stocking merchandise in all areas of the store. My co workers was pleasant to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning the store and knowing where everything was located.
good,"I provided fast, friendly service to all Target guests.  I opened up credit cards (at least 5) per a part time shift. I enjoy working evening's and I was scheduled as such."
good,"Employees always happy, management understanding, lots of walking, good to learn the skills of setting up pogs (racks for clothing) overall nice work experience"
good,Target's minimum wage is rising. They are very flexible with hours and respect any time off needed. Co-works are friendly and motivated. It is a good work environment with great Team Leads.
good,"I loved working at Target. It was my first job and I learned so much and grew excellent relationships with the team. The team and store were of the best in not only our personal district, but the entire country. I believe it was because of the strong management team, which without their positivity and drive the store wouldn't have flourished in our town the way it did."
good,"Target is very about its people and the guests. Management (except for the few – aren’t there always?) is wonderful – friendly, comforting, eager to help, and very knowledgeable with each department and job description. I worked as a seasonal worker and due to personal difficulties; I couldn’t take their offer at a part-time yearly position so for the few months I worked there it was exciting. All the workers are very friendly people, eager to help and eager to work – it was an ideal work setting. We would come in and our LOD (leader on duty) would assign us to a register and we would begin our work right away. The hardest part of the day would be the slow points – they were awful. You could clean, clean, and clean but it seemed there was only so much you could do because you had to stay somewhere near your register and when it was too slow there was sometimes only one or two so you were very restricted. Overall, Target was a wonderful company to work for."
good,"seriously LOVED working at Target. I started off as a cashier, promoted to a trainer after my probation period. Then, promoted to Guest Service after working at target for only 4 months. After that the job advancement stopped (wasn't expecting to be a manager or anything) but it seems to me that you need to know someone that's a Executive team lead, GSA, GSTL, or team lead or have a certain look. My GSA's & GSTL's were AMAZING though. Very flexible when it came to scheduling. Benefits were GREAT. I was full time and paid for the premium dental care ($10) out of my paycheck. I didn't really like how the vision worked though because it didn't exactly seem right. I was paid every other week."
good,"Loved being a part of the team, they listened to us. Learned many skills. Wish they paid more for your experience. I did not have to work weekends, made it nice to spend time with family."
good,"Guest services is very fulfilling. Always something to do. Answering phone, customer resolution, return/purchase item for customers/employees, sorting items to be put back in proper areas. Learn how to manage different areas in store. All my co-workers were great to work with, like a big family. Hardest part of my job was leaving cause of pay rate wasn't competitive. The most enjoyable part was making a customer happy."
good,I was a seasonal worker in the Christmas tree lot and home goods. I liked my immediate supervisor and the other workers. I only earned minimum wage but what can you expect in retail. They were flexible with my school schedule.
good,"Target doesn't offer benefits to its employees other than higher ups and a universal employee discount. However, it was a fun place to work."
good,"While working at Target Distribution, I was compensated well, knew my responsibilities, and enjoyed working as part of a team. Unfortunately, a few members of management became hostile. Overall, great place to work."
good,"My time with Target was a positive experience."
good,"- A typical day at work is almost always busy but rarely that crazy busy that you tend to hear a lot"
good,"Great work place and experience. Management was very good. Everyone got along okay, very busy and energetic. I experienced how to deal with costumers and attend them well under pressure."
good,Target is a great company to work for. Many opportunities to move in different directions. The culture is very diverse and the team environment is inspiring.
good,"-A typical day at work would be challenging yourself to push your team to grow within themselves and giving them the ability to want to learn more in the company."
good,Target cares about its team members and in a retail environment does its best to give a work life balance to all its company.
good,I enjoyed working at Target and I enjoyed having this opportunity. Decent training when I started this job so i knew exactly what was expected of me.
good,"A typical day at work is fast, fun and friendly. Some days aren't as such. I've learnt to always smile no matter your situation, it eases a tense mind and chaos. The management at my job is stable. They're always doing their job and more and always assure their employees satisfaction. Some cases there's a lack of recognition. My co-workers are great people to work with, but of course, I tend to get along with everyone. The hardest part of my job may be when a guest is very unhappy and you're trying your best to satisfy their need. They may rant and holler at you but that's where the customer service skills play a role. I always smile and breathe softly, listening thorough to their concern and executing promptly. The most enjoyable part of my job is when your hard work and dedication may go noticed by the managers and also including making guests happy and smile."
good,Another job given to me by my high school for the summer. It was great while it lasted (2 months). Staff was wonderful . Pay was minimum wage so nothing much there to talk about.
good,"The management is awesome, love my team members. Best part of the job is the Guests & the worst part of the job is the Guests. Hardest part is trying to keep lines short"
good,Everyday would be different depending on the day of the week. I learned how to be more responsible. I also learn how to manage my job with my personal life. The hardest part would be an impatient guest. Though I did enjoy seeing satisfied guests. It was an overall great first job.
good,"The work was easy and the employees were easy to get along with. Management was also very easy to get along with, and they were very involved in employees well-being at the workplace."
good,A really good company with great people.  A great place to learn people skills and team work. Love the atmosphere and the diversity Target sets in place for the Guests and team members.
good,"work day at Target is its always busy, working in the front in its always busy. I have learned that being in customer service you come across some really rude people, and that's the hard part at times. because some people walk up to you very nasty, and that's what took me the longest getting use to. Now it don't bother me none. my coworkers love them, boss he is a cool guy to, not bad at all"
good,"Its a great place to work, everyone's great, the environment and the management, the only thing is, its so hard to move up in the corporate ladder. Ive been there two years and no raises or promotions were ever presented to me no matter how much i asked."
good,I'm a lead in logistics and even though it's a well paying job the hours are very difficult. The hours range from overnights (10pm - 7:30am) or regular hours (3am - 11am).
good,I had came to work one day and they need help on the front end and I had to do consumer service and I had never done it before so my team leader had to show me real quick how to do it and from there I had everything handle
good,"Target is a great place to get your feet on the ground running. Starting off as a cashier will get you started because it's the bottom of the food chain and you can't improve without knowing where it all starts."
good,"It was an ok place to work the pay was low, for what the job was. The people were nice. No one was treated differently. You got a nice little discount."
good,was my first temp job hated it at first grew to love it and acceded all expectations wish i was still there. what more can i say
good,"Each day is different from the last. Being a Target Guest Service member we help each guest that comes in for a return or exchange of their purchases. "
good,"The associates are good, and the benifits are great.  They really are good for college students and young kids. Not older people though.  The hardest job is around the hoildays.  Busy, busy, busy."
good,"There was not many parts of the overall retail world that I was not able to learn in the 7 years that I worked for Target. A typical day as an electronics team member was to get my keys and proceed back to the electronics department. Once there it would depend if you were the opener or the closer. Opener was responsible for turning on t.v.'s and checking locked pegs and other security measures. The closer would touch base with the opener and get caught up on what tasks were done and what still needed to be done. "
good,"Stocking the shelves and making the customers happy was rewarding,  My customer service skills improved.  Target was a great place to work."
good,"target was an excellent place to work. The employees were professional and courteous, but understanding and considerate. The pay was fair with the possibility of a promotion/raise"

good,"co-workers are not held accountable by management for their performance. good or bad. they do free lunch often, if you work on a holiday they usually do bbq or cater, random ice cream days or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches day. target/cvs pharmacy doesn't make sense. target guest standards are very high and cvs does not offer that, they are more dollar driven so customer service will be affected in my opinion"
good,I liked the job a lot it was fun to see the smiling faces very exciting to work fast and enjoy work and it was great to work with so many friendly people and the very happy nice and jolly customers each day.
good,Its a very busy and fast pace. I love my co-workers to death. We all get along with each other and we work as a team. The hours are long sometimes but the work gets done. The atmosphere in Target is nice and pleasant. The guest are wonderful and they just makes my day more nicer.

good,Target is a great place to work and grow your career. I fully enjoyed my time as an administrative assistant and took advantage of many opportunities to educate myself on in demand job skills and systems.
good,"A typical day was completing planograms anywhere in the store. One week you could be in Ladies Wear, the next week your in Toys so it pays to plan your workload and talk to other Team Leaders so they know in advance that you will be entering their department, they may be able to provide help or guidance if necessary."

good,Target has great work environment and all the co workers and managers make you feel very welcomed all the time. It was organized and nicely managed. Great work place.
good,When i started it was under a different manager. Some times we would be understaffed but will be required to do the same amount of work. It would get done but everyone would end up stressed and overworked and wasn't just a once in a month. more like 2-3 times per week. But other than that it was a good place to work.
good,Excellent company to work for in which everybody was made to feel part of an overall team effort and rapid business expansion soon led to a virtual monopoly position in the coach hire market which is still the case today. The Managing Director made time to treat every member of staff with respect and gave time to anybody wishing to talk with him on any subject and as a result gained their unswerving loyalty and reliability.
good,Fun to work with people even though most people don't even pull their own weight. Team Leaders are enjoyable and some don't pull their own weight and slack off.
good,It was a great job and loved the overnight hours. Constantly worked on feet unloading truck and restocking store. Typically not enough employees to meet the standards in desired window. But over all great place to work.
good,"I like it. It is steady work that keeps you busy and going. We are required to pull items hourly that were short on the sales floor and have them ready to be filled onto the floor. Also we were responsible for putting away any back stock from the floor and/or the truck shipments. Sometimes we are called to pull items that are not on the floor such as TV's and furniture for the customers. As a backroom member we used the electronic pallet jack, automated fork lifts, cherry pickers, and handled the trash and cardboard compactors."
good,"Great work environment, must be able to multitask and think fast. Great recognition program. Very open to working with your schedule"
good,"A typical day would include dealing with customers, doing inventory, assisting with customer service whenever needed."

They are expected to create and maintain a long-term relationship with the customers in order to achieve sales goals and represent the store in a positive manner while ensuring recurring business. They are also responsible for assisting customers with choices and help them locate them and provide information about the product in question.
good,"This is a very fast- paced job that I enjoyed, there were no long lines because as soon as it started to get crowded they called for back up. The managers always made sure you were well taken care of no matter what."
good,This job has been great and my District Manager has made this year a wonderful one for work! It is a great place to work if you love being around children and want to capture the best portraits possible to create memories for the family. The hardest part of the job is just getting though peak season!
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day was being able to make people feel good about their purchase, by complementing. Also providing stickers to children and putting smiles on their faces. The hardest part of my day was when I had to lift pizza pans in stacks to take or put away, they're pretty heavy."
good,Target was fun and exciting everyday it was something different to do and different people you will come in contact with

We also have job duties that we are assigned throughout the day, such as Return to Stocks, Printed hard copies and print hardcopies, Daily Que calls and Third Party calls."
good,I enjoyed working at Target. The people are friendly and helpful. Everyone collaborates to get the requirements done and at the very high level of quality.
good,"Employee's were nice to each other and did there jobs most of the time, great place to work. Managers could of did a little more by covering the emploee's to use the bathrooms so that they wouldnt have to hold there bladders for a long time."
good,"I love my job, I am just looking for of a responsibility. More Duties. Go to a school learn more about the company how it started, where it plan on being in 5-10 years."
good,Target was a fun place to work for a seasonal job. Management was willing to talk to their employees regularly and their HR was always open. The customers were also pretty decent. The only challenge is finding everything in the store so you can direct people properly.
good,"A typical day at work starts at 5:30am working from the outside of the Property to the inside of the Property from the littlest detail to the biggest detail. I learned a lot with up-keeping of 2 properties at the same time pluss much more. When it came to Management I answer direct to all Executives and District Personel. I had a great time with most co-workers while at work and made the best of it. The hardest part of the job was just not having enough hours in a dayto get ahead of my shcedule CM and PM.

good,"Target was a good job, the managers were all very nice and we're all helpful.The pay was reasonably well, I got a bit more than average."
good,"My typical day at work would include checking the E-mails and voicemail messages left over the evening and replying to them as soon as I could. After that I would get any deliveries out while serving customers and answering telephone calls. Then take the days challenges and events as they come. I've got to learn how to run a business effectively and efficiently, dealing with customers queries and requests as well as handling money and making sure invoices are paid in time. My management and co-workers have become my closest friends which allows us to work so much harder as we motivate each other. The most challenging part of my job would be remembering every specific detail of all the products. The most enjoyable part is dealing with customers and the satisfaction of knowing I've helped someone find what they were looking for and knowing they would be back."
good,"Environnement de travail super"
good,"While working for Target, I gained many different experiences and knowledge about a variety of things ranging from guest service, to putting the store together, to learning to communicate effectively with my co-workers along with guests. My co-workers and management really made it easy to go to work and enjoy my shift.

I learned working there you have to be quick on your toes and ready for almost any question that a guest may ask you. I love working with the different people there its very diverse and the people who are chosen to wok there is amazing.The hardest part of the job is letting the guest leave unsatisfied, you always want them to lwave wnting them to come back. The best part is seeing guest come back with more people. and getting good reviews from them as well."
good,"Target is a great company, unless you are working in a low volume store, i came from the city to the country and it's such a life changing experience. if i could go back to the city i would, but family comes first. overall great coworkers, some of them."
good,"Great Environment, worked on my own in the back room Reverse Logistics, learned a new Computer program SAP, worked well when dealing with Co-workers , the hardest part of the job was just not enough hours in the schedule to complete all tasks, the most enjoyable part of the job was processing all the returns and (in store) defectives...never knew what would be there,,, interesting."

good,On my regular workdays on the job I would be forced to make sure everything is nice and neat when I start because of the high volume of leftover items that were tossed at night by the other members. I would log-in on the time-clock and begin my shift as a sales cashier. Within a few minutes target would get some customers. in any time now I would be asked to do something else; cleanup a spill or stock frozen yogurt. Then with this would come a first fifteen minute break and then cart attendants. This is exactly how my day was like.

I learned the most being in HR for the last 10 years I worked there. Unfortunately life had other plans for me. I was a working mom from the time my son was 3 months. He was entering Senior year and I wanted to be a stay at home mom for the first time. I needed surgery on my ear, thankfully that went well and is no longer an issue. I had an Aunt in the hospital dying and I wanted to be there for that to support my mom. I like my co-workers, I liked the management team I worked with. The hardest part of the job... hard to say as it was a job I truly loved!"
good,Target was a great workplace that was very accommodating to college student.  The hardest part of the job was getting up early on the weekend and the best part was having three 15 minute breaks every work period.  The management let workers do their job and I learned how to delegate work with this job.

Most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with the guests."
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in to rush to a long line of thirsty/hungry guests' waiting to be served their food and beverages. I learned how to give great customer service while still managing to complete daily tasks working at a fast-pace. Management is excellent, many leads and ETL's are full of enthusiasm and charisma, always wanting you to work hard towards the goal for that day. Hardest part of the job on the salesfloor was finishing the task within a short amount of time due to the store being so busy while answering questions from guests, but I always finished what needed to be. On the starbucks side, the hardest part is closing the store which included cleaning and washing everything while being alone and attending to guests'. But I love a challenge and always manage to close with minutes still on the clock and everything clean with guests' satisfied."

Involved a lot of movement between responding for back up for cashiering, requests of the team lead and re-stocking the shelves. The hardest part of the job was knowing where every merchandise was located throughout the store but thankfully we had a PDA (Personal Data Assistant) that we were able to refer to for those times we don't know. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to participate in most positions of the store like electronics, planogramming/setting and guest services."

However as new management came things started to change drastically so I left because work started becoming stressful while dealing with my first year in college"
good,"I have learned team management, temperament, co workers are good to work with and I love what I do there."
good,"Target is an excellent company to work for. They provide their employees with breaks when needed and have excellent benefits. However, it does depend on your managers how fast you progress. And they are tough about their 90 day period."

good,Worked around my school schedule. Good hours and fun atmosphere. First learning experience with cashiering and handling money.
good,"Target was a great place for me to learn and develop my management skills over the past nine years.  A typical day at work was making sure that myself and the 200+ team members are taking care of our guests, and that the leadership team is taking care of our team."
good,"At Target, a typical day for me would be to distribute the funds from the safe to all tills throughout the store, check the restrooms, check all computer equipment for functions, provide change to the cashiers, cover breaks, lunches, and ensure the happy experience for the Target Guest shoppers.  I learned that the Target Guest loves a bargain, shopping for unique items and secret deals and coupons.  Management taught me how to serve our Guests in a manner that they could be confident shopping and have any dispute resolved with a smile and a caring attitude.  The hardest part of my job was lack of coverage in an area specific to food service or the internal Starbucks store when a worker was sick or unable to work without having a trained employee for coverage.  I enjoyed being around the Guests shopping, many of which were my friends and neighbors."
good,"Always meeting new people. Wonderful co workers, very flexible to work around schedule."
good,"My work schedule consisted of ordering, distributing, organizing, researching merchandise and processing orders with LRT/PDA equipment. Then sometimes loading freight onto trucks to deliver to offsite warehouse or other stores driving a 26 foot truck. Depending on the day I performed different tasks that included customer service pertaining to merchandise, research and removal of recalls, Help Desk troubleshooting and training new employees. Also assisting managers, supervisors, vendors and other employees with projects regarding their departments. I was also responsible for driving the trucks daily as well as the forklifts, Wave Riser and helping shipping and receiving with accepting and sending merchandise. What I learned most about my job was how to consistently be productive even while constantly multi-tasking and how to respect and treat my fellow employees with patience and understanding given the workload I had to deal with daily. The hardest part of my job was there was too much to do when I was always being sent to other locations in the store and to other outside warehouses. Learning how to manage my time and complete my tasks became invaluable to me in other aspects outside of work."
good,"Clock in,then report to the front lanes supervisor that shift."
good,"Aside from the great team member break room and generally long breaks given to allow you some form of a meal, Target does have niche groups. As happens with large amounts of people. So do try and avoid being in those. Other than that, the work is easy. The pay is standard of a entry level position."
good,"great job, good people, the management overall is good to the employees."
good,"A typical day at work is working with team members to ensure sales, floor, cash point, fitting rooms and stockrooms are clean and well maintained per company standard.  "

What I have learned from Target was so much that it helped me ready myself for other opportunities in the work area. I really love my co-workers and enjoyed every bit of training new employees. I highly recommend this job for anyone in school or college, especially if you are doing internships."
good,"A typical day at work was loading trucks.  I learned how to load a truck properly.  The co-workers were great to be around, it was a good enviornment.  The hardest part was loading boxes over 50 lbs."
good,"I had moved here during the winter and all the management team were extremely understanding about my not being able to drive to work in the snow (since where im from we get excited over a dusting, it was extremely hazardous to me and others to drive in 2 feet of it.) the whole team was really nice and helpful and i just absolutely loved it!"

good,"A typical day at Target is very productive and fun to work with a energize team of people. I've learned to have a can do attitude in what ever you do because you need to be resilient and adaptable to change and people. I'm am a Human Resource Manager and the management at Target is very knowledgeable about their job and come together as partners to meet goals. The hardest part of my job is my hourly team leaders to complete all tasks on a limited amount of payroll. When we are over in payroll we have to cut hours total store. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting deadlines, acting with a sense of urgency and developing my team. "
good,"A typical day at work was simple. I've learned team work among most things, along with how the store was being operated. The management are cool understanding people that works hard for both the company and workers ,co-workers cool people too. The hardest part of the job was honestly was leaving work ,the most enjoyable thing about work was that I was able to work there."
good,From the moment you enter those doors as a team member you are part of the Target Family. Everyone is super nice and will help you become the best team member you can be. 
good,"Overall, my experiences at Target helped to shape me into the employee/team member I am today.  Hungry for more knowledge and experience (the expectation is that if you've been in your position for a year or more, that you will begin to network and seek an experience on a different team), the passion to see projects through to a successful end, and appreciative for the tools to do so."
good,"loading and unloading trailers, learned how to work and use my time wisely, the management was ok, enjoyed working with a lot of the team members, the hardest part of the job was loading the trailers, the most enjoyable part of the job was working and being able to socializing with other team members"
good,"The nicest part of the job was the customers and the co-workers along with the management team. Everyone worked together, at times, to get a big task done. The best thing about the job was there was always somebody calling off so I was able to get plenty of hours :) The hardest part of the job were the times when I was pulled off my department to help out another department, and my department was not finished but somehow would always work out."
good,"I absolutely loved my time working for Target. It was for an unfortunate series of events that I had to depart the company. As long as your managers actually follow the book or uniformly enforce the policies, you'll be fine. I am definitely going to miss working for the company. There are many ways to advance throughout the company, and they will help you every step of the way to get there."
good,my very first job. nice place to start working and cool place to meet new friends. This job was not hard at all.
good,"Target is an awesome place to work and an even better teacher of business practice. Get a job here and you've made it! Leave and you become ""One of them!"""
good,"I worked here for 3 years, it seemed like I didn't stay in one area for very long. I wanted to be a revisions captain- but I was being pulled in so many directions and trying to make all the managers happy, that was probly the only downfall. you meet a lot of good people and make some good friendships, I loved unloading truck and working in the backroom-"
good,"My typical day would be ringing up customers orders, answering there questions about certain products."

My manage was awesome, always had a postive attitude! I got along with most of my co-workers, they were very helpful when I needed them. The hardest part was working holidays. My most enjoyable part was meeting new costumers and helping them find what they needed."
good,"A typical day at target consist of fun, friendly and fast service to the guest. all the mangers and employees are all friendly and hard workers. The hardest part of the job is when a guest is not pleased with the service.When the guest has had a good experience and leaves the store happy that's the most enjoyable part of the day."
good,Target is a great place to work in to gain experience in managing people.
good,"A rotina de trabalho é caracterizada por uma não rotina, porque trabalhamos com criação e inovação. Tenho aprendido muito principalmente sobre a capacidade de trabalhar com as ferramentas próprias de minha areá (Psicologia), adaptando estas a um novo cenário e uma outra realidade, ou seja, aprendi a ser mais flexível e dinâmica dentro dos limites da organização. A coordenação a qual sou subordinada é de bastante qualidade, permitindo que aprenda mais a cada dia, dando espaço para que colabore com meu conhecimento pratico pessoal, entretanto não temos uma gerencia que funciona do mesmo modo o que por vezes atrapalha o desenvolvimento de novos projetos. Cultivo bons relacionamentos de trabalho, tanto com minha equipe como os colaboradores que localizam-se em outro setor, acredito que esses é um dos pontos mais positivos da organização que mantem um clima organizacional bastante acolhedor e favorece a troca, formando uma rede de informações e fluxos de trabalho com qualidade. Como dificuldade vejo a ausência de crescimento dentro da empresa, que não possui um plano de cargos, promoções e salários bem delineado. O que torna agradável é estar imersa em algo que acredito, voltado para a segurança e a preservação da vida, e também dos bens naturais. Posso dizer que a TARGET Americas S.A trás ao mercado um novo gerenciamento não só de riscos no transito brasileiro, mas também outros modos de ver este que é um grande obstaculo cotidiano, reduzir os acidentes de transito."
good,The best part of this job was the smiles that the children provided when they accomplished something new.
good,it was exciting to work at target unloading the trucks and very friendly co workers.
good,"very busy. had to sell target cards and keep the numbers up for the store. fast , easy and hard workers."
good,This was the first job I ever had and I really appreciate the opportunity to be apart of the team for a solid two years. Normally I would come in say hello to everyone I saw or at least smile. Go see if I was definitely on the list to work and if I was I would go in the back and put my stuff on the ground. Target was the type of place I trusted and was able to even not lock my stuff up and not once was anything ever taken from me. The environment for the most part was very friendly and something new and exciting for me. The hardest part of my day would be right in the middle when you just dont want to stand up anymore but you do. The best part of the job is right in the beginning to see everyone that was gonna be working with you all night long. A very great transition into the working world.
good,"I enjoyed working for Target. It was a very fast paced environment and a very productive workplace. I answered questions for billing disputes, fraud and took about 50-100 calls per day inbound and outbound. My co-workers were very enjoyable to work with and also my managers were wonderful. I worked with word, excel and answered questions and wrote letters to the Better Business Bureau and the Attorney General's office on behalf of the customer."
good,"Assist guest with desired purchases. Conduct cash, check, and credit transactions with speed and accuracy. Stock supplies efficiently by pushing pallets of merchandise to sales floor, rotating dated items, stocking at correct temperature.

good,"Seasonal job that occurs every Christmas periods, i liked this job but it did not offers long term security."
good,"This was an overnight job where a team of about five spent nights cleaning , reorganizing, and restocking shelves during the holiday season. I learned how to organize and stay focused on a task. The managment leader was informative, encourging, and a lot of fun. My co-workers made staying up overnight really worth it. The hardest part of the job was staying awake! The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to organize and sort things, I really enjoyed that."
good,I went to work to organize and place the incoming merchandise onto the floor before the store opens.
good,"when I walk in i say hello to other co workers and guests. walk to Clearical to clock in. get all my equipment ( walkie and PDT, PDA)"
good,"warehouse stocker. Decent pay, hrs weren't too bad. Its a place that appreciates part time and full time employees. The management seemed okay at heart, just a little misdirected at times. A lot of times Target hires manager that have no actual experience in retail, so you have to go along with their misguided instructions until they discover that they're in error of the company's expectations. Having multiple bosses who weren't on the same page was a big problem, so help them communicate with one another, and your day will be"
good,"My days at work were some what slow, not many people come to Garden, but many pass thou to the parking lot, i loved opening and closeing Garden and feeding all the plants, zoning, making sure my department was in order, even though it was a short time because of the season, I enjoyed working with my co-workers, and helping others"
good,"along with Apple Bee's, Target had me doing many of task, so course my day stayed busy. with many of the responsibilities I had on my plate, I've learned how to keep every nice an neat, always having something going for yourself, and also hard work. Management was more on the strict side but also down to earth. Most of the co workers were college students ( as well as myself ) so I had a lot in common with most of the younger age that I worked with."
good,Target Apparel is a good place to work if you enjoy working with fun people. Most days arent too busy but you keep yourself occupied with stock and cleaning on top of helping customers. The management are nice people and the employees under them work hard.
good,"I come in at night, the truck comes with the warehouse. We unload the truck, restocked the shelves. I loved working with a team who is willing to well with each other"
good,Everyday we zoned the areas of the store. I worked in Ready to Wear as well as the jewelry attendant and cashier. All co workers got along for the most part. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with loss prevention. The most enjoyable part of the job was setting up end caps and putting out new stock.
good,Was a great place to work. However the income you recieve from them is in no way competitive with other stores around the area. The people however are like family. You couldnt ask for a better group of people to work with
good,i meet alot of good hard working people we were like a family..i learned alot working at target like how to use a pallet jack..how to stock all the boxes together so they dont fall..how to use the LRT gun to scan items and put them in there right place..how to read the tags on the shelves..and i was trained to be a back up cashier..i loved my job...

I am very well mannered and i treat every guest equaly. I make sure to keep my work sapce clean and neat. I also make sure that I have everything that i might possibly need. The hardest part of my job would be trying to keep everyone happy at once. The most enjoyab;e part of my job is when I get praised for a job well done.
good,"Target is a great place to work, it is very centralized so most advancement opportunities will be routed through HQ in Minneapolis Minnesota...."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team who is helpful. The hardest part of the job is when there is not enough people on the schedule for the amount of work that is expected to be done.
good,It was a very good job. I learned how to work with people. The management was understandable.

good,"Excellent company to work in, the employees who work on the floor are great and working with a team is valued. The management should try and see how it is to work with the regular folk so that some management can be changed according to the employees who make the store what it is. Other than that, I would love to work at a target again."
good,got a lot of overtime and larnd how to use an lrt gun.cool and fun work enviorment.
good,"target is a great place to work for any kind of person,whether you are in school have kids.etc.they are very flexible and the yearly raises aren't so bad."
good,"Working at the Target Corporation was a good experience. Working in the customer services was a good addition to my resume.

good,"I only worked at Target technically for about 6months but they were very kind caring and coordinating. I was coming off the mend after recovering from a major accident and 2 totally unrelated surgeries immediately after recovering. They were extremely helpful in acomodating dr. appts etc.. The training was a litte tough because of a language barrier which is fair. It happens, But they tried and I got the hang of things fairly quickly id say. Would I go back to target? Absolutely. Unfortunately I dont think they'd have me back because I was unable to correspond with them after an emergency admittance to the hospital for an extended period of time."
good,It was a good job but I wanted more hours. I had good coworkers who were very helpful. I find to like customer service mainly because I like the satisfaction of helping people.

good,Unload semi truck. Organize the product as it comes down the line. Take product to work floor and stack it for the customers when store opens. Stock every other product that is low so everything is full and visible for the people.

good,I worked in the care so we were kind of in our own area there with starbucks.  There is a lot to take care of and you are often by yourself. Team communication is a must.
good,The environment is amazing and the guests are really polite and interesting to talk to when I'm assisting them with their purchases of the day. I love the environment and my co worker. A typical day is usually busy around mid day and on but that is the kind of day I appreciate the most.
good,The hardest part of the job would have to be the customers sometimes some of them would come in a good mood and sometimes some of them wouldn't. When helping them you just had to keep your patience.

good,They didn’t inform me that i was going to be laid off. The management wasn’t always flexible with the fact that I attend college. Which is something I also have to focus on.

Communication throughout the workplace is great. Gaining retail experience while having better opportunities to succeed in what you do."
good,Target is great to work for. Everyone is friendly and helpful. The only issue is they hardly give you any hours. I get 9-10 hours a week if I'm lucky and I requested 15 on my application. But they work you during the hours you say you're available (with the exception of training).
good,"Target was a simple,busy,fun place to work."
good,"Co-workers are very supportive. As a seasonal employee I am being given opportunities across the store to engage with guests, learn stocking and merchandising protocols and help fulfill orders."

good,Target is a friendly atmosphere where employees are like family.  They employ seniors  and provide a stress free working environment for everyone to get the job done.
good,Target is a fast fun and friendly place to work mostly because that's the type of employee's that they hire.  I always tell people that Target hires personalities and not so much concerned with relevant work experience.

good,"No two days are the same but thats part of the fun! Its a faced paced retail environment where multitasking, proper planning and high standards are the name of the game! Above all the guests are our number 1 priority!"

good,I enjoyed my time working with the Target Corporation.  I received the necessary assistance that I needed in order to do my job effectively and in a timely manner.
good,It’s a great place overall to work and you learn your shifts quick. But the management sometimes is poor with the supervisors and managers and can get you confused. But overall it’s a great place to work in.
good,"I have learned many things working at target , however; one thing always bothered me. It was that target always had a way of giving promotions to certain people knowing that others had been working harder and longer there. I believe target has gone through a lot of favoritism in giving promotions, and people aren’t rewarded on their hard work."
good,"Target is friendly fun place to work for. Employee's are nice and management is always there to help. They have multiple positions to choose from ,like cashier to backroom"

good,"Target has grown, changed and evolved since I first started. And like any job, its demanding. Are you a go with the flow type of person? Or are you a person who quits when the going gets tough? You decide. I've been through a lot through the years. Different job duties. Different shifts. Different managers. Some good some bad. But overall, Target isnt bad. It's a great place to be. We're like family."
good,"Fun place to work. Team members including the management team are always eager to help each other.  Most sales floor team members work independently and it is just understood that they will get their tasks done with little direct supervision from managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is arriving at work knowing exactly what is expected and seeing the pile of work diminish through the day. The shoppers make the job challenging sometimes; they can be very rude. In fact, during Christmas shopping season I would give a surprise 10% discount to anyone who didn't yell at me. I left Target because I moved to a new town."
good,"I am a results-driven security professional who relies on team building, relationship management, data analysis to implement common-sense, iterative changes to decrease asset loss, improve internal protection measures, and improve company profitability."
good,a regular day at target will always be smooth. Every supervisor at the store always made sure everything is going alright. Working at Target helped me improve my costumer service skills.
good,"great workplace "
good,I loved working there. I was very good at my job and it was a great place to work. I would definitely recommend this job. Some personal issues at home caused me to leave but I would work there again in a heartbeat.
good,Great company with great benefits. Very stable company that continues to evolve which is crucial for today's retail environment.  Target offers  a fast pace work environment with no day the same as the other.
good,"work life balance is awesome for me, i really dont need to go into detail but somehiow indeed makes you so i guess ill write out a bit more infor for this overbearing site"
good,you'll meet some cool people and you'll have good time working there and they give you free food sometimes and cook outs but you'll get no bonus so yeah work hard and have fun
good,Really great place to work no matter how old you are. You learn how do interact with the customers after a while you will learn how to handle different situations within working in retail or grocery store.
good,"Over good for people beginning to start work, or re start to work again. have great customer service skills. VIBE with Guest. "
good,"I worked as an Assets Protection team member for about a year. It was a great experience and I'd recommend it to anyone starting out , especially if you're also going to school."
good,"Terrific place been here for almost three years and I love the family feel"
good,"Working here was great, employees "
good,I started at seasonal and they kept me on as a part time employee because of my work ethic. When I planned on switching jobs they offered me a team lead position and a raise. I still took the other job because it was only a 10 minute drive versus 30 minutes and it was the same pay that they were offering with the raise.
good,"I've worked at Target for two years, and it's been a good experience all around. Everyone that i work with is super nice and helpful, and everyone really functions like a team. I had my doubts at first when the training i received was a little inadequate, but once those awkward first couple weeks were over i really began to appreciate my job. Great guests, great team members, great pay. It's definitely one a the best jobs that i have had."
good,The people who work at target are kind and hardworking people. Target pays well and attempts to be as flexible as it can be. Target treats their employees fairly.
good,Fun place to work at. Really good staff and caring managers. Got along well with people. Requesting for days was easy and HRs are very understanding. I recommend for starting and dedicated employees
good,"I generally enjoyed my time at Target, I was there just seasonally for the Holidays in 2016. It was fast paced, I got along with my co-workers and managers."
good,"Consistently delivering on the exceptional value, quality and style that elevates Target as the premier retailer in a competitive global marketplace, this team uses intelligent and progressive business strategies to make the most of our resources and partnerships worldwide and works across product categories to create a localized shopping experience, both online and in store."
good,This was my first job while still in high school. They were always holding fun competitions to see who could sign people up for the most redcards and the atmosphere was always pleasant.
good,I didn't hate the job. It made me money and I went about my day. But as I started to become more vigilant of my coworkers.  I realized that they were not a good group of poeple.
good,"I would recommend working here, great work environment. Everyones very nice, they taught me alot about merchandising and customer service. I would like to work there again."
good,"Target is a great place to work. I enjoyed going to work, project management and work environment. Good management, they invest time in development and driving results"
good,"Nice place to work especially if you just need a part time job.  Management is good depending on which store you are at.  Had to work nights, weekends and holidays"
good,Target has a great team member atmosphere. The managers make sure the work is giving out fairly. They take action to make sure all team members concerns are taken care of. In return as a team member you want to put in a extra 10%.
good,"loved working for target and the managers there are super understanding."
good,It was OK decent money but not flexible at all with scheduling barely had any workers that could cover my shift they thought it was a crime if I was sick and not very fun
good,My experience at target was mediocre. The pay was as expected and the staff was great. The job itself was very tiring and boring but well worth it. They pay time-and-a-half on sundays and holidays!
good,Each location I had worked at was radically different when it came to management styles. It is really just a luck of the draw but for the most part the general work environment was fun and productive.
good,"Target as a overnight stocker wasn't a bad place to work. I actually enjoyed it. Its where I gained my retail experience that I didn't have before, it also helped me to become more goal oriented."
good,"When i came to work for this company. the big facility an heavy traffic of workers kind of scared me. Every team leader an worker made you feel comfortable. You wasn't rushed to learn a specific job,you were taught bye someone with patience. Overall i love the job."
good,Target Work is steady and consistent even in a changing retail atmosphere. The management teams can be highly political and often this creates problems for advancement. In my case it ended up being a major negative with personal attacks against fellow team leaders though this has been a rare thing for the company at large.
good,I have been working here for 3 years ever since I turned 16 and it has been the best choice I made. If you work on the sales floor as I do you have a lot of freedom to get your work done at your own pace.
good,I love target im a sales break out i like looking what new product we are gonna get its really nice to be able to work in a environment that is clean and full of learning new things every dat.
good,Was a great seasonal job. Very fun and fast paced. Would definitely recommend to high school or college kids. Especially since they offer benefits like paying for school.
good,Flexible scheduling nice employees I always was asked to stay later than scheduled left because I wasn’t getting any hours so I had to find something else
good,"Tiene buen ambiente se trabajo, los manager son agradables y los miembros de el equipo"
good,Loved working at Target! I would work there again in a heartbeat. I think the pay offered is good but could be better; I live in a higher COL area now than I did when I worked at Target last but would make the same at both stores. So high COL isn’t accounted for as it should be. Also not enough opportunities to relocate for employees who want to stay with the company. But overall a fantastic place to work! The work is challenging and changes every day.
good,I really enjoyed the work atmosphere. Everyone was a plesure to work with. Being my first job I was kind of nervous going in but everyone was real helpful.
good,"It was a great job, I was a seasonal team member hired on for a remodel and I learned a lot in that time. I feel like the skills I learned can be brought into future jobs in a positive way."
good,I only worked for target for a few months while in between jobs but I had a great experience! Management was always supportive and understanding when accommodating needs of others and it was a very welcoming environment.
good,Collaborative skills are necessary so all team members are on board with the current status of merchandise and customers. Can be a lack of top down communication to part-time employees.
good,"you have to be very friendly and need to know how to talk to the guest. Also, have to be informed with everything going on in the store helps better help guest."
good,A typical day at target is pretty busy. Working with the guest everyday you learn how to really talk about anything on the spot and answer about any questions. The management for target I would say is great. Every manager does their best everyday to make it a better place for the guest and employees. I like being at target because it is a good environment.
good,"It was a fun and productive job but, the management was horrible. Very few of the managers knew what was going on. The schedule was very inconsistent even for the managers. My job was very busy and kept me on my feet which I love."
good,"Worked at target for 3 years and upon having to relocate, I left to find new ventures, however, the joy I had working at target, I always want to go back and experience that happiness."
good,early morning are quite and fun later on in the afternoon is busy and your always on the move. mangers are very understanding. hardest part about the job is remembering the job is very where everything is.  The job is very to enjoyable.
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Target and working with my co-workers.  The best quality that Target in Cypress aspires is that they do not discriminate in race, age, nor gender."
good,This job was a good productive environment always something to do the job that makes you stay fit manager and co-workers always make you want to come back to work good job to keep
good,honestly the manager i had was rough around the edges but after working there for a while you get used to him and he was insanely funny i would definitely work there again but only if the hours werent so trashy
good,"Worked in produce. Recieving and disbursement of frozen, refrigerated, and dried goods. Different shifts were available. Managment cool. Lots of perks. Breakroom with vending and a free food option daily. Discount card given. 10%off every purchase for employee use only."
good,"The management was typical management, they get their bonuses based upon employees work, so that's all they care about. However, the work was challenging but fun, and my co-workers were an absolute pleasure to work with for the most part."
good,The company focused on customer care and at that time was less concerned with numbers and profit which likely lead them to eventually sell their pharmacies to CVS
good,"I had so much fun at work everyday. The management team is truly amazing. They are always willing to help any team member that needs the necessities in life. Food and such. "
good,Great place to work. Would recommend to anyone. They have great people working there and it is a fun environment. They allow you to relocate which was nice.
good,Super fast paced and extremely competitive with other retailers. Fast fun and friendly! Everyday a new learning expirence. Gives a lot of opportunity to grow and develop.
good,"Busy location. "
good,overall good workplace. some days busier than others. the managers are pretty consistent in certain areas of operation. and they are pretty flexible with work schedules for the most part
good,"All the good and bad that comes with retail with a slightly nicer paycheck than most.  Management was easy to get along with, though to be fair this target was a small-format store and very different from large-format."
good,Management and HR are very understanding. The environment is very friendly and helpful. Starbucks and Target Cafe have very supportive managers who are there as much as possible.
good,I was a temporary employee with the company understanding that my relocation to a new town was in my future. They worked well with my scheduled and gave me the opportunity to succeed and take the PTCB Exam to become certified.
good,A great place to work at. I enjoy going to work everyday because the atmosphere is so friendly and helpful. Everyone gets along with one another to make the workday go by smoothly.
good,"Target is a top-notch company to work for but I did not like the job of collecting on credit cards."
good,"Although the management is great and understanding, I cant help but to notice that there is not much room for advancement. Ive asked numerous times to be placed somewhere else and they always say okay but they never trained me."
good,"Made prepared pizzas, pasta, bread-sticks, chicken and other assorted menu items. I also greeted customers and took their orders, cashed them out. I also set up and broke down all things needed for the daily operations, cleaned up then closed."
good,My time at Target was an enjoyable one. All the team leaders and store managers were always willing to help other team members by assisting them and assisting them assisting guests to ensure sales and to meet goals. Everyone always carries a very positive energy that makes you feel comfortable at work.
good,"Be on time."
good,"Fast pace, good management, learned organization skills and computer backroom equipment hardest part of the job was finding space for bigger Freight enjoyed working in my own area getting 100% done"
good,The typical work day goes by quick because you are always doing your job or helping customers. The management are very helpful and understanding. Great workplace culture all of the employees are friendly. The hardest part of the job is just getting the little things that you learn together but that comes with repetition.
good,Great place to work I spent time with people who felt like family.  I will say their selling goals were a little much and they pushed us to push the customers but our job was selling so thats understandable. Overall I'd say its a 4 1/2 out of 5 place to work!
good,"this is a great opportunity for young people to get a job and make decent money, super flexible hours and is willing to work with your school schedule"
good,Best place to work as long as management change to either age appropriate or real people with families not just getting out of school or because of knowing someone.
good,Target is a Productive environment. Collaborative and Easy-Going. I would recommend coming to target and also working their. Most of the guests love the energy of the store and it’s operations.
good,"I loved Target just wish I went back there during this past holiday season. They offered me a job  in the new area I was in.  I wish I took it, besides holiday season in the Post Office. I would've had a job afterward."
good,"Target is on their way to $15.00/ hr by 2020. Positions range from entry level to six and seven figure salaries. If you're willing to put in the time and effort you can go extremely far. Great benefits, including medical, dental, vision, paid time off, 401k, and more."
good,It was a great experience working at Target.  I spent 3 years working there as a Cart Attendant/Cashier.  I left to pursue other interests. Target provided a healthy safe work environment
good,"Fantastic company, really motivated and enthusiastic manager's. Tough to keep hourly employee's but many of the core/longer term employee's were really great to work with."
good,"My work experience at Target was amazing, I loved all my co-workers and some members of management.  I only left because I was relocating and there were no position's available at the store in the area I was moving to for me to transfer."
good,I love working for target. The management is outstanding and they are very understanding. They are always willing to teach new skills to help employees learn and grow with the company.
good,there were a lot of chances to cross train in different departments.  oppurtunities to further education through programs offered.  Was able to move to different stores as relocating with husband's job
good,"A typical day would include...."
good,"Go in with a plan, being kind to everyone, and communicate well with both your team and other teams throughout the store. Know how to organize well and understand sales, advertising, and forecasting."
good,Friendly and happy coworkers. Most managers work with you with your hours and time off. Very honest and trustworthy HR manager. All over a worth while job.
good,It was an amazing place to work. The team members were very friendly and helpful. We are a team and rely on each other. It is an amazing environment!!
good,Working at target is a great learning experience for teens. They pay well for someone not paying for a house and it is fairly easy to work. they are really flexible with working areas.
good,Yes the job was alittle stressful but the customers made the day go by really quickly. Athouth some of the staff did work well toghether i did let it getin the way of me getting the job done
good,"Target was my first job as a senior in high school. It was one of my favorite places to work, and even as an adult I would consider working there again!"
good,Target was a great place to work in my opinion. There wasn't much drama and overall I never really felt that there were any sort of cliques being formed so most people were easy to talk to and work with.
good,A majority of the team leads and fellow team members were very kind and a great joy to work with. I definitely did not know what I was doing when I first started but they were very patient with me which I appreciate. They pay generously as well.
good,"I learned so much in the time that, i worked for Target. My supervisor encouraged  me to re-apply in March 2019. I worked on the sales floor, stocking new items in every department."
good,"working at target is wonderful, I would recommend this any teenager who is looking to start of their career. the managers are great, work environment is wonderful."
good,It was a nice and safe place to work at. The pay was really good and I enjoyed the work. The hours were fair and I enjoyed the work. I would recommend this job to my friends.
good,While working at target I handled cash everyday and helped customers with any questions they might have. Along with learning how to handle cash I also learned how to talk to people
good,In Target I Gained More Customers Service I Learned To Work In A Fast Paste Environment It Helped Me With Stocker Packing Aisles Interacting With Customers While Working On The Floor
good,"All supervisors were always encouraging and I was rewarded for meeting certain achievements.  When they use the term ""Team Members,"" not co-workers, they really mean it.  Every one is a Team."
good,Being able to get paid to watch sporting events and concerts is great.  Co-workers are awesome.  Flexible schedules.  Multiple ways to stay in touch with co-workers in case shift swaps are needed.
good,I loved it from the moment I was hired til the day my seasonal position was up. I wish I stayed longer but I now have the experience when applying for a new job
good,Gave their employees food and listen to their employees.  Very understanding and pay was well. The employees worked well together and comfortable work place.
good,"Very strenuous at times and challenging  shifting between sales floor work and cashiering."
good,"I would definitely recommend working here. The environment is great, the culture is amazing. The target I was working at for the season made me feel like family awesome place to work."
good,"Excellent experience if you want to know how retail works and learn from the very best.  Amazing culture, wonderful people, great talent and opportunities."
good,Target was a great first job.  The training was fairly good.  I learned many new skills in a supportive environment.  Good experience learning customer service.
good,"Enjoyed working at Target, and would recommend others work there. The hours are flexible and you can get cross trained in different departments. One problem is they can't offer you full time hours."
good,I enjoyed my time it was fun overall. A job always gets tough but the experience was definitely worth it. I had a good schedule and everything worked really well.
good,"Great job, easy to learn and a good working environment. The management was very fair and considerate.  At target the whole store works as a team and everyone is very helpful."
good,I love working at Target. The working environment is welcoming at the same time giving you a competitive way of working. The hardest part about working at target isn't a physical or mental requirement. But trying to work and survive on the limited hours they hand out.
good,Sometimes i enjoyed working here and at other times i completely hated it. the day tends to go by slow and some managers and shift managers get very annoyed or irritated with other team members.
good,"A typical working day at Target is usually really busy, or really slow. You'll need to be fast, calm, and able to work under pressure. Having awesome communication skills will REALLY help you in any position you get. From what I have gone through, you'll run in to situations to where you would ask for help to accomplish your task, so creating relationships would be a great help too."
good,Target was a good experience for me to work. I learned a lot about the point of sales system as well as mobile phones. Working at your own pace and collaborating with everyone was very pleasing .
good,"if you are lucky, the team you are with will become your family. A typical day was quite fun interacting with guests, making friendships with your coworkers while keeping the cafe clean. you learn a lot about how valuable being a team is, you develop work ethics and a great understanding of responsibility. The hardest part was busy days and staying positive with customers when you are absolutely exhausted. The most enjoyable is the work culture and finishing up your shift while having fun with your co-workers."
good,"My hourly wage was $12 for 2018, and $11 last year. I heard it’s going up. I was in the back room for the most part, and I loved it. My supervisor and manager were fantastic. They joked around a lot. They rarely got mad. It’s generally fast paced."
good,I worked in the backroom. I didn't deal with customers. I just pulled items that were needed on the floor. It was simple and easy. I enjoyed not having a boss on my case every minute of the shift.
good,Good working first job out of high school it was a good experience for me I was a stocker in the backroom than slowky transition to a stocker on the store floor
good,Some days can be more stressful than others but that’s every job. Being a hardlines team member I’m always busy and time passes by very quickly. There is plenty of room to grow in the company. Target offers flexible hours and the managers are very nice.
good,"Very good company to work for, many opportunities to pick up shifts and get more hours. Great pay for the job you are doing. no set schedule but make up for the rate of pay."
good,"A very accepting work environment for everyone, a great place to start working. Everyone was very friendly. The management was great and very good at coordinating with workers."
good,Everyone I worked with at Target made the job 10 times better. Everyone is so welcoming and will answer any question you have. Management was sometimes not the best at my location.
good,I have and still enjoy workimg for Target. They provide great training and gove you great advancement opportunities. You are treated as parr of a team to accomplish great reaults.
good,I like working at Target I just need to advance to a more steady work hours and secure a better pay check. Right now I am only working part time and would like to be able to work at a full time capacity.
good,"My store is wonderful: Good people, good management, and responsibilities are clearly defined with rising expectations for you to grow. "
good,"i would say my experience as a cashier at target was fun and educational on many levels that i use on the daily still today(time management,communication skills etc.) The hard part of the job was getting used to people rush everywhere( during christmas season). The most enjoyable part of the job was watching the customers walk away with a smile on their face."
good,"Flow team part time. During holiday seasons the hours were almost as many as you wanted. Asked almost daily if wanted to stay longer. Also, could pick up extra hours if willing to cross train and work other depaetments."
good,"the poway target is awesome its like a family but be prepared to work hard and you may be able to move to a different position. "
good,Target was a fast paced environment yet it was a fun place to work. My supervisors and managers were extremely nice and helped to make sure I was trained well.
good,"Target is a retail store that has a little bit of everything which means we get a lot of clientele looking for many different things. Knowing your store, your products, and how to guest service well is key to this job."
good,"Very relax workplace, good for either students or people looking for a job that provides 20-40 hours a week. Logistics process requires some physical labor and is more fast paced than the other positions in the store."
good,"Target is a great place to work. I learned many thing throughout my stay at Target. I learned how to take constructive criticism very well, and how to implement it into my everyday life. The management team worked very well together, and provided great coaching techniques. Never felt like they were complaining or harassing. Hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult guests. Some people would come shop with built up life problems and they would spill over onto Target. Although, the guests were also the most enjoyable part of my job. Providing great customer service and helping each and every guest was very fulfilling. Making others happy, is something I really enjoy doing."
good,"Easy going job, always have something to do, managers will really work with you on anything that you need, & the store is always lively, the work load isn’t but it is steady"
good,"While there was drama at times the overall atmosphere was nice. Great coworkers and managers. The customers were probably the worst part about the job, and the varying hours you get each week. "
good,"Everyone in the company is friendly and understanding. A typical day for me was stocking and zoning, being called up to ring when necessary, and helping quests. Hardest part of the job is just seasonal, the big rush on the floor for holidays and trying to stock at busy times of the day when also having to cover cashiers when it's too busy. Most enjoyable is all the events we have and break room goodies!"
good,When I worked at Target I loved working there. My only issue was that they didnt seem to understand how a complicated pregnancy caused by diabetes can have deadly consequences if not allowed to take care of it.
good,"The job was actually really fun. The staff were lovely and very friendly. I would clock in, put on my name badge, and go get the stock for the day to fill and refill my shelves in my specific area. I would also go up and help with cashiering if they were too full at the front."
good,It was super stressful because different managers gave you different instructions. And i felt like the managers should discuss things to be on the same page.
good,There is cross training opportunities and always something to do all across the store. Plus starbucks is in the building when you feel worn out. Transferring locations is not too big of a hassle either. Overall it really is a great place to work if you're willing to work hard.
good,Assisted optometrist with eye exams. Learned skills and information regarding the eyes and medical terminology. Assisted patients with ordering contacts and ordering glasses.
good,Target Pharmacy was a great place to learn and grow. They really cared for their employees and there was room for advancement if you wanted to do more.
good,Loved the Staff i got to work with we were like a Family. Front Store never understood that we were unable to help them with Front Store things because we were so busy.
good,target was a great place to work mainly because you weren't dealing with the same people all day especially as a cashier it was a new person every time someone stepped onto your line
good,"Target is an amazing company for young single people looking to accelerate their careers. There is so much energy in the building and opportunities to learn, grow, develop and advance. Typical days are stacked with meetings because of the amount of collaboration that needs to happen to execute a strategy. Systematically they are really advanced compared to working for a small company, but there are also a lot of layers that you need to go through to make decisions, get approvals, and move forward. Over the last few years, there have been several transformations and reorgs that caused a lot of setbacks in terms of processes, efficiencies, and role clarity which can be really frustrating at times. But, they compensate well and there are tons of perks and benefits associated with working for a giant, trendy retailer like Target. I have learned so much and feel as though the real life experience I have had at Target is worth more than an MBA."
good,"Thank you Target for being my first job! I enjoy my job at Target. I am grateful to my boss for exposing me to different roles played in the store. It allowed me to have my job and hours secured. I was able to help, wherever they needed help. Thank you Target!"
good,Target is a very competitive but yet friendly and safe place to work. It pays employees very well and they also offer great health and dental benefits. If you are looking for a job with advancement and growth target is the best choice for you
good,"Great place to work despite  one manger.."
good,"It was so much fun, i made friends easy. My co-workers were very nice to me, I wanted to work there because i LOVE target! It was so simple getting the job. I highly recommend this job!!"
good,Lliked to work with Target & recommend other people to join Target as well.Managment is good they understand your problems & try to help you with your working hous & shifts.Dont call out for your shift especially if your dept is short of team.Hardest part of my job was to deal with LOD as there was always some communication gap between us.Most enjoyable part was to meet & greet & helping guest.
good,"Overall a fun workplace. Also competitive and a learning experience, also the pizza was good always had the best lunch. Always had a good schedule and nice crew to work with"
good,"A normal day at work would start with me and my team coming in at around 2:00 am. We would see what needs to be rearranged around the store and we would fix it for the remodel. Sections of items were taken out as new ones were added in. We put displays and decorations for holidays like Halloween and Christmas. When the remodel was finished we were trained in back-stocking, shipping, pulling batches for the stocking crew and price change. The hardest part of the jobs and time management. You need to work fast so you can move on to your next task."
good,"It's a great place to work, I fully recommend Target as one of the best places to work, great people, nice loving attitudes, and fully supportive teamwork."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target for the holiday season. It was fast paced & management was great! I really appreciated the flexible scheduling as well. I would recommend job seekers to go there for work, they even hire people with no experience."
good,"It was always an interesting day when I was working there, everyone was super friendly and the guests were always nice to talk to. So it was an overall great experience."
good,It’s good workplace and I would recommend it to anyone who likes these type of work because the management first of all was good and work continued nicely and easily right after
good,Target Management in my opinion was a joy to work for .They always would listen if you had concerns . My co-workers  always  worked together . And we trusted each other to finish the job we were assinged to do.
good,"I wish I could still be at target. Unfortunately I had to move further away and it didn’t make sense for me to keep driving a 40 minute way when I wasn’t making that much. In my near year that I spent with the company I can say that the management was great, the people I worked for and with were equally as good. Target was a nice place to work with people that knew how to have fun and get their jobs done"
good,"Fact Pace, Good environment to be in, Greeting  all types of people. enjoyable part of the job is operating machines, Rewarded for making card sales. Fun"
good,target is a good place to work alot of good people with good attitudes & the pay is also good. there good on security u cant make it out of target stealing anythang.
good,Meeting people who you are living around everyday and never knew they were that special until you meet them an actually conversate to see that you all have some things in common. Hardest part was having those who are in charge of you think too much of being in charge as if they are CEO. Most enjoyable giving all kids stickers and meeting babies.
good,"Day of Target was fast-paced with everything you do to keep the department stocked. Employees very friendly, management nice and requested that you do your job to the best of your abilities."
good,Target was great to me.  They have programs to develop and encourage growth within the company.  I have been given many new an exciting positions over the years.
good,durning a 8 hour work day. lots of heavy lifting and helping people. during the night shift picking up the store and make in look shapable for guest. most enjoyable part is knowing you got something completed
good,"I enjoyed working at target fun place to work, wonderful associates and good management. Great team work, friendly customers. Good working environment."
good,"If you are able to do a lot of lifting daily the job is fine.  Or if you are able to be on your feet the entire day, it would be fine also.  A lot of changes in a short amount of time"
good,I like the poeple I work for have fun and we all work hard on the flow team a lot or work the flow team did manager are great and we all get the work done when we need to get it all done
good,Target is a fun place to work however I don't recommend it long-term. Management is good about keeping up moral however burnout is quick especially following the busy holiday season.
good,It was a great work place & would definitely recommend employment there. There were some problems I had there with other employees but nothing to serious to turn me away.
good,Target was my first real job during and after high school. It was a great experience interacting with customers on a day to day basis. You learn a lot about the important of customer service.
good,Target is good at being flexible with  their scheduling. Team work is a plus. They provide positive input and recognition to ensure your success at your job.
good,I worked at Target when I was younger left for different jobs but ended up coming back 10 years later and still love it. I love the team members and love what I do.
good,"Overall it was a great experience. I learned alot while working at Target, such as how to work with registers and be flexible going from working as a cashier & at guest services."
good,I scanned a lot of products and sold Target red cards.  I was the number one seller of Target red cards. I also worked in the returns department. I also gave change to the cashiers when needed.
good,I enjoyed working at target overall I did not enjoy the amount of disrespect involved.some managers would give mean looks and some employees and managers talk to you like you are stupid.it happened to me and some co workers.
good,Good company to work for if you don't want to work your way up to something else other than a Cashier. I worked with them for about a year and I was working on moving up. I spoke with the store director many times about transfering departments. My shift leads told her about the good work i was doing but they never let me move up. Overall me leaving was because i didn't feel heard.
good,"Working in AP was a great experience. The pay was fantastic as well. However, you will be working MANY hours for that pay. Back to school and the holidays will completely take over your life, though. All in all, it is a great place to test your ability to manage and divide time accordingly."
good,"The work culture at Target is phenomenal but as a retail store it was difficult to recover from the RED card credit card breach during the holidays and how certain customers viewed the decision for customers to use the restroom that they felt comfortable using rather then based on anatomical accuracy. I thought it was good for Target to help the LGBTQ community but in my conservative, narrow- minded town it was tough. When it was the Holidays the hours were great, but during the slow season it was competitive and hours were cut. There was a lot of favoritism among the management but everyone was helpful."
good,"Target's overall culture and commitment to it's employees and bettering the world is absolutely phenomenal.  This is by far the best large company I have ever had the pleasure of working for."
good,"Target promotes a team atmosphere between its employees. It is a fast-paced environment that focuses on goals for your departments. It has opportunity to advance and it promotes strong work ethic,"
good,"Target is a competitive place of employment , great bunch of people to work with. I love my job there. I am a very hard worker and everyone in that store sees that ! I am on time every shift, even early. Only 2 call off in 2 years. I see myself as a model employee.  You have to be friendly and outgoing and I am both ."
good,Target was a great company to work for. If i had it to do over i would have never left. it was the classic you think the grass is greener on the other side.
good,worked in many positions and many departments but it was fun hardest part was when i returned from being out sick and found out I had no hours available
good,"Target was an go get it job their was nice benefits very nice environment the folks were very polite and curisty the job was gud the shift was gud parking wasn""t bad get in and out would work their again"
good,The work environment was comfortable and energizing at the same time.   There were numerous opportunities for middle management to improve their people skills.
good,"This job was fun, got along with everybody. No bad complaints about working here. The only bad thing would be that this position was only for seasonal work only."
good,They are very  lenient when it comes to attendance. It was always busy in the food area. However sometimes a lack of trained coworkers made it hard. Always helped new people feel comfortable and encouraged improvement and a job well done.
good,I would love to work  there  again very caring managers and everyone was very welcoming and helpful when needed and the mamangment is very understanding
good,"Working at Target shows you many helpful skills to implicate at other places. They challenge you with different task and equipment so you are always prepared for the worse. If you are hardworking and dedicated, there are many ways to move on up. I would recommend to work there for a while and build experience."
good,I think target is a great company to work for and they do their best to care for all of their team members and make sure they are all treated equally.
good,Overall management was fair to employees and understanding. Not much room to grow in my experience going from a backroom working to cart attendant in the short months I was there. No set hours as well.
good,Overall great company to work for. You have flexible schedules and opportunity to cross train. It is great workimg with customers that are happy to shop there.
good,"Compared to other retail jobs, Target has shown great organization and continues to push their employees to better themselves. Everyday I feel that Target has caused me to better myself."
good,a typical day at work for me would be coming in and start pulling. i would pull the carts out the freezer and then go stock them on the shelves. at the end of the day i would zone
good,I have both advanced and stalled at Target but the atmosphere keeps me here. The fact that they currently have a minimum wage of $12 and plan to raise it to $15 by 2020 means they understand that employees matter. The managers try but are bound by the constraints of the corporate structure. They listen but their hands are often tied by the heirarchy of the system.
good,"Nice place to work; fast pace in the morning; day starts early at 6am. You get to learn all aspects of the store."
good,"Target is a nice place to work with a lot of hours to work that are flexible and many different positions that you can work in. It is a little hard to get trained in different areas and to get scheduled there consistently, but the management is very nice, so if you ever have a problem you can always work it out with them."
good,I loved my time at Target. I learned a lot about myself and also how to be patient with people. Every employee treats you like family so there was never a dull moment. Target does it right.
good,"A typical day at work was relaxed for the most part but fast paced at the same time. The hardest part of the job was the hours. The most enjoyable part was the management and coworkers. I learned to use special tools I never knew how to use before, & I learned teamwork."
good,"Productive, I learned to balance work and life. Great management,  decent pay. Standing long hours was the hardest part most enjoyable was my interacting with team."
good,"I learned the role of being a successful Guest Service Associate.  I enjoyed learning the difference between online shopping and in-store shopping.  Online shopping is very convenient, and the guest gets first priority.  I also learned how to manage and operate self service food court.  Learned the correct procedures in prepping and handling food.  Overall, I was very sad when I left Target.  I would definitely return in the future, and I would also recommend it to others."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Target mostly because it had great pay for a job that was pretty easy. Don't get me wrong, it had its challenges. But I felt comfortable there and they accepted me as I was. I really appreciated the fundamentals and morals of the company."
good,This job taught me so much. One of the main things i learned was that customer service is key when you are working in a large retail environment like Target.
good,"a great way to start retail. You have Opportunties to move up, just ask. You get raises as well and feed back on performance. It is fast paced and always chaining. If you can work well with others and don't mind change, this is the place for you!"
good,I enjoyed my time with this company. I was provided lots of overtime which was hardly ever mandatory and always appreciated. I got along very well with my coworkers and liked the overall work environment.
good,"I found the employees very knowledgeable,the atmosphere very professional but fun. My work weeks were short. Overall it appeared that to be in management you could have a full time position."
good,"I come in early at 6 AM and leave around noon. A typical day invloves stckoing products and help out guests find what they need. The work schedule depends on a variety of factors: personal availability, the department you work in, and the willingness of other employees to work the hours you don't want to work."
good,Took inbound calls from target customers and assisted them with any issue they had on their account
good,working at target lets you intervene with customers in every department. management is nice and the hardest part for this job is remembering all the sku numbers. most enjoyable working with the people and helping everyone
good,"The company is a great place to work for, the only thing is the politics that goes on in some of the store but overall a good place to work for. It does a lot for the community thru volunteer events."
good,"I love working at target because of the discounts, cute options for home and clothes, and the ever changing designs and new products. But sometimes the managers are not worth dealing with. I believe target should be more selective with the higher up store managers."
good,I miss this job! The best I ever had! Amazing team and decent pay. Room to advance and cross train.  Busy and time flies by. Discounts and decent benefits
good,"A typical day at work was great. I greeted guest and helped guest."
good,its productive and participating copmany that helps alot of people to get the right job in the right field with proper salaries and locations in the middle east
good,"Target is a place to learn customer service. They give chances to anyone willing to work in the industry, it is not a job where you go and be lazy, you have to work. There is always room for advancing but you have to show that you are capable to do so."
good,"awesome pla, \ce to work, great benifets, most of everyone is friendly. I love theres a warm up exarsize be fore every shift. work hard ,staybusy. there great at working with you, as far as doc appointment and children, just  let them know ahead atime and all is well"
good,The day is usually very busy and require multi-tasking. There are several clinics nearby so a large percentage of prescriptions filled at this pharmacy are acute prescriptions.
good,Great combination of visionary leadership powered by cutting edge technology. They are transforming themselves from a old brick and mortar retail business to a hybrid model which is powered by latest in technology and vision.
good,"Helped do a variety of tasks around the store. Worked mainly in hard-lines, helping stock shelves, direct customers, and check inventory. Worked at the Nicollet Mall Target during construction, leading to working soft-lines (clothes), electronics, and as customer-help directing through the changes"
good,"I only worked here for a month, but it has been, by far, my favorite place of employment! I was a seasonal cashier, but I also had days that I worked in Softlines folding clothes. I also worked in electronics. Basically, wherever extra hands could be used. Usually, at night when things KIND OF slowed down. I say 'kind of' because even the ""slow"" times of the day require you to be quick on your feet & ready to work!"
good,"At target, they treat you well and they make sure things get done when needed. Target they will go above and beyond for their customers, its a wonderful environment, the managers are really nice and they are great about switching days or letting you cover someone else shift. love it."
good,i enjoy working at target a friendly environment. everyone knows each other we are so close we are like a family. unloading the truck and stocking the store
good,Working for target warehouse was a great opportunity. The pay was great and the hours were perfect. The training was horrible and discouraging tactics were used often. Overall it was an ok place to work.
good,I enjoy working for Target  . I just need more hours then thev offer  My manager and co workers are all great people to work with . We are given the ability to work independently.
good,Good place to work and try to advance. Haven't been working long was only seasonal. Good place to start out and try to go for advancements. Good luck .
good,"Working at target makes me want to go back to working retail ."
good,Working at Target has shown me how effectively a team can work together to complete a common goal. At Target we strive to succeed in the guests experience from the time the walk through the doors to when handed their receipt by a cashier and told have a nice day and please come and see us again. All of the management at Target are great human beings there is not one manager I would feel I could not come up to and talk to them about an issue I was having.
good,Worked here for about a year now in the food ave area and its been a great experience. Working in the cafe has changed a lot about myself and the guest. experience with target is great and all having discounts there and benefits.  For the downside the management is poor and needs improvement staff should have more opportunities in other areas.
good,I m hydrologist engineer able to adapt  for any work  condition. I used to be  a great engineer for most water and wastewater treatment plant company of Benin republic.I believed that my experiences should be fit most water and  environmental  company in the Unites States.At target i leaned more about logistic and waste treatment.th
good,I would be a cashier or customer service representative and I enjoyed it very much.  I learned a lot about the business and they helped me with how business runs while I was getting my business degree.  The hardest part of the job was during peak at Christmas and working more hours.  I enjoyed talking with the customers and working with all their needs.
good,"oh a slow day you would only get about a handful of customers that actually needed help, and most days where very non hectic, but being in a specific department of the store you have to know whats in the yours and the surrounding isles. electronics was easy to keep yourself busy.it was fun being apart of the target team"
good,"They pay well. Minimum wage at Target is now $11 per hour, but if you work at Starbuck or Food Ave minimum is $11.50. Employees get evaluated for a raise once a year. Employees have to take a 30 minute unpaid break and 15 minute paid break if you work 6 hours. Target hardly ever gives full time where I work unless you're a team lead or higher up position, especially since the raise on their minimum wage. They didn't give a drug test."
good,"Great place to work at, worked unloading truck so really early in the morning. They offer a good variety of daily hours. Just was hard to keep my work week up to 40 or above 30 hours a week."
good,"Target was great to work at but I was looking for more of a career. Pay is pretty good, and it is face paced so the day goes by fast. Very flexible hours great for students"
good,This was a great place to work! I absolutely loved all the team work and help available if you needed it. Only downfall was it's closing forcing everyone to find new jobs.
good,"Great place to work they really work with your schedule to accommodate  your home life, school, or other jobs! Employee discount is a plus! You get first hand at all clearance sales!!"
good,Great place to work and learn retail in an ever changing environment. Flexible in hours. Have had some great management and some that didn't last.  Love the company!
good,loading unloading trailers using forklift clamps pallet rider they will train you on every piece of equipment pay was excellent with incentive every year
good,"Target was a great place to work, good people and the work was not hard but fulfilling, the pay could be a little better for a big box retail store. The advancement process was to long as well"
good,"Fun, accepting open minded business that likes to work for its employees as much as the employees work for them. Kind staff, clean working conditions and an overall friendly place"
good,"Working at Target helped me learn a lot of valuable things, like dealing with guests, getting things done in a timely manner, and having a sort of pride in your work at the end of the day."
good,"As a young college student Target has been my longest kept job so far, and for good reason. My superiors at Target have always floored me with how much they genuinely care about their team, and likewise my coworkers have amazed me with how much they care about their work. Our team huddles and games do feel like give us all a chance to bond and to feel like the store is truly a team that is working towards something on a weekly basis. My favorite part of this job was that, if you were flexible, there was always something new to do! I also took pride in being able to help people every day and feel as if I was providing a quality service, however small it might be. I made people smile throughout the day, and that made me want to stay. "
good,"I have been working at Target part time (More than a year)"
good,The company filled a need in my life to have a good job and provide for my family.  I wish to have my Sunday free from work activities so I can better become involved with my church.  Work frequently interferes with what I would like to do with church in the retail industry.
good,Great dedication to guest needs. Team oriented place. Overall a good place to work for. Not a lot of associates sometimes so workload is harder at times.
good,I been at Target for 18 years.. I just need to find another job because I simply need a little more money right now. Working for Target has been a great experience for me.
good,"Every day is something new. I have learned everything there is to know from the ins and outs of guest servicing everyone I encounter to working store closing to make sure the store is at its best,"
good,"It was a wonderful, extraordinary first retail experience for me. The environment was a great learning opportunity as well. Looking into applying once more."
good,Target is a great place to have a first job I worked there part time in the summer before I started college. It was a fast paced job where there was always something to do a get done. One of the main pluses of working at target was the teamwork and how well the managers and shift leads got along with employees. All in all target was a great place to work.
good,"I would work the sales floor and I had fun interacting with customers. I helped them determine which product was the best buy for them. The management there is so helpful, if you had any questions, they would explain the answer thoroughly. The hardest part of the job was trying to complete specific tasks in a short amount of time. All of the team members were really nice to me."
good,"I signed a contract position at Target and got only one month of work which I was more than happy to attend. Each day I arrived for work the staff is always friendly and helpful, and welcoming. I really enjoyed the building and the organization was easy to navigate, even if they changed things. I worked sales floor, and some cashiering which I loved the most even though it's a bit pressuring. I loved the environment, the staff, the devices used to work and stay in touch. Transitioning to a much heavier items to push or stock on the shelves can get really heavy duty lifting and really tests your strength and endurance. It's good experience regardless. I loved working at Target!!"
good,"Typically, you clock in and go to work, they are good about staying on top of breaks and lunches, as a cashier and being stuck on a line, they definitely make sure you are relieved when you are in need of a break. The staff and guests are very pleasant to work with."
good,"A typical day at work includes  a lot exercise: I pick up customers orders throughout the store and package items to shipped. "
good,"The hardest part of my job is getting the computers to do what they need to . Sometimes the computers will shut down or freeze during a transaction . On a typical day I deal with about anywhere from 5 to about 75 customers a day . Between making sure that the guest is happy to calling target.com to get help with a return. Patience has to be learned in this line of work , remember to stay professional at all times, because you are representing your company."
good,"My time working with Target has been for the most part a positive experience.  I say this because you get a discount in the store, can get the 401k no matter how little hours you work."
good,Working at Target was like how everyone would think it would be- it was really fun and up beat and very busy when there was deals/sales. Target was my first retail job and it definitely was a good experience.
good,Working here they look for the following. You need to be fast fun and friendly and the rest they will train you on. Employees are welcoming. So just be you!
good,"A fun place to work, everyone was friendly and willing to help whenever they could. Team mentality is a big part of the job and helping others. Making sure the guest has a great experience is number one."
good,"I had moved to D.C. An this was my first job out of my state. It was a good job for me at the time, I was in school An the hours was great for my classes an help out with the payments"
good,Some other workers were doing what they want half the time but some of the team lead were very nice and doing what they suppose to I loved the cashier that work in front
good,"Target was my first place to work, so it holds a special place in my heart. It wasn't all a bad place. I enjoyed and wanted to go to work everyday there. I was only seasonal the first time around, but due to the tension against my mother, an employee of Target, I didn't get held onto. I returned six months later on July and was put in ""food avenue"". Here I worked for a while till I got sick. They were originally going to honor my sick days, but my mother got under their skin, and they back lashed against me for it, lost the job. The management are suppose to get some quota in, and I merely became a number. Great routines to follow, but a strict quota is imposed on the management."
good,"Hours fly by with the amount of work you’re given."
good,"This job taught me a lot about retail, the environment was positive and they supervisors were helpful. The hardest part of the job was the late hours we were required to work for the holidays"
good,"Target is a great job to start employment, especially for teenagers & young adults. Most days require the same work routine, which is simple and effective. You can learn many new skills and how to use new equipment and tools. Management is always constantly working with staff."
good,"Seasonal help is in demand, they pay, feed, and television during break what's not to love. The management is well, typical of retail...too young, makes poor judgment, and is condescending to employees."
good,"I have worked on the flow team for almost two and a half years. In my time, I've had three different leads. This was one issue with our team which was consistent leadership, but the great thing was that our team had veteran team members which were able to train the new team members. Our team was responsible for stocking and unloading our trucks in a timely manor, while also maintaining the merchandising of our store. "
good,"An average work shift at Target was always enjoyable. Depending on the shift you work, if it was a full shift (8 hours) the company provided generous amount of breaks throughout the shift. I learned how to be quick on my feet and collaborate with other team members when comparing different takes on the sales part of the job. The management was amazing. If you need a set schedule they make a way no matter what to make sure your needs are accommodated. The culture of the company i would describe as loyal. If personal issues start to get in the way of your work life, they go the extra mile to reach out to you and do anything they can do to help or fix the situation. The hardest part about the job would be being the right good judge of character. A role in the title i held involved meeting certain sales goals. In certain times, it became stressful not knowing how to approach some guests with the promotion, in a way it would better their savings and boost your job performance. The best part of the jobs was the recognition's. The company has such an interpersonal way of praising its employees."
good,I enjoy working here the pay is good management is very caring and they create a family kind of work environment. I like how they are very flexible with helping out students so that they can work and still manage their education on top of tuition reimbursement
good,folding sorting and fixing clothing in different areas. always busy working on go backs for myself and other team members and zoning areas. finger spacing racks.
good,Great place to work. Co workers and managers are very welcoming and helpful. Would recommend to anyone willing to put in the time. The job is very rewarding
good,You are always trying to do more with less. So we keep it upbeat and just get to it. The team is always trying to help eachother out and everyone that works thaere is nice.
good,"I loved working at Target. It was a great place to work at. Many great employees. Nice costumers. Good Hours, Flexible schedules. The management was very helpful."
good,I had personal reasons to leave the company otherwise I wouldn't have. Its a great company to work with good timings and your work life balance won't be disrupted.
good,The job was fairly easy i enjoyed the time i worked there staff was always helpful and kind . Manangemnt jad its ups and downs overall it was good vant complain to much .
good,a normal night is unloading the truck or trucks if there are 2 that night. Stocking the product after that is what takes time. Management is great. The workplace culture is varied in a great way. The hardest part is keeping up the proper pace so as to not be in an aisle for too long. Is is quite enjoyable once you know where everything is with ease.
good,It keeps me alert to my surroundings and able to focus on details I need to do. It has also helped me grow into a better person to help many other people save money and shop better.
good,Staff is friendly and helpful - great place for students and older workers -very flexible - nothing bad to say about company - only worked for holiday
good,Working at Target was a very relaxed experience for me. My managers down to co-workers all treated one another with the utmost respect. The hardest part of the job was the time shift that i had(Overnight/Graveyard). The most enjoyable part of my job was communicating with my fellow employees about everyday things and situations we dealt with working there. I found that to be a great tool to just speak and gather information from everyone to better our work experience during our time there.
good,"Everyone at Target was always nice and receiving towards everyone who worked there. If you needed help with something no one was ever going to turn you down. It's a fast paced job, lots of stacking of product on the shelves, lots of helping customers find items, cashiering and the like. Overall the job was good and fun."
good,Great company to work for because of the great communication that is provided by the management team. Volunteer opportunities are also provided by the company.
good,The people are great to work with and friendly. The employees respect each other for their hard work and responsibility to the job and their customers.
good,"I enjoyed working for Target considering I applied a few times and never got a call back, so when I got hired I was excited. Overall the work environment and everything was great."
good,"I loved working for target , just wished I could have held a full time position instead of part time. otherwise it is a great place to work specially for college students and high school students."
good,"Fast paced, never a dull moment. Fun and exciting, always learning something new.  Became a trainer, would think it would be better if trainers got some sort of compensation for the extra work."
good,"Target is a great place to work. They create a pretty friendly environment and make sure their employees are taken care of. I worked in the Starbucks on site so I wasn't on the floor. My only issue was that my supervisor was bad at scheduling hours and we had issues with people staying for long because it was so fast paced. Overall, cool place."
good,Target is a great place if in need of a part-time job. There is not much room for career advancement though. Pay is around the minimum wage and doesn't increase very much with the amount of time you've worked there.
good,"Target Panama City is a wonderful company to work for. I work as cashier, soft lines, and fitting room. With having multiple departments I never got tiered of being in one place for to long."
good,Target is a great company and I loved working there. The pay isn't that great and is one of the reasons why I no longer work there. Overall Target served its purpose
good,"Working at target is relaxing, though you have to constantly by standing on your feet, & greeting guests. Co-workers make the workday go faster. There's also some days where there's free food in the breakroom."
good,Target pushing for bridging the gap between leaders and their teams. Great overall experience within three different stores. They are brand centric and people focused and they shows in their stores.
good,if you like people than this is the place for you.  This was a great company to work for. customers get very colorful doing the holidays. It's been awhile since
good,"The working environment is always changing. "
good,Every day was a bit different. daily duties but the customer was first priority. You needed to help maintain the brand of Target so the guests would have a pleasant experience shopping there.
good,Throughout my years I've been at Target I have nothing but love for a place that showed me respect now it's time for me to get a better job that's all
good,"The staff was great. Fun to work with. Management team was fair and good to work for. Learned many tasks, not just cashiering. Enjoyed meeting lots of customers."
good,"A great place to work.  Management is flexible and provides growth opportunities to those seeking advancement.  Style and fashion has always made this company a trend-setter.  As a clothing merchandiser, I have been able to drive both sales and fashion and have developed a strong team that is able to be both productive and flexible."
good,"I learned that I can sell just about anything!!  I sold people on the Target cards, and was a cashier.  Management were very nice, and usually very helpful.  Target provided a very friendly work environment, people were happy to come to work."
good,Target is a great place to work when you are young and do not own a home or have large bills.  It is very fast paced and repetitive motions so its not great for your body.  I was happy to get the opportunity to cross train in multiple departments and learn to use different equipment and disciplines.
good,Working here is for someone who likes thing to move quickly.The managers are all very kind and enjoy helping you if you are lacking that day. Everyone works together and get things finished as a team
good,"I was a seasonal worker, so I really didn't get an opportunity to really be there lone. The short time I was there I enjoyed the atmosphere, workers, and being there."
good,"The job was fairly straight forward. Everyone took their breaks together, we worked together. If one person was struggling, the boss would work with them and encourage them. We had rotating task, If someone was on the truck and felt tired we would swap out with someone who had more energy which made work faster. The management also made sure to leave refreshments in the break room and show appreciation for their employees."
good,Loved itThe pay was the only problem it was a really low and then the promotions were only like 13 cents pay raise and the sore atmosphere is great everybody really helped out even the managers when needed
good,"A typical work day was being there by 6 in the morning to be there and unload the truck. After about an hour of unloading I was responsible for helping out stocking the shelves in an organized and timely manner. Management was good, I enjoyed working for mine while I was there. I would say the hardest part about the job was having to work up at 5 in the morning. For me, the best part about the job was being around the people on my team."
good,"Although it is a very fast paced job, once you find your rhythm it is a great place to work.The managers are caring and understanding as well as your team members"
good,"Back stocking, bringing stock from backroom to the store."
good,Good place to work however it was very physically and mentally draining for the location i worked at for 5 years. The store never kept a solid store manger for more than a year maybe two. Team members were very scarce. I was considered a veteran for making it 4 years. I started as a cart attendant barely making over minimum wage and it took me every bit of the five years i worked there to advance to management. Although i liked my job it was just too much work for so little money.
good,"The work can feel like a grind, but if you make good friends with your coworkers, it can be a lot of fun."
good,"I loved working there, the team was fun and friendly. We got our jobs done quickly. I wish I got paid more and got more hours but other than that it was a great job."
good,Started off as the Assets Protection Team Leader an moved 4 times during my tenure with each move resulting in a promotion. Company allowed leaders to try different approaches within their markets which allowed creativity and success.  That changed with a Senior leadership change at corporate an it became a cookie cutter approach to the business
good,"Easily one of best places I've worked, nice staff, managers were easy to work with, environment was very friendly and productive, flexible work schedule."
good,Target is a very competitive company. There are so many opportunities to be successful. I would definitely recommend Target as a place to build a lasting Carrier
good,"Working at Target was great, they had a great culture and made attempts to make working their more fun. The team was great as well and the merchandise was fun to go through. Jobs were very variable so each day wasn't the same monotonous stuff."
good,I really enjoy working at Target the management down to coworkers are all very friendly and helpful.  The work environment is lively and every day is different.  I enjoy interacting with the public and being helpful when needed by a guest.  The schedules are as much or as little as you require since you put the hours in that you can work and they will not go over that without consulting you.
good,"Autonomous work that can be stressful, but you do get opportunities to stand out and work on projects. Collaborating with your cross functional team is huge as well as prioritizing workload in order to meet deadlines. It's a young, trendy place to work with multiple opportunities to see celebrities speak or musicians perform during the work day which makes you feel like you're appreciated and makes it a fun company to work for. If I were to choose the best thing about working at Target, it would definitely be the people."

If i was not doing that then i was cashiering, answering phones or covering for the person in electronics. I learned the layout of Target from working here. The management here was amazing and they were always willing to help answer questions from both associates and customers. These managers got on the floor and helped the employees to stock the shelves. Target has an amazing workplace atmosphere where friendships are made and employees are cared about. The hardest part of me working here was how fast paced it was and how quickly you had to stock stuff. My most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people."

good,Great communication with supervisors and management. Very friendly workplace environment and a great learning experience. the most difficult part of this position was disposal of restaurant waste.  (cooking oil)
good,"Target is one of the most easiest, chill jobs I've ever had in my life. As long as the communication between the customer and worker is great then your day will go by so smoothly. The breaks are okay, sometimes you don't wanna take a lunch and 2 breaks depending on how long your shift is but you have to, but the pay was pretty good for me being a teenager."
good,"Target is a wonderful place to work. Management and team members all work together to get things done in a timely fashion.

It seemed like all the employees got a long well and it is such a good environment. I was a cashier, so I did pretty basic math and started conversations with customers. I also helped customers find things they needed."
good,Job is a great work place if there is room to grow and if you have job security. What I learned about this company is if manegment has a problem with you for some reason they will find a way to let you go. I did learn alot though about cooperate side.
good,"Inbound and outbound calls to customers in attempt to help bring their accounts current. I code accounts Bankrupt, Probate and Debt Consolidation. I also set accounts up on hardship programs and investigate errors that occurred and code accounts for other Departments to correct. "

good,"My time at Target was amazing because i got to meet new co workers, pay was good for my age, and for the most part a solid place to work. My typical day at work would would require retrieving and maintaining and being a back up cashier. Management was very good (for my store at least)."

good,"Management at my location are great to work for. They encourage their team members to be the best they can be and they encourage feedback from your position and any policy changes that are put in place.

good,"Besides the management, it was great and fun place to work. Only reason why I say management wasn't up to par is because they didn't hold the same standard to themselves as they did for the employees."
good,They have a great work culture and friendly staff.  Enjoyed my time there.  They restructured Assets protection 3 months in making my job a little out of my comfort zone.  I recommend it for retail not for security.

good,A typical day at work I come in at 3am with a positive attitude for my team to take on. We unload a truck anywhere from 1k-28k boxes in a certain time. Management/Executives are always willing to jump in and remove any road blocks any Team Lead may face in order to get to the common goal. The hardest part of the job is waking up so early and the most enjoyable part is being with my team leading and having a good time and getting the job done in a timely manner.
good,"Very great place to work with great pay. If they hire me again, I would definitely work there again for full-time however, not part-time. They have very friendly workers, it's just awesome."
good,I work at the fitting room/operator so I assist guest at the fitting room and answer the phones and direct caller to team memebers on the sales floor. I'm also responsible for foling and re hanging of clothes to the sales floor.

good,"While working part-time at Target Beerwah my duties included serving customers, both in store and on the phone, setting up and finalising lay-buys and tidying the store floor and the back dock."
good,"A typical flow shift began at 4:00 or 4:30 in the morning. Most scheduled shifts were 4-5 hours; however, if there was still merchandise to be stocked or backstock to be pulled, employees could opt to stay later. As a result, it was beneficial being able to leave at the shift's end if necessary, or stay later and collect extra hours. Target was also very fair regarding time off requests and availability changes. Here I learned more about inventory, backstock and the proper use of scanners and other devices used on the job. Nearly everybody on the flow team were close, which made the work more fun--even on the bad days. The hardest parts of this job were getting adjusted to every area of the store and their differences, and balancing the assisting of guests and stocking the merchandise quickly and effectively."
good,"Target is a great place for on the job training and getting your feet wet of you want to feel like you're making a difference. In one week I was trained in several different positions until they found the right one for me. "
good,Working with great co workers makes the day go by so Quickly!  Also seeing the guest come into work was also fun when you could help them out. Job was very easy
good,one good thing is that they do have set shifts in either 10 or 12 hour rotations. You are also well compensated for working said hours however when there is extra work to be done mandatory overtime can really cut into you person time.
good,Anwesome company to start a career with. A company that values it;s employees and team oriented culture that exercise teammates potentials. Various areas and departments for team members to grow and develope
good,If you want something fast paced with the same work every day but you engage with different people this is it for you! Management from my store believed in you and wanted you to succeed as long as you wanted to. The Guests were the most enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work means putting up the clothes that the opening team leaves, folding clothes that have been picked on, putting clothes where they belong and then zoned by brand and size. I have learned how to have more than two conversations at once. All the co-workers are great; we're a big family/team. We are encouraged and recognized when we do something well or go above expectations. The hardest part of the job actually isn't the job itself; however, it is the alternating shifts that mess with me. I don't know when to sleep and sometimes go days without seeing my family because our schedules are completely opposite. That would have to be the worst part for me."
good,"First job, had a great work environment. Managers and coworkers are great people, highly recommend it to others and encourage others to pursue this industry."
good,I believe that I had the greatest coworkers there. We worked hard together and had fun. The hours were not that bad. Peak season was as normal as any other distribution center
good,"Typical Day: Started off with clocking in, getting your equipment, and heading into the store. Bathrooms were to be checked and clean every hour, on the hour. After that you'd go by the Cashier's picking up discarded items known as ""go-backs"", along with clothes hangers. You'd clean up any spills that happened, while also taking any items out of their boxes to the guest service counter. You'd also take the trash out for the food places in the store, and worker areas. Lastly, you'd of course; Attend to the carts."

good,Good staff members. Clean work environment. Learned how to work a cashier. Being around customers made the day go buy faster.
good,Target is a great plAce to work.  But if you have a family with major responsibleties a regular target employees is not ideal.
good,"Target is a very decent place to work. They offer a very reasonable wage and have decent benefits like health insurance and 401K. The work is very physical and it be overwhelming at first but eventually you acclimate and get into a rhythm. The shifts are divided into either 10 or 12 hour days with 2 paid breaks. The people are generally easy to get a long with and many of the on shift supervisors are good with communication and helping resolve yours and the business needs. One downside is during the busy seasons they usually force mandatory overtime, meaning you will have to work an additional day or sometime two days, and it can stretch on for weeks or even months at a time."

good,"I really enjoyed working for Target, this was actually one of my favorite jobs. The environment was great co-workers and management. They were more like family."
good,"What I do at Target is take care of all calls, which I can either answer myself or transfer to the person or area in which the caller can be helped with better knowledge on that certain question. I also operate all fitting room tasks which include cleaning out the fitting room, making sure I watch merchandise that goes in and comes out. I hang everything back up in proper order and condition and when a whole rack is full, I am responsible that all reshop gets put back up and in an orderly fashion. Some days along with that, I have to zone any area they may give me, which may include men's department or intimates and active or all the above. Coworkers are very friendly and help if needed.

good,"Great management and also great employees. However, this particular location doesn't provide many opportunities to grow, the pay increases every year so that's a plus but many hours aren't given; you will need another job."
good,Lots of opps to volunteer and make a difference both at work and in the community. Days can kind of blend together depending on what job you're doing. Can be fun though.
good,empresa de panfletagemtrabalhava meio periodo muito bom so que o salario era muito pouco mas tirando isso a empresa muito boa
good,"I would salute Target, being a well known company I found my way and with a very helpful team I was able to put my skills and experience into work. Being my first job, they did a great job in paving and nurturing my skills and potential to my next opportunities later on in different fields. I am proud to have worked and being part of Target."
good,"Target cares a great deal for its employees and gives them ample opportunities to grow their career.  The compensation packages they offer are beyond competitive.  In exchange for the compensation and benefits, they do ask for a lot in return and have high expectations of their employees.  Their is a strong influence in committing to and ""buying-into"" the Target brand."

good,I really enjoyed this job. I loved working in the jewelry department as well as the fitting room. I love to organize and clean so this was perfect for me at the time. I helped prepare the store for the grand opening.
good,"Because I was trained in many different positions at Target, my typical day was starting out at the front cash registers, then moving back to the fitting rooms where I sorted clothes to go back out on shelves, ran the fitting room, and answered multi-line phones. Usually toward the end of my shift, I would go up to the front clerical office and assist the human resources team with various tasks (filing, data entry, assisting with payroll, pulling up and going through new-hire applications, fill out and hand out drug-screening paperwork to potential new-hires, etc.). I also worked on the salesfloor and in Lawn & Garden. I learned a great deal working at Target, such as , how to spot shoplifters (and other aspects of loss prevention), the retail hiring process, and most importantly, how to deliver exceptional customer service (even when the guest is screaming at you). I had a few supervisors, while working there, that had problems with their teams because of communication problems or just plain personality clashes, but overall the management team was wonderful. They would usually work with you if you had scheduling issues and were generally caring of their team members' well-being. I never had any personal problems with my co-workers (in actuality, I made a lot of good friends). The hardest part of the time I worked there was when I hurt my back on-the-job. Because of the extent of my injuries at the time, I was not able to work most aspects of most of the positions I was trained in. Because of this, I was kind of pushed out (not fired, not quit, just there but not there). My"
good,"Team I worked with was great. Everyone helped out where ever needed. I was held accountable for the electronics backroom. I learned how to get ready for Black Friday and Seasonal rush and inventory. The hardest part of my job was around seasonal time, making sure everything was stocked and back stocked. The most enjoyable was being my own ""boss"". My manager was able to not worry about me because I was goal oriented and pretty much always got my job done. Then I would help with the rest of the truck until we were done for the day."
good,Position offers various opportunities to assist guests and work in different areas of store. Many opportunities to use professional and personal skills.
good,"Apesar do dia de trabalho ser bem cheio e cansativo, tínhamos um bom ambiente de trabalho e ótima gerência para nos incentivar."
good,"Great environment, great supervisors and awesome team. We've always met the metrics for the sales and customer service."
good,Wonderful opportunity to learn and coach leadership and team work skills. Intern and college recruiting is a focus for every store.
good,"Working for Target is pretty fast pace. Everyone pretty much worked together in getting the job done, while still being fun and friendly with each other and our guests. My favorite part of any job is getting to know new people. I would say the most difficult part of the job was having to complete something in a certain amount of time. Especially when there are multiple things you need to complete. The best way to attack this is by time management and prioritizing with whats most important."
good,I have worked at Target on and off since 1984 in various capacities.  I enjoy the flexibility that this job and company provides to families and young people as well.
good,The managers are great!  I worked here for for Christmas and stayed for a year.  If it had not been for a grouchy husband I would have stayed.  They are amazing to work with.  And the co-workers are such great people they all do a lot of charity things together.  Really a special place to work.
good,"I love being a in store Human Resources team member at Target, working for the team members helping the team out to make a better work place is what I love to do."
good,"Great place to work, always something to do. Management is great and understanding. Employees differ. However health benefits are only available to full time employees."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting customers and working at the cash register. At Target, I have learned that it is a job that is well-suited for students. I was satisfied with the management. My coworkers were very nice. There was nothing really difficult about this job. The most enjoyable part about this job was getting along with everybody which this encouraged all of us to dedicate to team work."
good,"store was always crowded to capacity. workers were always angry to come to work due to the long lines, and children running around the store unsupervised."
good,"I was an overnight stocker while a remodel was going on and my shift was 11pm-7am. My co-workers is really what made this job so fun. It also wasn't hard at all. Had to stock, move items from one store to another, clean area you worked in etc."
good,"My experience with Target has been far superior than previous retail jobs. Your discount is fantastic and aside from gift cards, isn't restrictive. You can even receive vacation hours as a part time employee (based on average hours worked). The management is in most cases, reliable and when you need certain time off, it's generally not too hard to get. "
good,"Target was a very cool place to work with a good work environment. i would love to work corporate with target. i worked over night with flow team. we basically unload the truck, separate the boxes and make pallets and then restock the store."
good,Very inviting and fast past team working productively to get the days truck unloaded and stocked on the shelves hardest part is get repacks don in a timely matter some days they are light and most days they are heavy just depending on the size of the truck
good,"Being my second retail experience, it was one of the most fun jobs I ever had, the flow was fantastic and I made some great friends out of my coworkers there. Sure customers can be a pain sometimes, but the overall experience becomes better once you're given the OK to work in other areas of the store. I highly recommend working at this very specific location."
good,"Very friendly and helpful coworkers. Management is great at making things understood, answering questions and working with you. Flexible scheduling."
good,Good look into the international SCM business in China. Got a good understanding of what is required in the SCM industry and how Target sources product from China
good,Target is a wonderful place to work. You are constantly busy and always helping guests. Team members make the work day enjoyable. Team leaders always strive to improve the team. Hardest part is working with upset guests. Most enjoyable part is the relationships you build with your team members
good,I worked there for 6 years.  The problem was I would have to work every weekend. People were fun to work with. Managers were awesome.
good,"Working with Target has proven to be a very challenging experience, but also very rewarding. You will lead a group of individuals straight out of college, and you will be challenged on a personal and professional level daily. Financially, Target takes good care of you with pay and benefits, but your days can be long and tiresome."
good,"Being a cashier and working with the general public was demeaning due to rude guests, however jobs on the sales floor were much better."
good,Great part time job and very flexible with hours. Helpful time members and a great work environment. Great work experience.
good,The whole time I worked at target it was like I was never actually working. I was always having fun. My co-workers were a joy to be around and the management was very pleasurable.
good,Free food and pop every week either from the store or catered in. Challenges to win gift cards. They are also very understanding if an emergency pops up.
good,I would wake up at 5:00 and get there by 5:30 to set up the lines nitrogen and oil for the shocks. I would help assemble the shocks and would help out in various positions that needed assistance. Eventually I moved into a higher position and would test the shocks before they were sent out to the customers and then I would find the defaults and fix the problems and fix them and send them to packaging to send them out. The hardest part of my job was the managers or the head techs because they had no respect for any of the workers.
good,For the short period I worked here. It was great. On breaks time they always had snacks in case your didn't have a lunch. It was nice.
good,The company culture is very inclusive in nature and every individual is valued. The main challenge working here is the red tape around any new ideas to be implemented
good,I worked here for a few months during the holidays. I was primarily a cashier but would also help with stocking when needed. This was my first Black Friday in retail. It was definitely a unique experience in my life.
good,"worked there from day one, until it closed. Truly the best Job I ever had. If they returned to Canada I would go back asap."
good,I have truly enjoyed working at Target.  I have had the opportunity to work in many different areas across the enterprise which has made my career rewarding.
good,Working for Target was really fun! Every day I got to work with cool people with great personalities. A typical day for me was stocking the back room.
good,"A weekend at target is really busy depending n the area the store is in, you have to be a fast learning because the training process is a 3 hours and then your on your own."
good,Target likes to emphasize teamwork.  I don't think i'll ever see such a well oiled machine except from people who have worked together for 5+ years.
good,I enjoy all the co-workers around the job and everything was fun and everybody got along with each other. There was nothing really hard about working at Target. It was simple and easy.
good,Put away stock from backroom.  Keep sales floor clean and make sure all stock is put away in the right location.  Assist in any department that needs help.  The management and co-workers are always there if have a question.  Interact with a lot of people.
good,"Awesome work environment, great management and employee's. Fun work space, always had snacks in the break room. Always had little celebrations, if you will, when the number of red cards was reached. I moved and am not to fond of retail, however I would definitely recommend working here."
good,"excellent place to work,knowledgeable team leaders,start of the day was 4am which gave employees an additional dollar an hour up to the opening of the store at 8am. The work day usually ended at lunch. On non scheduled days your were able to call in to request additional hours"
good,I loved the work it was busy and fun most of the over night managers rocked and didn't act like they couldn't help out when it was needed.  And it helped me pay for my last year of college It was great.
good,"Because we work overnight target tries to make us as comfortable as possible by having chip day, or popcorn day, they have coffee for us all the time and we also go outside in the back to play basketball of course when its nice outside. I love my team members and with me transiting from the floor to the backroom they welcomed me with open arms."
good,Great company for retail but could focus a little more on work life balance. Great personal and great place to begin your business career.
good,This company promotes a great positive culture with forward thinking employees. Target offers a competitive salary and is always looking to improve their processes. They have a progressive style looking to stay on top of the retail market.
good,"I loved it! but I had to move! Fun, productive, team setting! Nice benefits if your single with no children! good pay with yearly bonuses, hardest part is closing and the late hours!"
good,TARGET is great place to work. co workers are nice management is ok. typical work hours are 8. somtimes cut hours during summer. more hours during the holiday. fast pace.
good,I normally work day for me is like starting in one department and end up all over the store. Covering different people breaks in areas I've been trained in or jumping on for back-up when the store get a little crowed with guest.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves, cleaning aisles, assisting guests, working the cash register and answering phones."
good,"Perfected how to work and thrive in a collaborative environment."
good,"My job at target is a cashier, Being  a cashier a target has been one of the funniest jobs I've ever had the people there are very friendly and I love being around my employees. The culture there is also great that's one of the reasons I've been at target this long."
good,the hardest part of the job at times is standing up all day but it be worth it in the end. my co workers were very nice people love working with them. i love meeting the customers that came through my line.
good,"Working for a retail company for over 7 years has really taught me how important the trust and your relationship with customers is very important. If you are able to understand everything that your customer is wanting, then you will be successful in gaining their trust in you and in the company."
good,its a nice clean work environment.  teaches you how to be more professional to guest/customers. work is pretty basic but also enjoyable. good in between job.
good,"Very enjoyable, great team members, very open on scheduling needs, some advancement opportunities with hard work. Good policies and ethics, good benefits."
good,"Only negative thing I have to say from working at Target is I didn't like the hours I worked, they were constantly fluctuating and I was given less than 32 hours a week. Plus they don't hire anyone besides management as a full time employee."
good,"You work long hours, but you are well compensated for your work. If you show good work ethic you will receive a promotion. Good working environment."
good,"Fast paced with continued teach, training and development of my team.   Its always about people and connecting with them as I develop great leaders.  Strategic and innovative as  we maneuver through difficult situations."
good,"I was able to work here and go to the University of North Alabama. They prioritize working around your school schedule, so that the employee can make it to all of their classes. The pay is above what the average job is willing to pay. This gives the management the ability to pick and choose who they want on their team. If you don't work hard the entire time that you are there, they will find someone that will."
good,"Loved my time at Target, but the paid was not up to the standard where I could support myself."
good,"Fui funcionário da TARGET durante quatro anos, sou muito feliz por ter trabalhando em uma CIA tão especial como ela. Empresa que sempre valorizou o colaborador e proporcionou oportunidades de crescimento para aqueles que se destacavam. Tive a oportunidade de trabalhar dois anos como Analista de Acidentes, no setor de Emergência e mais dois anos como Coordenador de SGI, após promoção. Nos últimos anos antes de sair da empresa, fiquei um tanto decepcionado, pois a empresa começou a priorizar apenas os serviços... lucros.. e esqueceu dos funcionários, foi perdendo a essência e o carinho que tinha pelos seus colaboradores. A situação piorou quando mudaram a gestora do RH, uma profissional sem carinho, e sem profissionalismo diante os colaboradores da TARGET, impressionantemente ele conseguiu a inimizade de pelo menos 85% dos colaboradores, até hoje ouço conversas maldizentes dessa profissional, que infelizmente conseguiu destruir toda harmonia que havia na CIA. Sinto muito pela situação da TARGET hoje em dia. Não conheço mas nenhum funcionário que esta lá por amor."
good,"Photo's of new babies, special birthdays, great vacations, great people, I saw them all.  My job was to make these pictures look great.  Cropped, brightened  colors, zoomed in on something great to needed to been seen. A special smile. Customers were happy, and they looked to be great photographers with a little help from us.."
good,Working at target was short but it was a lot of fun for my first and only job I had been applying there again and again but yet still haven't gotten hired
good,"A typical day working at Target was so enjoyable. When we got there we clocked in and look at our register assignment before stepping on the floor, which helped us out a lot. Then we would just begin checking out and greeting the guest. It was simple and enjoyable."
good,"Target Welland really had a great team culture, management seemed to genuinely care about all team members, and wanted the best for all of us."
good,Always helping one another we were a good team. You get to meet new people built a positive and trust environment. Always trying to make the best out of the day weather if it was a good or a bad day.
good,"As a Zoner had to keep my area clean and stocked and provide costumers services work with other team members also help to keep their areas clean if needed help and also was a cashier, when they needed back up cashiers i would always respond to the call, make the store line run smother. Team Leaders would always come around and let you know what need to be done in our area or if you area was good,"
good,"when you started a shift your supervisor would come and tell everyone what was on the agenda for the shift . easy going , our supervisors were always easy going as long as our tasks were completed, i mainly loved about target that everyone was always easy going , motivational and acted like a team 100 percent of the time"
good,"My day would start with walking the floor, checking for go backs, scanning any outs, and properly stocking the shelves and preparing the store for customers to shop. Working at Target was a really great experience, i was able to learn something new everyday."
good,A typical night at work for me consists of my team and myself unloading shipment in order to prepare to stock the store for the next morning.
good,"Customer service, cashier, replinishment. Great co-workers and management. Very fun place to work. We had lots of contests to raise money for charity."
good,"busy day lots of customers . learned to super  zone which meant to re-fold or collect item left by guests in the store , the management was difficult because having so many people to report to was a bit  hard to keep up with the hardest part about the job was not the item for the guest but we would always call other stores around the area that they would be interest in going to and purchase the item , the most enjoyable part was the atmosphere created by the people i had to work with it was never a boring day"
good,a typical work day at Target starts with figuring out what section or in and then going to the back to get your items that need to be returned. I've learned how to deal with customers on a personable level. Hardest part was Black Friday with the fast pace and crowded store.
good,I had trouble with a past supervisor who is no longer there but other then that great place and awesome team environment. Fast fun and friendly is their motto and they really stick by it. All TLs are very easy to talk with.
good,"Assist co workers in different departments to restock all shelves, re-shop merchandise not purchased, etc. I learned their is a lot into running a big corporation. The management was wonderful with all co workers. The hardest part of the job was some of the merchandise off the truck that was delivered broken already in which he had to fill out all the proper documentation for lost or damaged merchandise. The most enjoyable were all the different things I got to assist with putting together for the customers to enjoy."
good,"A typical day consisted of greeting, managing area, assisting customer issues, answering phones, and processing payments and returns. I learned better problem solving skills. Management was helpful and efficient when needed. My coworkers were well trained and willing to assist if necessary. The hardest part of the job was coming into contact with disrespectful customers, but I was trained to handle those situations positively. The most enjoyable part of the job was establishing customer rapport and having customers constantly compliment me on my friendly personality."
good,"This is a very fast paced environment where just about anything can happen on a daily basis.  Different kinds of spills that need to cleaned up appropriately, teammembers needing ear plugs etc., operating equipment, helping mechanics service the conveyors and on, and on.  We have job duties that need to be taken care of every week, but we also need to be flexible enough for those emergencies that happen from time to time.  Plumbing problems, electrical, pneumatic, and computer."
good,I worked at the company for 3 years loved everything about t just wasn't offered a better position  within the company. I watched people who had been hired in over a year after myself move up and I sat back at register. I had the qualification and skill set for a higher position. They trained me in various departments of the store but never offered me a better position. The district manager was great and offered but the ones under him didn't want me to move up.
good,"Target had best co-workers to work with, always positive and motivating. Would have stayed with company forever if they didn't shut down there operations."
good,"A fantastic company to work for with lots of room to move up and/or work in different departments. Very encouraging staff and co-workers who wanted the best for everyone and to help see everyone succeed."
good,I loved the  face to face interaction with the customers and working on a team . the managers are  very  friendly and supportive.
good,Target Warehouse Was A Excellent Job. Wish I Could Have Stayed Longer But The Military Required My Family To Move. The Staff Was Great And Most Of The Workers Were Very Good Team Players. The Good Outweighed The Bad
good,"era uma empresa boa, sendo que eu não tinha um horário fixo pra sair ,me impossibilitava de fazer minha faculdade."
good,very nice place to work. I enjoyed every aspect of my job at target. I was always able to do something. Because they cross train if one area is slow you can go to another and help there. While working there I learned some of my best customer service skills and was able to multitask well.
good,Cool management and relaxed work environment. Good place to work if you like sales. At a busy location you can make a decent wage as long as you can sell a lot of phones per month.
good,"I believe that Target is a great business that teaches team members about themselves, as well as helps those who wish to move up with the company obtain the skills needed to qualify for management, supervisor, etc.  My coworkers, in general are great to get along with, however, there have been coworkers that were challenging to  work with, but I have been able to learn to stay calm, maintain my focus on work and not the conflict, and if the conflict increases, I would contact management and ask for assistance in the matter.  The hardest part of my job is to make sure that all of my tasks to fill the floor with grocery, make each section in my department: coolers, grocery, etc. neat (zoned), is completed.  I always do my best to complete my job, however, because I work for retail, busy hours, especially during holiday hours, may prevent that."
good,"Meeting and greeting customers."
good,liked working in the backroom inventory stocking ability to finish all assigned duties in a timely matter great people skills the other employes were wonderful to work with
good,I enjoyed target but I was a stepping stone for me right out of high school I don't have any complaints about the company at all they worked with you schedule as long as it was reasonable treated the crew with respect
good,A typical day at Target is very busy and there is always something to do.  I learned how to successfully multi task from Target.  I also learned how to work at a fast pace successfully.  Target is a family environment. The hardest part of the job is the standing on your feet for hours.  The best part is the interaction with the guest.
good,"Target is a fun workplace, I have never worked for a company that showed how much employees matter, shows the employees how much there work has improved. I have learned a lot of new things, I love my job, coworkers are nice and helps out when needed"
good,It was great working there met new friends worked with different staff. The only bad thing was that they work you to hard for what their paying you. Stresses us employees for that position. They also try to push us to get the job sooner than the amount given to accomplish at a faster rate but its not possible.
good,"My tipical day, was so variety; sometomes i opened cashier, scheduales, check personal duties, client services. Work with colegues done le re shop in a funny day way. I met with Garda, workrd with cash and i was so fidelity."
good,Fast paced and multitasking environment. High level of team spirit but the deadline were sometimes not too conducive.
good,When i come in the first think you see are people on register. So you can see how your shift while start. Then you'll hop on the register and provide the up most perfect service you can.
good,I would stock and place new items on the self daily. I would share my knowledge with customers and other employees of electronics. Best part of the day was return customers sharing how well they liked items I have sold them in the past.
good,"Softlines shifts mostly consisted of organization and zoning/facing racks of clothing."
good,Great place very friendly. Great team work. Busy but organized. If you don't mind a unset schedule this is the place. Will to work with you to get time off. Offers benefits if you work full time.
good,"With the recent and continuing changes at Target, I am hoping to navigate the journey with grace. There is a lot of opportunity for professional development within different roles as we discover the road ahead. Truly an exciting time to part of this organization."
good,"I going to missed this store great team. "
good,Its a great place to work but can get a bit repetitive.  Its a great place if you are social. Get along with most of my team and it's easy to talk to my bosses.  It's not a hard job but the hours can drop significantly in slow months.
good,"Target's mission is to make Target your preferred shopping destination in all channels by delivering outstanding value, continuous innovation and exceptional guest experiences by consistently fulfilling our Expect More. Pay Less.® brand promise."
good,love working a target its a good environment they workers are great. the customers look forward to our great customer service
good,"Target is a competitive business with steady-minded co-workers who provide exceptional customer service to all that enter the store. A typical work day includes anywhere from cashiering at the front check out lane to pulling items from our backroom and replenishing the sales floor. As a Sales Floor Team Member for the past nine months, I've learned that the customer, otherwise known as the guest, is our stores number one priority and that without that friendly service, our business wouldn't be what it is today. We have a friendly staff of superiors who value each and every one of our employees. My co-workers are smart, friendly, and extremely engaging; especially when meeting new incoming co-workers. The hardest part of my job I'd say is dealing with rude, impatient customers who enter the store. Although the majority of people who shop here are kind and respectful, there are always a handful of rude customers we must interact with. The best of part of my job is satisfying the customers needs and assuring they leave with the item they came for."
good,It  was good working at Target especially for a long period of time and would recommand anyone who wants a retail experience.
good,"Individuality was key. They let everyone be their own person. You had to wear red shirt and khaki pants but did not matter what kind. If you had to miss work, they treated you as an individual not as a clock in number. Great place to work."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Target and was treated well"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was making life long friends and participating in non-profit organizations to improve the local communities in need.
good,"Pro's"
good,"I enjoyed working as a cashier,  and working with a lot of people. There was always something to be doing. I just wish I was not a seasonal team member, so I could keep working there."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people daily. And being able to assist guests with their shopping. I like being helpful. My supervisors would work with me if something unexpected came up and needed time off that I didn't have. My team members were friendly and willing to lend each other a helping hand when needed. I liked working there so much, I've worked for TARGET on 2 separate occasions. And I'm sure I would have no problem being hired for a ""third"" time."
good,"Working at Target was a good experience. I loved my co-workers, and I would learn something new everyday. I would usually work 8 hour shifts, 5 days a week. The hardest part of the job would have to be working black Friday, but it was a success."
good,"This is a great place to work, co workers are friendly and try to always make the day fun. Learned how to do many different task with setting up floor plans."
good,I really like how everything is setup there. I have learned how to communicate with the customers in an appropriate manner.
good,"An amazing organization with phenomenal leadership. Community-oriented impact with a solid balance of ensuring that profits are maintained. Very exciting work, but very long hours and minimal vacation time. Highly satisfying but at times exhausting work."
good,"A fun place to work but too many people in charge"
good,"Very flexible hours. The Williamsburg store management and crew are very friendly and adhere to Target's ""Fast, Fun, and Friendly"" motto. The hardest part of the job would be selling Redcards, especially after that fraud crisis that happened around December 2013. No one was really interested in the cards at that time, and the company didn't really do much to compensate for the people that were victimized."
good,Each day was fun and energetic. I enjoyed the upbeat and challenging environment that the managers created. It gave us great incentive to work and grow. The hardest part of the job was meeting the credit app challenges.
good,It is a great place to work. The team culture is amazing. They provide a lot of activities for the staff. The supervisors are very approachable and easy to talk to. The most enjoyable part of the job is the social interaction with the guests/customers. i am truly going to miss working there with all the new friends I have made.
good,Team type of work environment & I enjoy the interaction with the guest ( customers ).
good,Target is one of the companies that i have ENJOYED working at.
good,"The job requires patience and compassion to optimise customer service. It involves daily problem solving as well as an in depth understanding of the customers options. I have learned a lot about technology and advertising. The management system is very supportive and also allows a lot of time to learn. The company wants to be sure that you are confident in the information you are providing for customers, and feel comfortable in the position that you are representing."
good,Best job I ever hard. Very supportive management team and great team culture.
good,"Working at Target involves me to be alert at all times during my shift. Developing this skill was very beneficial. This is mainly because there is people who need answers to questions regarding products, people who need to be directed into different parts of the stores, and also being able to handle people who try to shoplift in a professional and calm manner. "
good,I enjoy working in the Warehouse and Retail environment. I have a certain passion about these jobs. I'm always happy to come to work and get started at the task at hand. I enjoy helping customer and putting smiles on their faces. I just Love the environment.
good,"Working at target is a great, fast pace, and productive place to work."
good,"Working at target has been 4 years of fun and such a career fulfillment to me. I was able to get trained in multiple areas of the store. Such as logistics, food avenue, cashier, fitting room operator, salesfloor hardlines and softlines, guest service team member, a guest service attendent, photo lab, and other areas of the store. Target has an excellent vacation time off pay you receive each pay depending on the hours you work every two weeks.The most enjoyable part of the job to me, was being able to cross merchandise. Being able to see a guest's face light up when they enter the store. And also leave the store happy. I was able to become a brand visual merchandiser for softlines. Allowing me to cross merchandise clothing, jewelry, accessories, and shoes. My co-worker and I were like one big family. And management was incredible."
good,"Target is a great company to work for. They care about their employees and make the job interesting. "
good,"Typical day is busy."
good,I love working for Target! Such a wonderful organization and team oriented culture.
good,A very fun place to work and a great company to be a part of. Leaders are great and team members are a joy to work with!
good,"I was just a cashier so I did not have the privilege to be on the sales floor, but I enjoyed being a cashier because I got to bond more with the customer and build a relationship so I had my regular customers that came to see me. I never had any problems with my co workers or manger. It was a good company to work for."
good,Target teaches you to embrace all walks of life and how to co exist. The experience there is beyond amazing.
good,"For My First job they really worked well with me as far as training and a friendly work environment. i learned the ups and downs of retail work that includes cart machine use and cashier/customer service . My manager was very helpful and fair. my co-workers came and went pretty fast but the ones i trained seemed to be very happy with there work, The hard parts about my day were working out in the  sun and making sure i got my guest checked out in a timely fashion during holidays. what i loved most about the job was i did it well and the positive reviews from management ."
good,"Good job for someone who is just starting out in the work field.  Did have fun working overnight, but I enjoy the fast past busy busy busy shift.  makes the time go by faster."
good,"It was nice to have an experience at target, best internship i had there. i would gladly work there again."
good,working here may feel like high school at times but when you work as a team and with great people things turn around and gets fun..its a fun fast and friendly environment.
good,"Average retail job for the sales floor. Cleaning, stocking, and customer assistance are abundant on a day to day basis."
good,"I started off as a seasonal team member working overnights, and they decided to keep me. This was a great first job and I met some really amazing people. All of my team leads were funny, friendly, and very understanding. Definitely understanding when personal situations arose. Only con I would have is that the pay isn't all that great. I mean, as a first job, it was awesome, but overall, it's not all that 'attractive'.  I only worked there a year, so I'm not sure how pay raises went, but you start off at $8.75 an hour or $9.75 if you work before/after store hours or on holidays. Overall awesome place and made some great friends/memories that I will never forget :-)"
good,"Come in with a good attitude, I learned how to review audits to ensure accuracy on all inventory.Verified shipments and tracked orders. Rotated and restocked products.Co-workers and I worked together like a team.The hardest part of job was lifting boxes, stocking products on the shelves. When we got to relax and talk in the break room."
good,This out of all my warehouse experances this was the most fun and exciting of my jobs. If my next job was like that one I would never leave
good,"A typical day at work in the pharmacy is waiting on guests, entering prescriptions into the computer, filling rxs, and helping guest find things they need in the store.  Other duties are stocking, checking in orders, and checking for out dates.  I have learned a lot from being a technician and from target.  My co-workers are great, easy to work and talk to.  The most challenging part of the job is dealing with guests that are upset but over the years I have learned how to talk to them and help them understand what is going on with their prescription so we can solve the issue.   The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know all the guest and making relationships with them.  They are always impressed when you know their name."
good,A typical workday was loading trucks at a very high pace. I learned how to work faster than ever. I really didn't know to man of my co-workers due to being alone most of the day. I went from trailer to trailer loading with boxes the entire shift. As much as I love to workout this job would have you physically drained so the most enjoyable part of the job was walking out everyday.
good,I manage the anti-violence programs and reentry programs within our organization. I'm also the Director of the Reentry program called CSAC (Community Advisory Support Council). Target Area is a non-for profit organization.
good,"I liked my hours, I like the guests there. Management was very reasonable. I can't complain to that. I liked my benefits, the training was a piece of cake. :)"
good,"Helped me engage customers and work on cash registers."
good,"I was able to develop people skills, and learn more effective ways of communicating."
good,"was a good job"
good,great way to learn how to deal customer and also how to avoid certain places to shop during black friday
good,The management was very good. It was a fun place to work. The overnight shift was the most fun and the most difficult. It was fun because we got to move around the store putting things away. It was difficult because you worked all night and into the early hours of the day. It was also difficult because you were constantly moving boxes that were sometimes heavy and required more then one person to move.

good,"excellent people and loved working for a ""Big Box Retail"" establishment."
good,"A typical day for me depends on the type of schedule I get for the day, sometimes I work morning to evening shifts or evening to night shifts. I was a cashier there, after two or three days that I worked there, I picked up the habit of how to check out the customers and their items. The management was really good. My coworkers were very friendly and welcoming and seeing as everyday there are new coworkers, everyone feeds off of each others energy. For me there weren't that many hard parts of my job, but I would have to say when you're ringing up an item that isn't on sale - for example - and the customer tries to tell you otherwise. So basically ignorant people. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my fellow co-workers and customers."
good,I was a cashier and I also worked in the snack bar area to assist customer with their needs.
good,"Most days went by quickly. Enjoyed interactions with guests and fellow employees. Each day was different and presented a different challenge. Gained many skills, such as being able to drive a forklift. Supervisors and management were available to talk when needed, and were often times open to new ideas. The hardest part of job was trying to find a balance between all the different duties that were expected of a garden team member, such as being open to guest questions and ringing them up, while also trying to care for garden and/or also receiving an order of plants."
good,"I loved working here! The other team members were great, the team leaders were very flexible with me, and, for the most part, the guests were easy to deal with. I worked on the salesfloor for about a year then got promoted to guest service attendant and stayed in that position for about a year. As a salefloor team member, I straightened up the store and put away misplaced and returned merchandise. I liked the interaction with other team members and guests. I really enjoyed being a guest service attendant because I had some leadership over the cashiers and the guest service desk. I only left this job because I needed to make more money and preferred a job in my field of study."
good,"Target is an exciting place to work. It is very diverse, and an easy going environment. Target provides you with a variety of tasks and projects that prepare you for any future endeavor.

The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the shelves and looking at the difference you made in the shopping experience for the customer.
good,I spent my shifts unloading freight from the delivery trucks onto docks.  I learned to use good body mechanics and work well with others.

good,"My time at Target Copy began as an outside Sales Representative. The money was pretty good and the benefits were as equal. I then moved to Commercial Printing outside sales which was the beginning of my demise. Sales were extremely difficult in that field and much of the business was already saturated by our company. Due to my low numbers, I was let go without the offer to go back to Outside Sales doing my previous work which I did extremely well."

I work in a fast-pace environment and you'll never know what to expect in a day. Just this week where we thought our seasonal hiring was over, we were told that we need to hire another 30 more people and we need to do it within a week. As soon as I get informed, I started checking all applications and set up interviews as much as I can to fulfill this task. At the end of the week we scheduled 50 good interviews and achieved our target of hiring people in support for the holidays. The management were very supportiveby doing interviews everyday until we reached our goal. The hardest part of my job is multitasking which is also the most enjoyable part for me because I get to challenge myself to achieve my tasks in a day and to do more of what I needed to do in a day. I am the type of person who takes everything seriously expecially when it pertains to my responsibilities at work. I make sure that everything gets done on time."

I did clerical duties, assisted in hiring, payroll, trained, and more on a daily basis. Management was eager to let me learn more in my role and perform some duties in management roles as well. The hardest part was the number of hours I was given a week to work, I rarely worked full time hours. The most enjoyable part was just working in such a great environment doing a job I genuinely loved."

The hardest part of the job was probably working black friday, and the most enjoyable part of the job was everybody working there and in keeping it a fun atmosphere."
good,I started at target as a backroom team member and worked my way up through three stores to become a team lead of logistics.
good,Most fun part about working here is working with your teammates and at a fast pace. Worst part can be if you have managers that are rude and disrespectful. Team work and leadership are core values that are upheld on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job may be meeting timed goals consistently. 
good,"Great place to work, hours are not the best. Each day is its own, each day  has its own challenges to overcome. Management is not always on the same page/level, each manager has their own expectations so you must learn what each of these are to do well in your position. "
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to work when equipment brakes or fails.
good,"My typical day at work was great. I started in the Cash office upon competion I did my price challenge report and tipped off loss prevention if a red flag popped up. In the afternoon I worked as support for HR and learned a little about the behind the scenes work or I was on the front end covering managers lunch and break as well as guest services and returns.  No two afternoons were the same I was sent where I was needed and enjoyed the variety.

good,"great place to work!!!!!!!!!! it is fun and people are friendly and very concern about your well being, the pay is alright, "
good,"This company does not offer many full-time positions. I enjoyed training new part-time employee's. The job was fast-pasted and a lot of heavy lifting was required. Now the other jobs that I have listed on my resume where more people friendly, for example, the animal hospital I enjoyed working with the vet's and taking information in regards to the people's pet's and filing information when needed. the only bad thing was I was not making enough income to make my bills so therefore I had to look for another source of income."
good,After clocking on I head to the section that the Team Lead tells me to go and I start fixing the shelves and the isles. I have learned to do things how Target wants them done. There is really nothing that different at each retail place. The management staff is pretty cool. I have a lot of great co-workers and they make my day go by smooth.

good,"Its the best job I've had for a long time. The pay isn't bad compared to what were doing, plus there is a night differential of $1.00 I just wish it were more, personally. The hours are the only thing that may be a problem, at least in my store. I don't always get the needed hours on schedule, but I usually make them up by calling in any night im off. A few people have come and gone, but there are those who are there to work and are appreciated."

My coworkers are friendly we all get along. The hardest part abput the job is dealing with customers. the most enjoyable part is dealing with different problems with the customers."
good,This was a great place to work with great people. They are great for a first time job as well. It is hard work but they pay well for it. The only issue is holiday pay could be better and sometimes that managers would forget to give you a break or lunch. They would promise the ability to move up and you would never get it. These were the only issues. They make workers challenge each other in the RedCard sales. You get prizes when you sell them and they make sure you are being recognized for all your hard work. The most challenging part is the breaks are short.
good,-Day starts with a check on High Theft Inventory which can take time depending on location and quantity of products. After that I would conduct observations at the front entrance observing and greeting guests as they enter. If a suspicious individual or some one I would recognize from the Daily Intel Briefings enters the store I would enter the CCTV room and obvserve the subjects actions on the floor. Other then that mostly interaction with guests and assisting the team when needed. After store closes I would sweep the store for any lingering guests and check exits and the back room areas.
good,I enjoyed helping out my guests and overall working at This company. I enjoyed the fact that Target was reasonable when it came down to my severe migraines they were able to work around my schedule. Ive learned how to contribute to the guest needs in a friendly matter. The management at this company was awsome they were always there for me and helped me out the best way they could. My co workers were beyond friendly and very helpful to my needs and also very understanding. The hardest part of my job was around the holidays cleaning and closing the store late at night was a bit of a hassle but i have no complaints whatsoever.
good,Working at Target was a great experience for me. I had no previous experience and they had no issues training me. The people I worked with were very helpful as well. I appreciated that the Target company realizes that life happens and they do their best to help in your situation whether you may be showing up half an hour late or have a family emergency and have to call off work for that day.
good,Target is an exiciting place to work. They offer exposure to many different roles and the management is great.
good,I enjoyed meeting new quest to the Food Ave area. I popped popcorn and enjoyed the smell and freshness that it brought to the area. I loved waiting on the quest.
good,Just about everyone visits Target. I learned that Target is more than your average convenient store. You can shop at Target and get a variety of necessities and wants. Customer service is always there to help the customer and the management team keeps the Target reputation. The hardest part of the job is maintaining such a big store. I enjoyed working with the customers and employees. I was also a regular shopper there as well.
good,Great co workers and managers fun and exciting atmosphere.
good,I worked overnights and it was wonderful having the 4 days with 12 hour shifts and 3 day weekends. It was nice to be able to plan vacations and go places.

As i moved up to back room my duties and responsiablitys changed. I would come in unload the truck with all the new frieght , move it down assemebly line for the stockers to put on right carts and push to the floor, once the truck was unloaded and scanned , My duty was to scan in the backstock to home locations and stock. Clean up and go home .. The hardest part of the job was the management.. so many and all of them telling you a different things... which was confusing but kept you on your toes.. The most enjoyable part was the fellow employees that i met.. Many of them are still friends today .."
good,I like working here because they have friendly customers service..
good,"Working for target has taught me a lot, from working with my co-workers, to having great communications skills with my managers. A typical day at target is doing more than one thing at a time. I work at a high volume store, so as the assistant manager, I am responsible for the starbucks team, as well as making sure everything is placed in order,writing down weekly schedules and maintain the team as a whole. I like that we are a high volume store because there is always something to do. We always have more than one responsibility at a time. The hardest part of my job would be trying to communicate with the store managers and being able to agree on a resolution for starbucks. Since we work for Target and starbucks, we have to come out with different resolutions that will cooperate wwith both starbucks and Target's core roles. The most enjoyable part of working for Starbucks/Target is that I am able to use my creativity when designing the new boards for Starbucks. Being able to help a customer and knowing that at the end of every transaction they are leaving with a smile on their face, makes me like what i do for strbucks."

good,Ive worked with the company for a great deal! Good place to work for with a team value of your not a people person its not for you.
good,"Great place to work. You work with a variety of workers who work as a team. Your main objective is to provide great customer service to each customer. You learn to work as a team and each member assists each other when necessary. Therefore, everything turns out great! You also learn where merchandise is located, and as a result can better assist customers. Management provides instructions and encouragement every step of the way. The hardest part of the job is when sales are low and you may not be scheduled to work as many hours as you need to provide for yourself and family. The most enjoyable part of the job is the success of having happy satisfied customers who go out the door smiling and willing to come again to shop. Also, completing your daily work assignment successfully."
good,"A typical day at Target for me consists of organizing, organizing, organizing. Being in the fitting room I must sort clothes from returns and from guests trying on items. I also answer many phone calls and make overhead announcements throughout the day for team members and guests. Working at Target I have become an emotionally stronger person. I have learned that not everyone is ""nice"" and that you can't let one rude customer affect your mood the rest of the work day. I have learned to always have a positive outlook."

good,routines are expected
good,"A typical day at work included processing punch corrections for both dayside and overnight team members as well as keying in time-off requests and vacation hours. As a team lead, I participated in morning huddle to let team members know of any special events we planned for that day and if there was important information they had to know about the store. I also acted as operator 80% of the time so I had to answer phone calls about guest's inquiries, potential applicant's questions and any phone calls coming from upper management requesting a project to be completed. I also covered breaks and lunches for the other operators and my co-worker, responded to back-up cashier when it got busy, spent time on the floor to assist guests with what they were looking for and helped the team with re-shop or zoning the department, helped team members and team leads with their questions about hours, benefits, personal issues, and I was made available to anyone that needed me."
good,"First and foremost you must check in by punching in the time clock. Then I would grab my equipment which included a walkie-talkie and a PDA. Walk into my backroom where our inventory is stock and find my co-worker and see how much work he has done. Management was always nice and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was the early shift, which many of us had to work every other Sunday."
good,Hand load trailers from a Conveyor belt fast pace 10 hour days
good,The hardest part of the job was other employees being lazy. Closing was hardest part of the job.
good,"I would come in to work, see and talk to other employees, and go to work. I learned to smile alot no matter what type of day you were having. Management was okay. My co-workers were fine. The hardest part of the job is staying busy when their was nobody to check out on the registers. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing people either other employees or guests there that you wouldn't usually see or talk to outside of work."
good,9 years of my work history was spent here. what is big to me is my age. so unexperianced in so many ways at 18 years old. huge time in my life. wish time could be turned back. would still be there if i could travel back.
good,i learned the importance of teamwork. i loved walking into work and working with great people. the management were one of the best teams ive worked with. you can go to them with any problem whether it was personal or work related.
good,Target is a fun environment where the customer comes first great management and they have always taken care of their team members. The hardest part is balancing task because there is alot you have to do when working in the store between task and delivering great customer service. I enjoyed the people most of all there are some great people working there.l
good,great hours. usually you can choose the hours you want to work.
good,A day at Target will always keep you busy and never a dull moment. Interesting guests all the time.
good,Good place to shop it. And meet new people you can always find what u looking for at target.
good,Target as a company is a very nice company to work for if you can accept the fact that is a retail job like any other in the field.
good,"Target is a great place to work, they realize that you are giving up your time with your families when the Holidays arrive and they try to make thing festive even during long and stressful workdays. They have safe work practices and support their employees."
good,Target is face paced and is a great employer for those looking for Management experiences. I was able to develop a varied of Leadership skills in my first position out of college.
good,this is a great place to work the only problem is you don't get many hours!!! Excellent for a second job!! great Pay choose your own schedule for the most part.
good,"Target is a great place to work! A typical day at Target is all about putting away everything that guests return or putting away stuff you find that’s not in the correct place. Almost everyone working is cashier trained so when the lines get backed up, multiple people should be coming to back up to make the guests feel like a priority so they can get on with their day."
good,"They have a lot of great benefits for their workers, many of their red card and employee discounts are great because they help out a lot when you have to go grocery shopping or if you have to order new clothes or electronics."
good,This job helped me stay energized and full of outgoing attitude toward my customers. My boss was super bubbly and had a positive attitude all the time. She was what held the store together. Hours were flexible with family and school as well.
good,Target is a good company to work for not always easy to grow there but enjoy working there. Just wish it was easier to grow and move up in the company that's all!
good,I only had a seasonal job here. I would work there again if the opportunity arises. It was a positive environment.  It took them a long time to get back to me about getting a job and they didn't follow up with me when they said they would.
good,I was always greeted by my coworkers. The flexibility with scheduling really helped me get through school. The management was amazing to me and I felt a sense of security working there.
good,I absolutely loved my time here. Nothing but great experiences with everything! My manager was always open to ideas and feedback on how to better things as well as being flexible with hours. I felt very comfortable here and I know that I could talk to everyone about things going on in my life even outside of work!
good,"While I am still knew I am grateful by how fast I was able to pick up the required training, I am taking my shifts day by day and feeling everything out as I go but so far so good."
good,I enjoy working at Target hoping to get better hours and fulltime  with medical benefits.  It's  a great environment and you are constantly  learning new things and given support from the boss.
good,I was treated well sometimes I did not know what my status was. Was supposed to be inbound but work front end. When would check with lead was told he's not mine he's yours. What kind of leadership is that? The HR staff and store manager were great and my assistant manager.  Would work for them any time.
good,"As most retail jobs, when business slows hours are cut back and the extra people are cut, but hope to get hired back! Every day you learn something new and interesting!"
good,Very friendly environment and a lot of learning opportunities. Very diverse culture :) The work can be long and the hours can affect work life and balance but this is due to so much change within the last few years but it is a matter of how the team and management give support that make it into a good experience.
good,Great time working with Target. Didnt obtain the hours I was looking for. The culture is amazing though. Hardest part is just finishing everything on time but even then its pretty easy. I learned to represent the company and also my position well throughout the process.
good,"I recommend jion Target,  for a better future,  shine your profession, learn the dignity of co workers and customers. Find  a family like atmosphere  all over. You can ask any one even Assistant  Director for assistance & problems ."
good,Working in fulfillment is easy and enjoyable when you prefer working with yourself but also as a small team to help each other out when needed. The management is ok nothing really to .complain about
good,I learned how to stock I also learned other areas because you get moved around. Usual the store is busy. The hardest part was probably having to bend down all day.
good,"The team members ,especially the electronic department associates whom I closely worked with, have made the workplace enjoyable by treating me as one of their own team. As my work was involved with handling wireless guest needs,which required utmost care to solving technical and devise usage issues , the friendly atmosphere in target made it easier for me to handle any issue at ease which resulted an outcome we and the guests enjoyed."
good,"Being around fun and friendly environment, working and stability. It’s enjoyable work. Wasn’t hard at all. I would recommend working here. I’ve been here for 2 years so far."
good,target was a great company to work for. I wish they didn't have to leave. they treat all of their employees amazing. pay is very fair. discounts to employees were great as well. if they were still there... I would still be there! loved it there
good,"Great job steady, lots of knew skills can be gained, great support system, amazing developmental programs, fun events and great resources. Managable schedule ."
good,Great team atmosphere  good leadership  training and fun employment  one day orientation  on hands training    Employee general cares about their employees
good,"Target is an amazing company.  The systems they have in place are above others in the market. Hired as seasonal, not renewed but I performed very well"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the happy costumers they smile back when you smile and greet them and you able to make their day a little better when you and how you can make it better
good,"Target is a nice job , they provide great benefits and they are always open to work with you for scheduling shift , pay is also nice too . It’s a great starter job for teens and adults."
good,"working at target was easy, very calm, the managers are very chill and the workers working there. I learned how to handle money and more customer service experience."
good,The store location has been nothing but great to me. They teach me as much as they can and they let me take charge and interact with the guests. The company is great and such a fun and rewarding job.
good,Only downfall is it's a seasonal position. The atmosphere is great.  Gets a little chilly since it's a warehouse.  You are about to wear comfortable clothing.  They provide protective wear and supplies needed to complete the job.
good,"A typical work day would include ordering food from vendors, cleaning appliances and dining sections, maintaining proper amounts of cooked food, scrubbing and washing dishes as needed, handling cash, fully closing down the food section at the front end of the store, and disposing of trash and cardboard in their proper areas. Lessons in effective communication and a good work ethic were obtained during my daily tasks. Delegation and closing the area were the hardest parts of the job and also the most enjoyable parts. Delegating made me feel like I was learning a valuable leadership skill while working, but it was also hard to inspire team members to do what needed to be done. Closing was a difficult task due to the sheer amount of work that needed to be done after the lights were turned off. That being said, it was enjoyable having the responsibility and freedom to close on my own."
good,Target is very nice place to work. The environment is very friendly and welcoming. They have such a respect for guest satisfcation. The higher standard makes working there great
good,As working at target I realize that not every single person that walks through that door is having a good or bad day so as my job I had to welcome and make sure that our guests are being treated as you would wanna be be treated. I actually love working with people and getting to  know and learn each day. I also love seeing guests leave with a smile on their face.
good,Been there about 22 yrs. Fun place w good ppl. Excellent place to work. Pay very competitive. Love it but just want a sitdown job moreso. Highly reccomend it though.
good,People were very helpful and considerate. Managers were fair with sick days and such. I would definitely recommend working at Target if you have the opportunity.
good,"Days went by fast at work due to the amount of tasks that needed to be done, but never felt too heavy. I learned that big corporations such as target have an enormous back stock room and I learned how to navigate them and how to find things within the backrooms."
good,working at target you become a team player. i worked retail so i folded a lot of clothes and cleaned up my section. its a good paying job.HR and management were extremely helpful as long as you are a good employee.
good,"A great place to start working, and interact with different people from different places. Happy to have worked there and learn new stuff everyday. Hopefully ill be back."
good,I loved the job it was very nice. I love meeting new people in helping them find what they need. The employees there were very nice da energy there was cool.
good,"A typical day at work includes me sharing smiles with my management team, and other employers in addition to customers. i learned a lot about   is the impact on the business with smart team member choices and business planning, also dealing with different types of customers and how to handle all of their needs. Management is great, they understand all of the things you might have went through and making sure they support you physically and mentally which is very important."
good,"I worked at Target as a Hardlines team member seasonal, but was kept after. The management was always great and encouraging. Very positive environment to work in! Team members were patient and willing to help for the most part which made it less stressful. Great communication because everybody has a walkie-talkie. The hardest part of the job was learning where everything was without looking it up on your device, but after that it was a piece of cake. Amazing job, only downside is hours went from full-time to 8-16 hours after Christmas and New Years and they never went back up for me. You can pick up on shifts though."
good,"Working at Target was a wonderful experience. I started as a unloader which gave me more training in receiving, back stocking, pushing to the floor, and use of a PDA (zebra). While working I developed a more strategic and efficient way to work. With the opportunity to grow in the company I took full advantage and was able to learn how to manage a team to get the task done with great productivity. I couldn't ask for a better experience!"
good,"Target is a great company to work for.  They have really good benefits packages, competitive pay, inclusive work environment, 401K.  The company is very active in the communities that they serve."
good,"When you have a doctor's note for and to miss work, they'll still hold you accountable and end up letting you go.  I loved working for Target and I showed them that I did too by always being there for my shifts and than I became really sick and couldn't work."
good,"Target was a really good experience for me I learned how to interact with people more and how to work as a team, there were a lot of familiar faces so it seemed like a normal safe place for me."
good,Target's offers a variety of services . They are very keen on customer satisfaction. They also empower you to make decisions that will ensure a positive customer experience.
good,"I love my job and the team members there, it's very clean and family friendly. You can advance in this job, the human resource team are the best. I enjoy it."
good,"There is always something to do here!  We are always busy stocking, backstocking, organizing, rearranging, and pushing new merchandise.  And that is not including helping the guests!  I like working here because I love helping people, and I get to do that all day here!  I like leaving work at the end of the day knowing I have accomplished something.  The particular Target has become like a family to me - they have been incredibly supportive and have helped me through some pretty rough times.  My management team has been nothing less than incredible - they have worked with me during crazy scheduling crisis, letting me pick up shifts when I am able, and being more than accommodating when I need to work less hours.  Everyone is more than happy to teach you how to do things (i.e. using the devices to backstock items, checking on where an item is located, how to pull items, etc)."
good,"I worked at Target for a short time due to school schedule but learned a lot, supervisors were very helpful - would love to go back. Everyone was helpful and friendly"
good,Sometimes the rules and changes handed down from corporate can be a little ridiculous and backwards but the managers make it a good or bad experience. Easton has a  lot of change over when it comes to management and them getting a chance to move up to a bigger store.
good,I think that Rancho Cordova target can be very dirty and scary at times but the people there are very nice and helpful and can help you with almost everything you need
good,Very accommodating with a laid-back pace and helpful co-workers. Receiving training was odd since the first person that trained me was unable to articulate day-to-day activities and explain simple things that were pertinent to the job since he took everything super casually. The minimum wage increases might screw over employees who have been there much longer than the new hires and management doesn't seem to do anything about it.
good,"I started 2007. Worked my way to nearly 40 hrs /week almost immediately.  Had to work 6 days a week! But, they#0685, appreciated a strong work ethic. And eventually, I was working 10 days a pay period. High management turnover. But, managers at the district, group levels, were very open door. Kept store ETLs honest. Great place to work!"
good,I remember working at Target back in 1999it was around Christmas time and I look forward to seeing the people at the door rush in and buy last minute gifts .I had alot of fun being a cashier at Target . It was a very fast pase job during the season. But one thing I was grateful for was I bought a Christmas tree with my check.
good,Team work is a big plus here. benefits as well as other opportunities are available. being able to work in a nice helpful place with respecting petiole is amazing !
good,"Good job great work beautiful yard great system. Wonderful trainers. The weather could fool you, but all in all great job. My only issue there was some looks that made me feel like my skin color was a problem."
good,"I loved working at target. It was fun everyone was cool. I was just a part-time cashier. When you don’t have anyone in your line your folded clothes are cleaned up helped other people. This was Cedar Crest Blvd., Allentown. But yeah I was a really cool place to work I do it again in a heartbeat."
good,Management was great and I like that I had and opportunity to advance if I wanted too. They where really nice to they re-hires and old employees which was great.
good,"Very nice and healthy work environment. All the team works as one in Target . Really like, the place to work with. Very safe and sound place to work . I will recomend this place for sure. Positive vibes is one bigger thing in this place ."
good,"Flexible hours, Amazing employee discount(s),helpful team members as well as management. Pays well and offers time and a half for all holidays worked."
good,I loved working at Target but the management team really matters the target I was located at had the leads and their faves who got to ski by while the rest of us put in the hard work and scrambled to even make up for others. It's a good job once you strain out the bullies.
good,Best management team..very supportive and takes the time to train.Seasonal employee only that hopefully will lead to full time...they treat people like human beings..great place to work and a decent discount.
good,"The company has consistently kept itself from being stagnant by renovating itself with the everchanging world of retail. As long as you can embrace change and understand the importance of evolution of the retail world,  you can be very successful."
good,"Very enthusiastic friendly culture"
good,My experience at target was great. It was a fun to work in environment everybody was really nice and we could all work and still have fun the longer I work there the people changed but the mentality different until recently when they changed their leaders
good,"Target treated me well for the most part, they paid well, I got to work in toys/electronics, which are both things I’m very interested in. And I got to work a fair amount. However I was a minor at the time which caused my hours to conflict with everyone else’s, and I was unable to work there after the season had ended"
good,The working environment is busy but relaxed.  You will work as part of a team that helps each other complete tasks in a timely fashion.  The management is very helpful and encouraging.  You will be treated with respect.  The stocking work is relatively easy but requires some strength.
good,The workload is not very bad and easy to work through with good time management skills. You also get your schedule two weeks at a time which is also great.
good,When i started the job i loved it. Management was friendly and willing to work around my schedule. If you work hard and show up they treat you with the respect you deserve.
good,"I loved working there. Great customer service, quick service, very professional place, the work environment is suited for optimal efficiency. The people there are goal oriented."
good,"Good place to work.  Great benefits.  Good pay."
good,Buena para trabajar lo recomiendo para cualquier tipo de personas
good,Its alot more work then people think it is. The hours vary from week to week. The pay is great though. Just alot more to it than just stocking shelves.
good,I started my career at Target. It gave me the opportunity and experience I needed to move up in a fun fast paced environment. I still think about going back to work at target from time to time!
good,"Great place to work I had to leave to take care of my mom in Ohio"
good,It's a good place to work a part time job.  Our team is a great team and the discount is good.  Management is good for the most part.  People call off a lot without replacement.
good,"A very challenging and fun job. Loved helping customers find items as well as introducing them to new products. In my seven years with Target I gained experience, wisdom and patience."
good,Never a dull moment. Always on your feet moving attending to guess needs. Trailer push zoning and reshop. Learn a lot about retail and expectations. Good first knowledge at retail
good,Target was a relaxed environment with lots of teamwork. The employees were nice and helpful if you had any questions. I really liked it there but the casino had better benefits.
good,I worked on the beauty department. It was a lot of fun because I enjoy makeup and skincare. A typical workday consist of pulling items from the back and putting them on the floor. Guest service. And zoning.
good,Every morning we would meet up in the back of the store before work and have morning meetings. And would talk about what needed to be done throughout the store for the day. Then we would praise those who went the extra mile to help guests or sold red cards that would always give a boost to us to feel good at starting work.
good,Not a bad place to work as long as you mind your business and go to work they don’t run down on you about being fast they just want to make their numbers which isn’t hard
good,"Fun job, good pay, 12 to 13 an hour when I was there. Got a 10% discount on almost everything there. Decent management but it was mostly my own responsibility. It was manual labor and on weekends and holidays very intense and faced paced. When closing I had a time limit to get the carts in before my shift ended. Great part time, especially students."
good,When we only have a few orders maybe a hundred or so but I have worked with there were 3 or 400 orders and we had to have them done by 4:30 during the holidays was our busiest season so I picked the orders pack the orders scan them to make sure they're going to the right person and we were times on how fast we picked and packed but I enjoyed it very much love to work there  required a lot of time
good,"This job was my favorite, however due to seasonal staff not everyone could stay. Management was very nice and cared about their employees. The ladies of HR are very accommodating to family emergencies."
good,"Fun working at target, management can be tough but if you have valid reasoning for missing days or anything of that sort they can be flexible. Coworkers support each other."
good,"As much as I love target, it could be hard at sometimes, management could’ve been better. A lot of people that worked before me, have left due to the poor management."
good,I worked with some amazing individuals..and some not so amazing individuals.  Target at the time I worked there was a great company to work for.  I learned a lot about different departments.  I enjoyed being challenged most of the time.
good,"When I first started working at Target it was great but as time went by 4 years later, 4 store managers later, and about 5 or 6 team leaders later Target wasn’t the same for me but the days go by really fast because guests entertain you sometimes."
good,Target was a great place to obtain experience working and to engage with customers. Very helpful team members and management that worked with everyone’s availability and concerns.
good,It's easy to learn how to do this job. Training is minimal and getting started is easy. Customers are great and fun to work with. Hours are good. There's opportunity to pick up extra shifts. Management is very friendly.
good,"Every day enviroment was fun, safe, and productive. Very diversed employees and non judgement zone. We worked as a team daily. My position consisted of opening\closing the cashier registers and customer service desk. Wasn't too much of a hard task for me, heaviest i'd lift was about 30 pounds. The busiest time of the year here is holiday season. Gets very busy but nothing I couldn't handle. Overall great experience."
good,"While working at target I performed several tasks. I worked as a cashier as well as a hardlines associate. While cashiering I signed customers up for the target red card(in store credit card). As a hardlines associate I restocked shelves, rearranged items and made sure all the aisles were neat."
good,"Can be stressful and overwhelming some days but over all a good company, it was my first job, worked there for three years and learned how to do every job position in the store."
good,The work was fine but the erratic scheduling was terrible. Too many short shifts at odd hours. The job was not as advertised. Training was less than optimal.
good,I had a wonderful experience working at Target. The management was very friendly and understanding. I worked at Target for over six years as my second job to help my daughter get thru college.
good,"It was a friendly environment, although they lied to me. Other than that it was a good experience overall, the coworkers were nice and the job wasnt too stressful."
good,The job was decent however I was constantly asking a manager what I needed to do next. The sort of job where you do a task for an hour and ask for another task.
good,it was pretty cool working for target i went in as a temporary worker got to experience the target warehouse and overall the job was easy and clean and organized my time there was short lived my assignment ended 5 month in.
good,"I enjoyed working at target, it is more of a full-time job so if that is what you need then it’s perfect. Management was well put together and the team is awesome."
good,I loved working at Target and the discounts and red card savings were awesome. The management is great and it all team members were like one big family!
good,Worked different shifts for 25 years. Started out working the sales floor doing daily tasks and helping guest. Got promoted to supervisor and all the required duties. Supervised electronics and other departments. Before I retired I took ownership over 10 departments and several employees. I coached and trained new people and I also interviewed and hired new employees.
good,"Great company to work for especially for a creative. Work hard, play hard mentality. Modern company with great benefits, amazing co workers, and inspiring place to work."
good,"They had opportunities at target to win some stuff, I won a shirt for being at work and never calling out in December. Raffle to win some summer stuff, a google home, and more. They also had cookout one time and bought food for people to eat on their break like, ice cream, pizza, burgers, hot dogs, desserts. Friendly and helpful managers and employees."
good,"Loved my time with Target one of the best companies I’ve ever worked for. "
good,"Loved it, the only this is that you don’t really have flexibility with hours once you set when u can and cant work. Other than that it was a great atmosphere"
good,"It was an easy but demanding job. Pay was set well, just be prepared for long hours on your feet.  The bathrooms and  break rooms were air conditioned."
good,Very smooth job and worked at my own pace. I had a lot of fun and the people there were very nice and easy to to talk to. Very easy promotion as well which was very nice.
good,Target is a great place to shop with competitive prices. It's great working here because we offer excellent customer service and we also have things we benefit from.
good,"I applied at the hiring fair and was hired on the spot. It took a few hours but it was worth it. Training is paid, hourly pay well above (Tennessee) minimum wage. Great place to work although sometimes shift leads/ supervisors suck"
good,Best place to work at. Target is a good place I do recommend this for a job. I worked here for 2 years but decided to quit. But good experience I had at Target.
good,"I love working at target, the management is amazing and the coworkers are great. They only guarentee 4 hours a week though. I am a style consultant so my day normally consists of helping guests choose outfits, folding clothes and putting together new merchandise stands. Its hard to move up in the company when you fold clothes all day."
good,I would be most willing to go back .  Never experienced a problem with the store even with the managers .  They always gave me opportunities to advance in my job .
good,"The supervisors and fellow team members are very fun, we always have a good time while working hard. "
good,I would highly recommend working for Target. It is aan all inclusive company that is set to continuously be successful even in the changing world of retail.
good,"Typical work day for me was at the service desk processing returns, ring up small orders and separating shop backs to go back on sales floor. There was always something to do which made the shift go by very fast. I will not comment on the manager i had at the time because he no longer works at the location i was at which would be a rewarding benefit for future candidates"
good,"Lying about this job would be pointless, this is demanding work. Freight gets dropped off at night, and for more than 30 minutes you are in full gear attempting to empty a giant truck filled with heavy equipment, furniture, boxes, pallets, full size electronics, and more. But the group pushing with you is a group of people that are just as dedicated as you are, and if you work together you'll bring out thousands of items of freight like it is a second thought."
good,"target has been my home  for the last 5 years and has been wonderful, i have grown as a manager due to the great mentorship of my old manager . target will always have a place in my heart"
good,I met a lot of new people while working for Target and I had fun as it was my first job as well. Great staffing in general and I had fun for the short time I was there.
good,Fun fast paced environment. Training is provided. Undercover plain clothes loss prevention. Audits conducted on a daily basis. Always something to work on.
good,"Target is a has a very trendy yet professional environment. Everyone helps everyone, you dont feel any kind of negative energy or impact. Some parts of the jobs can be tricky but have an easy way of figuring out."
good,The managers are very understanding and helpful and they encourage you to be the best employee that you can be! It was really fun to work there with all of my fun coworkers.
good,"It was really fun to work at target i loved it if i could go back i would ! "
good,"No matter what department one may end up working in, the team members and management were great people to work alongside and for. It really does give one the the feeling of working with family, and the guest service is always prompt, polite, and helpful!"
good,"Target is a great first time job. It offers the individual with great communication, multitasking, and people skills. "
good,"If you have great work ethic and do a good job, management will notice you. I was tagged for a promotion within 6mo of working there. I only left because I had an epiphany during my promotion talk that if I stayed i'd spend my entire life working retail and I realized that I did not want that."
good,Flow team would work the trucks in the am and seasonally over nights. Team members are more then willing to help and show you the proper ways. Managment is very professional. HR is very fast to reply and get you into your job. Training is online andsimple..
good,"Target was a great place, the best work environment that was fun and fast-paced. The hours were great the work culture was fun and excepting. Best manager is ever had worked here!"
good,"The work is hard, hot, and very desirable. The hours are good with set schedules but overtime seems to be very spotty over the years and there is mandatory. I myself am an overachiever that likes hard work and they offer mental stimulation. The pay is some of the best you can have without a 4 year degree."
good,"I worked part-time and had many responsibilities. I had great managers and it was fast-paced, but relaxing. I often got more hours than I thought I would, but they balanced my schedule really well."
good,this was probably one of my favorite jobs. the pay was good. they had good coverage. hours were really good as well. it’s a relaxed very relaxed place to work.
good,"felt close to fellow workers, felt more and more pressured as years went by. right hand not aware of what left hand is doing. more equipment is needed/not enough available for work/workers. employees helpful to each other."
good,Target was a fun and easy job for me to get me through college. They were flexible to my hours and quick to let me change hours. I enjoyed my time there and always recommend starting there.
good,"Very accepting workplace, and many opportunities. tattoos, colored hair, and piercings are accepted. They do not drug test without probable cause. Just do not show up intoxicated."
good,"Selinsgrove target is very flexible to your schedules and follow what you put your availability as, everyone is very accepting, allowing diversity. Sometimes it gets annoying because there's not always enough hours especially since they hire too many extra workers from seasonal hires. Employers are understanding and care about your well-being. They always find new ways to be better productive and organized at your job and in the store. Communication isn't always given to everyone and you hear things from other workers of things you should know. Everyone is super helpful to one another and willing to help and teach you to better understand things. A great place for a part time job or for those still in school."
good,"I liked working here, i worked as a cashier all day and occasionally would stock items. i learned how important customer service  is. I loved my coworkers."
good,"I loved working for this company, I would have loved to have stayed with them. It is unfortunate that they were only needing seasonal workers and not permanent workers at the time."
good,It was a really fun place and the managers are very reasonable and super friendly and supportive. They work with you to help you get the job more and that is great
good,"I give them a 4.5. typical day at the job is working at a upbeat pace but not uncomfortable to were it wasn't unbearable. I learned how to make fill orders and able to communicate with the guest making me comfortable speaking with guest. Management was helpful able to accommodate anything I may need, the hardest part of the job is sometimes getting help when you need backup. the most enjoyable part is meeting new people"
good,Good work environment with friendly and communicative employees.  The particular location I was worked at was big and bright which made it uplifting for me to work in!
good,Well this job is very crazy during holidays I worked in the back if the store doing online orders so during holidays there is about 200 people working back there including some managers we had to move quickly to finish up on time but there were lots of happy moments between all employees. I was supposed to be temporary but got hired permeant.
good,"I loved working at the Starbucks in Target.  Even though it was a fast paced job, the staff there treated everyone like family.  Also, you’re able to make amazing connections with most of the regulars."
good,working at Target was a great experience. My store had an awesome team and store management. Everyday I looked forward to going to work to help my customers and work with my team. During that time we had an awesome work force.
good,It's normally fast paced and a little hard to get the weekly redcard goal but great coworkers and great close managment make this place feel like a home away from home. While the higher ups can kinda suck but it's often worth it because they dont last long here. Good attitudes will go a long way here.
good,"It was fast paced and never really a dull moment. The atmosphere was great. Supervisors and management was great, as well as the other people who worked there."
good,It was a nice environment coworkers made it comfortable for me to work there and also mangers and they were really nice. And the guest were really nice when you welcome nicely.
good,"Very fast passed, easy to get trained in a lot areas so you get more hours, you won’t be full time unless you’re a manger or you’ve been there for 5+ years, their starting pay is great"
good,It was very good it was great as far as the system goes but when it came to the managers running the place it was more difficult hard to get assistance and when you did they had an attitude about it or you would try to ask before workers for help and they would give you an attitude
good,Overall a great company to work for. I learned a lot in the time I spent there. They took the time to make sure I had all the tools I needed when I promoted and were very supportive in my transition from team member to team lead.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Target, the staff were positive, supportive, nice, respectful, cooperative, and organized. They would praise and reward employees, give raises, and had different incentive program's daily. I really felt valued as an employee and as a person. There was a great sense of a positive organizational culture that really made people feel welcomed and happy. I overall had a great time there."
good,"Very hard for single moms, who's father isn't in their child's life.  You need to be of at a certain time, due to day care, and not everyone was fond of this.  When a child was sick, very hard to find someone to watch so you can go to work. Some managers were not polite at all; in fact, they were very rude to the front team."
good,"It's an awesome place to work. the people are nice. The staff wasn't all that great, but who really is when you have to maintain order in the workplace."
good,"I loved the people and environment while working at target. I was disappointed when they told me they weren’t keeping any soft lines seasonal employees, but was pleased to hear that they wanted me to reapply whenever they hired next. I understood because of payroll, and am planning on possibly reapplying over the summer due to my very open schedule. Overall, target was an amazing place to work and I was able to keep busy without feeling stressed or overworked."
good,target was a family oriented place most of the people i still hear from lots of fun had softball tourn. between the stores. every year for the first few years etc. people very nice over-all a good placeto work
good,"I worked with a very collaborative team who were good with communicating objectives for each shift, which was pretty enjoyable. Early morning was a perfect part time shift and I was able to move it around if need be."
good,I liked working at this fast paced environment. I lived supervising and having fun on the joband working with guests this jobtaught me so much. Has Great opp opportunities for advancement.
good,Target was a great place to work coming out of high school and going into college. The job allowed me to be flexible between work and school. I gained a lot of my experience from working at target.
good,"I actually really liked Target. It was a fast paced environment and I learned a lot from team building skills, to being able to and comfortably preform tasks on my own, and just overall building my self confidence in the work place as well as out."
good,I started working at Target when i was 19 years old. It's a perfect job for young adults! i loved it! I made long lasting friendships. The vibe at Target was pretty awesome.
good,Opened the new store and worked on every team in every department before becoming the Human Resources Team Lead.  Had that position for 12 years before we opened a staffing agency of our own.
good,"Target is an amazing place to work in the Twin Cities, there are many resources at your fingertips. There are regular tech lunch talks, company wide demo days, hackathons, and much more. Most tech teams operate using the Agile methodology, so a typical day can include a standup meeting in the morning, then a couple hours of coding (maybe some pair programming depending on the team and day/task at hand), lunch, then another couple hours of coding, and typically maybe a meeting towards the end of the day outside of core hours. Very collaborative workplace culture, management is always trying to figure out what is best for the team. Not that much office politics either. Overall a great experience working at Target!"
good,"It was a great place to work and it sucked that they didn't keep me on after the holidays but I knew what I signed up for. I work a 4am and it was quiet and relaxing just stocking the shelves, everyone was so helpful when I didn't know where something went. The team leaders were awesome and supportive. The hardest part of the job was waking up so early, and the most enjoyable was stocking. I loved stocking shelves."
good,Everyone focused on getting the job done. The managers did their part and would help out as well. Everyone worked as if they were a team on the same level.
good,"What I loved about working for Target was the diversity, especially in upper management. Target also has a team focused culture, that's why everyone is labeled a team member. It doesn't matter what department you are assigned to - we all work as a team, to ultimately ensure our guest leaves with a wonderful brick-and-motar experience. In addition, Target provides employees with the opportunity to grow within the company."
good,My experience at Target was great! The benefits were excellent. The help and guidance from HR were decent. My work schedule fitted my lifestyle and OMs were very supportive.
good,"Very fast-paced environment, friendly team member, a bit stressful. I was a seasonal worker at Target and I don't have anything to complain about everyone was nice."
good,Been with target for 11 years love the place looking to relocate closer to home if not possible will be looking for something new. Great culture and a lot of volunteering that I love!
good,"Very good management that is also very caring towards their employees. They make sure that everyone is welcome no matter race, creed, or gender identity. I've never felt safer at a job than at Target."
good,"Every manager there was extremely nice to me, never did I ever feel unwanted. Strpng learning environment and was flexible on letting me learn every part of the store."
good,"Working at Target has been a good experience, met a lot of people, made some new friends while working learning the day to day processes of retail stores."
good,"Working here can be enjoyable. Sometimes it can be a drag if you are trying to move up the ladder, even after being there for over 2 years. I do my best and my worst is even better than other people's best but still get no recognition. Overall an amazing workplace with amazing people."
good,Every manager treats you like you’re one of their family members and they’ll work with you as such. I’ve never felt disrespected in any way while working there. I actually felt as an equal instead of a subordinate.
good,"You start off the day by grabbing your pre-made assignment sheet and communicating with Team Leaders about any additional task, grab your equipment, and get right to work! Whether it was pulling goods from GM (general merchandise) stock room, working out the stock to the sales floor, or maintaining a organized sales floor. "
good,having overnight shift were great because you have day hours to spend with friends and family. great working environment. working hours weren't accurate it was low an played with so pay rates was changing which wasn't good for my bills. but all in all its a great place and great to be placed on a resume knowing target is a huge company not just in Hawaii but also mainland as well.
good,It was very relaxed. Always meeting new people and making new friends. Everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful. The mangers where very nice and always helped you when you need something or have a question.
good,"Target is a good place to work! Great people it’s a fast pace job nice environment, helpful team members,great food great breakfast shopping at that store you get a got feeling good discounts."
good,Working at Target was a great experience. The guest and management made working at Target a nice place to go and work when scheduled.  My co-workers made going to work enjoyable.
good,Management is great! Everyone working together makes for a fun place to work. Has great benefits and paid vacation even for people who work as little as 20 hrs per week. The interesting thing is Target promotes from within. One of the former CEOs started as a cart pusher!
good,Very good place to work at but once Christmas passes badly cut hours. Everyday is different work sometimes busy sometimes slow. I learned more customer service
good,The employees I worked with were really nice. The management is nice and easy to talk too. Work schedules are printed two weeks out. They encourage team work and everyone gets along.
good,A typical day at work would consist of basic duties that are required within an employees job description.   There is usually at least two huddles within a day for all employees that do not work at the cash registers.  These meetings are usually regarding tasks to be done throughout a workday and any special recognition that team members would like to announce.
good,"Very enjoyable job! Very demanding on your body. Co workers are very helpful, good company with discounts to work with. "
good,"I love target during the holidays, it’s fun, busy and a lot to do. They keep me busy by decorating, if they need help on other positions meaning if someone calls out on the cashier I’ll go help and most of the time they rely on me."
good,"Target was a great place to work, they really welcome all different types of people and they treat everyone fair. They really cared about their customers and the place was always clean."
good,"The work experience at Target was very pleasant. Even though the training was very helpful and got you into the flow of things quickly, if you ever were to need help you would get it quickly. The managers were very helpful and I never felt too pressured to complete any task. I would say the hardest part of the job at least at the beginning was selling the company card, which was something they really wanted us to do. However, over time I got the hang of it as I developed my communications skills."
good,"I loved working at  Target, they worked with my schedule, and you can move up in the company. It was a steady pace job, great customers and pay.Also if you get more people to sign up for a Red Card you get more hours."
good,Very fun job and stress free for me at least. Probably one of the best jobs I have ever worked at so far. I’m only 18 by the way so it was a really good first job for me.
good,"This was a diverse and friendly company to work. I enjoyed the team, management and meeting new people. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone."
good,"Only being seasonal, the pay was better than Amazon seasonal pay and it was pretty easy. But Target decided to hire on more full-time employees instead of converting their last seasonal personnel. Seems like they wanted to pay more for less."
good,I really loved the job but had to move due family issues. I would work there again most definitely if I had the chance too. Everyone there was so nice and happy during their shift. I never had a bad day working there. 100% would recommend to anyone.
good,Very good management and great workers. Love what I do. Definitely plan on staying here. Although they did cut my hours way back from 40 hours to only 15-20 hours a week.
good,"a lot of hours to consume and make overtime with, management is great, when they have options on getting certified in areas of the store its paid training as well, we get certified as well which is a great thing to put on applications as well for other jobs."
good,"As a former cashier, management was well organized and did well with the holiday shopping stress. Every employee was flexible and well-rounded with other jobs. Overall, fun place to work."
good,"It was experience I couldn’t get anywhere else. I worked as a part of the SFS team. It was very fast paced,it felt like everyday we were always behind no matter who was working. Overall it was still a fun, good job if you like to keep busy and always moving."
good,"Target culture felt like a big family, everyone was very nice and got along. Managemnt was wonderful and were always helpful. Very good about giving time off. Not stressful, wonderful atmosphere."
good,"to work at Target warehouse. You have to be strong, physically fit, and on time. You have to work fast and hard. You have to meet quota every day. You cannot be slow at the job."
good,"Target takes care of their team members, generally people that I have worked with have been pleasant including the mangers. I learned quickly to cashier and how to deal with situations. Everyone where has pros can cons but I’m generally was to happy to complain."
good,The job environment is very relaxed. The workers are kind and friendly. They make sure your okay with your job and make sure you understand everything.
good,"• Great start when you are beginning to work. "
good,Target is a great place to work but not so great for part time. I am a student at snider high school and could work fridays and weekends but they still never scheduled me more than 5 hours.
good,Everyone was really nice and worked with you to make sure you were meeting the required time limits. I recommend you keep busy and always ask what needs to be done next so they keep you longer.
good,"I would have to say it was rather fun working there. All jobs have there difficult moments, but the co-workers made it easier. Everyone that I asked for help didn't hesitate to come along and show me right and wrong."
good,It is a great place to work but it is fast paced and they are very strict with your hours. When you need to take breaks and etc. Over all it is a fine place.
good,The hours were a little inconsistent in terms of how lng youd have to stay for the most part you were left to decide but management gets upset if you don't take the extra hours when they ask. Everything was very quick paced and at times the job could get very taxing on stamina so I had to make sure to keep an energy drink or snack bar handy or I was likely to exhaust myself.
good,"This was an amazing place to work, but its hard to get full time hours unless you have a lead position. I would definitely recommend this job for anyone whos looking for part time or side job."
good,"I like working at Target, the people there are very sweet and very friendly. We get paid very well, but we also don't get many hours. I would love to keep this job and find a second one."
good,"Working at Target is fun, I made a lot of great friends and I met some really great guests. I would definitely recommend working there to other people."
good,"I had a overall good experience there. Hours were alright, job quality and work was pretty easy. Management could’ve been better was a little sporadic at times."
good,"i work at the starbucks in target it is good, keeps me busy and helps me multitask and stay on top of things. I clean make drinks make sure evrything is dated probably stalk the firdges and put out merchandises we also test all the new drinks and pastry. and make sure the area is in good shape for an easy work environment"
good,"Its pretty chill place up til the holidays, then it get a little wild, but not to bad. Just need to watch out for those guest that got an attitude, but if you by the training they give you, youll do fine."
good,"You have to get the work done no playing around, always keeps you on youre feet, some of the management people are rude and will do anything and everything to get in youre way, the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with guests and helping out your fellow workers if needed, the hardest part of the job is trying to work in 2 areas cause ones your assigned location to work in and the other a manager put you there and then a few minutes freaks out that you are out of area."
good,"Lots of areas to learn and advance. Working from outbound areas I learned order start, singles, inline. In the inbound area I learned to unload a truck and and to break pack."
good,Easy job for sure and I liked it while it lasted but I got a better job offer and had to quit in order to be paid more at a different job so it was that
good,"I actually really enjoyed working as a cashier at target, only downside is I didn’t work a lot or as much as I thought that I would. It pays good, and I was only a seasonal but I would recommend this job"
good,A fun environment to work in and to be involved with. The coworkers that I work with are the most enjoyable part of my job. My coworkers and I get along great and we all work good together. The management is very caring and wants the best for their workers. Target has taught me how to interact with guest and how to  work with well other people.
good,I was a seasonal employee. The training and management was good I had no problems. If I had any questions a leader on duty or another employee was always there to help. Good hours and good pay
good,"You will meet plenty of great people who will make work both exciting and motivating. Teamwork is strongly emphasized. They are also really good about hours and time off, and the HR department is always helpful."
good,"As a team member at target the overall goal is to keep customers happy and safe while they shop. Providing excellent service is key, this includes being timely in checking customer out, zoning/cleaning front end of store, stocking front lanes, and resolving customer problems. Some guests have greater issues with their order and as a cashier we have to be patient as a solution is created that keeps both customer happy and  sales maintained. The most enjoyable part of  this job is being a part of a team, working together to accomplish goals for the front end of the store."
good,Working at target is fun and very easy to do.  Everyone that works there is nice and very helpful.  all the emploees are laidback and good people to work with.
good,"I loved my time at Target, truly a great company that helps and supports your professional growth and development. There is a lot of feedback and recognition intended to help you succeed in your role.  The culture is upbeat and light."
good,"I had the most fun, & met some of the best people at Target. The staff was very helpful, nice, & pleasant to customers. I enjoyed working eith the front end staff."
good,Went in to work at six in the morning. Work was fun but then I became bored of the routine. I ordered the produce and made sure everything was safe and there were no expired foods on the shelf.
good,Target is a fast fun and friendly place where they listen to you and everyone gets along will I work there again yes I will you get your breaks for the hours you work and discounts
good,"As a High school student I started with Target in 2003 it was a great company. I had opportunity to move around then and try new areas. I felt valued as a team member to the company. I’ve always worked very hard so lots of hours and challenges didn’t bother me, in fact I thrived in that environment. As time went on, more positions were eliminated and more work expected."
good,"I loved the fact that all I really did was anger phones, I didn't like how they were slow paced sometimes, it took a while for my raise, and the people and managers are amazing"
good,"I didn't plan on staying at this job for very long, as I wanted to move on to a career path involving animals. However, looking back this was a great job and place to work. There are times I wish I could go back to the simpler times of this position."
good,Great place of business. Professional and we’ll taken care of . Customers are polite and have a great deal of manners. I would clock in and get straight to work always had a set schedule on what to do and where to go
good,"Managers not being more compassionate and understanding to my outside life when I absolutely needed them to be was by far the worst part part about my target experience. Despite the negative taste left from parts of management, customer service was right up my alley and attending cashiers and cart attendants when needed and creating a great customer service was my drive to redo it everyday"
good,"Everyone is super helpful. Have a great lead that takes care of her employees, as well as her costumes. Moderate busy. LODS are friendly as well. They have flexible scheduling."
good,I liked the repetitive nature of the job I had. The team I worked with made the graveyard shift do-able. Great company to work for. Started as a seasonal worker ended up staying!
good,"It's Nice and Smoove (part time)"
good,"Target was a very good ""first job"". I loved being able to start my first job in a workplace that was well managed. I learned a lot of stuff about jobs in general while working at target and I say that was a huge plus."
good,"my experience at target was very good, i learned and developed my communications skills as one of my duties was customer service. "
good,always had positive environment and always was doing fun activities at work to help work go by much easier. i always had someone to help answer my questions.
good,"I have not worked there long but have enjoyed every minute.There are long days sometimes and it is a different atmosphere than most companies. Everyone is for the most part friendly, on occasion not but not everyone has a great day. I have many other interviewees tell me that they love it that everyone is soo nice. I think this is a great job to grow into. It is a great starter job for the business profession and hopefully I will move up in this company."
good,"It's a great place to work at. Sometimes management can be a bit rude but co workers tend to make up for it. Its usually an easy job, they work with your hours which is perfect if you're a mom or go to college."
good,It was a great experience for growth I’m the security field. I had an opportunity to learn many different ways theft occurs in a corporate setting. I learned the different tasks through roles on how to eliminate and deter theft while driving sales and maintaining guest safety while improving guest experience.
good,End to end team in whichever department you need to know how to perform multiple jobs. Very high paced work environment. The guest always comes first.
good,I worked here for 3yrs.Never wanted to leave but stupid management let me go. But the job itself was amazing oh and almost every week they feed you pizza or Zacbys
good,"The pay was above average for around the area where I was from and management was able to easily work around my busy college schedule. I enjoyed my team and the managers. There were time when tedious and miniscule social interaction were taken upon too harshly from a perspective of a certain team lead. Workload was enough to be busy during the entire shift so generally time flies by. If working 8 hours, you get two paid 15 minute breaks and one unpaid 30 minute break. Great discounts on products such 15% off c9 clothing."
good,"Target is more slow paced compared to Mcdonald's "
good,I was bummed that I couldn’t get a transfer but I had a great experience . I learned three different departments and I was expecting to learn more as I went.
good,"Cleaning your area when your not busy, properly bag customers items, provide amazing customer service, maintain a goal and try and achieve customer applications for credit applications"
good,"Such a fun environment to work in, I was a seasonal employee for christmas, which made the job a bit more stressful, but overall a great experience! Great management as well."
good,I’ve been working for them for the past four years I so far no everything of retail how to help customers cashier background check and so far helping customers and her stand what they need and showing them around
good,"The people at my workplace really took the time to show me they way around the store even when I struggled immensely at the beginning. Once my skills finally came online I started to appreciate the effort my managers took to get me started so in turn I gave my best to show my results which in turn made the whole workplace much more enjoyable for me, my managers, and the guests."
good,"Muy buena compañia, me ayudo a desarrollarme como empleada."
good,"I loved the work pace, even though at times it got very busy i never felt fully overwhelmed because management would help you through and make sure that you got your stuff done."
good,"Gran equipo humano y laboral. Empresa familiar, joven, moderna y eficiente. Excelente ambiente laboral."
good,This is a great company to work for. I was in the stocking team I got there at 3am and was part of the team that unloaded the truck also stock merchandise then towards the end of my shift i was put in the back to back stock eazy going work pace as long as you can keep up with the pace
good,Work life balance is challenging for exempt employees. Innovative and continues to evolve as a brick and mortar retailer. Great inclusive culture. Will teach those whose first job this is important skills.
good,"Target distribution center is one of the most elite of its kind.  For starters, the mere size of the establishment is mind boggling.  As for the non-impressed personnel there are the ‘numbers’ of items needed to be picked for order completions; absolutely through the roof on a weekly, daily!, basis.  Steady business to allow for all the overtime one can handle and a self-reassuring feeling of stability and job security.  I cannot wait until Christmas to hopefully unwrap my reinstatement of employment for the next 81 years of this yet to be centuried millennium!!!"
good,I love working at Target it is great place to work if you are looking for a job that will work with you with hours and just time in general. Target is not a place that is will allow you to move up. So if you are looking for a temporary job I suggest Target but not as a career.
good,Love my job there. But no manager in my department so things were all messed up. Kept cutting hours a lot and it’s hard to live like that. Never wanted to leave but I need more than 7hrs a week
good,I honestly love working at Target. I’ve really flourished as a worker and I fully enjoy every minute working. Some of my coworkers have left me feeling sore about where I stand in my position. Some of them at times can be very childish and honestly should not be there when they can barely keep their opinions to themselves. On the other hand I have amazing coworkers whom I will always cherish and believe in.
good,"I worked at the Starbucks in Target."
good,Target is a nice place to work for even though the hours might be low sometimes but the co-workers are great and customers are mostly nice and understanding.
good,"I enjoy working for target and am happy to have this opportunity. Good overtime, you earn your money. It is hard work and long hours. get good sneakers/boots"
good,"nice to b employed first of all ,its a systematic,system once i got the hang of it, it was a pleasant work experience  .the time go bye fast enough till the breaks and lunch time come so fast ,fast paste most of the time."
good,Worked when I was in college and was great job while doing it. They are very busy most of the time but sometimes slow. They help with my job skills and improving my conversational talk and customer service. Management was great and atmosphere was also. The hardest is getting people sign up to the Redcar and the pushing from the higher ups that I need to get more.
good,"My work star on check register and out  i have   lot of thing how to talk with customer and how to behavior with the staff and management "
good,"Though there are assigned items to accomplish during a shift, you will spend more time helping or cleaning up after the customers. Patience and grace are a must in this kind of job."
good,Its just a better-looking Wal-Mart placed in middle-class neighborhoods that calls its customers 'guests' as a weak attempt to differentiate themselves from the competition.
good,"Usually I supervise up to 10 people in shipping, I ensure that the product gets out to the customer in a timely manner. I go over data of what is expected to get out and I delegate to other coworkers where I need them to be to get the job done in a timely and efficient manner. I constantly partner with my manager and clerical to ensure that we are on pace to hit our goal. When I am not on that side of the building I am training new employees within department in both the receiving and shipping of the building as well as equipment training. "
good,I was an overnight stock person at Target which started off as seasonal but then i became permanent due to my work ethics. I would go in at 10 pm and get off at 6 am. I stocked and straightened all the lanes before the store opened the next day.
good,"Target is a cool , fun, and friendly work environment that was a great place to start my first job. The customers as well as employees always had a smile on their faces."
good,a very nice a friendly work environment. managers and other team members are great people to work with! guests always leave with everything they come looking for and very happy
good,"Customer Service data entry inventory merchandising operator a switchboard"
good,"I enjoyed working at Target.  There was a lot of support for my position, and team effort to get things done.  Management was very kind and encouraging.  The work environment was friendly and everyone seemed glad to work there."
good,I work overnight and I still enjoy working for target . Occasional bring coffee and donuts and on special days bbq n the mornings . Target appreciates their employees
good,"There will be days where you are having a bad day, the workers there can change your mood and turn it into a good day. I learned that you can apply for a certain position but it is not likely that you will do that position all the time, they will switch it around and have you do other positions when there is not enough workers that day. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in the mornings because time moves fast, but throughout the day the store will get busy and u will have to be working more efficient and longer to get the work done. However, the hardest part of the Job is doing something that you never wanted to do, but you have to do it because that's what a job is."
good,"When I was working for Target in boulder , they gave me the hours I wanted , we're super friendly and the environment was great to work in . I prefer Target for anybody trying to get jobs"
good,"I worked seasonally in the Logistics area so my experience is MUCH different than those working the floor. That said, it was an extremely enjoyable job, mainly working with the coming and going of shipments and working alongside the outbound and inbound teams."
good,"Pay is amazing. No experience required. Depends on your department, Some departments are more stressful than others. I like that seasonal employees get paid the same as anyone else. Pay day every thursday"
good,"There is so many different people that come into Target. So everyday was something different, which made it enjoyable. The holidays were the best and worst, because they give you many hours and they go by so quickly, but it was hard to to do all your responsibilities in the short amount of time. While also trying to help guests find what they are looking for and assisting cashiers. The most enjoyable was working with so many different people, made some really good friends there."
good,"Overall the target I work at  in Woburn , everyone works as a team and its  a blast. We all work together, but we all have fun at the same time. The pay is retail grade so lower than average, but the job is relatively easy, though can get stressful if you have a difficult customer/guest to deal with. Overall though most of our guests are awesome and I know some on first name basis by now. The location is convenient to anywhere North of Boston via 93 and the management pushes you but not overly. They let you do your own work and grow into the employee they want you to be for the company while nudging you along the way. They do however expect you to follow the target code of conduct. Overall its a great positive place to work, and should be the bullseye target of any job search."
good,"On average we are pretty busy"
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are ok staying in a role for a long time.  Moving up is hard.  The director level roles are extremely difficult to get even if you are a proven Rockstar at your role.  Very focused on diversity, almost to a fault."
good,Good place to work but were understaffed so the work load tended to be overwhelming and management maintained high expectations of the employees to complete the work. It's a good place if you thrive under pressure
good,"This place is a great place to learn about management and lead your own team. They like to hire within which is ideal. There is a lot of support, but also too much to do in one day."
good,"It was my first job and it was a really great place to work. Love the company and what it stands for, love how active they are in our community, loved the people who worked there, and it was overall a really great experience. I always had fun going to work. They will gladly work around your schedule for whatever’s reason. I wish I can work there again. The company really does care about the people who shop there and the employees as well. Really good company that’s continuously improving and listening to opinions."
good,"Working for target can sure keep you busy, if you are done in your department or section assigned, then you must help the other department in need. It is a great place to build team work skills."
good,"Target was a great place I really enjoyed being a cashier there and meeting a lot of great people, but I just had some family issues and they just weren’t going to accept that I was going to leave for a week."
good,As a part-time summer job my position at Target was perfect.  I was paid well and have a flexible schedule.  I didn't care for the uniform.  I was a teen and we all had fun but some of the older employees were unhappy.
good,"Enjoyed the job temporary, was great money, manager very understanding faced paced environment. Very strict on being on time I would recommend this job to someone who likes fast pace working. Very time consuming and expects shot from their employees"
good,"Loved working early morning shift [4am - 8am].  Great team spirit, working as group to replace shelf stock before opening to public. Always looked forward to next shift."
good,Target works hard to provide a fun atmosphere and competitive pay. Our HR team hosts activities to keep our team involved and interactive. Overall management is amazing to work with.
good,"I learn to read different people"
good,I like Target it just isn’t paying enough i have a lot of bills to pay as of late i need something that will bring home more in for me to be able to live life stable and not have to dip into my savings
good,"Love the company as a whole. Wish there where more opportunities to advance, but aside from that managers are great team as awhile comes together to get the job done."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Target, my bosses were always fair and only demanded things of me they knew I could accomplish and would push me to be better over time. My associates were also great, and we would all go out after long days of work to the local bar and hang out together. It was a great starting position."
good,"You get your full 40 hrs a week only 4 days, you get a 3 day weekend. You work 6-4 so you still can have  time to enjoy your day if you have plans later that day."
good,I absolutely loved my managers (Team Leaders) at Target. They never judged me when I asked them about something that I did not know. They taught me everything within one to two days. They were very helpful and oh so cheerful.
good,Nice people very motivating and encouraging. Quick advances. Leaders always show gratitude although Management always had unrealistic expectations. Generally a ok place to work
good,"I loved working at Target. The managers were all so nice and helpful. I loved working on projects with my co-workers. It was always a fast paced environment, but I enjoyed that about the company."
good,"I work as a Softlines team lead. Typically I come in and check the workload for the week and Poing of Sale system, then head to the floor. Push truck during the morning then switch over to putting reshop out and cleaning up the floor. I love the modernization because it always feels like we're a step ahead of the competition, but not everything always works. It's truly a fun place to work, and it's fast paced so you'll always have something to do."
good,"I had the best time working at target, love the customers and my coworkers and all my shift. I was seasonal that's why it end it. We receive the truck in the morning and help organize everything by areas and then run it. I used none electrical fork lifts, to move pallets etc."
good,"I worked in the Starbucks department, and stress is what drives me forward. When things got tough, I was having fun."
good,"Many opportunities for advancement. They are willing to place you where you fit in most. I was hired to work soft-lines, but I enjoyed cashier training and they made me a cashier. After showing interest in my job as a cashier, I was tapped to become assets protection."
good,Target cares for their employees and makes sure they are always performing at their best. Target’s management is very professional and understanding. Target treats their employees with fairness and they’re always making sure they are the best retail company.
good,"Very strong team culture, great company intiatives."
good,Understanding the consistency of stock levels declining rapidly on a day to day basis it was a great job to physically set in motion that the hours where going to be long and demanding but every shift felt great as soon as it was accomplished.
good,"Fun place to work.  Friendly staff and coworkers.  Good benefits provided for part time employees.  Offer good amt of hrs for part time employees, you have down times during the year too where you may not get so many hours, but overall, not bad."
good,"Overall, I had a great experience working at Target. The employees are wonderful and all of the management genuinely cares about us. The only reason i am intending onleaving is because I intend to find a job more suitable for summer."
good,"Target warehouse is one big family outside of your real family. They cared about your health and staying hydrated during the summer. We always warmed up before going to our stations so we wont injure ourselves. The hardest part of the job was in the summer because it was so hot in the building. Some days you might have a good night and some nights were bad because of the freight we might have to pack. I enjoyed my GL'S and the people who I worked with because we made the best out of the 12 hours that we were there each night. I learned the proper way to pack product, so that it will not be damaged because our motto was to make sure the customers had the product undamaged and at the stores in a timely fashion"
good,"As a cashier a typical day at work would consist of working at the register, making sure your area stays clean. Also give all attention to the guest and help them in anyway possible. Sometimes you have to help out in other departments but usually no difficult tasks are asked of  you."
good,"You come on time get your projects done, you have no worries, Job is laid out on the table simple and easy. Strick on breaks meaning they want you to take your breaks. Its mandatory to take your breaks"
good,"Management is great, they are friendly and understanding. Target accepts all customers and gives everyone the equal opportunity to succeed in the place of work."
good,"If I were to summarize my time at Target, it would be this: the company has a tremendously supportive work environment on the macro level, but as an individual, at least in my experience, your time is neither valued nor considered as often as the former might imply. I was scheduled outside of my availability during my college finals week, which was one of the reasons leading to my resignation. But perhaps most of all, there is little to no room for advancement for someone who does not fit the specific store's ""ideal"" team member mold. For instance, I excelled in my roles, but both were independent, non guest-related in nature, so I would often be passed up for positions despite demonstrating a desire and aptitude to learn, in favor of a newer, much more ""brand"" team member. I have no qualms with management at Target as a whole, but my particular experience was not pleasant. Take these words with a grain of salt, however, as my experience was certainly not universal."
good,While working at target I enjoyed the staff and work that was being done. However there were multiple instances of promise for advancement but they never followed through.
good,the hardest part of the job was during busiest days and the store was under-staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to help as much customers as we can and seeing them leave the store with satisfaction regarding customer service.
good,"I was hired for Christmas Season and loved working there I would love to go back there to work on a full time basis. It was a pleasant place to work, management was helpful when needed."
good,I have enjoyed employment at Target for 8 years. I would remain with the company but my family is relocating to an area that Target does not serve. Target is a great atmosphere for customer service.
good,It was very upbeat and always had something to do  it was never boring it keeps you on your feet with everything you are suppose to do they give you breaks within between shifts
good,"A typical day at  work is a normal 12 hour graveyard shift with lots of productive work to do throughout the 12 hours being there. What I learned from the job is Working as a team to complete a task and how to be fast and accurate with work. The Management team is great they communicate and assist each other with any work that needed to be completed throughout the shift. The workplace culture is surrounded by a lot of ethnicity from all over the world, you live and learn other peoples cultures working with them. The Hardest part of the job I would say is being active throughout the graveyard shift when its is time to leave , your body sometimes hurts from standing long hours and you get a frustrated when it gets hot in the warehouse being that they use outside air conditioning but, target requires you to bring a water bottle and to dress light for weather condition like heat and as well for the cold seasons. I love that targets provides complimentary dinner when completing quarterly task and exceeding annually sales in stores on the eastern coast."
good,"Flow team is a great job, but there's not a lot of hours and it doesn't pick up till the holiday season. Overall the job is pretty simple but requires a bit of physical labor."
good,"I loved working at Target, it was a lot of fun. The managers/supervisors were always excellent. They made sure you were alright and checked in with you on a regular basis. I felt like I was part of a team all the time and everyone helped each other without question. It was a great environment. As a Flow Team Member I was allowed headphones while stocking which helped because there was no music in the store. I enjoyed working the 2am-10am shift. If you weren't comfortable working in an area they would move you and helped you adapt. I really had fun. I would work there anytime if I need to."
good,Great guest service and team feel. Learned a lot about customer service and the importance of keeping a customer happy. Cross training was very easy to do as an option for more hours as well.
good,Target was an fun place to work while I was younger as I started my family the pay wasn't enough and the raises we're to small for me to provide for my family.
good,"I believe that Target is one of the Best companies I have ever worked for in my entire life.  There are always some things employees wish that their employers would listen to but at Target I never felt like the company did not care.  For it to be such a large corporation, they do a very good job at letting the employees know they care about them.  I would have liked it to be easier to advance into management, yet isn't that what every goal oriented employee wants?"
good,The hardest thing about the job would be trying to find where a item was located in the store if they wasn't showing in the system. Target is really a relaxing helpful job that makes your communication skills with others stronger.
good,"I like interacting with others on my job and being apart of the full end. The customers were always nice, and although this was one of my first jobs, thy never complained if I happened to make a mistake."
good,"Really nice friendly place to work at, workers are friendly,  managers are professional.  We treat the customers as guests in our home,  we dont discriminate against anything."
good,I enjoyed working with the company.  The managers were always reliable and very hard working. I always felt wanted and part of a team.  They felt more like family then coworkers.
good,The team is great and the amount of work is perfect. There are minimal stresses while working. Two breaks and one lunch for a eight hour shift is also reasonable.
good,friendly atmosphere to work.not much of tremendous pressure.co-workers are helpful.managers do understand our problems.got a lot of practical experience from the previous company
good,I loved working here. The people were great. If you had a question they would help you understand. They were very flexible when it came to scheduling.
good,"A typical day as a Barista in the Starbucks kiosk, I expected to talk to at least 50 customers day, I expected to make all drinks and have full knowledge of our menu. I expected to make human connection and encourage customers to become regulars. Teamwork was very important and our goal was to set one another up for success (cleaning, collaboration and help)."
good,Great Company to work with. Great verity of new tools availiable to utilize in the project. Very fast paced and competitive work environment. Ability to grow within the company.
good,When the team is great the workplace will be great. My first location was awesome and that was because of the managers. The second location was horrible because it had no order and the managers weren't respectful
good,I would like it better if i received  more hours on a regular basis. on holidays and busy weeks they would have many hours for me to work but sometimes they did not have the hours . If i had more hours i would have had more benifits/money/vacation= better life
good,"Working here is fun for the most part but some guests tend to forget that you are a human with feelings. Also, every role at Target is pretty easy to learn and you can quickly move up in the workplace"
good,"Everything was great however if you are a contractor or recently hired, layoffs rehires are frequent and should be expected. As for promotions they are almost impossible to acquire. Some employees have been there more then 5 years, as a direct hire, and also being able to avoid the layoff/rehire process. Even among these employees, if a position above them opens up, Competition is high as some of them already have previous management experience."
good,Working for target was a very fun experience that always was interesting. I got to work in two different areas of the store and it was very enjoyable.
good,I really enjoyed the culture at Target.  They did a ton of fun stuff to develop and grow the team and had fun outings.  I chose to leave so I would not have to work Holidays and Nights.
good,interacting with customers and being in a fast paced environment merchandising replenishment sales customer service lots of team work.  keeping up with a great image for the companys success very diverse and a lot of benefits if you continue to work for target and want to grow through out the years prided by caring for their employees going all out to ensure their future is secured
good,"I applied online on their website & within few days got interview call .I  went for interview.Two round interview was there & I got selected & they gave me conditional job offer the same day. I find it flexible in terms of working hours,people & team leaders are helpful at Target.I would recommend Target as your next employer"
good,Part-time hours. Flexible hours. The PIC will work with you and your availability. Other technicians are great! We became family. This job is a great way to get through school. Pay is okay and higher than most retail pharmacies.
good,"A typical day would require the whole team to push volumes of freight out to the stores awaiting whatever the new fad, style, music or media. Also, safety is a big priority in the culture. Work safe, work smart, work swiftly."
good,"I started this job right out of college. It has pushed me to become the leader I am today. When I first arrived I was shy, timid and not comfortable with having tough high level conversations. "
good,"working part time for a retail store provides that extra cash especially during the holidays. Target is just the right job, if you are good they might offer you to continue after the holidays. I was hired for Christmas and I stayed for 8 years."
good,Target was very busy during the Holidays from about summer to January. After January it was so dead and the hours sucked. So this job is really fun but its very inconsistent throughout the year only during the major holidays from Summer Til the beginning of January.
good,"liked working there, would go back if I could get full time. Management was always helpful when I had questions.  You were allowed to make some decisions for customers on your own.  Hours were flexible enough that you could still have time off when needed."
good,I was a cashier which consisted of scanning customers items in orderly fashion. then collect the customers money and pay for their items and give them their correct change if necessary.
good,"Target is constantly innovating and updating processes, job roles/responsibilities. Team members make quick advancements within a year or two of being in a position. Management is great. They really try to work with you and try to find the perfect fit for you."
good,A typical day work there was fast pace. Had to get things done by a certain time. Everybody got along and helpful towards each other. I was really a teamwork environment.
good,"I worked for Target over the Christmas season and was offered a permanent position after the season ended; and although I enjoyed working for the company, I turned it down because the 3rd shift hours did not work for my family.  If the hours work for your situation, I would highly recommend working for Target - management is wonderful, and it is a very positive work environment."
good,"A typical day at the Target workplace consists of hard work and self-motivation. Everyday this  environment is fast paced and challenging at times. I've learned how to pace myself and use my time wisely. In addition, I've learned how to perform my duties in a safe manner. My OM is persistent and takes his time to explain things we do not understand. Our workplace culture is, ""Put safety first no matter the situation. Target has provided safety classes and are innovative when it comes to safety (provided stop signs and pavement markings throughout the warehouse. The hardest part of the job is trying to motivate yourself in the mornings to do HARD WORK. The most enjoyable part are the breaks and getting off from work."
good,"Target was a great part-time job. I got a lot of experience, met a lot of really nice people, and loved the discount! Looking back, they were very laissez-faire. (it takes a lot to get fired)."
good,"Great place to work. The people are what make it fun. If you are consider target, make sure you cross train so you can get more hours or at least be able to pick up other shifts when someone posts their shift to be taken.  You don't get scheduled with a lot of hours but they are always calling you in and you can pick up so potential for hours are there"
good,"This was several years ago, but I just was not paid enough. I made 8.94 after working there for 4 years and 2 years of being in management positions. I could not support myself and my child."
good,This was my first job and i learned a lot here. I worked as a softlines team member in apparel and shoes. Target is fast paced environment and you always have to work with your team members.
good,"I really enjoyed working there wouldn't mind going back to work for them, the hours are awesome and so are the people. The job was so relaxing from what I was used to"
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs. I had my different roles working there. I worked unloading the trucks, stocking shelves, then team leader. I loved being a team leader. We had fun together while we worked. It was fast paced at times but we all worked as a team.  There was never any big issues in the store where I worked.  I left because they would not advance me to the next level because I did not have a degree. "
good,Fast paced
good,I love this job. All the team memeber are wonderful! And the management are really nice. The only problem is they only are  allowed so many hours a month so sometimes your hours can be cut during slow seasons. And the hours change every week so it’s hard to plan things. It’s a great job if you are more flexible about hours. I do not recommend it for someone who wants steady hours.
good,"They was long days but went quickly, learning to use the scanning gun and counting machine was not hard  management was great very diverse a very large DC hardest part was that I had the nerve to count my steps and most enjoyable was the paid lunches and they would feed use dinners so they believe in family oriented type of environment"
good,"Nice place to work, when you can get into higher levels such as management or supervisor positions it's well worth committing to as a career. And if you want to return to the company, I'm sure they'll you."
good,"Target was a fun place to work, if it wasn't for school, I would've stayed. The pay was also acceptable, I didn't feel under-paid. The managment was great"
good,"Great company to work for from start to career.  People are amazing and moving up in the company is something that is fun and new.  Walk in to apply or online, very easy process."
good,"I worked as a flow team member. Unloading trucks in the morning was always fast-paced and stressful, but our managers and team members always made it a positive experience. Starting work at 4 in the morning is difficult and was a big adjustment for me, but I found that the time always flew by. There was always those 1 or 2 people who made it difficult, but by and far, the majority of other employees at Target were friendly and cooperative. I made many lifelong friends while working here, and I miss it. But I ultimately decided that I wanted to pursue my goals and become an EMT."
good,Target was a great place to work and gain my first customer service work experience. I learned a lot about working as a team when we went in to set up the store prior to opening. Management team really came together to make sure every employee was comfortable and a part of the work family by having store huddles.
good,Love the people and the job experience. We got paid minimum wage. We worked maybe 25 to 20 hours weekly. I think we could at least been getting paid 9 an hour. People with families and real bills can't live off minimum wage with the cost of living and other things going up in the world. Or work at least 8 hours in a day instead.
good,Started working here the summer before my first semester in college as a seasonal employee. Working hardlines was very easy just restocking product on the shelves.
good,"The work vibe within the stores are very high and positive."
good,I loved working here. People were great to work with. Hours were fair and the job itself was easy. At times the leaders would forget your break. But over all great place to work. I had to leave due to my full time jobs hours. Otherwise I'd still be there.
good,I really enjoyed working target the environment I never had problems with any of the employees and managers everybody is extremely positive and motivational.
good,"I had loved working for target, however the low hours caused me to get a second job, and both retail jobs were conflicting with my demanding school hours at FAU so I had to quit unfortunately."
good,"management was fair I also learned many skills I enjoyed most was learning different skills such as hardline, food court area. Guest service   it was hard to deal with some customers when they don't have the item"
good,"3265 Was a awesome experience, it opened my eyes to realize it wasnt just a local store.but more, co workers were very open hearted and we worked together as a team, with a little bit ov' leadership in a few. sad it came to an end, but it is likely recommended!"
good,I learned a lot I had never worked in retail and I enjoyed it very much. The hardest part of the job was rude customers. I made friends with the people I hired in with. The management team was awesome at this location would work for them again if possible.
good,"Caring staff, collaborative work place and fast paced. Management is mostly wonderful. There has to be some self motivation if you would like to be successful working for target."
good,"i loved working for target! i loved working how many hours i wanted, they always needed people to fill in shifts it was sad too see them go as I was hoping to work with them permanently. It was always busy in the evenings and weekends."
good,"Working at Target was a fast-paced and busy workplace that provided learning retail experience. I learnt how to efficiently manage given task to produce quality work. Team members become close and are very welcoming. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people, both customers and employees, and helping customers."
good,"I didn't work there long but i really did enjoy the people, and the environment in general. It is a very considerate and honest place to work and everyone is very friendly. It felt like home."
good,the management was great when I worked there. The customers were super nice and understanding when I was training and even when I got the hang of everything. I am pretty sure I never had a rude customer which is so nice.
good,"Working at Target gives good experience and they work very well with you. They provide a fun work environment, and the management is always involved with the team members."
good,"A typical day at work depends on if you open or close. Pretty standard with locking up high value items in their cases and making things presentable for the customers. Management and workplace culture is great, everyone is very friendly and pretty easy to get along with."
good,"Staff was fun and the work environment was generally relaxed. However, during the holiday season (Black Friday, Christmas), the workload explodes. However, higher pay and greater hours make up for it."
good,"Although every day is different, I really like the people I work with.  They are very helpful and hard workers.  I have learned how to be patient with guests who come up to Guest Services unprepared or believe we have done something wrong.  Multi-tasking is very important in this position."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Target. Every day was a new experience, and every day was an adventure. Working with fellow employees to create the best experience for guests was both challenging and eventful. Management helped out as best they could for both guests and employees. The hardest part of the job had to have been explaining to guests that just because the website say its in stock doesn't mean we have it. I loved working at target. I loved everything about it. I loved who I worked for and with."
good,I enjoyed working for the company because of the customer service we had to encounter daily and satisfying customers shopping experience when they would come in to our store.
good,I get along well with all my coworkers and we all work as a team. Management is always available if need be. The ability is there to pick up extra shifts if I want.
good,"Great place to work with people who care. It can get busy, but for the most part it is easy going. Customer service is really important. Over all a great and fun job."
good,Hard work. Very fast paced job. Pay is good. You have to get certain numbers of packed products per day. Nice people. 12 hour days. Management is nice.
good,"A typical day of work at Target would fist take place at the receiving docks where the morning trucks were. We would have our morning huddles and discuss what goals management had set for the day for store employees. Management played roles as leaders whom would take the time out to show employees the steps to whatever task they needed assistance. I found the hardest part of the job was the guest whom at times would be rude or inconsiderate of employees such as myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with fellow employees and management, we would have celebrations almost weekly and always at holidays."
good,"The staff At the MWC location is great. I would recommend it to anyone, especially those that are still in school. They worked with my schedule so well."
good,Feel the lines up with boxes cut the boxes open clean up the floor pull carts put boxes on the truck unload truck clean up the bathroom mop the floor sweep the floor
good,"I worked at Target during the last part of my junior year through my senior year of high school. Working as a cashier really helped me open up more as a person, since I was helping the public."
good,Working there was very nice and the coworkers made work more enjoyable. The managers were very understanding and they were always there for us. I had a good time working there.
good,Everyone is super nice and they train new people very well. I wish i was able to have been there still but i was only seasonal. The backrooms are kept organized so its easy to find things. Same goes for the shipping area. Though its kinda small in the shipping area and can get really crowded.
good,i met my ex girlfriend working at target. target was fun and easy. but i didnt like zoning all the little items and putting them on the edge of the shelf.
good,"In my opinion it's a really nice place to work. Everyone that works there is really helpful, nice, and really easy to talk to. I would recommend working here"
good,I work with is company for14 years. Management and staff are very easy to work with and supportive.  Not only I work in the cosmetic department I also helped out in ladies and menswear. The only reason why I’m looking for another job is because I need  a full time job and something different.
good,I felt very comfortable from the start of my employment. Really nice co-workers willing to train and guide you.The staff was approachable and knowledgeable.
good,"I love Target as a company, but I wish I got to experience better management. However, in my role as a Presentation (POG) Team Member, I thoroughly enjoyed my work."
good,Easy job and the management was great. Had free food in the break room a lot of the time and quickly trained me from cashier to guest services. Managers were great
good,This company is wonderful to work for but extremely hard to maintain the ability to perform at the level needed to meet their quota expectations. They are great to their employees but expectations are far too extreme and job security is stressful on a regular basis. The work load is overwhelming at all times!!
good,Target is a good job for students looking to balance out your school and work. The management and the bosses are very caring and helpful. All the co-workers are friendly and welcoming.
good,"It was an amazing job which i am honestly quite sad to leave. I was only hired on for seasonal though and they didn't have hours to keep their seasonal staff. Honestly, i loved working here. i got paid well, was easily able to get time off when needed and get time on when available. rocked 40 hours a week and the ocasional overtime week. the work is easy and honestly kind of fun. the coworkers were lovely and i will miss them dearly. hopefully i can be rehired at somepoint in the future and work with the frinds i made here again. i highly recommend working at target if you have the chance."
good,I was only there for a short time. I was originally hired as a seasonal worker but got hired on full time. I declined because I had to move. They take wonderful care of their employees.
good,"Target is a fast-growing company with lots of opportunities for growth. Like any corporate company, there's politics involved. Aside from some minor issues with communication from management it's a good place to work. We have good benefits and the pay is okay."
good,"The pay at Target is very competitive.  You are required to work 10 hour days, 5 days a week.  You must work every other weekend and stay until the store is put back together.  The closing process sometimes went until 2am."
good,This was a holiday temp job.  Cashier position standard most places regarding pay...however could be more.  They have plenty of advancement opportunity if you plan on a full time position
good,Great company to work with. Interaction with management was great. They encouraged new ideas.constantly changing.  The workload was manageable and when complete the pride showed on everyone.
good,every day learn something new.The hardest thing is to finish my work when is so busy and hectic but still finish my work and feel awesome. when i accomplish my work i feel great.
good,descent hours not enough work. Most of the time the store was a mess and some of the employees were always lazy to finish the tasks the were given. but other then that I was a great place and a very home like environment
good,"Target offered me the opportunity to be the last person that the guests would see before leaving. This allowed me to create a personable experience for them, many of whom took advantage of the Target RedCard!"
good,I like working there. Fast paced and great environment to work in. Would recommend this for someone who works hard and doesn’t mind sweating a little bit
good,Love the management at target. Good team based environment. Provide health benefits and 401K. Flexible work schedule. Ability to take paid vacations and advancement in the company.
good,"Managers at target were productive individuals that keep everyone on there feet to finish the job. The work place is great, great people there good work ethic and people that want to work."
good,"The environment at the Target I work at is great! The managers are very helpful and most of the guests I have encountered have been great. The hours are very flexible and there is a workplace shift swap , so as long as you don't ask too often and have a semi-decent reason, you can easily find someone to take your shift if something comes up. This is also helpful if you would like more hours than you are scheduled for. Though the strict schedule can seem intimidating I caught on pretty quick and there are always other employees there that can help if you need anything."
good,Great place to work especially if you need a part time job.They work with you.And work your hours around your availability.The leadership is great and they look after you
good,Target was fun and always kept you busy and working hard. There's always something to do for those people who like Hands-On work. Tigers of friendly environment a home away from home.
good,fun job fast paced. always busy and you have to keep up. customers are very nice. i learned to keep a fast pace to help as many coustomers as i can. management was great to work with.
good,I liked working for Target. I was just ready for a more permanent position. I had a newborn baby and I need a more flexible schedule to accommodate my children and also insurance. But overall its a great place to work and I would recommend it to anyone.
good,Great place to work as a Manager. work life balance is great and the pay is very good for the area. They are very PC so if you cannot play by those rules look elsewhere
good,"Overall it's a good place to work. The managers can get aggravating. Just do your job, don't call out often, and everything will be good. The pay is good."
good,Unloading trucks and putting out merchandise in different departments not for people who dont like to work hard. Its a job that makes you feel good when the department looks good and well stocked. Helping customers is great it makes the customer smile and keep coming back to shop.
good,Target can be a really fun place to work with some very positive people and the shifts can go by really fast. The job can get repetitive but can always ends up ok because of the environment you are working in.
good,"By far the best company to work for in when just starting out during high school with a very high base rate per hour. HOWEVER! If you make ONE, that's right, just one mistake within the first 90 days, you will most likely be dropped like a sack of bricks. Corporate is extremely cutthroat and looks at it's employees more as numbers than people. I have seen phenomenal employees get fired due to misunderstandings or a single mistake within those 90 days and it tends to be 1 strike and you are out with corporate."
good,"a great place to work for a college student looking for a first job."
good,"Empresa dinâmica no ramo de Gerenciamento de risco do Transporte, onde possuí uma ampla estrutura e suporte aos seus clientes disponibilizando sempre soluções. Em minha carreira profissional  me proporcionou etapas que me levaram a um conhecimento profissional inestimável e também o conhecimento maior que levo para minha vida, de amizade, companheirismo e gratidão."
good,I couldnt go a day without drinking a frap. I loved making the drinks and loved everything about working for their Starbucks. My co-workers were nice and my manager was great. Perfect part time job.
good,"Target was a fantastic company to work for!  I definitely wouldn't have left if my wife wasn't relocated.  Most days start at 7am and end at roughly 4-5pm.  The STL was absolutely amazing at my store.  She really took the initiative to help guide you in your desired direction of career development.  The hardest part of the job was the 9-12 miles per day you put in on your feet, but it sure does make the day go quick!"
good,"Target is a fun place to work and the people make it even better. You are always busy, and there is never a dull moment. The best part is getting to interact with people and turning customers days from terrible to amazing (you wouldn't think that happens in retail, but it does). Your coworkers become your best friends. The pay is fairly low."
good,"The easiest part about working at Target was helping people locate items, since I was/am a frequent customer there as well. The hardest part about working at Target was keeping up energy and not getting sleepy since I was in high school at the time I worked there."
good,"This job was a seasonal job, they paid super well and I enjoyed my time there. The team was very motivating to keep doing your best and they gave plenty of hours."
good,great place to work get to have a balance life outside of work and great friendship and family. Management can be a bit harsh when it comes to working but it is definitely beneficial to you advancement and moving up in the company.
good,"A typical day at Target can be very fast, fun, and friendly. I've learned a lot about different types of people. Management can be a little tricky. Workplace is fun overall."
good,"I enjoyed my time at target, i felt like i was needed during my time there and that was great. They are very flexible with their hours and the average weekday is very relaxed."
good,There's never a dull day working at Target. There's always work to be done and a guest that needs help.Different types of people come in and out of Target and the team members that you work with are always there to help and may even become some of your closest friends. The managers that you work with are also there to help you and always make sure that the job gets done.
good,The company is a good place to work at with plenty of room to grow. the only downside is the HR people who are very snobby and picky of what time you clock back in after your break.
good,Great work place for teens that's in college trying to gain money or not on school wanting money management is tough but over all great work place....
good,i loved every single day of it. i would learn new things. meet new people.fast paced. learned more customer service skills. I'd work for the company again.
good,I enjoyed working for Target Tech every much. The district manager that I had the opportunity  to be working with was every involved with every team member
good,Would need to organize product to the correct shipment box cut open boxes for the packers also help inbound with unloading packages off the inbound trailers
good,"fun work, they work with schedules well,  every team member is there to work not matter their job title. very accommodating for family issues. they really teach you how to be part of a team."
good,a typical day at work for me is pretty long considering i go right to work after school. I have learn a lot while working with target such as work ethic and just general retail experience. The employees at target are very friendly mostly everyone was tight at work most of my coworkers were young so it was a very playful environment. The hardest part of this job has to be dealing with ignorant customers because no matter what you would have to hold your posture at all times and the most enjoyable part has to be the overall experience of working with older people learning new things.
good,"As with any retail job, the pay was low - but it is a lot of fun if you enjoy people.  I was supplementing my retirement income and I was just working for the holiday season."
good,Great team great place to work I was a cashier it was fast paced but I'm a fast learner so it took me no time to learn my position and what to do independently
good,"Although they cut me back on some work hours, it was a fun working experience learned a lot from the people there would recommend anyone to work with the target team."
good,Working with target has been a wonderful learning experience for me. while employed there I have had the ability to utilize and strengthen various skills of mine while also learning new things.
good,This is the first job that I had ever had. I would be outside rounding up all of the carts to checking customers out at the cashiers. I learned a lot and management was great.
good,"Working at warehouses with target has been fun, still is. It is the employees right to pick where they want to work from a variety of choices. In addition to this, other job offers are made available for employees who do not wish to work in the warehousing deoertment."
good,"I relocated "
good,I was just ready to move on but its a great company. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a stable job. Just complete your tasks and you will be just fine.
good,It was my first experience in the pharmacy retail position. it was great to have regular patients and be able to assist them more with their prescriptions.
good,"Great place to work but the management turnover was unfortunate. The culture was always changing and the rules were convenient for whoever was in charge that day,"
good,You pick up on people skills. How to tailor your message and encourage people to want to work for you. Metrics take lot of dedication. Everyone is super friendly.
good,Target is actually a really good place to work . Because of the co-workers eveyeone makes you feel welcomed at all times . And plus you never feel left out
good,Easy! Management was great. Hardest part of the job was cashiering because their systems were out of date and when you're getting training they just give you a book and expect you to just go at it by yourself. Most enjoyable would be fellow co-workers and helping the customers.
good,I enjoyed working there. Not great pay though. I spent about 2 and a half years at Target and I liked it. The benefits need work and getting 40 hours in a week is tough.
good,"Very fast moving place, you're always on the go. Helping customers locate any item they would need and knowing you did your best to help them is incredibly satisfying."
good,I love working at target for the  four years I've been there I've learned a lot and was provided with work skills and experience that will take me a long way and retail
good,I have worked here for 4 years and it's a great place to work at. I would recommend working here for people looking to get into the retail business and gaining experience.
good,Great pay very fast paced a lot of lunches an incentives work loads very week to week multiple job functions clean safe environment job change options within company
good,"Target was a great environment where a regular day was still fun. Being there taught me much about working with others through customer service. The best part of just seeing the customers and what they wanted to buy with their money, especially in a place with so many options."
good,"When I worked at this particular location it was very laid back, as long as you did your job you were safe. It's been a long time since I have set foot inside this store."
good,"target is one of the greatest places to work at. helped me gain a lot of knowledge in retail while i was there, filled with great team members and leaders"
good,I found Target to be a great place to work. Coworkers and managers helped to ensure a fun and friendly atmosphere. We were rewarded for a job well done with incentives and little friendly competitions.
good,"This job was nice, when I started we pretty much set up the whole store that was different and then all employees work in all departments and willing to help any guess with assistance if needed. Then I did inventory of the whole store small team of us..I enjoyed that kind of work."
good,"A day in retail is long but usually goes by very fast due to the non-stop madness! The weekends get old, and holidays become just another day. Takes a certain kind of person."
good,Target has been an amazing place to work.  I have had many opportunities to grow and develop while working at Target.  The people are amazing and you get the opportunity to drive your career where you want it to go.
good,Started as a cashier and worked my way up to head to receiving. Worked with great management until company was sold in my hours were forced to be changed and I was unable to work the hours they were requiring. I truly loved my job.
good,"Training new officers in new officer training classes Case management with 150 criminal cases. Presentations twice a week. Conducted classes for human resources"
good,"I would really like to work at target. I'm a helpful person, I don't have attitude problems, drug free, I can work anytime from 11:40am to what ever time you will need me. This will be my first job, I am 16."
good,I loved the secure/safe working environment. The workers and customers were always so nice and friendly and helpful. The facilities were clean and neat and very bright.
good,"Each department had a team lead that you were over. I managed the foodservice department . We all worked as a team helping each other in times of need back to school, holidays. Most enjoyable was the parties or events we had for the team. Management team at the time were a team worked together."
good,I really enjoyed the team work environment and recognition culture that Target provides to their employees.  I would recommend it as a great place to work.
good,"I loved working at Target. It was always something new, Interacting with people and making their day a better one made me feel good. My team was more then a team it was family, I enjoyed everyone i worked with, Management was the only problem they were younger then the people working and had NO experience in the department they were in charge off and couldn't really help the team when we had problems going on, But overall Target is a great company especially if you love doing something new everyday, also very flexible with your schedule."
good,"This job is all about backroom logistics and stocking. The hours were great, 4am-8am while it lasted. I wish they would go back to this especially for moms like me who still have kids at home."
good,"My day to day task were not extraneous in any manner, the management allowed reasonable amounts of time to complete all task/objectives for the day but at the same time strive to assist you to complete them faster. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the workplace environment and how friendly every was"
good,I liked the fast pace job of being a cashier. It was interesting to work with all kinds of people. I also liked to meet all different kinds of people.
good,"Target work life balance it is great for Property Management."
good,A typical day at work is running around fulfilling every task for the day and managing between tasks. I learned proper folding techniques and organization. Management were nice. The work place culture is always open and diverse. The hardest part of the job is all of the consistent walking around the store. The most enjoyable part is associating with the customers.
good,"Target is a very nice corporation who actually seems to care about their employees. I didn't work there very long, so I can't say too much, but it seemed like a positive work environment."
good,"Greeted by everyone working as you come in, Enjoy the time you are on the clock and look forward to your tasks that are presented to you throughout the day, Exciting team dynamics, Great pay, Easy to relocate and advance within the company, Caring management."
good,"Overall a job at Target is great, the environment, the coworkers and the pay is all amazing in terms of a work place. However my reasons for leaving was lack of hours and the workload due to short staff a majority of the time."
good,"Perfect learning environment for new managers. Target has a great training program is very routine oriented and is focused on development. The stores are all laid out in a similar fashion there is usually one big new roll out each year which keeps things exciting and fresh. The products are lovely-honestly who goes to Target and doesn't leave without buying something?! The schedules are fairly regular in the number of nights and weekends that are required. The work day is a tad longer 10 hour days are required with one hour for lunch. Working every other weekend is a major benefit compared to other retailers. The logistics process is hard work and very well organized. Generally there is a team of 5 managers with 200 team members. The culture is fast, fun and friendly. Reviews are fair and the merit system is a nice extra for all levels of employment. The employee discount is 10% and at different times of year you are offered extra discounts off select items. Overall a great place to work."
good,the management was really nice and friendly. I only worked the morning shift there. I had the days off I needed if I needed any.  sometimes during the morning shift we would get busy but never to busy.
good,it was great for the first year but then new interns tried changing everything around and that store went down hill so I as well left. the jobs there are self explanatory and were pretty easy going.
good,It was fun working but I was in high school and it was hard to go in and work food ave and starbucks then close both before I leave and nobody else was working with me .
good,I have enjoyed my time working at Target so far.  Everyone really works as a team and are super friendly and helpful.  I recommend  working at Target to anyone looking for a part time or full time job.
good,I worked overnight (4am- typically 12 but sometimes longer). We unloaded the truck which usually takes about 1-2hrs depending on how large the truckload is. I was in charge of electronics. I loaded everything that was in my area onto a flat then separated each item into carts by aisle. Then stocked every item. Then things that didn't fit took them too the backroom and backstocked them then helped my team out in other areas
good,"They train you well enough that it's easy to pick up being a cashier. Beyond that, the managers are good and the customers are good most of the time. If they aren't, usually it's easy enough to speed them up or get them out of the way."
good,"Target was my first job right after high school, and I must say it thought me a lot. I learned about responsibility about having a job and what it truly meant. The managers were great and the work environment was a safe one to work in."
good,"Easy going job, employees are respected. activities to boost morale occur daily they even feed you meals at least twice a week. giveaways contest good deals. target is on the top of the list for great places to work"
good,"My experience at Target taught me how to work as efficiently as possible with the help of my manager and co-workers. Everyone I worked with was kind and helpful. My work was often self-directed, expecting me to think on my feet about what needed to get done on a given day, which I enjoyed. It wasn't particularly mentally engaging work, but I found challenges I could have fun with here and there, such as reorganizing an entire section of t-shirts the customers had made a mess of and trying to see how much of that I could accomplish whenever I didn't have a clear directive."
good,"Target actually were one of my favorite companies to work for. Pay was decent, benefits, staff was always friendly and helpfu l. Would've stayed with this company but when I relocated some years back the closest one to me was like 45 minutes to a hour away. It wasn't worth the distance. Overall it's a great company to work for."
good,"I worked here mostly every day, from shifts that would typically last 8 hours. The management wasn't the best, schedules and overall morale was satisfactory."
good,I worked at Target p/t  in two different states and each time I found the management to be fair and encouraging.  They made effort to make fun events as well as reward excellent service.
good,my co workers were great. we would all help each other more like a family. there wasn't tons of stress put on us. everyone would help whenever they could.
good,"I only worked for a short time but everyone was super friendly and helpful when I was learning, co-workers and supervisors."
good,"Enjoyed my time working at Target, would definitely consider working full time and moving up if not for my specialized degree. All of my manager were very proficient and reasonable."
good,"So it may have been because of the decent management but working with this company was one of the better companies to work with. The management was always easy to talk to, everyone was great to work with, the entire place kind of splits up pain tasks (ex. cart pushing) between everyone, it was pretty laid back."
good,"Target was excellent company to work for, but since Target had some down falls employee like my self is concern about job securtiy, At one time we was getting full time hours as a part time hire, now hours has been cut to employees are getting part time hours"
good,"Working at Super Target in downtown Fort Worth has been a wonderful experience. My managers were amazing and supportive. The clientele were very nice and respectful (although there were very few awful people, but that always happens). I enjoyed my colleagues because they were focused and kind."
good,good company to work for stability and quality of life. fun people and yiu get a chance to interact with customers. Helping them in any way to find what their looking for as they came  in to shop.  Good change of pace theirs always enough things to do.  company atmosphere to upbeat. they have food during the holiday and monthly incentives for the employees
good,Target is one of the best places to work for. I really enjoy working for such a great management team and company. I would highly recommend people to apply and work for this company.
good,Target really cares about the opinion of their team leaders. We have as much say so as the higher managers for our departments. Great place to work. This is a great place to connect with your managers and employees. Scheduling is very flexible.
good,"Days at work are typically long, can be hard on the body due to being on feet 24/7, guests can be delightful and other times not, the management was decent, you get to work the hours you want most of the time and the schedule is rather flexible. The hardest part of the job would most likely be dealing with rude guests or not having a very normal schedule (and the vending machine in the break room would always steal my money). The best was all the people I got to meet, the flexible hours, and there was always free food at huddles and in the break room."
good,"I loved working at Target. Everything from my coworkers to my customers, my work to my schedule, I loved. However, I worked during a seasonal term that ended sooner than I'd been told it would. Seasonal workers were told we'd work until about April, and we were all let go at the beginning of January with the assurance that we could always apply again."
good,"I enjoyed being employed here , very outgoing atmosphere happy place they have complimentary food for lunch which is good for the low pay and hours you get they allow you cross training to be in any field you would like"
good,They work with you. Manger was cool any problems you had she will work with you. I would work for them again. I would recommend this job to any student good place work at if your going to school they will work around your schedule.
good,"I enjoyed working for Target,  I learned how to use a Forklift Truck while working at the Target Warehouse.  It was hard work lifting boxes that weighed more than 50 lbs and loading trucks but I enjoyed it and thought that the compensation offered was great."
good,As my first place of employment it was a wonderful opportunity for practice working in a professional capacity while also knowing that I would be moving on as I got older.
good,great place great people i loved working there i hate that i had to move but i will always being welcomed with open arms----------------------------------------------------------
good,I learned how to work with customers on a daily basics. The most enjoyable thing about this job was the co-workers. I learned a lot working at Target for the last 6 years.
good,"Loved working at target. Management was fun and positive. Coworkers are always helpful. It always felt like a team environment. The use of the walkies helps immensely with fast and proper communication with employees from other departments of the work force. I always had a smile on my face inside the store while working."
good,"After working 5 other jobs I'd have to say Target was my favorite. It was fast enough paced to not feel boring, but not too crazy to feel overwhelmed. "
good,Work is fast paced but controlled and fun. learn something new all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself. Was very varied. Culture was very deep and present.
good,"After not having a professional job for 10 years, Target was the best job to get back into the working world. Fast past, positive, a lot of motivation. Each store is different. My store has a lot of awesome and positive employees and positive environment."
good,My position as a sales associate was my second job after entering the work force. The company offers decent introductory opportunities for those getting the hang of a work environment.
good,"The people I worked with are really nice and very diverse. The managers and company did their best to accommodate every ones need. They would hand out some goodies every now and then like a sweet bands, pins, offer grills from time to time."
good,"The team is the best part of working at Target.  Target hires young, high motivated people that make coming to work fun and challenging.  Most people are action oriented and create a positive environment where you are encouraged to be our authentic self."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target. I just thought it was time for me to move on to something better. The employees are very nice. "
good,"I actually really like working at Target in Tigard. The people are hard working and kind, and they seem to genuinely care about you. The hours are okay, and the money is less than I want to make, but other than that, it's a great place to work. The only major complaint o have is dealing with some of the customers. They can be vindictive and downright mean."
good,"I have greatly enjoyed my time at Target and love the people I work with. As an entry level job, the pay is very generous and the works is fairly easy. It can be hard to get good hours depending on work station but if you were a good work or wish to get trained in multiple areas they will most likely schedule you more appropriately."
good,"I love this place (I still work here)!! Management is okay. I've changed my availability several times, I'm close to full time now, and I love the other people who work here."
good,"We promote great guest service each and every day. Another goal of ours is to build very strong leaders. #1 is service first as we strive to meet the needs of every guest that enters the building. From an asset protection stand point, my team and I utilize various amounts of strategies to keep the building safe and secure while implementing routines to combat loss to the company."
good,"I love working for this Company,The Management is amazing and also a Fast,Fun and Friendly Environment the only promblem I have with this company is they do Not pay you enough for all the hard work you put In."
good,"Really great place to work. Always ways to advance and move around to different areas of the store. Everyone there is willing to teach you what they know. They were always really good about the schedule and picking up shifts or getting shifts covered were never a problem. Although, when I was a barista at the Starbucks in my store it was always really hard to find coverage when someone would call out. The managers never really seemed to put a rush on finding someone to cover and I think its because they don't really know how busy it gets and how important it is. You can't go on break if there is no one there to cover for you."
good,I only worked three days a week which was not feasible for my lifestyle. The pay was not a lot. My supervisor was very helpful. The seasons could make your bonus more or less than excepted.
good,Great people but not much i can say i was only there at the end of the seasonal. The pay was decent. Management was very kind. If i worked there longer i believe i would have enjoyed it.
good,A great company to work for. Only bad things is the length of time you have to be employed  and amount  of hours needing to be average to be able to get benefits. Job transfers to other stores when need arises  is easy process. work environment is great.
good,Targets strength was in its employees.  They had diverse ideas which lead to better problem solving.  The best part of my job was problem solving personally and with other team members.  The most difficult part of my job was the constant policy or job description changes.
good,"Great great greatgreat great great great great great great great greatgreatgreatgreat great great great good pay benefits, work enviornment smart people challenging"
good,"Great work culture, perfect work life balance, good infrastructure, great management team, fun loving and friendly employees and leaders. Doing great job for various communities. Will recommend  to all if given an opportunity."
good,"Super Target was and Is a great company to work for. I typically opened for the produce and meat department. I would toss trucks onto shelves in the back room and then stack the shelves on the floor. I am also cross trained in Deli, Market, Frozen, and Hardlines"
good,The management was very considerate of employees issues with health. They provided disability services and accommodations. They gave enough breaks and lunches for the employees to not feel overworked or stressed.
good,"Target management works with employees to ensure you have the hours desired when possible, and allows for last minute schedule changes.   Online tools are offered to employees for schedule changes, benefits and time keeping management."
good,"This is a great place to work, as long as you are in the right store. I've worked at 4 locations across the United States with vastly differing results in the Team Members I've worked with. The latest location being very young and clicky. At my earlier locations we were a very strong tight knit group that looked our for each other and our team."
good,"I was only at target for a short period of time but Target taught me how its ok to open up to people. there's not really a hard part of the job depending on which department you're in. the most enjoyable part about the job was the after school rush, some people may find it frustrating but I thought it was fun."
good,Wonderful fun people - worked great with my disabilities as I was working there I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Life got hard and complicated but every one at target was wonderful and took good care of me
good,"Seasonal worker was let go after the holidays, but good company to work for. I worked on the (soft lines) team i was the one putting away the clothes and other types of merchandise."
good,Typical day at Target is pretty much a walk in the park. You clock in do your task help the guest and always make sure you take your breaks and lunches at a reasonable time. I enjoy Target I've been there for  4 years. For your first job it is definitely a great learning experience keeps you on your toes keep your and punctual. Target is the kind of job that helps you build and work on your communication skills with the people around you. Everyone there our friends if not they definitely treat you like family. They look out for one another but guests are always going to come first. I've worked just about every team member position there and i would say the hardest part about target is meeting unrealistic goal timrs or requirement. Other than that it is still a good job to have because at Target you can be best version of yourself or at least it shows you what you can be or do.
good,"The Starbucks inside the target is one of the hardest jobs in the store, memorizing the recipes and things for the drinks is the hardest part. They pride themselves in being fast, which I am not. There is also a lot of upkeep to the Starbucks as well such as labeling and stocking. The upside would have to be is that there are slow moments in the day where you can rest. However sometimes they will put you on the register inside target if they are overwhelmed, but it is much easier than the bariesta job. It's all worth the 10.50 an hour though like darn."
good,"A typical day at work would include assisting guests in locating and understanding products. I have several job titles. As backroom, I pull the required products to be stocked on the shelves and back stock required products. As In-stocks, I scan requested products and ensure correct quantities. As electronics, I acquire knowledge on new tech products and provide guests with knowledge about them. Lastly, as sales floor, I would stock the shelves and and pull products forward when needed."
good,Target was a very good company to work for as it was my first job. I will always appreciate the opportunity they gave me. Very organized and structured.
good,"Target was an absolutely insane place to work, that's actually what i loved about it. it was busy, thriving, and sometimes difficult, but it taught me a lot even though it was just seasonal (i didn't apply for seasonal, they didn't tell me until the second interview that that's all they were looking for.) I excelled at promoting their in store credit card, and was told with that ethic, they'd love to keep me, but without any notice of when my position was about to end, it came to me finding out by not finding my name on the schedule. It was a blow to the gut, however i found out they didn't keep any of the seasonals from my group. I was qualified enough to be hired then, so i reapplied for a position that was open; a few days later, i was sent a rejection e-mail about not fitting as a candidate this time. Not sure why, so i felt like it should be noted that its just strange.. great work if you can get it, but don't believe the hype about  potentially being hired regularly if you're seasonal. you may be let down, and that truly hurts when the job world is so difficult to find your place sometimes."
good,"I loved working at Target and would work there again if there was an option. The only thing bad I can say about Target is that while the job security is good, there is no real way to move up in the company. If you're hired for one thing you will stay doing that one thing."
good,", great place to work very time consuming always keeping you busy doing different times we saw some store also I have plenty of benefits and discounts for employees"
good,Enjoyed working here and the people I worked with.  Was only a seasonal position and was not hired on after the holiday season.  Would love to go back when a part-time position becomes available.
good,"I chose Target over Walmart to help out at Christmas-Seasonal"
good,I was hired on from a seasonal employee.  The management are strong and inspiring.  Its a fun environment even though hectic come the seasonal time.  They cross train you if you are interested.  You can be of good service learning up to 4 cross trained skills. I'm at 3.
good,"I was quickly put into this environment and I felt some of the stuff was a lot to learn. However, if I ever needed a seasonal job again I would definitely go back. The biggest down fall was the other employees and their lack of concern for if they came to work or not. When they did not show up it made it very hard to complete the work that was expected of me for the night."
good,My experience working at Target has been most enjoying and fun while working here. I enjoy greeting and helping guest with their needs and concerns. I enjoy working with great friendly staff and working with a family corporation.
good,"I worked here seasonal from 2015 to 2016 as a cashier. Was hired again for seasonal 2016 to 2017 however I was not able to work the cashier position due to my hours and was hired on the Flow team instead. "
good,Great place to move up in the company and very easy to do so! Team moral is great overall and a fun place to be yourself! The company is headed in the right direction
good,I really enjoy working here at Target there are a lot of great individuals who want you to strive for more and bigger goals this a great job to get your self started.
good,Working at Target was a great experience. I learned a lot from management and also my dedicated team members that helped me with learning the ropes of the job. Being able to assist the guests gave me great joy also!
good,It was pretty Fun I just didn't like the way the hours were given. Sometimes they'd give me 3 hours or the times woul be dumb like for instance a 1:15-6:30 I didn't like that it was stupid.
good,The management had many goals and encouraged employees to successed. Work environment was enjoyable and you can easy get your work done. Breaks were  based on the amount of gourde ou worked and were perfectly set up to not get too tired.
good,"the work day begin with a meeting, Then you do your stretches. Get your paper work then head out to the floor. Co-workers were great and friendly. Management was a unqualified, most if not all were new to warehouse a lot of them were right out of college with a degree in art or history not even a business degree."
good,Operator/Packer I would package and label the merchandise after sorting into proper boxes then would scan correct boxes to the correct conveyor to be sent out to shipping team safety was a major factor in TDC FAST FUN & FRIENDLY
good,"Nice place to work but sometimes can be demanding of your time. Very open to all different kinds of people. Fast paced. A typical day at work for me, includes making the store look nice and guest servicing. I've learned about people skills. It's a routine and there's multitasking involved to some extent. The hardest part is asking people to sign up for red cards but the most enjoyable part is the coworkers. It's also really satisfying when you're able to help a guest find something."
good,"I enjoyed working for Target, they are a good company.  The managers were good to their employees.  Stores are kept clean and always were true to their hours and gave you what they said that they would.  When ever they needed extra people they would always call me. I only wish the transfer could have been made.  There weren't any openings available.  I would still work for them if I could."
good,"A typical day would be me going upstairs to clock in for work. I would greet all of my fellow co-workers as I make my way to my cash register. I then turn my light on and start to check out guest in a timely but friendly manner. I enjoyed my job because I enjoy talking and having different conversations with people. The hardest part of my job was getting people to get a target card because not everyone wanted one. My co-workers and managers are wonderful, I enjoy working with them every chance I get. I would then end my shift by going back upstairs to clock out of work."
good,Does a great job of getting things done and not being unreasonable about it. Always has work to do so it is very easy to stay focused and on track. Very good company to work for.
good,"typical day for me was unloading and stocking. typical day was 4 to 6 hours, longest day was 12 hours in the entire year i was there. this was my first job nd taught me a lot about customer service and dealing with people and co-workers. managers were very laid back and mostly understanding of any and all situations. the hardest part of the job was trying to meet the deadlines thy placed. my favorite part of the job was getting to work and interact with so many great co-workers. would suggest this job to any young person, or someone in college. hours are lacking to use this as a primary source of income to support a household."
good,"I love working  in a family environment."
good,Its definitely a good place to work for as a first or second job. Job calls for flexibility which is good for experience and interacting with guests and team members.
good,"I looooved working for Target. For the most part the guess were really nice and the job itself was fun. I love servicing nice people and at Target, that was what I did."
good,"The actual company cares about the associates, guests and community. There is great opportunity for advancement and flexibility with schedules. I've never worked at a place with more positivity and teamwork or appreciation."
good,Target was an amazing and fun experience I would recommend for anyone looking to dive into loss prevention/retail. Target has great opportunities for people looking to grow and build as a leader as well.
good,It was Seasonal. We got rewarded for our hard work and we got free food in the break room everyday. I had great co-workers/team.
good,"Loved every minute of working in this pharmacy that is now CVS. Everyone was kind, outgoing, and very welcoming. Management was always helpful. The store is very clean. Other pharmacy techs were also willing to teach. Hardest part for me was learning to bill insurances but I was guided thoroughly and caught on quickly."
good,"A typical day of working include reading email about how the store is doing. Then I print reports that tell me if a team members time work is not showing correctly. Then I do my daily task of entering and printing information for reports. The when I'm done doing my daily task I look at who has applied and try to match up potential new hires to what were looking for. I put a schedule once a week for the store. I also work on the sales floor as well. This job has taught me how to take on multiple task at one time. It has also helped me with my peoples skills. I help people on the sales floor on the phone and any questions team members have."
good,"I like working for target , the environment,the mangers,it's just a awesome company to work for, the benefits the pay target brand our store is always clean  we the employees always greet and put our guests first."
good,"If you love retail, you will love Target."
good,You spend the majority of your day standing. You're station is located in electronics which is cool but you're not allowed to help anyone that's not looking to buy a phone or anyone working in electronics. Management is the worst. All about sales and thinks the only reason people walk into electronics is to buy a phone.
good,"I have only worked for Target for almost two months and I love the job, even though i need second income, Target has great benefits..great location, pay, and they are willing to work with you and give you more hours."
good,"Target is a great place to work. The team leaders and team members are all around great people. Target goes out of its way to ensure that all LGBT people are protected and this is made clear in orientation. My only issue is that I was working full time hours (by constantly picking up extra shifts), but never received any benefits because I was never coded as full time. But the environment was great, the team leads and human resources were great, and if you had issues with scheduling, Target is willing to work with you."
good,The team that I worked with were amazing with training and assisting me in areas that I needed help in with being a new worker.
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, working as cashier teach me to be highly responsible and reliable for the customer and the store"
good,"A typical work day at target is upbeat, pretty quick guests come in and out looking for things. I learned how to engage in conversations with guests that made them feel welcome as well as make them eager to come back. Management at target was somewhat okay, i just feel as though they need to be more understanding on sicknesses and illnesses that come that people have no control over. I loved my co-workers they were all friendly they all helped me out when i was new there. Everyone is a family at target. Hardest part of the job would have to be trying to convince customers to buy a red card and having to explain in details what it was about and what it required. Last but not least the most enjoyable part would have to be seeing new faces everyday and engaging in conversations with different people from different cultures."
good,"Target is a fun place to work with nice benefits that most team members really enjoy. A typical day at work involved opening up the café and then start getting food ready for the guests that came into the store, you also do a lot of cleaning to OSHA requirements, ordering and stocking the café."
good,"I would get to work like always 15 minutes earlier I would talk to all my co workers because we were all pretty close as co workers , i would clock in make sure my manager would know I'm on the clock and they would send ,e where they would like me to go."
good,"Definitely a team orientated place, and everyone enjoys being able to be of assistance relaxed environment and the managers are reasonable with scheduling."
good,A day at work is Iwould punch in at whatever time that my shift was at. I would sign in at the register and help people ring there purchases through fast and accurately as possible. I learned better customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was the complaining customers. Meeting new people and having awesome co- workers. Management was always changing so you never really knew who it would be
good,"target is awesome. Great people to work with, great working environment and who wouldn't love to be able to window shop while you work!"
good,customer service is women's sportswear; assisted customers and cashiers;  service desk: handled returns and cashed checks
good,the job wasn't hard and there isn't any cons I can think of. I loved working for target and the managers were great as well. there was great work flexibility and opportunities. you wouldn't be stuck in one spot it was an all around work.
good,Enjoy working for this company. Feel very respected in the company. Love the opportunities to cross train into other areas.
good,"I start every day off by doing my morning production reports for the production controller. I gather all of the information and reports, and distribute them to team members as well as assign them their tasks for the day. I schedule appointments, research packing lists, research packing orders, create appointments, manage the trailer yard, manage the permanent team members as well as team members from temporary service agencies, update production information, communicate with multiple vendors so that shipments are correct and on schedule, research products, run mid shift reports, manage IFCO(pallet building company), distribute information to the yard drivers and security team, and manage all appointments so that our level of service is reached. Any and all inbound problems or questions come directly to me. I've learned a great deal about logistics, time management, how to manage people(how many workers to assign to each task, and how to set them up with the best way to be successful.), different 3PL and vendor procedures, and everything about supply chain management. The hardest part of my job is coordinating a carrier's paper work and information with our computer system, so that we have the correct information. Also, communicating with over 50 different carriers in a 12 hour day, but I don't consider it hard, only lengthy in time. The most enjoyable part of my day is working with my co-workers, and know that we collectively succeeded in fulfilling the needs of the company, and achieving our goals set for the day."
good,"Is a good place to work as you meet lots of well experience professionals to learn from."
good,"Target is a great place to work. Friendly people, great management, and they care about their team members. I still am learning to this day and that's the kind of job I like, a place where I can learn and grow everyday."
good,Days started with getting to work right off the bat. Everyone was always well coordinated together and with helping each other get the work done. Every employee was willing to teach or give advice on ways to better do a task. Management was always there to show how to do something or also get work on the sales floor done. Hardest part I would say was when someone had improperly set an isle or we did not receive in a shipment of items that were to be expected. The most enjoyable part was all the customer service experience I received as well as the good co-workers I worked along side of.
good,Working at Target was a great first job but they don't really give you the opportunity to move up in the company. I've been with the company two years now and still remain as a cashier. They allow me to do the task that the supervisor does but when it comes to promotions they go based off sonority.
good,"I got paid $12.75 with no experience to do Merchandising... I DIDNT EVEN NO WHAT THAT WAS!"
good,"After getting to work it was always smooth sailing, and team leaders were always on schedule. They coached well and were always full of positive feedback. The hardest part was only meeting the REDCards quota as a lot of people already have them."
good,My time at Target has been an amazing learning opportunity! The atmosphere is very much focused around the idea that we can only do our best work when we work together. The management is kind and very welcoming. The hardest part of the job is simply just keeping up with the guests who come in and out of the store. Good news is there is an amazing team behind you every step of the way.  I would highly recommend working for Target to anyone.
good,"I'm busy all day with follow up and supporting other areas. I learn something new every day from the team, my peers and Management. The hardest part of my job is when I have to spend time in my office, the most enjoyable is when I am on the field and interacting with the people that makes our business success. The other thing I love is to identify high potential within the company for future promotions."
good,I learned great people skills. i enjoyed going to work everyday. management was very reliable and understanding when it came to certain situations.
good,The Target culture is something to truly be proud to be a part of. The focus on team building and guest service makes an excellent work environment.
good,"Typical day involved a lot of walking, standing, and lifting.  Constant communication with customers and co-workers.  Hardest part of the job was had a large are to keep clean and organized for one person but it could be done."
good,"Unanticipated spike in Volume"
good,"Overall I loved the Target I worked at. The people were great and interacting with the customers was a lot of fun. I only wish they would have paid just a little bit higher, It was hard living in San Diego and living off of such a small wage. Also everyone that was on the work team seemed to work well together and without problems and It was nice seeing that."
good,"Target is good place , good culture , good learning on retail domain,"
good,Was fun and very nice and easy. Wish they weren't closing in Superior! I also wish I didn't have to quit otherwise I would've stayed for as long as possible.
good,"very stable work place fast pace good job overall, nice people helping love hard work and love new task as well job taught me a lot far as standing for 12 hours to discipline"
good,"Good company to work.Good work life balance,Average salary hike."
good,"Target inspired me to envision myself as something better. They provided me with the tools to improve myself and become a better Human Resource individual, which inspired me to get my degree. A typical day at Target DC was never typical. We had a certain amount of usual paperwork to work on but always welcomed new challenges. We as a team processed payroll, we kept our team member's training current, we tracked our LOA participants, and worked with our team members to trouble shoot their concerns as mediators to our corporate office and benefits administrators."
good,Overall working at Target is a very good experience. Everyone is nice and very helpful we all work together as a team.I highly recommend Target to anyone looking for a part time job.
good,very buisy job i learned how to use a bailer machine my management was very cool and the were hard workers as wellthe hardest part of the job was how fast we had to move the most enjoyable part of the job was the team members
good,"I enjoyed my time as a Business Analyst Intern at Target Headquarters. Being in downtown Minneapolis, Target provides exceptional work spaces, work-life balance, and opportunities for advancement for their employees."
good,"Its a great place to work, especially for women, work- life balance is given more importance and Employees are treated with utmost respect and their efforts are valued"
good,"start up meeting about previous days activities and current day announcements before setting up agenda for the day, which would include preforming preventative maintenance on building systems."
good,"Overall, Target is actually a really rewarding job. They do pay less than Walmart, but I felt better about myself as a part of the Target team. I would go back in a heartbeat, but I was stupid when I quit so I'm non-rehireable. "
good,overall great place to be employed Great supervisors and Excellent benefits  supervisors taking the time to help when help is needed    fully understand job with minimal errors or down time
good,"Great benifits"
good,"A very fast paced environment with management being fun, helpful, and helping at the same time. Making sure all customers are treated with the most up right respect."
good,"Awesome culture and people. Excellent benefits,work life balance,fun place to work. Enjoy working here. If i had growth here i would have never thought of exploring other opportunities."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Target. I would run a cash register and work on the sales floor. Unfortunately, I encountered a health problem that I have no longer deal with. After that, I became pregnant with my second child and my husband and I both agreed that I would become a stay at home mom."
good,Assisted guests with fast accurate Friendly Customer Service by scanning Items and making sure the Leave my designated area completely satisfied and happy with a bright smile. Supportive management and team.
good,"I loved the environment, I loved how fast paced it was, kept me active and I liked engaging with people,. I just didn't like the long hours, how late I was out and the pay wasn't the best"
good,Family Values with Co-workers - worked for Target for 7 and half years and on the job training learning multiple departments due to short staff ..
good,C'était vraiment une bonne compagnie dommage que ca na pas fonctionné au Canada
good,"I have greatly enjoyed my time working at Target so far. I have a great group of co-workers and everyone is very friendly and outgoing. The workplace is clean and lively, and management staff does a great job making work a good place to be every day, including supplying workers with food in the breakrooms and even at team meetings."
good,Great workplace. I have met some great people and have experienced what great managers are like. very fast paced environment.
good,"i learned how to clean, size and color the clothes and a bit of fitting room operator. management was great always on top of everything ALOT of employees very professional at everthing if they needed to talk to you or train you they would always do it no matter how much it would take. co workers were a bit quiet but because everyones always busy but no one ever forgot to smile and say hi. the hardest part of my job was closing i would freak out not knowing where some the things went. The enjoyable part was being in a cool fresh and clean environment where everything was easy no stress."
good,I worked the evening  shift almost every day for three months. I would go clock in and than get my work area ready to work. I learned how to talk to other people and how to keep a smile on my face no matter what is going on. The management was very nice and willing to teach me how to do my job right and learn more about it. Even my co-workers was willing to help when I had any questions about the job I was doing at the time. The hardest part of the job was when the job I was require to do at that time was to hard for me to understand how to do it. Even after trying to do it many times. But the best part of the job was after I did get to learn how todo the job I was proud of myself for learning something hard and doing it right.
good,"While I was working there, I had a fun time. The time went by quickly and I got along with all the co workers. I was only there for a short amount of time, during the busiest time of the year, Christmas. It was the type of job that you have to quick on your feet and make decisions fast. When there is a long line you need to get each guest in and out happily and quickly."
good,"Interacted with the customers and identifited their needs and recommended best products."
good,"Very team based. Had random days for employees like flapjack fridays, cereal sundays.  They had a bunch of games in the lunch room with a little library.  Everyone helps everyone else on the team."
good,"A typical day at work in the life of a cashier is challenging you could say. Haha. You get to deal with all sorts of interesting people, and your main job duties are scanning items, bagging, cashiering, handling money, balancing money, doing mental calculations when the register is broken. I learned quite a bit of information when I became a cashier, for example don't ever put ANY type of liquids with meats, always smile, always be polite, and always go to the end of your aisle and ask anybody if they need assistance. Management wasn't really what I expected it to be, to be completely honest I was disappointed that the management wasn't more on top of things like they should be. Breaks were disheveled, they weren't long enough and anytime I would put my help light on, it would literally take them 20 minutes to come over to my register to assist me with my problem. My coworkers were a blast though, I always had fun with them, and in all honesty I think they were a HUGE part of the reason why I stayed for so long. The hardest part of my job was to try and adapt to ALL the new changes that the store was going through, though it was difficult, I still managed to overcome it and continued to perform my job as required. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to meet/start friendships with my coworkers and customers. I'm a very sociable person, so a long lasting good first impression is always vital and very important to me."
good,"Target is a good job, but it is only part time. They are very flexible about giving more hours. The work is not super difficult, and there is opportunities to work in multiple departments."
good,"Was a wonderful place to work for. Was a seasonal cashier but trying to get hired  back seems impossible. I enjoyed how the registers were set up and everyone that worked there was friendly, but was not kept on after the holidays were over and I have applied several times to no avail so I am not sure what they are looking for. It seems if u can get hired as a seasonal, u should be able to get hired permanently."
good,"Enjoyed working with the management and team members, good environment fun place to work. nothing hard about the job, I just stayed busy and focused on the guests and getting my work done."
good,"Target was a great company to work for. I had the opportunity to work in stores management, Regional and HQ Management and Distribution. All of which provided a high level, well rounded and rewarding career."
good,Very helpful with customers. Making sure they found what they need. Making sure they get the help they need in whatever department or sections.
good,"it has been a great job lots of great coworkers"
good,This place was an awesome place to work. They held you responsible for your job and gave you courage and advice on doing your job. Safety was taken seriously.
good,"I was here seasonal but was able to stay."
good,"enjoyed this job just not the schedule . hard to get a decent schedule but the pay was well worth it ! they should deff. split up the work week schedules so the everyone isnt so burnt out in such short time , they would probally get a higher production rate that way"
good,"A good company to work for if you don't mind the baggage that comes with retail ie. nights, weekends, and holidays. Lots of teamwork and opportunities for advancement."
good,"This was my first job when I turned 16 and I stayed with them throughout college. I specifically worked in the Concord, NH location and the management there was great. Everyone worked together well and most everyone got along which is great for such a large work place. It was a friendly environment and I enjoyed working there very much!"
good,"I worked at target for two years, in that time I got a raise of 25 cents and never had an opportunity for advancement. The work culture was fun, easy going, and the people that I worked with were fun to work with."
good,I learned to stock and how to find the items and place them in allocated places. Team work. There wasn't anything hard or challenging about this job.
good,"I would recommend others to work at Target, especially pursuing Management level.  The pay and benefits are good.  Hours can be long and it is a physical job.  Lots of walking,, lifting, reaching, etc."
good,"Empresa com responsabilidade e compromisso no ramo. Empresa que qualifica seus funcionários dá um suporte com seus supervisores e coordenadores, sempre se reunindo com a equipe de colaboradores junto a diretoria, confraternizaçoes com os familiares."
good,"loved my managers, and employees! work was always so relaxed and calm. if there was a problem they would always find a way to solve it"
good,"Aprendi a correr atrás daquilo que preciso saber para obter um bom resultado no trabalho, como trabalhando longe da matriz, as dúvidas e as respectivas soluções eram consultadas, trabalhadas e resolvidas. Aprendi que é preciso sim trabalhar de verdade pela empresa porque com seu bom resultado todos ganham!"
good,Wonderful and friendly place to work. Having a good team to work with. Learned how to look and take on the task/job list of things that needs to be done. And to how to delegate them to my other peers.
good,The management is good. Employees are encouraged to grow and feel valued. Work enviroment is professional and pleasant.
good,"a typical day at work was to make sure all customers were on the right track and got all the help they needed for they're well being. I learned how to work as a supervisor and have a lot of responsibility, with things like closing the store etc. also to make sure all product was properly pushed before store opening for a ready to shop store. the hardest part of the job was knowing that my hours were actually never full time and they liked to sometimes give you a whole week off which I didn't like to much."
good,"Overall Target focuses on development of each leader. They compensate very well and truly care about how you are doing - if you are good at your job. Those who have the aptitude are pushed to excel and encouraged throughout the process. Others who may not be right for management usually complain that they are being left out of development, but it comes down to if you work hard, you are compensated and supported. The company wants to keep it's great leaders and keep them moving up!"
good,"the pay is good, i worked merchandise flow team & i worked 3 days a week but they would give me extra days if i wanted. great company"
good,My typical day was putting stock away in various departments and keeping the shelves looking neat and clean.  The management was great but the employees were hard to work with.  The hardest part about the job were the hours and the most enjoyable was seeing the new products that go out on the shelf before everybody else.
good,Target is a very employee centric organization. The work culture allows its employees to attain perfect work life balance.
good,"Very busy, lots of tasks to be completed. Always have the store looking brand. Learned management skills. Worked well with my co-workers. Had a hard time asking leadership for help when needed. Had a great team that worked with me at the front end. Always a team player no matter what came up."
good,I worked here for six years and I can only think of great things to say about Target. its a great place to work and shop. I met so many new and like-minded friends from this job.
good,This is a great place if you want to advance in your career! I enjoyed shopping here and working on black Friday. I miss all of my former co-workers so much!
good,great place to start out at but not good if your looking for a career low pay. very easy job friendly people no overtime if you prove yourself you can work your way up on hours and to a team lead position.
good,love the store colors. lots of customers to interact with. a very people friendly environment. this company can go the distance.

good,"Management was refreshing and understandable, hours were great. work was simple and quick to finish up because of team members helping on another"

good,"I loved this target because the staff was so bubbly, also I worked during the thanksgiving holiday to christmas season and although there was no for sure job placement I wouldnt  mind going back if given the chance just for the holidays. I had that much fun"
good,"This job is great, management is awesome and willing to work with all employees. They have been supportive of me through paramedic school and working to obtain a job as a firefighter."
good,"Even though there were the usual hour cuts that came with working retail the job was the best one I've had so far. The job was consistent enough that I knew what I'd be doing on a daily basis but at the same time due to what came on the trucks being ever changing you had to be on your toes and able to accommodate the new stock especially if it was for a coming seasonal change that doesn't go out on the floor for a couple of weeks. "
good,"A typical day at my job was to start the day by leading a large team of 18-25 team members to unload a trailer of merchandise that could contain anywhere from 500 boxes to 3000. Our expectations where to have our product pushed to the sales floor before the days end. Daily engaging and inspiring a team to be fast and accurate with the merchandise that was pushed to our sales floor. Leading a backroom team to accurately locate overstock as per Target process. Manager on Duty, leading store team to the success of excellent customer service, personal development and problem solving. Problem solving could be customer service, planograms, down loaded sales issues, recalls, receiving, janitorial service, safety and daily sales goals."

good,I loved working at Target. I its was such a fun environment and all the other employees where great. WE had fun Friday where we got pizza and other food. We also got to do team building exercises which helped us get to know each other better.
good,This is an amazing place to work if you value Customer Service. The Team Members that work here are fantastic since only fun and happy people are hired!
good,"Typical day at Target is fun. I gained supervisor experience which was a great opportunity. I learned to work in the team and experienced that knowing the personality of your team members makes it easy to work with them and be more productive. It gets little stressful during the holidays, however that can be managed also by making it interesting and fun. I enjoy working with my team."
good,"Big box retail store, very busy. team and process focused. relied on time management and driving for results to accomplish goals"
good,"meeting pour une mise à jour si événement spécial"

good,I enjoyed the people and my surrounding it was fun I never had any problems with any of my co workers or superviors every one I came arcross I grated them with respect
good,The hours were very early in the day which made it great for my other part time job.  Did not have benefits so this is the reason that I left.  Did not have to deal with the guests in the store.  Very physical job.
good,"The team is very friendly and I had any questions I could ask anyone of the team mates, if they didn't know how to help they would take time out of their day to help me find someone that could!"
good,"A typical day at work was, check emails and then out to the floor to make sure the store was clean and ready for our guests. Open registers, open door and then it was making sure that the team members were zoning and putting out stock, checking for expires in the grocery area. Helping guest find the products they are looking for and making sure that our team members were having a great day."
good,"A typical day as a Target cashier is when you first arrive you clock in, immediately you see coworkers in the break room to get to your locker most are friendly and greet you warmly. As you make you way to the front of the store you smile and help any guest who need it along the way, helping guest is always great, they are so appreciative that someone is acknowledging that that need assistance. When you get to your register you log on and begin to check out the guest. It's so great being able to talk to guest about their day and how its going. The worst thing though is when a guest is in a bad mood and no matter what you do they stay that way. Before you even realize it your shift is over and it's time to leave. My time at Target was very enjoyable everyone from guest to coworkers to even management treated me wonderfully and made me feel so welcome. I would absolutely love to work there again."
good,"Working at target was  a great experience, first job I ever worked grave yard shift, It was pretty tough but very manageable/ I enjoyed everything about that job expect the fact that I wouldn't get enough hours."
good,"I had a nice job at the time I need a employer."
good,I love this company greatly.  They treat their employees with great respect and also their customers.  They are really encouraging and care about the well being of their employees on the job and off.  I would recommend working for Target to anyone.

good,"The facility has opportunity for growth, and leadership is great about informing the group on daily productivity. "
good,A typical day at work consist of answering the phones and making sure the customer bring in the correct # of items in and out of the fitting room. Also making sure the fitting room look presentable and the areas are presentable and stocked. I've learned that different people like different things and customer love the opinions of others when it comes to buying a new item. I loved my co-workers and my manager. It was a fun environment. The hardest part is making sure everything is in the right area before closing time. I liked when a customer was satisfied with the items that they bought.
good,As i worked in shifts so my work started various times in a day. Typical day includes meeting of various customers and their transactions. Co-workers were a great help.

good,"Working at Target as part of the management team was fulfilling.  The team member culture was positive, fast, fun and friendly.

good,"Fast - paced, challenging and dynamic place to work. Lots of opportunity for development. World-class leaders and support system to achieve amazing results."
good,"HIGHLIGHTS OF QUALIFICATION"
good,I absolutely loved working at target. I didn't really learn anything new because I already knew what to do. the co-worker were very nice helpful and friendly.
good,"A good company to work for, decent compensation, and shift bonuses. The management was helpful and friendly, internal postings for career advancement. My co-workers were pretty much all okay.
