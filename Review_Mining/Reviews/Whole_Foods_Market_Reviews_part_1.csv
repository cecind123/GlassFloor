rating,review
bad,"I worked at the green bay rd location in Evanston IL. Management over worked you for little pay. For Whole Foods to be such a successful market, employees are extremely under paid for the work given. You go over and behind and it’s not recognized. If you haven’t worked a year and you have a health issue, nobody cares. You will lose your job. The point system is ridiculous. Not a fun place to work at all"
bad,"Favoritism, politics, and hypocrisy are rampant in this company. Its not what you know, its who you're sleeping with that will advance people who have no business being in leadership. If one person decides they don't like you you are as good as doomed. They set you up to fail."
bad,"normal retail every day customers sales etc i was good at merchandising and they loved it, also display building and i loved doing it. It is good culture"
bad,They used to be an amazing company to work for.  They truly cared for their employees.  Then they started cutting everything for profits.  They stopped caring.  Now I see them as an expensive Walmart with what they demand from employees with nothing in return.
bad,Would not recommend working for this company. They say they are supportive of balancing work and personal but that is not true. They seemed to just hire anyone off the street. The people they put in leadership are horrible role models
bad,"Place is a joke.  Management is a complete joke and disappointment. You are forced to work ridiculous hours and cannot leave until the job is done.. if you put in 16 hours 1 day and the job is not complete and you leave cause you have a family at home, they hit you with a leave early. Job advancement and promotion is a joke... Only if you are buddies with members of management will you get promoted. 10byears experience there I've seen it all."
bad,"Moving up in the company is based off who you know and not what you know. Bad manager hire Bad people. "
bad,"I have a passion for baking since a young child. I figured this would be the perfect experience, learning how to bake from scratch, being around experienced bakers. That was short lived. The manager really wanted to make the team feel welcomed and united. However they played favorites. Refusing to alternate schedules, and allow others to express their work. Managers entertaining drama between employees. Managers lying about transfers, even though they stopped the transfer. Strict attendance policy."
bad,"Not very happy with this company or the location I was working at. Empty promises along with half promises, lack of management provided me with nothing but stress"
bad,"Was a great place to work, once the buy out happened, the culture really sunk down. Very fast paced with very little support from the team and management."
bad,The job is terrible not worth it at all if you work I’m prepared foods I feel bad for you no training if you ask for help they will fire you when you are a runner you have to do a lot more work then anyone and don’t expect anyone who is leadership to help they don’t know what it means to be a leader vs a ruler they don’t show by example they just tell you what to do and expect you to automatically know how even if you’ve never don’t it before
bad,it seemed like a great job at first. the people there were really nice and somewhat willing to help you if you needed it. About a month or so into the job things started to change and management really showed their true colors. Avoid all together if you are looking for a job with job security.
bad,"They will squash you in a minute, they are way to big! They don't care about their employees. They run a good business but tell their employees that they are replaceable."
bad,"I quit before Amazon took over but the environment was already toxic. I worked at Whole Foods for seven years and witnessed multiple harassment situations and when I brought it to store leadership, I was told it was my job to keep an eye on the team managers. Nope."
bad,"I was numerously sexually harassed and after taking up multiple complaints with higher ups n nothing was done I decided to leave the company, the job could have been alright if they actually cared about their employees"
bad,"Management is unfair and there is a lot of favoritism. I’m very disappointed in this company, the company itself might have potential. They have to fix management and treat everyone fairly. If you are social then this is the right place for you. I have noticed that if you are social then you can simply socialize throughout your shift. Management also needs to learn how to speak to employees and at least try to understand them."
bad,Never receive a good working treatment the composting area was fake and all that proyect  was fake and all people involve in  that was grown they abused with the people ho use to work in that area
bad,No team work no one cares need to put people in positions that they need to work and stop being and other places they do not be long and people need to concentrate on one job not 10. And no organization people are everywhere workers there need to concentrate on one job that you were hired for. And they need to bring back delivery service
bad,"My time at Whole Foods Market would be classified as chaotic, mismanaged, unclear directives, poor training, and people who are political and want to see you fail. Not once did I feel ""safe"" or ""supported"" in my work, I was penalized for actions that were not discussed before-hand and overall hated my time with this company."
bad,"Managers expect you to do the job of 4 people with no support from them, while they complain that customer service is suffering, and when you explain that you need help doing the job of 4 people, they say they'll help you and proceed to schedule themselves outside the time in which you need help."
bad,The Whole Foods Market Center City Located In Philadelphia PA In No Way Follows Or Instills Any Of The Values They Inform You And Teach You During First Day Orientation They Will Allow You To Be Mistreated As Long As Who Ever Miss Treats Has Status Within The Store And Will Sooner Try To Get You Out Then Help You Have A Safe Comfortable Working Environment.
bad,"I feel sore, stressed and overworked every day with constant anxiety. There is a lot of pressure put on our leadership to put onto us from their global whole foods leaders. As time passes we are becoming more and more understaffed and out of stock of common items we don't have the budget for anymore. It feels like every few weeks something else is cut back or changed to challenge us. Every time a new standard is met through back breaking work the only response is raising the bar higher. This is frustrating to both employees and customers who sometimes drive long distances just to shop at a whole foods. Team members can only do their best working with issues that are out of our control as we also stray further from the original core values of the company."
bad,Whole Foods Long Beach is racist 100% to all of their black employees and they discriminate and put all the blacks in the back in fire blacks for no reason
bad,"8 years ago it is so fun working at wholefoods, good food great people , good company and benefits. But not anymore. they cut everything and to much work load for each employee. That's  why they are always hiring. team members always quit. the company is collapsing."
bad,None. This a  crock of money balls  when at whole foods place to work at. I wouldn't accept all the cruel punishment for what these low lives have towards them its a crock of monkey balls to explain it nicely.
bad,Be nicer and make tour workers feel welcomed instead of making them feel uncomfortable and making them feel like the don't belong... there was a lot of favoritism
bad,"I did not like working here, which is why I left. Poor management leads to workers not wanting to work. And it is sad because it started out as a great place, but the longer I stayed the worse it became."
bad,I like it at first until they dismissed me by bias policy and didn't even acknowledge my written report of untenable co-worker character. Racism is NOT good policy.
bad,They demand full availability for part time hours and even cashier role is arduous because you spend a lot of time wrangling carts which is never part of original job description or interview. $15 an hour is not enough for what they expect both in time and task. Training has cult flavor & the Amazonification is readily apparent in management staggering disconnect to employee basic needs. Asking for a break is a mortal sin and the fear is ingrained in you from day one. There is no room for your humanity here. You are a cog in a brutal wheel and the job will grind you into the tiniest of pieces. Deplorable company run by heartless drones.
bad,"The Whole Foods location I worked at was the Bryant Park location in NYC. They played an EXTREME amount of favoritism. Meaning if you weren't best friends with the manager, you basically ended up doing all of the work no one else wanted to do."
bad,"Poor benefits, lack of growth, you’re just a Id number to them. The pay raises are very small and they don’t compensate you for anything  amazon has ruined the culture and happiness"
bad,"I don't recommend anyone to work at this place because corporate office Manager here don't know how to do their jobs properly. They over stress you every now and then still no appreciation ,and one more point the co-workers have made such a bad practices at whole food's that you feel like you are a school going kid. If you are taking a sick leave you have to give doctor certificate here in short you don't even have right to get sick at this place."
bad,"Since Amazon acquired the company, things have gone downhill. This company has been corporatized to the max. VERY HIGH TURNOVER RATE!!! People are constantly getting fired and you are treated like a slave."
bad,I’ve been here two years now and the pay is good and the work is constant but poorly managed and there is more work to be done than there is workers which makes things stressful
bad,"Came to whole foods after they bought the lease at my prior job,loved it working in Boston,store location was fantastic,sadly the management was a nightmare..alot of department managers/team members/supervisors had attitudes etc.,went in with 13 years of experience in grocery store work,and sadly was not given a way to utilize my personal experience and knowledge,alot of favoritism around the store,very backward idea of value,appreciation..i was let go due to lack of communication and proper training for their new system..would have stayed with the company if the management team was better selected,and had lesser egos and superiority complexes.."
bad,Always under staffed a lot of work to do ... a lot of favoritism . Hours cut randomly ... always having to lean a new safety training because team members always getting hurt ... Having to sign paper work in the daily ...
bad,The store manager should not be managing that store. She is the main reason the employees are happy. Beyond that too much micromanaging. Lot of unwanted stree on everyone to get jobs done
bad,Worked here and absolutely hated it! Management stinks. Had to come in after hours for Department meetings. Ugh! They think way too highly of themselves. The starting wage is nice but not worth the hassle for yucky management and even worse customers.
bad,Not worth the headache to much stress everyone talks about each other no room to advance no sick days team leads are horrible just a bad environment avoid
bad,Benefits are the worst and low PTO. The company is now corporatized since being bought out by amazon. They milk all their employees. Dont work here. There is absolutely no work life balance. Be ready to be a slave.
bad,"Whole Foods management is toxic from the top to the bottom. These people will gaslight you until your head is a living light bulb. Our store manager literally put his hands on one of our coworkers and tried to drag her upstair while she was having a panic attack. They racially profile, give you no tools to be an efficient minion and overwork their people. I know the workforce is getting pretty bad across the globe but 15 dollars isn't worth the mental and emotional abuse these people put you through. They are taking advantage of the youth and the baby boomers who couldn't ride the tech wave. The company itself is on neoliberal bull and try to hide their homophobia, racism, and misogyny behind gauges, tattoos and coexist stickers . Work life balance is horrid because the shifts they give you and try to blame on Kronos never make sense, sometimes you end up working 6 to 9 days in a row. career advancements are there for people who at times dont even ask for it. BAD TRAINING, you get in trouble for things they didnt teach you and if they did it was once like 3 months ago. "
bad,"Honestly don’t work here unless you have no options and want to work as hard as possible for not really worth it pay , you’ll work 10+ hour shifts expected to pick 200 boxes per hour and meet a goal of 1,600 boxes or more per shift and the boxes variety from 40 pounds to 100"
bad,Stay away from this place. They used to be great but now its just corporate and they don't care at all about employees. definitely not worth your time. It'll take forever to earn one day off. Built to cater rich entitled brats who treat you like a robot designed to serve their every need.
bad,This was the worst job experience I have ever had.The management team act like pure children.I cannot and will not advise anyone to work for this organization
bad,Over worked tm never appreciated a lot of favoritism not a good place to work managment does not care about tm just $. Always looking to fire the next person.
bad,"I was shoved into a made-up role but was given no additional compensation, guaranteed hours, or offered any benefits. My code was “Part Time 20” which meant they were only obligated to schedule me up to 20 hours, but I was continuously scheduled 36+ hours and was never offered full-time status or benefits. I was given several responsibilities oiutside of my position, was verbally abused by a lazy team manager. Often, capable team members were overlooked for promotion in favor of managers’ friends. I was used until they had no need for me."
bad,After the Amazon purchase it totally changed. Very discriminatory culture has taken over. No regard for team members. Store leadership is only out for themselves. Horrible place to work
bad,It was a very sorry place to work for dog u out I would never ever work there again it's all about them and nobody else  hope they change soon I don't ever thing they will do that I think they will sell the places very very soon
bad,"Very fast paced, had too much of a corporate feel to it.  Management was very unclear, there were many on staff but never knew exactly who to report to.  Poor communication with what I was supposed to do and when."
bad,"Whole Foods Market is one of the worst jobs I've ever had. The management system currently in place in is absolutely horrible and needs immediate reform. Any concerns are met with hostility and contempt. Work/Life balance is NON-EXISTENT. You MUST dedicate your entire life and soul into Whole Foods or they will CUT your hours.  there is ZERO flexibility on scheduling. The drama that occurred there was like being back in High School, it's one giant popularity contest and any room for advancement is based on your popularity instead of your work ethic and overall merit. Each Day I was given a production list but that production list could never be completed because the walk in cooler was ALWAYS EMPTY and ALWAYS MISSING ITEMS. I cannot complete a recipe with missing ingredients! yet I was the one who was penalized for it!! Normally i would work the salad bar venue, and one day I was helping my coworker at the coffee/juice bar because they were slammed with orders so I helped them out and got penalized for it. There were multiple occasions where I was penalized for helping out another team member. I cannot emphasize enough how much bias and favoritism takes place in this company. As I stated before it is one giant popularity contest and it's a really ineffective way to run a business and only creates low employee morale which is not in alignment with whole foods ""core values"". that they so vehemently like to uphold but never implement in their day to day practices."
bad,"Beware: "
bad,"Stressful day after another. They tell you they care about you but don’t. They terminated me after a painful death in my family (my mother passed) and it was very hard for me they allowed 3 days of grieving... no good and then had me open a new store telling me I’m going to be fine and do great things to only be terminated a week after the new store opened. Talk about unfair oh yea they will use the at will policy to terminate you, beware fellow workers they have a revolving door when it comes to employment"
bad,I pray always that no one these days ever attempts a career or even a job at Whole Foods!  I would only say get a job if you knew it was going to be temporary.
bad,"Management is absolutely horrible!! The workload is way too much compared to the amount of employees to do the work. They constantly add more and more to do without adequate compensation, regardless of how much time and effort you put into the job. They will pass you over for opportunities just to give the job to someone less qualified. They treat ppl like trash."
bad,"A real sweatshop atmosphere "
bad,"iôki"
bad,"I left everyday crying, operating my program with less than 3% labor, whereas the industry standard for this field of work is 11-16%. TYpical day included being harrassed by the store manager (who was later fired), yelled at by angry customers for complete lack of operations storewide. Absolutely no communication. Underpaid and overworked. Worst job  experience of my life, quite honestly a traumatizing experience."
bad,Awful management. They never cared about the staff members. It felt like a dictatorship rather than a leadership. Management had unreasonable expectations
bad,"see above, well don't try to care, it's dangerous and you will lose your job, smile on the hey rides when corporate comes through, every one is a viper."
bad,Extremely poor management. Will take away hours and positions without asking or telling you in advance. Will change your job without asking or telling you in advance. The managers target certain employees and will run that person ragged with constant criticism and 'rule' breakage until they quit. They allow thier favorites to costantly break rules or harrass other employees  and do nothing to stop it. Work enviroment is awful. I wouldn't want my worst enemy to work there.
bad,Poor management and lack of communication as well as won’t advancement. Too many issues and they don’t work together they work against each other as well as most people think they are better then the other
bad,"Management is not accommodating to employee life outside of work, there is favoritism among employees some employees get special treatment while other employees get nothing. Since Amazon has taken over, it has become more like an Amazon warehouse atmosphere. None of the managers will speak to me, they will only talk to certain people they like. It is a very uncomfortable work environment and I do not feel part of the team."
bad,"poor management"
bad,"Terrible company since Amazon took over.  They encourage predatory practices, discrimination, and favoritism.  There are a lot of wrongful firings, now, and management does nothing to correct the situation."
bad,"This has too be one of the worst places I have ever worked, This place has no use for a person that has any ideas of there own to help functionality of the Company also this place has no use for people with experience even though they say more money if you have experience overall if i didn't have to work and pay my bills i would have been left this place. I have over 20 plus years of experience and this place said to me that that does not matter."
bad,"Management needs some major improvement. Very quick turn over rate due to no compassion towards their employees. I would not recommend customer service;  however, other departments may be more tolerable ."
bad,Worst place to work nothing but favoritism and will let you go with no proof or evidence to back up their claims all word of mouth. Also they over work you for $15 an hour with long shifts and short breaks supervisors always threaten to get you fired if you don’t do what they say and your sick time and paid time off are all in one instead of two separate things
bad,The costumers are all rude and entitled. They are never satisfied and constantly make complaints just to get things for free. The costumers would also get you in trouble on purpose just because they had a bad day. They never made me a full-time team member even though i was working full-time hours for months. Staff is very rude and immature and act like they're in highschool. If supervisors or the rest of the staff don't like you they'll do everything they can to get you fired. Staff from other departments watch you like a hawk and spread rumors. They make complaints to your boss for no other reason but because they're bored. Overall i don't recommend it. I worked at the location at Tribeca and it was the WORST. Im happy i quit.
bad,"I don’t think everyone is going to have a negative experience working here, but if you want something better for yourself than 15 an hour then Stay Away. "
bad,"never work their again"
bad,dont waste your time terrible place to work!! they treat you like dirt! team leaders earn overtime while regular cant how does that even make sense?!?
bad,The team leader that work in meat department in Charlestown mass is rude and unfair the are very  racist and they target people of color the job is very high demand if you don’t have any pride or if you don’t want a life outside of work go for it.
bad,The managers do not work with people who are in school at all. They were unable and unwilling to work with me on my availability due to being in college. I changed my schedule and they never updated it.
bad,"That place is like a cult. They have totally unrealistic and ridiculous expectations for their cashiers, they work you to the bone, they monitor your bathroom breaks, and they act like it’s absolute heaven to work there. It’s not."
bad,"One of the best companies to come to Mid-Town Detroit! Great and competitive pay, wonderful atmosphere, helpful team players in every corner, and a place to learn so much and meet new people!"
bad,"Nonunion, low wages, very poor management. Many leaders, but no leadership. Customers are an elite sort of aging hippies. They will pay three times the cost of an item, as long as it was organic. This is not you average supermarket and most people can't afford to shop there."
bad,"good place to work great tream members flexible schedule nice customers clean hard workers store manager cares about the store"
bad,"I started in 2007. Company was great initially raised were given 2x per year, increasing store discounts. Ever since Amazon took over the place has went to the ground. Employees are treated like ROBOTS. Not given sick/vacation time at the beginning of the year. You must accrue it. Worked 78-80hrs. per pay period to earn 5-6 hours of PTO.  No bereavement policy, expected to use the measly PTO hours for EVERYTHING. If you DON'T have enough PTO to cover an absence you get written up. Management only cares about making money. Super clickish"
bad,I loved Wholefoods I worked there for over a decade it was an awesome company.but now they are not. They changed everything that made them standout from all other companies.
bad,"This started at as a great place and turned into one of the worst work environments ever. Management treats workers like garbage, and the customers treat workers like slaves."
bad,"Racism has to stop, I don't understand why as management they couldn't acknowledge people and say thank you for there hard work ! And have the nerve to watch and walk behind you as if you steal for a living. It makes me sick"
bad,"This is a crazy place to work the people can be so rude. But I worked in the warehouse so I didn't go in the store much people."
bad,"Very stressful job in the prepared foods department .  The Team Leader shows favoritism to younger workers. Our schedule changes from day to day, or no one scheduled to work a station so we have to do double and triple the work while other days we have too many people.  He lacks management skills, shows favoritism, disrespectful and has no integrity.  The mature workers do the majority of the work while the younger workers have it easy. Our jobs are constantly being threatened over any little infraction."
bad,the customers are nice and the work isn't too bad either but the management was absolute garbage . The would never keep up with there own policies and displayed clear signs of favoritism
bad,"Out of 5 stars that is available (now that Amazon owns WFM); I've always preformed to the best of my abilities every single first shift; but hag/media/drama set me up for spot-light fails.  Given the outdoor and indoor work environments; gave me 40 hours per week that I had to inspect, adjust, and maintain full acceptance of products from around the world (USA trade) with ""Team Leader"" signing off."
bad,Managment is horrible there it's so unorganized in the food department wise. Vary unprofessional managers that are too prideful and will always blame you for their mistakes. They will take their anger out on you and act childish. They will never act like real professionals. They let's their emotions and personal life affect their job and employees. They will swear at you and around you pointing fingers unprofessionally and always will talk about you to other co workers when you are not there or around. You are walking into a mess if you even consider working here. But no one will blame you its understandable you need to make money and have a job go for it you have a great team there to vent to jus take it from me before you get hired dont let their smile fool you. It's a trap in the begining after your first week that goes away real quick
bad,Terrible benefits if you're part time. They'll make you jump through hoops and dance like a little monkey for a full time position that MIGHT happen after you've wasted another 3 years of your life being broke there. Like any other retail company the management is dysfunctional and they don't care about you or advancing your future at all.
bad,very poorly managed by barons. this is ridiculous that I have to write a review for a job that caused me so much trauma . who ever ends up reading this take a few extra minutes out of your day to reflect. are you happy? every other question that is presented to you by peers . your job is replaceable . you're loved ones aren't . cherish them. peace
bad,"Management was disorganized and rude, the work was slow paced and boring. The company expected us to care about it so much and then refused to pay us. Horrible experience with this place."
bad,Was a great job until Amazon bought them. After that things changed and the environment became stressful and uncomfortable. Management became hard to communicate with and team member moral suffered.
bad,"Everyone is afraid for their jobs, and all of leadership is on a power trip. its just the worst and they ask for more and more everyday with out giving more pay."
bad,whole works use to be a company that appreciate their team members. In the last five years the company has went down. They fired their best employees cause they make to much money and they didn't want to pay them.
bad,"The management only cares about advancing themselves. They were rarely on the floor when scheduled and on top of that, they kept us understaffed and made it known that it was expected of us to do the work of more than one person. "
bad,its all about who you know and how much your willing to look the other way when something wrong is going on. if you speak out about things that are illegal or unfair you will find yourself getting fired quickly.
bad,"I was literally worked tirelessly until my back gave out, then they fired me because I couldn't return to work as ordered b the doctor, while I asked constantly to help in logistics until I healed. I had to fight for medical reimbursement and was left high and dry until I was forced to have personal representation step in."
bad,At Wholefoods to work was very easy as a production Baker everything was choreographed to have the baked goods ready for opening of the store. All in all it was a very stressful experience.
bad,"If you have a disability of any kind, you will be ridiculed on a daily basis. The wrong people are in leadership. They are more out for themselves than helping employees grow. They make newcomers-especially from Amazon feel like an outsider and not welcomed. I would never set foot in a Whole Foods after this experience."
bad,The management is horrible. They play favorites. They talk the talk but don’t walk the walk. Save your self from working for this company.  Htirehoivh;jidffnv;sddkjn;ksjdfnv;kjsdfnv;
bad,just don't apply not a great atmosphere it is only so much one person can take. My short time here felt like the longest years of my life coming into this place.
bad,"The company is atrocious, high turn over rate, nearly zero retention, and poor management.  Look for work elsewhere, the company is in shamble ever since the Amazon takeover, and the employees are the ones suffering."
bad,"This company  or atleast the Sarasota on University location is a complete joke.They constantly are micromanaging and harassing employees about nonsense. The turn over rate is extremely HIGH which explains why the hot food section was never really that good because employees were constantly walking off the job due to MANAGEMENT. They allow the rude customers to speak to them employees anyway they want, without actually being concerned for the employee. They try and use gift card to pacify  issues and as a way of payment instead actually paying the employees. With that being said it is retail. There is a ton of retaliation that happens if you try and speak up. They are looking for robots, so if like being overworked and underappreciated and need a filler job for 3 to 4 months then this is for you."
bad,Every one is on pens and needles worried about getting fired . Very petty attendance policy . Makes you stressed before coming to work               .
bad,I hated working here. They are bias and the customer are annoying. Management are two faced and all they want you to do is brown nose it till the end. I could not. I was just to rea for this place full of fakes.
bad,"not applicable, it wasn't a great experience, a lot of favoritism, vindictive store leadership, unfair treatment, racist comment were often made, toxic work environment,"
bad,"I was put into a job that i was never trained properly for, and when going to a manager to request more training, the answer would be there is no time for that."
bad,"“ Management”  was unprofessional and inept. The employees I worked with were lazy and unsanitary. Frat-house culture thrived i.e. profanity, crude jokes, gossiping and sabotage of work. Extremely shady staff. Proceed with caution when dealing with H.R Dept. Store manager and senior staff are NOT who they appear to be."
bad,Terrible place to work.they wanted new immigrants for lest wages.  the parkinig was terrible.  The distance to and from Destin was terrible.  Cannot afford to live near job because of high price apartments in Destin.
bad,"Don't get fooled by the orientation, its all nonsense. I had horrible management who barely did any work just sat downstairs all day on the computer chit chatting and having fun. Meanwhile the workers are doing all the labor in my department (dairy) not enough workers in this section. We also had a horrible buyer who did not help whatsoever would be times at night I'm working alone unloading 6-8 pallets by myself. Everyone who knows the dairy department is a heavy work load in this department. There is no room for advancement whatsoever so if you have high hopes in growing in a company look elsewhere. Our Fridge was a hazard of every week of spilled milk or juices. Those who worked the night shift did most of the cleaning up meanwhile the day guys would mess it up while we had to also reorganize the milk for different dates which was too much, dealing with boxes of milk as well milk crates. We would get excessive of amounts of yogurt,juices,milk,cheeses that we either had no room for in our fridges and would eventually expire. We would have meaningless meetings about this and co workers would complain but nothing got done whatsoever."
bad,"Unfortunately Whole Foods doesn't provide options for advancement, relocation, or job-training. Many of their hiring decisions are based in bias rather than opportunities for learning or advancement. Pay is barely competitive and employees are kept under specific hours. NO OVERTIME EVER. Very expensive benefits package."
bad,Don't work for this company if you value your free time and your sanity. The management's solution to any problem is to hire someone else who cares less.
bad,"If your not in the in crowd, it doesn't matter how good you are at your job.  Everyone has their own team and doesn't include the company as a whole.  Don't waste your time"
bad,I am disappointed in my experience at WFM. Management doesn't care about employees. You are just a number. Cashiers are treated unfairly. Customers get away with murder. This is a toxic environment for people of color and women. I wouldn't work here again.
bad,"If you like drama, backstabbing and terrible leadership, you may like it there. Its run by kids mostly. Mgmt plays favorites and allows employees to act any way they want. Wholefoods does not support employees, they treat employees line children and do the bare minimum as far as breaks go. They have ridiculous rules and sadly, the moral where I worked was not very good."
bad,You need to be sleeping with the General Manager or his drug dealer to get ahead. High levels of incompetence throughout the company. They no longer care about Team Members and made that perfectly clear. The worst.
bad,"I don't know what to say about this company. I don't think that they consider the lively hood of their employees."
bad,do not care about their employees. all they care about is bringing in new employees at the cheapest rate and keep rotating and bringing in new people so they never have to give raises.
bad,the culture at whole foods market has changed ever since and a little before the buyout. they use to care more about their employees now all they want is the cheapest labor possible.
bad,Management sucked.. it was a boys club. They didn't care about the females. Under paid and over worked. no life work balance. Act like they will give good raises but for the people who deserve good raises they don't give them to them
bad,"Whole Foods had very bad labor practices: gaslighting, bullying, not allowing workers to unionize...DON'T WORK THERE.  Also extremely overpriced.  Some departments are better than others, especially if you just need a parttime gig for a bit."
bad,Wages too low to deal with stress of customer service. Place is going downhill since amazon took over. Cannot set certain hours even after establishing seniority. Only apply to work here if you are desperate for a job.
bad,A very chaotic environment. No clear direction. No teamwork. The pay is ok. The hardest part of the job are the people (both team members and customers).
bad,Never enough stuff working hot bar more then supervise the staff that showed up to work horrible leadership other then some of the other team leaders not in my department
bad,"I worked for them twice. The time I was away, the company changed for the worst. The culture totally changed. Also the managements treatment of team members changed."
bad,"The manager at this location is unprofessional and rude. She embarrassed her employees (who are very nice people overall) in front of customers and treats them like garbage. To make things even worse, Whole Foods stands behind this awful manager. I guess that shows you what kind of company this is."
bad,"Everyone is lit...."
bad,do not  like working here...management do not listen to the employees. I really think whole foods is heading the wrong direction after amazon took over. Benefits wiped out. Thanks Amazon
bad,Management would have no loyalty and would play favorites. Without recognizing hard work that one would bring to table. Co workers and management were the lazy and relied on your work and would think it was all them.
bad,"Actually... literally... seriously... the worst pay for work ratio in a job ever."
bad,"Leadership is extremely poor here. When I started out it, it wasn't bad at all but they hired a manager that constantly seeks to punish and discipline team members. It's to the point that most everyone on our team agreed that she didn't care about any of us and only sought to please higher ups. And nothing was done to reprimand her despite constant, numerous complaints about her. I was expecting a much different …"
bad,"This is the kind of place where the wrong people in the company move up and those who work hard get shot down. "
bad,"these people had no idea what they were doing, the management was terrible, they only go towards other people really. And they had no idea how to care for someone or clean standards in the food department"
bad,A typical day at work was just that WORK! I have learned not to return to work there. Management? Who trains them? Nothing hard about the job. I enjoyed some of my co workers.
bad,When I worked for Whole Foods the company was going bankrupt. The schedule was always subject to change. The management never had time for training and the pay was deplorable.
bad,The atmosphere was intense. The upper management were unprofessional. I only worked there because it was a paycheck. The customers were pleasant to meet. Especially the celebrities
bad,"Management put so much stress on me due to the fact that they were incompetent at their own job and had no people skills or organizational skills. This was not fair or appropriate, because I was paid low while they were piling their own responsibilities on me, a team member. While working there I've heard too many stories about people being let go after years of working for them, how they promote the wrong candidates, and team members were constantly being written up for petty reasons. My ""team leader"" wrote me up because of personal issues she had against me, which had absolutely nothing to do with my job performance. This is what kind of unprofessional people are running their departments and stores, very immature people that sadly never got over high school."
bad,"transfer you at will and if you decline you are fired, had to commute 50 miles each way with no compensation for it and was required to work over 10 hours a day without getting paid for more than 8 hours"
bad,"I started as a part-time with the promise of full -time which never came; I was doing a 3 people job with a joke of pay, working full time hours with part time benefits."
bad,"good grief...talk about a negative management model...nothing positive is reinforced, but anything from clocking in more than two minutes before your schedule to not having a straw in your allowed  water cup, earns you ""infraction points"" that build to oral and written warnings.  Very passive-aggressive communication, signs EVERYWHERE saying ""Don't do this; Don't do that"", etc.  And insurance coverage?  Forget it.  I've been trying to use my coverage to get appts and prescriptions filled and UnitedHealthcare and their associated pharmacies keep losing my account.  WFM is getting rich off of employees paying for medical care but being unable to use it.   And even regular, hourly ""team members"" (ha, team, that's a laugh...""that's not my utensil/tool/etc., I'm not going to wash it, but I will take it out of the sink and set it aside so I can wash what I used) don't work as a team.  It's every man/woman for themselves.  ""Open Door Policy""?  What a joke.  Management (whey they call Store Leadership"") is always in meetings behind closed doors."
bad,"I quit because I had to do the job of 3 people on most days, and was not compensated appropriately for that. Instead of feeling appreciated by my managers for doing all that extra work, they would nitpick ways to complain. They didn't want me to quit but they were treating me badly. I never expected to work with such manipulative people at a grocery store. I don't recommend starting a career with them, their management is very unprofessional and petty."
bad,"Very toxic environment. I worked over 4 years for them and ive worked with alot of people. The bad out weighs the good. Managers dont care about you only sales, they talk down to the team members. They put so much pressure on you that you fail at everything you do. Not a place to build a career like I thought it was, only way is if your close will the managers (they have favorites). I am now a manager at another retailer and im loving it Whole foods made me feel like i wasnt capable of anything and I proved myself wrong I know now that it was whole foods that was wrong not me. The company as a whole used to be good but now its just another corporation."
bad,"I certainly do NOT recommend working for whole foods unless you enjoy a corporate entity becoming extremely invasive towards your lifestyle. If you smoke you're scum, if you don't care about all natural ingredients,  you're scum. Want to earn and keep your own tips? Not at whole foods. Want to make a drink that doesn't involve pre-batched horrific ingredients? Not at whole foods. Want to actually make cocktails with mixers, regardless if the owner of said mixer company rides a vegan bicycle not? Get the heck out of whole foods. I've worked in bars almost 10 years, nobody has over trained, but under-thought the concept of a pub like that garbage whole foods in SHRSHREWSBURY, MA."
bad,"stocking shelves, receiving products, clocking in and out, helping customers, creating backlog, cleaning and communicating with management on the next days orders."
bad,"No training, health insurance cost way too much, the job was unfufilling. Handles medical leave through a horrid third party service, leaving employees screwed often. Shady things were pulled regularly. Customers were by far the worst I've ever experienced."
bad,"basically working like a slave and no appreciation whatsoever. They want you to do more with less workers sit around and talk but no working. The managers don't train properly,"
bad,I was in te meat deparment for 5 months everything was cool the first three months but the last two they started making me close the whole jamboree locations meat deparment by myself at least 3-4 times a week and when i bring up the situation they try to say its my fault and dont own up to anything they have done wrong
bad,Absolutely awful company to work for. Don't care about employees only about the bottom line. Will do anything to save a buck or two. Hang employees out to dry on difficult days.
bad,The work environment and pay  were great but the managers never knew what they should be doing so they would follow you around and get mad for not doing extra without being asked.  I was a bartender but was written up for not cutting cheese on the opposite side of the store without being asked.  It was not a part of my job expectations or description so I left.
bad,There are a lot of benefits that they never tell you about and the management experience I had was very poor. It has a lot to do with favoritism there.
bad,The job demands a lot of flexibility for scheduling. Management is uptight and business first focused. You do get points for being late or calling out sick. As a cashier you can easily escalate to a final warning if you forget to give cash back. Not all departments are the same. But customer service is the worst team at this store.
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance: stressful, the environment is unorganized and exuding with tension."
bad,"they bad habit talk much, and other they had problem schedule, call out. they can be terminated.. they want you work hard. Because it without supervisor overnight. they played.."
bad,"The store manager at the Franklin, TN Wholes Foods location does not know how to handle legal issues professionally. And that is most likely why they got sued. Their H.R. personal is also unprofessional."
bad,"A lot of people tell on each other to get ahead and think they are the best at what they do but don't realize how incompetent they actually are. Endured harassment from the time I started. HR did nothing about it and had to wait for the guy to quit.  Leads in customer service take out their personal issues on employees. Always a lead being rude ,micromanaging or going off on an employee. A lot of these people they hired seemed to have some sort of mental issue. It was a weird place to work."
bad,whole foods is a very racial place to work they addressed the people of color as you people if that's not racist i don't no what to tell you poor poor leadership
bad,Bad management running the store. It'll be surely run into the ground shortly with the new store manager and her minions. Sad to see it go down like that but that's what happens when you hire garbage people to run a store.
bad,"I hated working at Wholefoods.  The hours were crazy.  Different everyday and every week.  Grueling.  Terrible pay.  Bad, inexperienced management.  Like high school.  The only good thing about this position for me was that it showed me what I absolutely didn't want to do with my life."
bad,The management sucks from the store director down to department managers. No one knows how to properly run there department. They refuse to help with anything
bad,"Quit my first week. No guidance, I had to show the manager how to clock in after his lunch break during my 1st training day. When you call for your schedule nobody ever calls you back so you are constantly wondering wtf is going on. People are rude, place is gross behind the scenes."
bad,the worst management. no one cares. everyone gossips about each other. not the right place to make any friends either. people just suck. some are cool..
bad,"Maybe, whole foods is a great place to buy food/eat, but not so much to work.  You are not given a chance to flourish your ideas, etc. if you're not in a high position."
bad,"I would not recommend working here. Constant rule changes, everyone is very rude, and the benefits are far too expensive. If you're looking for a part time job I highly recommend looking elsewhere."
bad,"Whole Foods is a very demanding, low paying, horrible benefits job. They treat you like you are not even human. Supervisors made me feel like I had lost all my dignity, was very happy to quit to move on to a better job."
bad,not at all fun. very stressful. typical routine. didnt bring much change. it was great only during rush hours. be sure to give good cutsomer service. i was not satisfied with the managemnt team
bad,90% of the store's associates no longer work there. This place is horrible. Whole Foods Mobile should be shut down. The hot bar food is recycled from the night before.
bad,"didn't like this job at all they were very strict  about everything clothing to policies they had , you can drink a whole bottle of juice or meat or a bakery item and they would still refund you for your purchase"
bad,I was employed here for over 13.5 years. Over the years this place has become a much less than desirable place to work. They are constantly behind in proactive employment and always changing their polices and taking away benifits. I do not recommend this place for employment.
bad,The management cares nothing for the employees.  They do absolutely nothing.  All I see is them standing around gossiping.  They provide no kind of support at all.  If you work here you will hate within the first week.
bad,"This company makes money by looking like they care about the environment, food, and their employees but they do not. Same business policies as Wal-Mart."
bad,"the store had poor management , leadership, it lacked guidance, vision and aid "
bad,"this company is falling apart. management is horrible, 0 of the core values are respected. security, i don't think they know what it is."
bad,"I worked at the Columbus Circle location in New York City, and I have to say that it is the worst job I've had to date. I was a front end cashier working under the most awful, argumentative, abrasive Team Lead who has no respect for team members. I've watched them berate team members ON THE SALES FLOOR. There isn't much room to move up in the company either, if the right people haven't taken a liking to you. It's a very draining, demanding job with little upside."
bad,Dirty kitchens two faced team members and management. Will not help you to exceed. Culture is completely backwards no support for management old broken equipment norovirus inside the kitchen. Do yourself a favor do not work here better to be unemployed
bad,"unwilling to let me work to earn pay, asked to clock out as often as they could ask me to clock out. Onesidedness of the Leadership as one employees opinion matters more than mine."
bad,The best part of the job is the diversity of the staff! you learn a lot about grocery retail. you work hard get paid well. Must have open availability.
bad,"Good pay and benefits (and yes, while I ended my career as an STL, I started as a part-time team member)."
bad,"I had worked for them for  a long time and even transferred to Arizona  on a recommendation. The time came to take my vacation that was approved (to visit my sister just back from Iraq, not a vacation) told it wasn't then quit."
bad,"The scheduling is not good, benefits expensive, and company doesn't care about helping you advance.  Company claims to be one of the best to work for, but it is not.  Hours are cut quite a bit and you don't always have enough staff to be able to do your job.  They care more about profit than anything.  Also, they have a terrible system if you are ill and cannot work."
bad,Walgreens company does not pay their employees a livable wage. There is no growth in this company and they do no encourage employees to want to grow to better their lives and the lives of their family. I will never work here again!
bad,prepare food. nice customer. learned to be patient. get treated unfair is the hard part. clocking out is the most  enjoyable part of my job
bad,"takes advantage of workers."
bad,the manager i worked with would only give instruction yo her fellow Spanish workers other than that as a whole the company is a good one
bad,This place is a joke. They play favorites. They will sell you a dream about how great they are when it reality its just a souped up Walmart. Definitely NOT a fun place to work.
bad,"when i first got there i had a very good time and then that turn for the worst. the management are very critical of everything you do and they are very rude. they don't give you a chance to prov yourself for a long time because if they feel like you don't fit in they will fire you, even if there is a month."
bad,Understaffed and very busy! I would be so stressed working here and so would the manages so the environment was very bad! I also got treated very badly
bad,"I currently do not have a job, and the only job I have ever had was working on cars with my dad. This is difficult for my dad to make money since business is crashing because of the economy. I learn very valuable information."
bad,"A typical day would be our pre meeting about what the numbers are for the day and what we can work on and than we would start to fulfill our orders until we finished . One good thing I got from this company is the experience . But other than that this was probably the worst experience I have ever had in a work place . The hardest part was dealing with the drama between the co workers and the management that only cared about numbers, so if you perform well you can get away with anything .On top of that they had no clue on how to lead the employees and there were cases of racism when I was here .  When it happened to me nothing was done about it, instead I was lectured about how I handled the situation . Since the person who called me a racial slurr performed highly in selection ."
bad,"A typical day of work would be the sushi chefs bossing you around, telling you what to do because you're not on their level. I learned that if you're not from their country they will treat you like you're nothing. Management was below standards, some coworkers complained that the supervisor was unprofessional, he would always leave an hour early and would just call out because he felt like it. The hardest part about the job was being surrounded by Asians the whole day, giving you dirty looks and talking in their language while you didn't understand them. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alone because you didn't have nobody bossing you around and being judged. They say every 3 months you get a raise if you know what you're doing but that's all lies."
bad,"Just cut over 2,00 jobs before holidays. They also plan to cut around 10,00 jobs in the next eight weeks. They higher up face to get higher bonuses now while regular high paid veteran team member get canned after working there for upwards to 20 years for sum. Not a good company to start your life with right now. I got fired after five loyal years."
bad,"Leadership schemed to have me dismissed from the team without valid reasons. I was brought into an unlocked storage room by the store manager and the head of human resources, where I was informed that I no longer worked for the company two days after a notice was filed without my knowledge. When I asked to view documentation of said dismissal, the store manager and head of human resources refused to show me. This matter is on-going..."
bad,its ok but the leadership sucks they don't care about their workers customers are always right even when they are wrong.
bad,"The company is rated as being a great place to work.  Don't know who they asked, because most of the employees were treated badly."
bad,"a typical day at whole foods was coming to  work knowing you were not like. I learn nothing at all work issues was not  explain very well"
bad,Terrible company to work for no respect for hard working employees
bad,"First off, I do want to say that there are some nice people in whole foods, mostly just people working hard to pay their bills on what little they make. The rest is just horrible. A typical day of work is you clock in, and before you can take a break, you are bombarded with rude customers who expect you wait on them hand and foot. They talk down to you because you work at a GROCERY store. The worst part is, even if a customer flat out belittles you, it is your fault and the company would rather fire a great employee then defend them. Anyway, lets talk about the work. You are usually OVERWORKED and expected to do the job of 2 and 3 people at the same time IE wait on counter while you prep items and clean at the same while they give you other task as they are understaffed to save money on labor. Then heres the best part, after breaking your back for a few dollars, you get told that you need to step up your game and have a better attitude. The leadership here is a JOKE. very unprofessional. I have seen my leadership disappear every time a pretty face walks by. Have seen and heard leadership talk to customers in an unprofessional manor and get away with it. If you are not the company pet, don't expect decent hours and expect to work weekends.... ALL weekends. I have seen things happen in different departments that would make people stop shopping here, IE prep foods, bakery and meat. this is not slander, the is truth. The company only cares about profits and squeezing all they can out of the workers for little to no reward. Most workers are unhappy but afraid to talk in fear of losing"
bad,This is probably one of the worst jobs I've ever had when it comes to management. People are constantly leaving or getting fired. The turn over rate is extremely high. Customers are rude and talk down to you a lot.
bad,This place tries to indoctrinate you into theri belief system like a cult. You are working as a drone in a grocery store and the corporate side does not care about you. But all the drones are convinced that they do. Thank god that not all of my co workers bought into that junk. Good compenation for an unskilled position however. It was a good job for me when i was 19 and in college. I would not make a career here however even though they will try to convince you that you should.
bad,"Full time Pastry Chef."
bad,"This was the worst company I've ever worked for. Everything was okay for the first year and not a day more. I could not believe the unprofessionalism I witnessed by management and the store leadership. I have never been criticized by management because I didn't high five my coworkers when I came in.They have this everybody hug atmosphere. Don't buy into the ""we are a family nonsense""."
bad,"Teams are lined with bullies, breaks are rediculously short and you tell them you specifically can't work a certain night due to volunteering at a youth club and they put you down as working that night every week! Pay is average but hours are stupid with the store dead most of the time and they just don't really care much.."
bad,"One of the worst work experiences I have ever had, management are unfair, unjust, negative, and not qualified as leaders.Playing at being retailers"
bad,"Over all the work was fine. But management isn't the greatest, the coworkers have a habit of taking one look at you and judging your off the bat. Also they vote as to whether or not you can stay at your 90 days, and management does nothing if your a good worker and the coworkers vote you to leave. I advise to stay away from whole foods."
bad,"I worked at Wild Oats for 10 years. Whole Foods came in and took over, after ceo of Whole Foods, John Mackey ran an internet smear campaign against Wild Oats for years so he could acquire Wild Oats cheaper. That's the kind of punk who runs Whole Foods. (I read another employee review on this site that said he couldn't mention the ceo's name but called him the devil). Well I can, and will mention his name. JOHN MACKEY."
bad,"After 3.5 years of being a top producer as produce team leader I caught my Store Manager lying to me about two of my employees. I went to hr and was told to get over it. The employees went to the ""anonymous"" ethics tip line and within five minutes were summoned to the office of the manager they were complaining about. All of us have been fired. They also have implemented a program where other departments ""dumpster dive"" into the produce garbage and compost for product to sell in the prepared foods department. Stay away from the Park City salad bar!"
bad,"If your a HS student or a college student this job is more preferably for them. I wouldn’t recommend anyone who has real life responsibilities this type of work for employment. You get harassed by customers, you have no one to go to for protection of workers. There’s no Confidentiality at this work place. Everyone knows and shares your business throughout the store. Paid maternity leave sucks, no one shows you steps that needs to be taken to reassure coverage for time out. The job only cares to protect the company and its name not so much as the employees at the job."
bad,They pile more and more workload on one person in a day. Always understaffed is the reason for this. People come and go in this company I know why now. Mangers make it out to be your problem and not theirs. Not hiring keeps labor hours down for them and harder on the employees working here.
bad,"The way the staff makes you feel if your not spanish is outrageous and racist. They keep people that isn't Hispanic at the bottom of the company with not room for growth. Management (who also is Hispanic )would see who works hard using them for heavy duty and hard work while others talk to them all day(Hispanic). Wholefoods cuts hours when they don't make money for the month they give use 16 hr weeks"
bad,"They treat their employees like absolute garbage, you’re anxiety is through the roof before you even enter, it drains everything you have in you...the only plus is that they pay more then most grocery stores will but I’m telling you it’s really not worth it...management could care less about the people that work for them and help keep the place afloat...seriously stay away"
bad,"Poor management, point system is terribly set up, if you live in MN during the winter and it's the frozen tundra and your car doesn't start for 3 days and you miss your shifts you get points towards being terminated. Barely get time off, no work/life balance."
bad,"I worked in the produce department in Danbury and the leadership is just the worst. Its a good company just really bad choices when they hire TL and ATL's. Theres no real recognition to employees just favoritism, core values are a big lie, and scheduling is really bad."
bad,Too much to type...but this company shows partiality big time. There was even a suicide with an employee while I worked there and it was blamed on she was assured to get a promotion and didnt get it...you can have this company!
bad,"Management didn't do their jobs correctly, scheduling was a nightmare, it was always wayyy understaffed, we were constantly out of food, didn't have enough time to do our jobs. I would never recommend someone to work there."
bad,I found Whole foods to be completely disorganized. They set arbitrary rules that cannot physically be followed and hen hold you accountable for them not being done to their satisfaction.  My store managment was abusive and completely incompetent.
bad,"It used to be fairness, a fun place to work now, it's like they hire to fire so leadership can earn stripes as a season leader. Open door is not really open door, you will be judged."
bad,"It’s amazing because you can see how this place tears you down. People start the job excited and their customer service is excellent! Then as time passes by you see how miserable that person has come to be. I have things thrown at me, I’m yelled at, blamed for things outside of my department, called derogatory names, and told I can’t defend myself from customers. I must let them hit me and walk away (I’m serious)"
bad,Whole Foods sold itself to Amazon and Amazon's corporate culture of devaluing its employees and not giving them benefits has become the norm. Whole Foods has been taking benefits away from employees rather than giving them.
bad,"Discriminatory management, wrong person in the position, if you are not close to manager(s) they will never give you a chance to advance yourself but instead they put their favorite in the position. Working in Wholefoods is not what you know but whom you know."
bad,"When I was hired the company motto was, ""We surprise and delight our customers."" That was an old motto that represented the approach to customer service in the early days, that was no longer in practice. Profits came first. It's gotten worse over the years. Now the employees openly do not care about customer service and the company doesn't bother to train anyone."
bad,"When I first started at Whole foods I felt it was a great job with multiple opportunities for advancement. Now reality has sunk in and I (personally) don't see it the same. No offense to the company, but I personally must move on."
bad,The leadership team at Oracle does not follow the core values.  It’s a toxic environment where incompetent and cruel individuals over work and bully the team.
bad,"Whole Foods has good benefits for employees. It provides health, dental, vision as well as  401k and stack options. Also offers opportunities for employees advansment. I really enjoyed working there, because they have flexable schedule and easy to get along with a coworker."
bad,I learned many things about workplace politics here. They had too many bosses per team and not all of them worked together which made my job harder. They do have good benefit packages.
bad,"Terrible culture, so much neppotism on managements part that there is no room for advancement, cuthroat everyday feels like they are looking for a reason to fire you, if your not gay vegan or transgender , every member of leadership will belittle you while they stare at there phones or emails,"
bad,Whole foods puts unrealistic expectations on all employees!!!!  They expect your to fit 100 hours of production into 38 hours. Upper management does not back team leader decisions.
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 months as a cook in their Prepared Foods Department. I was apart of a store opening. They tried to sell every single applicant that it is a great company. It is not. Stay far far far away. If you have doctors appointments, kids, a life outside of work- DO NOT WORK FOR THESE PEOPLE. They do not care about their employees what so ever. The pay is great but if you want to be more than an employee number look somewhere else. Management sucks and so does it HR dept. They won't do a thing to fix an issue."
bad,"The schedule changes everyday , there’s no set schedule, doesn’t work around other jobs or school ,"
bad,Whole Foods changed from encouraging risk taking and learning from mistakes and embraced transparency.  Amazon however punishes being creative and is very secretive.  It's similar to trying to figure out the man behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz.
bad,it is not good there the managers are all just cashiers that kissed bu** to gain position while the real hard workers get left behind as cashier because you can't loose a great cashier at whole foods they are the face but if a cashier isn't as good but is friends with a manager already then they can get taken off the register and get a 2 dollar raise it's unfair
bad,whole foods is a company ripe with discrimination. People of color only get higher paying jobs to meet quotas for diversity. you wont be treated equally.
bad,"The creative positions were blatantly taken advantage of at a regional level. Left to fulfill the expectations of 5 people's workload without proper training or guidance. Superseded the output of my peers, and still ended up losing my job because of poor management of the company's brand and identity on a global level."
bad,Mostly non college educated management which prevents people with more experience from moving up. Company and management that thinks very highly of themselves for little reason.
bad,"This company tries its hardest to not be ""corporate."" This turns the whole company into a mass of confusion. If you don't fit in with the ""culture"" of Whole Foods you will not advance, no matter what your skill set. They are constantly cutting budgets and people.  This leaves the people left after these cuts with extra job responsibilities, but no extra pay or time.  They preach an employee focused workplace, but the majority of people working there are not happy."
bad,"Worked at the flagship Lamar store just before opening, was great and then fell apart, the culture, leadership, benefits, and just continues to get worse from the people I know that still work there. I would never ever work there again or recommend that anyone else does."
bad,"Work hours were insane and despite the fact that the construction team was labeled as 'the hardest working team in the office', nothing was ever done to address the issues they faced. No additional compensation was offered and often the team would get yelled at -literally and in front of others- because someone on the executive side had changed their mind about something in the project. There was little to no support from anyone on the executive team, and work life balance and team member happiness were never a consideration. Not all the regions are this bad, but the Northeast definitely is."
bad,"Horrible place to work if you are in Payroll. Management is horrible, coworkers are snotty little girls. Too much work in too little time , very stressful. First you must endure 1-2 panel interviews. Then if you are offered a position it is not guaranteed until your team ""votes"" you in or out within 6 months. It reminds me of the game Survivor. Stay away!"
bad,The base pay is fair. Benefits bad. No transparency. No drug testing so know who you work with. It is true to be successful don't say your opinions or business observations just say yes and nod your head. Not for critical thinkers. Yes men. Not just customers steal see where all the camera s are?
bad,"The schedule is constantly changing on an almost daily basis. Some team members were fired because a manager changed the shifts without telling them about it. "
bad,"too much expectations."
bad,"The store I work at does not promote from within, they mistreat employees. I worked there for over three years and feel like any day they might fire me. They micromanage everyone."
bad,"Very little concern in providing a safe, functional work environment.  Very serious safety issues go unaddressed."
bad,"With lay-offs constantly an option, the company that once was full of life and prosperity is now run on fear culture.  You must have open availability for any role other than a part time employee, making work-life balance non existent."
bad,"The management never takes into consideration your skills that you bring to the job, I came to Wholefoods because I heard about the Team Member Support and Happiness with an emphasis on wholesome organic and natural food preparation, working with people who claim to believe in the wholefoods philosophy, With over 30 years culinary background, they think the best possible fit is tearing open bags of slop for the hot foods bar. The prepared foods are neither wholesome nor delicious!!"
bad,"Not a very good company. Starting from upper leadership down to team members. Everyone hates their job and looking for a way out. They wait until you make one mistake to play the gotcha game. Extremely unfair, racist, discriminatory, and play favorites. Worst company I've ever worked for in my entire life. And the pay is terrible."
bad,Whole Foods Market has changed drastically since 2013. A typical work day is you without any management performing far too many tasks at once. The lack of leadership allows for team members to perform however they want.
bad,I have been a Vegetarian for over 7+ years and love the lifestyle. I thought it would be great to find a job at a store that has the same values as I do. When I started working for whole foods it was wonderful. Great pay benefits and best of all quality and availability of foods. I would be able to provide products to customers which relied on these. Changes happened where whole foods would not tell us why we did not carry these products or if we will get products like it. A shift also happened in the way they treat employees as well as giving raises. A lot of great people left the store because of loss of jobs do to labor cut and wanting to keep more money to themselves.The teams you work on are small so you have a high physical expetensy. The sad thing is they give terrible benefits and do not have a union so employees do not have a say in what we can elect and not. If you get injured be prepared for a work nightmare and having to deal with the humiliations of it. You can not work until you have been cleared by a doctor and you have to go through every level of management of the store about it. What happened to light duty work? IT is a whole different experience when you work for the company
bad,"The company's stock has plummeted, so the higher-ups are taking steps to save the company money by cutting jobs, salaries, and benefits. They recently cut a bunch of mid-management jobs and offered those people another job at a much-lower pay, but for some reason those same arbiters of ""reasonable spending"" don't seem eager to slash their own wages."
bad,Management lied about hours employees would receive and employees regularly stole sales from other employees. Overall horrible place to work
bad,"I had heard such great things about Whole Foods and took an ENORMOUS PAY CUT to go to work for the company.  My manager was horrendous...born and bred Whole Foods.  The company practices HR with tunnel vision, is rigid beyond belief (except for pot smoking), and provides terrible pay and benefits.  "
bad,"Start at 8 am.  At 10:30 I have to have 12 different kinds of salads and 4 kinds of desserts. From 1:00 pm until 4:00 pm I am responsible for maintaining all these 16 spots plus 10 more with hot food. Management never happy and never say Thank you. "
bad,"It is a very degrading job. Whole Foods acts like it doing you such a great favor to employ you at a grocery store. Really, it is just a grocery store which means a survival type job with barely any career advancements. The culture is overly micro managed. They have 4 reviews in a month on employee performance. The first one is after three days. That is not enough time for people to get the fill of a job. Also, it is a waste of money to pay people to sit there and nit pick."
bad,"One of the worst work experiences I have ever had, management is unfair, unjust, negative, and not qualified as leaders."
bad,"Very unfair environment, I can speak for myself and others when I say this"
bad,Multiples times team members asked for the required dishwashing gloves (without holes in them) but were told I have them upstairs dont worry by Teamleader. When asking about getting more butcher coats we desperately need since some team members have resorted to reusing unsanitary work uniforms we were told the store is on hard times.
bad,Very much like going back to high school. The store was very “click-ish” and if you weren’t s cool kid you would be punished. But by your scheduling and by your peers
bad,"At first the job was fine. But, the management at Whole Foods which includes the store managers and my managers from the produce department completely ruin the job by their utter lack of ways to communique to their employees every day they find new ways to get on you and say it in a way that is very negative."
bad,"Whole Foods at the start was an ok place to work, but my experiences were not the greatest.  There was some favortism between higher ups and regular workers.  It kinda felt like if you weren't the cool kid you weren't needed.  Don't let the pay be the reason you work there because I didn't find it worth it, but I guess it just depends which location you are at and the people you work with.  I personally based on my experience wouldn't work there, but don't let my experiences decided for you."
bad,"This is a Klick for grownups. Favorites are played and long term employees are just that because they play a complex HR system. If you know how to play ball the healthcare makes it worth the effort. Other then that be Prepared for endless meetings about how to get things done with not much time to actually get things done because of the endless meetings. Also, schedules are constantly changing"
bad,Typical day at wholefoods is attitude . You say Good morning and it is go 33 that the register.I think that is so rude .Just little hi how are u doing would be ok.
bad,"In the beginning of starting with the company was nice then after getting use to everything scheduled by myself once a week excepting me to get backups for the case and clean and fill the case help customers if no one called off in either pizza department or for fresh pack i had help towards the end of the night only"
bad,Used to be at least 4 stars. After change of management and being bought out by Amazon nothing matters but pushing Amazon sales. Super high turnover rate and with good reason.
bad,Management from the Bedford avenue location are very unprofessional very ghetto and honestly it’s the most highschool-ish group of grown women and men very catty promotes drama no room for growth if they don’t like you
bad,I had to leave the company due to health issues and they pretty much planned to get rid of me. They gave me papers to sign that I would be ineligible for rehire without explaining to me what I was signing.
bad,"Don't waste your time here.  The benefits are weak, the pay is below the market, and there is no opportunity for advancement.  Pay / bonus structure / merit increase / job description policies are constantly changing."
bad,"Leadership is lazy and backstabbing. They deligate and take responsibility for all successes. Never on the floor. Never work weekends, nights or holidays. Don’t have a clue what goes on. Only look at the numbers!"
bad,"From a feel good hippy start up full of compassion and team work, they became a hypocritical greedy corporation. They threw their best employees who made the company out on the street (some literally became homeless) banked the money and then sold everything to a larger corporation. From long hairs to suits."
bad,"Culture change, maximizing profits at cost of employees."
bad,"WFM was a company where it paid to be friends with the boss. Working hard was rarely recognized. They didn't understand that sometimes emergencies came up. They were sometimes harsh regarding attendance policies. The great employees rarely stayed in the company. Its a job that most people took because they needed the paycheck and wanted the discount (yet they were left overworked, stressed, underpaid, and still unable to afford some of the products sold at WFM)."
bad,"I was so excited about the opportunity to work at Whole Foods in Memphis. I trained in Germantown, Tennessee and was sent to Memphis, and I worked in the bakery. The bakery manager was not familiar with baking terminology and often times made it difficult to follow food standards because he didn't understand baking and pastry. He was also very unfair to part-time workers and students who were in university."
bad,It’s a company that rewards people who hang with the in gang. You get promoted by knowing people not necessarily know the job...and meetings are more important than getting your job done in 8 hours
bad,"Has so much potential, but “leadership” ruins the whole experience by not understanding the difference between actual leadership skills and management skills. There’s also too much office politics, inner circles and cliques who profess favoritism amongst each other leaving a tremendous gap of holding people accountable for their actions, even when they know they are deeply in the wrong."
bad,"If you enjoy managers that went to school for a degree in the arts and are bitter because they have no place to implement their skills using their useless degrees, then by all means this job is for you. "
bad,"I've worked in multiple departments at this store and experienced some biased or poorly trained management/team leaders who would lie on, scapegoat and bully employees, stressful unrealistic and unfair expectations placed on kitchen staff leading to unsanitary conditions. I've witnessed bad treatment especially of the dishwashers where they place the sole responsibility of the ""dishwasher"" to heat up and maintain soup stock and prepare rotisserie chicken while maintaining a busy and understaffed dish room at the same time, they will blame the dishwasher for being unable to keep up with the unrealistic workload expectations rather than address the shortage of staff. Some of the inexperienced or negligent team leaders/management encourage cutting corners to meet the unrealistic workload thus causing unsanitary conditions such as unthoroughly cleaned cookware and improper food handling. Some of the team leaders/department heads/management will praise the negligent and punish the diligent and often discuss an employee's disciplinary action or personal information with coworkers whom should have no privilege. It's difficult or impossible to find or approach any level of management to address the problems at this store, so most people choose to quit. If you apply for a job here, you'll be wise to address some of these issues that you read about in this review in hope that the management will push for change or you'll at least recognize what type of work environment you maybe walking into if work environment isn't improved. There are many other problems experienced while working here"
bad,"Overall not a pleasant. Nobody worked as a team. Management was okay. Work was not hard, just fast pace, The hardest part of the day was putting up with some of the coworkers, and the best part of the day was when it was over."
bad,Worst experience i ever had at a job. Not only are the stores filthy they use rancid food for the hot bar on the regular. Managment is the worst i habe ever seen. They are allowed to verbally and sexually harass you.
bad,"The head manager was wonderful, but the kitchen manager (Shift Lead) was a piece of work. The stress from that job was not worth working there. I had to be put back on my anti-anxiety meds because the work environment."
bad,"WFM expects employees to perform at the highest level while paying a minimum for the position they hold.  They do not respect your opinion and the ""Open Door"" Policy is rather closed. "
bad,"I worked at wholefoods for over a decade and when I resigned with notice, I was walked to the door, no thank you.  and asked never to return.  this company is very political and has a long memory."
bad,"Too much internal propaganda, capitalism at its finest BS-ometer. Good if you work on a team that gets a lot of gainsharing and doesn't share with the whole store."
bad,It was honestly the worst 3 months of my life. The Bayhill location in Orlando Florida has very horrible management.  Team members happiness is not a core value at that location. I hated every moment of it . I don’t believe every Whole Foods is horrible I just think the location I was at was the worst. I honestly Want to give no stars
bad,"i learned how to prepare meat and seafood for safely and efficiently for customers. management was poor, they were degrading to some employees. dont care about employee needs and will recklessly change your schedule at anytime even if that schedule doesn't work for you."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was going into the freezer and pulling out all the bakery items and lifting them up, dealing with other coworkers and the managers"
bad,"Worst job I ever had in my life,the manager was a drunken dope addicted person who only looked out for his self, working was hard because I had to do everything by myself at the Goldcoast location"
bad,"typical day: alternating hours of cashiering, cleaning, and picking up carts."
bad,"incredibly dishonest company that promotes a bully culture to keep the bulk of employees revolving in and out."
bad,"It doesn't matter how great of an employee you are. ..If you have just one personal emergency, they will fire you. Also, don't eat at this place..never seen such disgusting sanitation standards.  The place is so busy and disorganized that the staff rushes to move raw meat from one counter, to putting fresh vegetables on the same surface without washing the area thoroughly.  Food sits around at room temperature for hours. Management doesn't oversee their areas and doesn't have a clue. Don't work here, don't eat here"
bad,"Management changes often and varies store by store and is often clannish and condescending to cashiers and employees of other departments. This affects the overall morale and attendance of the employees and causes the customers to take note of the less than friendly attitudes of certain employees, particularly those in leadership."
bad,"Management was not ready to fulfil that role. Not a lot of opportunities to grow within the company. In the end, we were made redundant weeks before Christmas."
bad,"Whole Foods Oakville has an issue with rampant harassment in the workplace, horrible management that involved threats and humiliation, and a heartlessness that extended to laughing while questioning me about having to take a day off for my grandmother's funeral. Do not work here."
bad,"The employees I worked with were hard workers and good people."
bad,"If you want to be treated like a number and not a name, join the SW offices of WF's.  I sacrificed years of my life for this company and in the end they just cut me to the bone"
bad,I was verbally abused by customers and management daily. Point system for absences is absolutely ridiculous. Only good part of the job were my fellow coworkers who also hated management.
bad,The environment around this place is that you are to commit 100% to their philosophy and that still doesn't mean you will move up. The upper management all know each other and positions are not always awarded based on who is best suited for the job. There is A LOT of gossiping and management actively participates.
bad,"Please do not work here. Its not worth the stress. They do not appreciate any of their employees. Managers do not do anything, they play favorites and you can never advance unless they like you for no apparent reason."
bad,"My Whole Body team leader has forced many good employees to quit, doesn't help the team do well in sales, is unorganized, and spends most of her time in the back room brainstorming new ways to manipulate her own team members. It is beyond me as to how this person still has their job, but this is an example of what kind of people this company keeps around, at least in the Midwest region."
bad,"The environment at whole foods is not a good one if management likes you are good, but disagree with what they say and you will be punished. no loyalty, no support from upper management. regional vice presidents will not back you up."
bad,"I was a former employee who opened the port chester store... they are ungrateful, treat their employees like s***, at one point i had moved up and got demoted for doing my job when a fabricated story was presented to management and they didnt even look into it. they will take advantage of you as most as they can"
bad,"I spent the last year working there , and it's been a nightmare , the turn over rate is very high , you only get 20% off food , they look to fire full time employees so they don't pay for benefits"
bad,"Filled with lies and  favoritism especially from management.  Important equipment around the store breaking, management is to greedy to put out the money to help fix things, workers unhappy. That's why there constantly hiring people cause they can't keep workers. Worst place to work. Only thing good about WholeFoods is the little people that do what they have to so they can keep there jobs."
bad,Poor communications between management and employees. No balance of work and life. One of the worst places I have ever worked.
bad,"they sell organics and natural foods, but they are now exactly like a conventional market in every way.  the culture is just good marketing and another sales pitch.  its a good job for a young person to feel like they are getting ahead, but stay in school and do something worthwhile in your life instead of working at the FOOD HOLE!!"
bad,Treat loyal employees there that have been there for years like garbage and treat everyone as an ID number. Please don't ever work there because the environment is awful and the leadership team is a bunch of uneducated people that think they know what they are doing.
bad,Whole foods fired me for eating a few pieces  of chicken . As a matter of fact I was there almost 6 months and on an average  there fired 3 people aweek. They have no loyalty  to there employees.  Not only that they took my last paycheck  because they said I owned them. They rather throw  food away  than let and employee eat.  I never cooked anywhere that didn't allow you to eat. 8.99 a pound for food who can  afford that
bad,"This place Is vey bad management Is very bad everything about this company Very bad they run in the office tell on each other, they have three or four employees they baby the rest they treat lvery bad work 17 maybe 18hrs the worst I ever experience. It's to bad you won't let me say what I really feel but you get the idea"
bad,"When I first started at WFM Bellevue it was an amazing place to work. But like a snowball down a steep hill, the problems kept coming faster and growing bigger."
bad,"I found management to be oppressive and negative and not encouraging of team members , very critical and not helpful towards an employee, no discussion . Not a good place to work. It only catered to rich people."
bad,"The management here is absolutely terrible.  They take ""the customer is always right"" to a point where it is dangerous and abusive to their employees.  The benifits are alright and the pay is decent, however if you end up working as a cashier or in customer service i'd suggest getting out as soon as possible."
bad,Take a vow of poverty to work for greedy and arrogant faux-hippies. Yay. Charlatans is the best way I can describe the management.
bad,"My time at McDonalds was by no means horrible but it wasn't great either.  Got very little hours, even on the days with open availability.  the pay was horrible since it was minimum wage with minimum hours.  but over all it is a very good experience builder for those who need their first job.  Lots of multitasking and basics in cleaning.  you learn to develop customer service skills as well."
bad,"A typical day of work was unbalanced workload, sometimes after working until closing the night before after having no days off in a 7 day period, then opening at 5AM the following morning.  If you are hard worker, you will be taken advantage of.  You are brainwashed into believing you are working in a world class, exceptional establishment, but the pay is poverty level wages and poor working conditions.  You must pick up the slack from workers that work a fraction as hard as you do.  Perhaps perfect for somebody in high school, or its their first job.  However, if you are over qualified, do not think that you can easily work your way to the top and do not believe the hype that this is one of the best places to work, according to Forbes 2013.  Management is passive aggressive and brutally sarcastic.  They have little concern for your health and well-being in direction violation of the so-called core values which state ""we support team member happiness and excellence"".  Coworkers are teenagers micromanaging you on such easy tasks as bagging groceries, and very disrespectful.  Hardest part of the job was the extreme workload, even for somebody in exceptional health such as myself.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the amazing people that I met, whether they were coworkers or random store guests.  Made many friends that I am still in contact with"
bad,The company is great on paper but the management is weak and biased. nepotism and favoritism prevent and avdancement...get in and get out
bad,"Management above the store level, was nothing but a bunch of bullies.  People who had entered retail, having no skills other than being bossy.  At the store level was better, but they would always be directed to be jerks.  I learned nothing, and was never utilized for any skills I brought from previous experience.  I walked out."
bad,"Fast pace place to work, which is nice makes the day spin by. Always cutting down labor for the bottom dollar..."
bad,Working as a cashier for Whole foods was pretty fun. you meet very nice people and have amazing co-workers
bad,"Not so bad at first, then you realize they don't care about you at all. leadership i would give a 75% dissapproval rating."
bad,"If you are a person that enjoys being told what to do, doesn't want a reasonable work/life balance, and gets giddy at the idea of being treated like a servant by customers, this is the job for you. While the benefits that Whole Foods offers are excellent, this is offset by the fact that Whole Foods does not pay it's team members a livable wage. Management expects long hours and does not care for independent thought. Regardless of what the kool-aid drinkers tell you, everyone at Whole Foods is expendable at any time."
bad,"They are terrible people. The rapid employee turnover extends to the management team.  Employees are bussed to work from remote locations (without pay). The discount is good, as is the product. Do not expect to be treated fairly or to be able to advance."
bad,"learn a lot of things"
bad,"I started with this company thinking that I finally found that one place to work. well first off they over hired 22 people and lay them off but they did give us jobs in an other dept.he company gives gain-sharing well u cant get this unless u are voted on a team well usually it took 1month it took me 6months. Then , I got sick and was in the hospital for over a week. They did not tell me that they were going to cancel my insurance while I was on leave and had to get Cobra well lets just say that I am still in a mess because of this financially."
bad,"I worked the overnight shift at WFM and at first, it seemed decent. The supervisor gave me a tour of the place and explained various procedures to me and what was expected of me. This is where the good part ends. The amount of work they expect you to do is crazy to me. After a few weeks, i was able to break down 2 full pallets and do 2 aisles on my own. Then I was brought into the office for a discussion about how I've been doing and out of nowhere I get these BS reports of me not doing my job and that I wasn't fast enough. This place will make you feel like a slave!! I skipped some of my 10 minute breaks just so I could get more work done due to the pressure of getting the aisles ASAP. After a few more weeks,one of the managers asked me to come into the office for a discussion. I was told that it wasn't working out and that I was being separated...   I should've known a company that is associated with amazon treats their workers like slaves and accuses them of  stuff."
bad,The favorite the ones they like and don't care about the ones they don't like. The help was always changing and the were short staff at all times. They know how to put you down and don't care about your feelings.
bad,It can be great fun or it can be miserable. Interview your department lead as much as they interview you and go observe the people in the department you are interested in.
bad,"I was so excited when I got hired here but man, oh man, I could tell immediately they were very understaffed and mismanaged. My first few days there, I had NO management training or guidance. I was stuck in a room for hours doing training videos, and then I would be pulled out to go wrangle carts and bring them in. I was very confused but I wasn't mad about getting to move my legs and get active. Then, that's all they had me do for almost 2 weeks straight. I was hired as a cashier, and I hadn't ANY training in this two weeks. I also had an injury that I made every manager aware of, which made it hard for me to push carts, but I did it anyways. Since the first day, I didn't get introduced to all the management and who I should report too, and when I asked, I received a different answer every time, or it was someone I was not introduced to. I had no one I could talk to about job help or anything in general. When I tried to interact with the other cashiers, they treated me like I was trash. The girls all looked at me like I was a nobody, and were very curt and rude with their responses, and the guys just treated you like you were invisible. I had no guidance for my time at Whole Foods, and when I tried to talk to one manager, she brushed everything off and honestly, she made me feel worse, like I was the problem. I felt a pit in my stomach every time I walked into those doors, which really sucked because I adore Whole Foods and all they stand for, but it was a really awful experience. "
bad,"Terrible company to work. Yes the pay is decent but doesn't mean anything if there aren't many hours.  Management is trash and shows favoritism to anyone who sucks or who they want relations with. The customers were awful,  a customer can pretty much get whatever they want. The complaints could be over the smallest thing. If you're not favored management,  your hard wont matter !ishouldmuch as it"
bad,Before thinking to take a job for this company do your homework they watch everything you do here emotionally drained after working here think twice before working here the bakery manager needs to go and take a English lesson on spelling and being a leader totally clueless!
bad,"I started as a part-time cashier, loved the leadership in the front end, moved to Team Mentor, Customer Service Desk, and Front End Supervisor. Excellent management and wonderful employees to work with. Than, I knew to move up, Ineeded to move around the store. I applied for a buyer in the Supplements department, the life style buyer, which I absolutely loved my manager, assistant manager, and all the team members. I asked my boss if he would let me apply forr the leadership program, and of course he said absolutely. I applied, and got accepted. I got compliments from all of Store Leadership on how great my essays were. When I completed it, I moved to be an assistant manager on the grocery team, which was the biggest mistake. Retail was never my dream job, but take it from me.. IF NOT A SINGLE team member goes to advance to be a part of their own team mrmg, maybe think about why not!"
bad,"working in the front end you are on your own most of the shift, regardless of the roll you are supposed to play. No one is ever there to help you on the floor or off the floor. Availability is a huge issue with them, they have favorites throughout the stop and leadership is never willing to help you when you need something. the communication between supervisors and TL's is horrible."
bad,i got terminated because i went to the back door i was locked inside of the building more than 30 minutes the stupid meat department manager did not like me so he probably told the boss to get the excuses of back door just to fired  me the guy treated  you like hood ghetto he does not professionalisms
bad,Poorly Managed from Store manager to produce leadership. Hours are generated by a machine. No help for employees schedule. When asked how to move up. Was denied and shunned away from the position.
bad,"The management is the worst kind of management possible, it’s blind leading the blind, and no one has any idea of what goes on in a professional retail environment.  Your bosses will harass you, your coworkers will treat you poorly, the customers always win and you’ll lose your job over your dumb boss siding with whatever they say, and no matter how long you work for this company, they will disrespect you and do everything in their power to make you feel like garbage.  Go literally anywhere else, this isn’t worth it."
bad,The floater position is so disorganized and they never seem to know where they want you. Then you are basically just stuck doing cra*py work where they need it all the time. You don't really get to learn every department and it was certainly the worst job I've ever had. I worked at Starbucks for 2 years and it was soooo much better. Even fast food jobs were more enjoyable.
bad,"Whole Foods was rapidly becoming more and more coporate while I was working there, and has gotten worse going back as a customer since. They replaced knowledgeable hard workers with less creative people in every position they could."
bad,Work more for less.If you have experience elsewhere they will treat as if wholefoods is the only retail grocery store and experience outside of that dont matter..
bad,"Awful place to work, cruel mean management, awful hours, small employee discount, no value in team member well being, the list goes on, avoid like the plague."
bad,"The management at this company is not one that you would want to work for. There is flagrant sexism and favoritism among a slew of other problems. "
bad,"kept as only part time so I would not be able to gain benefits."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time at Whole Foods. The morale was low--too much was expected of folks that did their job well; and not enough was expected of others. Leadership did not seem to understand their positions very well, or were too stressed by their workload to manage effectively."
bad,"Very immature work place. If you want to come to work in a high school like environment and be treated as such, then Whole Foods is the place for you."
bad,"I am a previous employee who was just recently fired from the NW Washington DC store. Aside from being ostracized and wrongfully terminated, I was further humiliated by the store manager in front of other employees and customers."
bad,"Overall, the culture is okay. Great customer service is highly valued here. Fast pace work, a lot of customers, a lot of big carts with a lot of things. I've been ringing items for the past 6 years"
bad,"Management is lazy"
bad,Little opportunity for advancement; poor management both at store and team level; bad team members; wanted you to have no independent thought and be an automaton; retaliation culture
bad,"Whole Foods had always seemed like a well oiled machine to me, but after working there for 2 years I now know that is hardly the case. What used to be a company that was world famous for employee satisfaction has fully become a confused mess that puts employee happiness and professional encouragement at the very bottom. "
bad,Management was terrible. Prep foods team leader was nasty and gave disrespectful remarks once he got comfortable with me. Department has potential with better leadership.
bad,"My biggest issue with Whole Foods is I requested a change of shift and they said they could help do this for me. But they just keeped dangling that carrot in front of my head instead of being honest. 4 months later, they keep playing the same game so i left that job. But the other issue is they have a system of voting you into the department you work for, and there are some benefits like earning more money, I forgot exactly how it works. Working for Whole Foods as a Dishwasher for over a year and i haven't been voted in because the department manager didn't put the vote out there. being a dishwasher seems like an easy entry level job, but i can assure you anyone who has been there will tell you it's hard work, and to miss out on extra money busting my ""butt"" for a year to wait for my manager to get his act together is just wrong. And 11.50 is not enough for that job, not even close."
bad,"Started off great. Ended off terrible. Mangers would complain about coworkers talking while working in the same section. This is a place of business, not detention."
bad,"They pretended to be team member friendly but it just declined over the years.  I was bullied but management was afraid of the person who was bullying me, so they did not do anything."
bad,The once proud company of Whole Foods is now another pocket hungry corporation.  They do not and if they continue down their path will not ever care about their employees anymore.  Its sad to say but the once happy family friendly vibe is now a thing of the past.  Every beginning must have an end.  And its new beginning will be its demise.
bad,Mgmt is too busy focusing on the wrong things. They should be trained on cultural diversity. Also they need to make sure there is enough food. Most important they need to lead by example.
bad,"Upon my hire date I had given my department team lead my availability and it was completely ignored. Every week I was scheduled on the days I couldn’t work because It conflicted with my other job, forcing me to call out weekly, resulting in write ups. Training for new hires does not exist, my first day I was thrown into an opening shift, ALONE, having no idea what to do. Team leads will get onto you for not closing, opening or doing your job the right way, which is okay but unfair if the employee has never been trained and if the do,  you get shown how to do a task 10 different ways by 10 different people. The store managers were wonderful and very understanding but the chain of command leading up was horrible. The best part of the day was how friendly the guest were. I felt as if I couldn’t speak to my department managers in confidence, It’s hard to respect someone when they don’t respect you."
bad,"The problem with Whole Foods is the lack of vision and foresight. All of the emphasis is in the front of the store. The turnover is incredible. The point system time keeping is crazy,"
bad,"pay Is good "
bad,"Worst place i have worked bar none. As a customer the expectation is extremely high, that is shattered as an employee. The best way to describe it? Like the end of the Wizard of Oz when you find out it's all smoke-and-mirrors. "
bad,It can be a fun environment. I worked for Whole Foods for a year at a different location several years ago and it was by far more fun of a company to work for then. I feel that they give a lot of false core values and don't adhere to them. There was an overall concurring feeling throughout the store when I worked there.
bad,Whole foods cultivates a community but also a culture of suspicion and superficial relationships. I have no desire to work at my store anymore because of all the gossip that has occurred. whole foods claims to promote the attitude of always assuming the best of other but I have had the opposite experience.
bad,"While the pay and benefits remain good, the overall culture of the company has gone away. The changes made in the last few years have been severely detrimental to the growth of the company, and as a result the company has lost many strong leaders and team members, myself included. A shame, as the company 4-5 years ago was a wonderful place to work."
bad,Alot of talk in the group interview... Management was very under qualified for there part. Regional Mngmt was even less qualified. The constant changes in protocal were ridiculous. My coworker were the only bright part of my day.
bad,"Everyone is out for them selves top to bottom. If you want to spend your days watching your back, this will be a great place to work."
bad,i wouldn't work with the same team manangers but the staff members under them are very great willing to help most of the time and honest
bad,"I had an awful experience working at Whole Foods in Naples Florida.  I am a long time WF advocate and shopper.  So, when living in FL and not having much to do I applied for and got a job at WF Naples, FL.  My ""training"" was entrusted to people who, obvious to me but not to management, did not value the WF culture.  My training consisted of showing me how to get around food safety laws. I worked in the prepared foods department. When food in the coolers was at an unacceptable/unsafe temperature (too warm) and was supposed to be cooled down as per food safety precautions and regulations, instead I was trained to follow the procedure that all the other staff followed- find a food that was the correct temperature and ignore the stuff that was at an unsafe temperature.  When I realized what was happening and told management, my co-workers became angry at me.  This being Florida, I was afraid that any of my coworkers could be one of the 2 million concealed gun permit  holders  in FL I did not want to return.  No one in management made any attempt to keep me on and make things right for me or even to talk to me about my experience.  I think management was happy with not knowing what staff was doing regarding food safety laws and happy to see me go.  I do not hold this against WF, as I chalk it up to this being Florida and my coworkers being Floridians. I do feel cheated out of a job I liked for doing the right thing, obeying the law and being concerned about food safety.  I will never eat prepared food at WF again though and probably will not attempt to work at WF again.  I think"
bad,"I worked this job for about a year and because I wasn't under team leaders butt kissing it they gave me no hours! They claimed it was because I wasn't ""smiling"" much lol. Great pay buhh no hours! Whole Foods only cares for their dollar and the customers that keep bringing their money in. Great co workers and customers!"
bad,I was excited to work here but after a while I learned this is not where I wanted to be
bad,"Although I believe in the Whole Foods philosophy of providing quality, organic food to people, working there was a nightmare. Managers showed favoritism to certain employees and hard work was never recognized or congratulated."
bad,The management are not great. The hours arent great. You never have a weekend off. You have no social life. It is making me miserable.
bad,No advancement regardless of job history and management doesn’t support ideas for change and looks at you like you are ridiculous for even suggesting anything
bad,Need to learn how to talk to people. They seem to worry the talking about people  business and don't  care about people  well being .everyday I would  come in and feel like I'm ready to go home because  they have their favorite person or race or people
bad,"This was the worst job I’ve ever had. I can’t even go into a grocery store anymore without PTSD. Team Leads bully you and don’t want you to succeed. Customers walk all over you and management welcomes it, as long as the “customer” is happy. People harassed me, as well as my other employees and were never banned from or asked to leave the store. People were scheduled way past what they were even allowed to be. Management was super passive aggressive. I was set up just to fail. Team members are burnt out and begging for help, but since Amazon took over, management only cares about the “needs” of the business. You’d think since the pay is so high now that they’d actually hire decent employees. Yet we still just all talk bad about the customers and each other at any chance we got. Terribly hostile work environment. The East side ones just aren’t safe at all, and dangerous to walk to your car at night/early morning. Too much stuff to deal with for a grocery store. IGNORE AT ALL COSTS."
bad,"They aren’t understanding at all and working there felt like walking on eggshells. The company “rules” are more for robots rather than humans. Its always understaffed for a busy location. Not one full time employee got 40 hrs a week. at most maybe 37. But a lot of us would still work 6 days in a row. Never had a steady schedule, every two days id switch from day shifts to nights. They dont treat their employees good at all. The insurance sucks too."
bad,"Not the best environment for experienced cooks to go in. Leadership was the problem here from day one. "
bad,"Do not work here unless you want to work in a place where you aren't payed your worth, constantly overworked, and there's drama at every corner. The scheduling is fair, the job itself and customers are good, but if you dont want to be involved in a drama-filled work place where favorites are the only ones who move up, I suggest to not apply. Unless you constantly want to be taken advantage of and have your willingness to work squeezed out of you. Management don't see you as human, they just see you as a body."
bad,"Trash does not pay enough for the job you are doing and what they expect from you. Only way to make extra money is by running incentive but it’s every month, so you’re busting your butt for a whole month for a couple hundred dollars. You get paid bi weekly so u have to run all month to get it . You could run for 3 weeks straight but have a bad last week and all that was for nothing. Don’t do it"
bad,"Inept & unskilled Team Leader in Customer Service who drove away more good people time and time again. "
bad,"WholeFoods Market has potential to be a great workplace, the employees are overworked and understaffed with no assistance from upper management to make the job bearable, however it is a place where you will meet your best friends. The people you work with there are the reason the job is fun. If you can handle rapid changes and stupid managerial decisions while keeping your head low you'll do great.  WholeFoods was a great place to work before amazon took over."
bad,"Benefits have slowly dissolved over 10 years to a fraction from what they used to offer, while still expanding their company. Culture of seeking out leaders with a top heavy and reactionary management style. The work level to pay is not reasonable and does not pay out till you have been there a long time. Working full time and having a family is very challenging because they demand full availability which makes it impossible to move up if you have children and do not have child care."
bad,Job expectations were not communicated clearly. And when expectations weren't met there was often unprofessional yelling and cursing. I would often see fellow employees in tears.
bad,"Store management is horrible and rude.   Even more so after amazon bought them.  Raising their min wage to $15 caused a lot of unpleasant feelings, stress toward one another and the store began firing people left and right who made too much."
bad,Management is wishy washy.  They only right you up if they have a problem with you personally.  If you be their friend then you can work there for a long time.
bad,The management has their priorities misaligned. Plenty of room for advancement if your willing to inflate the managers ego. The time goes by fast because you are so busy trying to do the work of others.
bad,Great pay with benefits. They're were alot of changes In the company. Just like any job changes occur sometimes irs for better sometimes its not. This used to be a great company
bad,"I loved my coworkers and the job wasn't so bad but the management style and the policies that are handed down create a paranoid and stressful atmosphere. There is no standardization in company policy so many of my coworkers fell victim to abuse just because the manager didn't particularly like them. The abuse of power by those in management is ridiculous and there is little to no options to combat it. Most of everyone that I knew at Whole Foods left or were forced out within a year. Even the ones who held out were forced to leave eventually. I just heard from a former coworker recently that his store had been cutting corners with food safety protocol. When he approached management about his concerns, they treated him like a dictatorship treats a revolutionary, threatening punishment including the loss of his job, attempting to silence him instead of solving the problem. Whole Foods likes to pretend that they're better than companies like Walmart, but they are not and never have been. Don't be fooled. You can do better."
bad,"Teribble company, dont ever work for whole foods. Managers can be cool, but they dont have your back. Act like they are your friends and then will turn on you in a heartbeat. No room for advancement either."
bad,"Managers would belittle cashiers"
bad,"They claim employees are the most important part of the company but it’s not true. The managers refuse to work with your availability. They give you a hassle every time if you complain about any managers they make you feel as if it’s your fault and the manager did nothing wrong. Managers never help just sit in the office, of customers disrespect you they just make it seem like it’s your fault the only good thing about this place is the pay"
bad,"While working at Whole Foods i soon realized the higher ups of the store do not hold themselves accountable for anything they do. Managers will build you up and tell you you're going to get a promotion just to turn you down and give it to a under qualified employee. They will also schedule you for 6-7 days in a row while managers will only have to work 2-3 days in a row. You can tell the higher ups of the store about people stealing,bulling you,harassing you and other various problems but will turn a blind eye like you said noting, not to mention in some departments they will make you falsify food logs when inspectors come instead of fixing equipment. All in all i would not recommend Whole Foods as a place of work."
bad,"Worked in the Omaha location. Consistently watched them work employees to the bone and then fire them at the drop of a hat. Didn’t matter if they worked there 10 years or 10 weeks. You break a rule, you’re fired. No discussion, no defense, no warning, no suspension. I was never guaranteed hours or job security. This job was just month after month of walking on eggshells. Management was terrible. The only good thing about the job was the coworkers."
bad,"Poor Management. Discriminating towards others, seeking financial gain through dishonest practices. Personal friends of the Health Department as to not receive any red marks."
bad,"There is absolutely no work/life balance with WF. The business' needs are all that matters, and your life and time belongs to them. Requesting time off? Sorry buddy, if they're short staffed you're coming in to work! Unless you're a manager of course! Then take all the OT and time off you like!"
bad,"Very unorganized place to work. I thought this of all places would also be a place of non-judgment but on the first day you’ll see first hand how this isn’t reality at the Napa, CA  location. Terrible pay for how much memorization is needed and the constant supply of computer system crashes made it overwhelming! For how much this place makes, their own employees cannot afford to shop here based off of current pay."
bad,"Management does not care about you or the job at the end of the day. My first week of ""training"" I was told ""sink or swim"" as guidelines to my job. No clear communication between anyone even in your own department. Constantly told different things multiple times a day with no one being absolutely sure if they are even right as managers. Consistently understaffed and rushing to do 2-3 people jobs alone, then getting passive aggressive emails about not being able to finish all the work or not doing it as pristine as they wanted. Unless you block out days be prepared to constantly tell management they messed up your schedule."
bad,"I was wrongfully terminated by leadership after 8 years hard work and delegation. It was the most hurtful and disapponited experience of my life. Leadership terminated me without solid prove what they accused me of. They don't realized a simple decision that they made can make my life so miserable. Financially, I can not afford to hire a lawyer to fight for me. I just have to hide my pain and move on my life.Working for Whole Foods is not as good as people think. I don't have a solid prove that I was discriminated for some reason. I just never felt that I  fit in to this company's culture and leadership group even though I was one of the  leadership group."
bad,"Management was very stressful, constantly reminding staff how important they are not and how easily we can be replaced. I worked in the prepared foods section, my team leader had no cooking skills but wanted everyone to do everything just as badly as she did. Not to mention the fact that the schedules were constantly a mess and no one ever knew when they working. Terrible attitude overall and a terrible lack of communication skills for someone in a managerial position. Absolutely no leadership. The best part was the team members working together and trying to make the experience easier for one  another. Customers are hit and miss but that’s fine."
bad,"Toxic management, discouraged customer interactions, no room for advancement, they want autonomous robots not people. Upper management doesn’t take concerns seriously. They’re dedicated to money not people and causes as they claim."
bad,Awful place to work.. leadership doesn't have a clue how to run the building. Buddy buddy system unequal opportunities there..if your not friends or kissing a** or calling corporate you will not move up.. your hard work is not appreciated ..nepotism.. there has been new management due to the fact that previous management was running the building into the ground. Still management now is still terrible.. leadership does not help out they just try to break your back and get the most out of you..never work for WF Cheshire distribution..
bad,"Management is incompetent and their policies get in the way of being human, such as a car breaking down, health, and living situations. The clientele is friendly but often entitled and can cause a real problem for you. You do the right thing, but we still get reprimanded for it. You are often required to do big projects by yourself and when you need help, it's unavailable and again, you get reprimanded for being incompetent. The hardest part of the job is the coffee rush. People like to use us like an express checkout and often we can't take them because they have too many items and aren't getting coffee. This makes them rage at us and often get belligerent. The most enjoyable part is getting to know the customers that are regulars. They tell you about their life and really treat you like a friend. They stop by just to say hi. You know exactly how they like their drink and its often the only nice thing you hear all day, is how perfect you made their drink. We often don't get a lot of feedback unless the drink is wrong."
bad,"Back of the house at Whole Foods in Burnaby is a horrible place to work. They do not have on hand the appropriate supplies  necessary to carry out your duties on time. And no running around the store for small sizes of these supplies is not feasible. There is a very unsafe steamer that multiple people have been seriously scalded using. I am talking 2nd and 3rd degree burns. You will notice they are always hiring because they treat their staff as disposible often having them work a night shift followed by an early morning shift for example."
bad,"I did not like working here so much, even though I was good at my job, I did not feel like it was a productive work environment. They ask too much of everyone, and give out write ups when you could not complete a task by yourself"
bad,"the company is good and pretending like they care and treat their employees well but once youre hired on that is not the case. horrible managers, they would talk about their employees unprofessionally in front of other employees, said they pay a living wage but absolutely did not. they did not want to work with my schedule what so ever even after going to hr and the store manager. the only thing i liked about the job was some of the other employees."
bad,"Wholefoods seems to advance people that are better at keeping there workers isolated, instead of bringing the, together to get jobs done better. Talking is seen as counter productive, whether or not your job is done well and quickly, even if you've decided to help others on the team. The higher ups don't take many things into consideration, at several of the Wholefoods. The theme I've seen in all the wholefoods I've been to is, the want to keep workers as separated as the could."
bad,"Fun place to work in the early years, not by the end. Management does not know how to run stores and expects too much. Work life balance is horrible have to work AM, Pm and sometimes overnight."
bad,"This company is going down the drain. Managers here are the worst and lack common sense, literally feels like your surrounded by idiots. Your hard work here gets no recognition. The only way to move up is by kissing a**."
bad,"I worked under a bro-like manager who kept his hads in his pocket a good chunk of the time,  Personally, I did not have a good time working here. Many other epopel I know do not mind working here.  This si my individual experience."
bad,Started out a great place to work.  Culture declined rapidly over 5 years as they prepared to be bought out.  Culture varied wildly depending on which store you worked at.  I worked at three different locations in Denver area.
bad,"A lot of the guests that shop here treat the workers as though they're nothing. We work very hard and were short staffed daily. Upper management wouldn't give support and often made threats to our departments leaders. "
bad,"The approach of having departments give you a trial period is perfectly fine. What makes it not okay is that even if you do well in your position, you can be ""voted off the island"" at the end of your trial period by your co-workers just because of something as simple as your lifestyle is different than theirs."
bad,Overall I have high expectations for this company. For a period of time I was able to grow. Unfortunately once Amazon took over this company the attention to detail and organizational structure changed rapidly. Ultimately it was obvious that the company had lost his perspective on the people who made up Whole foods
bad,Management is terrible and incompetent. Hard to say anything good because it seriously overshadows everything that could be good about the position. Seriously. You aren't ready. Management is a living nightmare and they will mess you up one way or another.
bad,"Relaxed, slow paced and unproductive, no drug testing and unprofessional management.  High turnover, poor or no training for employees.  Company has no direction and contradictory objectives."
bad,"The only thing that I enjoyed about this job was my AMAZING coworkers. The management is awful, the customers are rude, the new OTS system leads to products always being out, management expects way too much and will not pay you more for extra work and responsibility."
bad,It’s a great place to work PART TIME if you like to get high and not take life seriously. The managers were uptight and more like micro managers. This place needs an entire overhaul.
bad,I was doing the job of 3 employees because we were so short. They still hadn’t staffed anyone after 90 days of employment. I was burned out. They were also ok with inadequate staff members because we were understaffed.
bad,"Low pay, lack of care for employees. Co-Wokers did not pull their weight. It's better to work there if you are in school or have another part time job."
bad,"I had a horrible experience here if you didn't act or look a certain way you were always bullied and harassed by "" managers "" . This company appears to be a nice and happy environment but it's overrun with people who've been here for years and they bully all the new employees. It was disgusting and i will never return."
bad,"Most employees are not qualified for industry and because management does not hire potential individuals for corporation growth, nor care to practice or enforce, current FDA regulations and codes in the kitchen."
bad,"Whole Foods Market is a fast pace work place with little or no breaks throughout the entire shift. They hire the smallest team possible to get a lot done with out spending a lot on an unrealistic labor budget. It wasn't always like this, but the store is under new management and is no longer enjoyable to work at. You can find the new manager in his office, sitting down and starring at his computer screen. The previous manager could be found on the floor helping customers and her teamates."
bad,A day at work would be like any other normal day for anyone else. Nothing really exciting. Learning experience is different because people learn things on a different level. Management was different cause managers would say one thing then do another things wouldn't be what it seemed. Work environment was fun & stressing at the same time cause it was always something but at times it will be happy moments that you wish came along in the business.
bad,"Team leaders show no respect for members of their teams. We were/are just cogs in the machine."
bad,WFM is the worst employer I have ever worked for. They enforce things unfairly. They have no SOPs nor policy on how to do certain things. Because of this when they coach they coach as they please.
bad,I loved my job and 99% of my co-workers. I loved my customers and store reps.  The company miss-represents itself. I was raised that if I do not have anything nice to say I am to remain silent.
bad,wonderful co workers. management is very fickle. customers craved knowledge. great health benefits. did not appreciate placing frozen cookies on a tray and being called a baker
bad,"CON"
bad,"Poor management, whole foods must be your life if you work there. Employees are expected to do more and more work in less time with less help because all they care about is profits. The money is good, but say goodbye to any life you have outside of whole foods market. Don't expect to do anything you enjoy/are good at, they'll place you wherever they want you (this is generally whichever department has the highest turnover). Also don't expect any training, whole foods works on a learn on your own as you go basis. Enjoy."
bad,"Cashier, hardest part can be lack of support on the sales floor. I love my guests. The leadership could use some improvement but overall the company is great."
bad,This place used to be good before amazon. Now they don't hold the same core values. My store was a satellite store  and ran through a ridiculous amount of leadership. Awful leaders and leaderswork  for the pay
bad,"When a new store manager is assigned,if your an older and a more experienced employee,that is paid to much expect to be fired or demoted. Yes you will be replaced by a lower paid,less experienced and younger employee thats most likely friends with the new store manager. This has happened so many times it's awful and very sad. And its not just a few,  i speak for hundreds of top performers in the company and the state of Florida"
bad,Excellent pay.... but the favoritism...lack of respect is definitely not worth it... A person of color doesn't stand a chance for advancement... At least not the store located in good ol MS
bad,"Working as a cashier is boring, repetitive and does long-term damage to your body in environments that are not ergonomic to the variety of differently sized people in the world. In the long run, it goes nowhere, and my opinion might be different if they had allowed me the opportunity to work in a different department."
bad,The worst part about working with whole foods is how disposable you are to management. The system at whole foods is based totally on seniority. If you haven't worked at the company for 10+ years expect to get the worst shifts and hardly any time off so much for the PTO. Management is usually incompetent because they have to cater to the senior members of staff first which can often throw the entire schedule out of balance. While working here disclose very little personal information and discuss nothing of how others work or how you may or may not like them because it will always come back to you and will get you fired.
bad,"Stressful environment, warehouse is just unorganized. Write ups frequently and poor customer service. Team leader doesn't really look out for team members."
bad,"I really don't have anything nice to say about whole foods ."
bad,"They removed stock options and gainsharing bonuses. They do not match your 401k. Insurance is shameful. Pay is not competitive."
bad,Great benefits.. Management is poor.. Scheduling is inconsistent one night you might be closing next day your there early.. 20 percent discount avaliable
bad,"Once the official $15/hr went into effect, mgmt slashed everyone’s hours. While hiring five new people a month because current employees were finding more consistent work elsewhere."
bad,"I moved 1000 miles to Chattanooga, TN. Having a passion for sustainability and providing people with local products was the main reason I wanted to work at Whole Foods. There were a few nice employees but otherwise it felt like I was back in High School, I was bullied for no reason at all, put down, made fun of, no one ever helped me when i needed it and even my manager bullied me, the most. I am 31 years old and have never in my life been treated so horribly. I am a simple, lovely person, with great morals and I work very hard. I was hoping working at whole foods would allow me to meet some local people and make friends but people were just rude. Its been a year since I worked here and when i think back upon my experience, I wish I had just walked out. Oh not to mention, my job there was the fastest pace and gave the most customer service (which I was great at because I've been in the business over 10 years and my customers adored me). The people were so disappointing and so petty (but some people thrive on putting other people down) . SO happy to have moved on, wish I did sooner. Will never be  a Whole Foods Customer again. Don't work with these gross people."
bad,No one was happy working there. The management was mean to the employees. I got in trouble for being one minute early once. The people that worked there looked down on new employees and would talk behind their backs. It was such a bad experience for me working in that department although I did like the perks of the benefits and discounts.
bad,"Poor pay for what was required and management at the time overlooked a lot. More favoritism than I, personally, had ever seen at any one company. I was disappointed."
bad,"I was miserable there. Over worked, cultish behavior. Leaders are over the top. They don't care about they're workers. Never happy no matter how hard you work"
bad,"I learned how to involve myself with the tasks of the community who would visit Whole Foods market and found myself a family among friends. The skills I obtained in this job were life changing and I will hope to bring with me the courage and ""you-can-do-it"" attitude with me everywhere I go. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to help people with simple tasks that made their entire day a wonderful experience from there on out."
bad,"The whole foods culture was ever changing. When I first started working there the was a focus on long term employment, where management cared for team members and morale was high. after I was employed for 6 months I could see things changing. Turnover started to increase, management became more demanding, workload increased exponentially, and morale took a nose dive."
bad,"on the outside, the job itself seems appealing. If you are hired on as full time you will get at least 35 hours a week, which was nice. The problem was not getting enough hours, but rather being even remotely close to the posted schedule. There were many nights where we would leave as late as 12:30 or later on shifts intended to end at 10pm, and this was not at all uncommon. The benefits of PTO or Vacation time were made pointless by the fact that they were always understaffed, so even time reserved off well in advance was seldom granted. The overall benefits offered are admittedly attractive, although the almost criminal mis-management of the store far out-weighed this. If your desperate for something with solid hours, it might be a good fit, but otherwise I would keep looking...."
bad,"fast paste, handful of genuine co workers, schedule is always changing, management is disrespectful and hard to communicate with. i learned about each the different sections in the grocery store, how to identify where each product goes."
bad,At First I really enjoyed working for Whole Foods and learned a lot about the Natural Foods Industry but after 10 years all the changes within the company my interest waned.
bad,"Not very busy, Lacked a lot of training, very hostile environment at my location, didn't enjoy the job at all, felt very under utilized, a lot of drama among the employees, almost felt like high school."
bad,after the purchase from amazon they brought in new managers. after that everything got weird. since the new team leaders were from the outside it was a terrible adjustment period that hasn't seemed to correct.
bad,Temporary job for students. Lures you in with false promises of a great company culture and opportunities for advancement. Management is poor and has lost sight of CEO mission and values
bad,"8 hours on your feet"
bad,people who doesnt know the job and kiss butt gets promoted before the employee with the skills and knowledge. Dont work here nothing but hypocrites who preaches clean eating while they eat at Mcdonalds.
bad,the job is not what was explained to me at the interview. I was also surprised that so many items in the prep/cook department come in a box and are not homemade.
bad,no mobility in the company. open positions are normally predetermined before the job is posted. management harasses employees until they leave for cheaper personal. Managers don't teach new hires.
bad,"Competitive pay rates that are slightly above other grocers, however its not extra you will work hard for it. Interesting atmosphere. Prepare to be overworked. Advancement system is a con like others, you can advance but will not be compensated. Needy customer market based on giving the customer anything he or she asks for."
bad,"It may seem good at first but you will hate it and the customers are the devils workers ! They think you are nothing but slaves , & thats 80% of them ! Be prepared ! .. They try to get rid of you no matter what & then cry when they are short staffed ! Too much taxes getting taken out and they dont even give you a good raise ! They wont even try to work with you with whatever you need, its just what they want !! STAY AWAY ......."
bad,"I love the diversity of my store."
bad,"I have been working at Whole Foods Market for nearly two years as a Team member customer service. I greet customers, there is a good teamwork. I really enjoy to ave contact with the customers and learn about healthy food."
bad,"I had high hopes of this company. Going in as a customer before I was hired everything seemed clean and everyone seemed happy. Behind the scenes though it was a different story. I went in having professional training in a kitchen at a trade/technical school and I was baffled by what I saw here. Employees that did not care for their job and that did not fear making people sick. Sanitizing water left for hours and hours cold, dirty with chunks of food. Cross contamination, disregard to hygiene. On top of that management is very difficult. There is a very unprofessional and unethical trend going on at these stores: Favoritism. This leads to dysfunctional teams with no sense of leadership. Creates hostile environments, leadership roles are thrown around to people that do not have the character or interpersonal skills for it= tension tension TENSION amongst team members. The only good thing is they have great benefits but is it worth all the extra stuff. Idk.  I never looked at whole foods the same again after my experience with them."
bad,"Whole Foods Market in Santa Cruz is staffed by selfish people.  The company claimes to emphasize team work, however there is little or no team work happening at the store."
bad,"No confidentiality, mediocre with schedule requests."
bad,"Not a positive work enviroment"
bad,"Originally excited about the work environment and ability to advance in the company. Very quickly learned the leader of the store is only interested in promoting people he's friendly with, in spite of the insane interview culture there."
bad,"Working at Whole Foods is great, the pay is good, hours are solid, and the co-workers are great. But with Amazon purchasing Whole Foods, the culture and support is lacking. Whole Foods doesn't really care about the happiness of it's employees overall. They will shower you in appreciation when you first get there, but once the honeymoon phase is over, they will show their true colors. Lack of communication, write-ups out of the blue, over-working you, and lack of support. Do some research before you join a team because each team leader is different and will drastically change your experience. If they don't know how to communicate or handle stress they will set up up to fail."
bad,A decent college job however be sure that management understands school schedule is non-negotiable. Great opportunity to meet cool people and to learn about sustainability.
bad,I was offered a job at Whole Foods in the bakery department of a new store in Beverly Ma. During the interview I explained that I did not want to work more then 4-5 hours a day because I had a health condition. They hired me and during my training I was told I would be working almost 40 hours a week. I explained that I couldn't work more then 15-20 hours a week and I was told by my manager to suck it up till at least after the holidays because they were a new store and very busy and did not want to have to hire someone new. I think that someone should take a closer look on their policies of hiring people with disabilities because I don't feel like they do. I think I would have excelled at the job if given the chance but since they refused to change my schedule to the original schedule I asked for I had to leave the job.
bad,"At my location, Whole Foods has been at a topic of controversy, one being discrimination. If you have children and hope to have a career. Go elsewhere."
bad,"When i worked there in 2015 it was really bad all around in the kitchen, short staffed, underutilized employees, poor pay, management clearly never worked in a busy high stressed kitchen before, in addition to not knowing how cook at all. The worst thing about the kitchen was the inefficient menu which lean to a lot of spoilage, about 85-110 pounds of food throw away during my shift alone. Ill admit the produce and meat were always high quality but that doesn't really matter when you throw most of it out. Do not work here, just shop."
bad,The pay is decent. Management and leadership sucks they don’t care about the employees only the customers. They play favoritism which isn’t fair. Employees are over worked and don’t get the recognition they deserve. Team members work hard while Leadership does barely any work.
bad,"Pecking order and rumor rule the work place. Under staffed, over budget. Benefits are fully loaded though. I'd recommend an introvert personality that can handle the load of 5 other people."
bad,"Employees are in and out quickly.  Management appears to be fair and productive.  It is only until you have worked there that you will find out the truth.  Constantly putting out fires, filling in for employees"
bad,You have to think and be like them or you won’t make it they don’t really have training but they do pay well the work is challenging. There are allot of job advancement opportunities if you can drink the koolaid and become the same mindset as them
bad,"In addition to the super short breaks and the manager disliking you drinking water because it's always over 90 degrees , the building is typically without a/c. The manager hates for cashiers to use the restroom even as this is unavoidable, we are humans. The manager likes to play employees against eachother for imaginary promotions and throws bones at brownnosers. Try taking a vacation after saving countless hours of PTO."
bad,"Discrimination, hostile, terrible management in the bakery, don’t ever work at the Jericho location. No communication and not a huge amount of space for growth don’t work for the bakery work for any other department but the bakery"
bad,All I can say is the customer service mangers are ruining that store!!!! First company ever I seen so many snakes and crooked mangers. Those mangers have no regard for the company's values clearly.
bad,Poor management. Poor pay. No skilled produce clerks. Low balled me. Didn't pay me for more then 30 days. I reported wf to c.a. labor board and won. One big joke.
bad,High turnaround rate and hit or miss management/employees. Very vague communication between morning and night crews which created conflict constantly. Management prefers to be heard but not seen in the meat department. Expressing problems to the company usually falls on deaf ears. Part time workers opinions or voiced problems are treated as “complaints”. Very friendly work environment and coworkers. Pay is great for a grocery store.
bad,my honest intentions here are not to slam this company i am sure there are good stores and leaders but from what i went through and saw there was no such thing typical day at work was very stressful they can never hold on to there team members there overnight workers are treated horrible and little to any concern about team members in general. i did learn from some good people. the people i worked with were the best part its hard to find good overnight people to work with. the workplace culture is very back words if you have any problems due to another team member and speak out about it you will find your self in trouble . the hardest part of the job was dealing with the issues that the earlier shifts had left you.
bad,"very very bad. it says i need one hundred and fifty characters or it will not let me post. This place has gone way down hill. no union, amazon owned. do not work here."
bad,"It's a weird company, almost cult like.  All the stereotypes about the WF customers or employees are accurate. Half the managers or supervisors were great. Others, well lets just say ""bad is bad"". Almost no cross training. Departments are totally segregated, it takes on a ""clique"" mentality, semi uncomfortable. Customer service is not stressed (in my first few days a customer asked a cashier ""where the ketchup is?"" cashier replied ""I don't know"" and walked away). Some people bought into the WF philosophy and love working there. Whatever makes you happy. Most of my co-workers were very nice and easy to work with. It wasn't for me. That place gave off a weird vibe. To each his own."
bad,"I've been working at WFM for 5 months and can't wait till I find another job. Customers trow food (burgers), water at me, while I was nice and always trying to help. Management did nothing about it. WOW buks works if you re friend with your supervisor. Insurance is very expensive. I was asking to make me a full-time worker, first they said I need to pass training week, after they said that I need to know how to do everything in department without them putting me on training, and when I learned all this myself, and it been 5 month of waiting,  there was no appreciation, no full time job, no WOW buks, but they start cutting my 25 part time hours. Hours, days and shifts vary from week to week. Today I had emergency call, but before I checked store and it was dead, so I took my 10 min break to call my mother back in Ukraine, and my supervisor talk to me like I'm slave,  that I can't talk and better go to work NOW. pushing me in door. "
bad,All I care to say is my experience with Whole Foods was not long and ended badly. I have nothing more I care to relate about Whole Food's or  it's CEO I can't comment about because sometimes people have people working for them and are not aware of everything that's going on.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job, people act so fake they act like they're your friends when their not. You can't trust anyone, the management is the worst and they have a stupid rating scale where they rate you if you're good or bad, your co workers can rate you bad if they don't like you and get you fired because I've seen it happen. The supervisors will listen to them because their stupid and they don't even see how you work which is ridiculous. Worst place ever. You can work so hard and still get told your not a good worker when you really are. Very disappointing, they need new managers and supervisors, instead of a rating scale so that they know how to do their jobs right."
bad,"Decent work environment but the management is awful.  The benefits are decent, however, it is not worth the abuse you take from management and customers."
bad,"I can really only definitely speak for the bakery department in Naples Florida and the overall management team."
bad,after all of my hard work for a year and they fired me because I forgot to punch out .  My explanation was that after working over night  for a year and doing hard work  working over 40 hours each week that I truthfully forgot
bad,"Whole Foods once a great place to work were people cared about the core values but now they just hire anyone and promise everyone a chance to move up make you take classes and training to move up, use you to do work they don't pay you for the work you're doing. Do not work here unless you won't a part time job it's not worth it."
bad,"not paid enough. also need more of a pay raise, with more vacation time. but needs alot of work to be put into the company. dont come here if your not ready to work long hours."
bad,"I worked here as a dishwasher. You get very little respect and the workers do not comply with most of the requests you have to create a more smooth workflow. Management will not accept a schedule and they expect you to keep your work week open for any arrangement they please. I asked for a set schedule and I got ""I'll do the best I can"" from management even though I have schedule for school. The kitchen expects you to clean their equipment which very seldom gets cleaned so when it comes to you it is an absolute mess and hinders you from staying on task. They are required to compost the food waste on dirty trays but leave it to the dishwashers to do. Schedules are based on sales, not the individual's needs. If you want to move to a different department you have to work there for six months then it takes the absolute perfect timing (which may never come) to transfer locations or positions yet, they make it seems like an easy thing to do. Despite Whole Foods ""holistic"" take on their business, they are as greedy as any other large corporation and this breeds quite the complex within the employees."
bad,I got stalked sexually harresed and got told it didn't happen I went to work there because I loved the place During training I got watched and pucked on  it just distroyed me I have been seeing a therapist but I'm not
bad,"Positive workplace, quality product, demanding schedule of many short shifts a week, one doesnt qualify for a full-time position without 5 consecutive days of full availability. As a single dad I worked on my days off to cover other employees and would work in alternate depts. for more hours, up to 29hrs. At max."
bad,"They hire a lot of leadership out of company; which can be good but its a minus to people who want to work their way up."
bad,"After 5 years being with Whole Foods, the company kept changing policies and management. When I started,  Whole Foods was very considerate of their employees and customers. That seem to go out the window once they introduced a new program called O.T.S.(order to shelf). Also with Amazon buying out the company, daily task seem to get harder as it started to turn into a check list job."
bad,"Completely incompetent management. Think of why Amazon bought this place. The reason is they were failures in major fashion and Amazon came in and bought the place at a rock bottom price. The group I worked in had too many millennial clowns that everyone told them they were so smart and they believed it. Problem is, they are incompetent, arrogant and totally clueless. These three aspects of a person combined leaves zero room for intelligence or strategic thinking. It's only a matter of time before Amazon swoops in and fires these losers in Austin and brings in their own team."
bad,Many of the employees don't take job seriously and many are underpaid for the amount of work performed. Poor management skills as evidence from excessive promote from within policy rather than bring in experience from outside companies.
bad,"They're incredibly short staffed and the staff they do have a leaving because its so awful. You thought retail during the holidays is crazy, try working at a whole foods not up to ""regional standards"". Could easily describe in one word, stressful. Only reason i was there for so long, the lifelong friends i made there."
bad,Whole foods as a whole is a great company but when it comes to management they seem to be overwhelmed easily. Not attentive to employee situations and is not in tune with store functions.
bad,"Great place to work if you like retail hours and breaking your back.  If you have a family and want to see them, don't go into management.  Schedules change weekly according to business, you will have mandatory meetings, you are not guaranteed to be scheduled your full hours every week, and in the last 10- 15 years they have gone from 70% full time 30 % part time to the exact opposite to avoid paying benefits to as many team members as possible.  This means most employees are not invested in the original core values, and management, (leadership in their terms) are so desperate to keep their jobs many are willing to throw anyone under the bus to survive."
bad,"Not somewhere I'd recommend anyone to work at. This company is full of politics and even if your a hard worker you won't be able to move up within the company if management doesn't like you and they make it very apparent. Managers show too much favoritism and if they like you, you can do whatever you want. Team members feelings aren't taking into consideration."
bad,the managers there were horrible and wish they cared about there employees a little bit better than they do! over all experience was great met a lot of different people
bad,"Typical day at work was coming in, getting yelled by my department manager, then immediately getting yelled at by the store manager for something you had no control over, like the drink case being empty. Mind you I just got to work. Working 8 hour shifts without proper help, and getting yelled at all day by management for being short staffed. Management was unreasonable. They would usually blame others for their short comings. Co-Workers was the only reason I have anything at all positive to say about this job. Without them I would most likely have hung myself in the dairy cooler. They really helped me get though the day there. From what I hear if you are not in the Grocery department there the job is actually not so bad. Just don't get a job working there in grocery, and don't take the job even if they say you can switch departments after you get a job there. The only way you are going to get that done is if you do the Don of the store a favor on the day of his daughters wedding."
bad,"No skilled management, very poor communication, lack of help, lack of team players, lack of culinary experience, lack of cleanliness, no organization, overall the most unprofessional kitchen I've ever work in 20 years. "
bad,A typical day at WFM is usually busy. Meet good people but not enough time to see what they realy are interested in or what they realy need.
bad,"First time working at Whole Foods, everyone so kind and very friendly but it’s an act. "
bad,First glance you were harmless. I was near and you needed someone to help you grow. They told me about you... you’ve been doing it to everybody around town.  But you guys suck
bad,"I liked working there , south boston big store and good selection but the racism was too much to deal with if youre an african american i advise u look for somewhere else because the customers would always make me feel uncomfortable as we as the management, Mark was rude he would barely say hi to the employees, he always acted like he was better than every one else"
bad,"At the location I was at, favoritism was rampant, allowing under qualified people into management positions."
bad,"Hardest part is being treated like a robot rather than a person. "
bad,"If you are looking for a job at Whole Foods please reconsider applying for the Prepared Foods department. The branch I currently work at in Burnaby is a complete mess in terms of leadership, the pay is not great for the amount of work that you will have to do, you will not have enough support (meaning never enough people will be scheduled) and instead of fixing such issues the team leader will continue to ask that everyone has to help everywhere even though everyone is already extremely busy on their own assigned stations. From what I've heard most of the other branches are the same when in regards to this department... so I recommend just applying for something else even within another area of the store. Part-time work isn't so bad obviously but full-time will leave you feeling sore and tired for every single day you work here."
bad,"Lack of training & management. Lack of communication. Store leadership was ill-educated, lack of urgency. It seems like they just hire anybody for any position."
bad,"This place acts like they care about their employees, but they really only care about making money.  Constantly cutting hours for the employees, but then giving away product to the customers."
bad,Your treated like a second class citizen. If you start making too much money per hour. It makes it near impossible to move up. If you try to transfer. You are more than likely to take a pay cut. Its a very oppressive environment.
bad,"Great place to work if it was under different management. Too much favoritism and unfairness. People who sucked up are who got promoted, rather than the people who busted the butts and worked overtime to make sure everything got done. Pay was decent, not enough to afford to live on your own but enough to eat (if you don't shop there, that is). Really awesome people work there and it was like family. The work was HARD (especially if you're in the kitchen!!) but overall a decent job.. if you don't mind a boss who lays into you about your health if you're not skinny like him."
bad,You can learn a lot of new things in the company. have the opportunity to transfer to other departments if there is a position open for availability you can try to up in the company.
bad,"Was consistently targeted by management. Team Leader, Marcus Lavarius(whole foods fremont) switched to whole body at the end of the hiring period. He was consistently dishonest and should have been let go from the company."
bad,"I wanted to work for this company because my friend absolutely loved it. I worked at a different location than she did and from what I experienced, it was a nightmare. Managers play favorites so unless you're a good *** kisser, don't even bother with looking to advance. They gave the hours to people who did the least amount of work and didn't clean at all. They'll try to fire you over absolutely nothing if they can get away with it. I didn't feel respected there at all and I left because my manager didn't take her job seriously and was a very horrible person. If they don't like you, you'll know because its basically like high school where everyone talks negative behind your back. Customers were rude and at times very aggressive. If I were to ever work at Whole Foods again, it would NOT be for this region because they are absolutely terrible."
bad,"Whatever you do, beware of the WFM in Post Oak Houston. The new store manager is a horrible human being and created a hostile environment to work in. He got rid of an entire department for the lack of training Whole Foods failed to provide and found a small reason to blame it on. Whole Foods used to be a great company to work for, not anymore."
bad,Okay place to work at at times the customers can get out of hand. For the most part its probably the best supermarket youll work at in nyc. The pay is good and they give raises once a year.
bad,"The management often delays coffee break and lunch,coffee break just provide 10 minutes in violation of the Labour Code. They justify this action by claiming understaffed.There is lots of favoritism.Job assignments are not well distributed lack of information."
bad,I just needed the money at the time and the job was decent during the summer. Working there towards the long term mark wasn't really something i could see myself continue doing.
bad,worst place to work for the staff is cuttthroat and lazy and it’s just a waste of time save yourself the troubles and go with the other job you were thinking about
bad,"management needs help as far as professionalism. They play favorites and dont appreciate the hard work thats put in.  The people that do the bare minimum get praised, the people that kill themselves get nothing but warnings and threats towards their job."
bad,"Horrible place to work backstabbing co-workers, management lots of favoritism-if store leadership dont like you they will try to destroy you reputation."
bad,I like whole foods or the concept - although I work here I honestly never shop here. The prices are marked almost as high as my coworkers. Standards have really gone down at the store I work at due to young people working here that really don't care. I believe it is location dependent. However if they don't start getting stricter with staff this store will probably close
bad,Whole Foods leadership is snakes and liars. The team members make the job cool but the leadership and customers are very unprofessional and rude. You’re never noticed for the hard work that you do but for the negative things or lies people have to say about you
bad,"Overnight supervisor is the worst, very disrespectful to his help. The overnight supervisor hides most of the night while his crew did most of the work! It’s not a bad job & pays decent they just need to replace him"
bad,I was employed part-time and a family member was a full time employee. Both working there at different times and stores. Both of us experienced bullying and degrading attitude from management. This internal ‘culture’ exists.
bad,Very rude and tattooed full of themselves hipster work environment that sees no value in true talent. Amazon has them all on eggshells and it’s not at all a cool environment. It’s very corporate and the people that work there all have thousands of tattoos and pretend like they aren’t corporate. I felt no connection with any of the managers. They all seemed very cold and selfish.
bad,"This is company that has certain way ,or work culture that you a great idea that would help the company out and make money for the company they would not listen too. Also they frown on anyone multitasking they wanted to do one thing for 8hrs."
bad,This place is where bad people go . There is no real reason to ever work here. You are a slave literally SLAVE. They treat you like nothing  for no reason and get away from it. You’re back and you’re feet will be messed up breaks are horrible. Managers have relations with staff and favoritism. If you’re really struggling work here.
bad,The dynamic of the company shifted from a laid back nurturing work and shopping enviorment to one of a cut throat corporate one.  Where they once focused on the customer experience and taking care of the employees it is now purely about getting every last cent out of people that they can get.
bad,"Whole foods was a great experience however, management wasn't that great. I did have a chance to learn about some great products I just with the management team were better."
bad,"very stressful.  Management is not concerned about workers, they speak to workers very disrespectfully,. the customers are extremely rude and management seem to overlook and never address their bad behavior. staff get very short or late breaks, sometimes over 6 hours to break. no appropriate heating during the winters.  staff is often scared to go to management, because of fair of repercussions.  the staff or of a mix culture and I enjoy working with the people.  Management  is cold and insensitive.  morale is very low among the cashiers and other support staff."
bad,None didn’t like job too much work unrealistic overworked underpaid not happy worked pizza deli meat seafood dishes nobody knew what they were doing what a joke of a company
bad,"Since the layoff in 2015 and amazon buyout, I would not work there ever again! Very crab in the bucket mentality and had favorites in which they were granted promotion over ones who had degrees and better skill sets and experience."
bad,I wouldn't suggest working there to anyone. Typically we filled orders throughout the day but there was no organization to the facility. Management didn't care to teach you anything therefor I had to learn things on my own.
bad,"it can be fun sometimes, ridiculous Management Team, they just care about make money and care way less about their employees. Avoid this place, any place is better than this one."
bad,"This was a good place to work at one time. Then came the Amazon buyout and the rollout of the OTS (order to shelf) program. I have never had a more stressful experience in a retail setting than I have now. If you’re not in leadership, it MIGHT be an okay job."
bad,"Stifling work environment; preferential treatment; co workers were nice, some managers very nice. Very low pay; Treated very impersonally by high level management. A lot of physical labour for the pay."
bad,"Hiring process was very fast.  Surprisingly so.  Everybody so accomodating, friendly, etc.  Then, you're just out there by yourself.  Lots of co-workers around but they don't want to help you and they're all younger.  Some disappear during shift, some go out to parking lot to smoke pot."
bad,great interview and the managers are very pleasant.  The overall procedures and questions were on the mark and seemed to be to the point.  I would expect all would say the same.
bad,"Great Team member assembly, Wonderful hiring staff, Good criteria For Employment Qualification. They Make sure that every employee is comfortable and knows they're options."
bad,A fun place to work. I meant a lot of people. Everyone there was very nice to me and welcomed me with open arms. I would definitely work here again if they need me
bad,"performing audits and pickups on lanes, counting in the loan drawer, administering loans to tills. and overseeing cashier functions"
bad,"The company offers good benefit package plan that you cannot find everywhere, good environment to work with team members are very friendly ."
bad,did not like working there. the co workers were very rood to each other. the hardest part of the job is the grumpy costumers.
bad,The envoronment in this store was horrible.  The management was rude and inconsiderate.
bad,"Depending on your location a typical day at work can be really busy and tiring or really dead and boring. I been with the company for a year and a half and it was by far the worst job ever. I tolerated the job only because I loved the friendships that I created with my co-workers, it was a job and it was good financially. WFM has no union which is bad on the workers behalf. You work for a company that DOESNT value their team members. I felt like working there, I was degraded as a person and not as a young lady trying to make it. Some of the customers was rude and disrespectful & the management was TERRIBLE. The hardest part of the job was keeping your cool and the enjoyable part was the amazing people I came across both customers and co-workers. This is not a job I would recommend to anyone."
bad,"Learned skills here I can always take on another job , customer service skills , etc."
bad,"I've never felt so disrespected and undervalued in a company. The staff treats their own customers as though they know better than them, and make others who have differing viewpoints on nutrition and certain foods feel like dirt. Disgusting."
bad,Wonderful fresh foods. Good people to work with. Nice customers.
bad,i enjoyed working at whole foods at first but after a few months of being wooed you start to see the low advantages of working there. your do so smuch to not be appreciated in the long run if your not a supervisor you have no chance of moving up in business.
bad,Customers are so entitled to do whatever they want and act inappropriately and even racist. If you need money and don’t want to start at minimum wage then it’s a great option . All Whole Foods are different but flagship type stores are the worst to work for . Being a cashier is emotionally draining doing the same thing everyday and standing. While customers want you to kiss there feet . Working in customer service you have no freedom  any other department is better
bad,"I worked for Wholefoods Market since 2001 and during that time I experienced a very demanding, fast paced, relentless workspace that required mental as well as physical stamina. After 15 years on the sales floor I developed several skills from customer service, merchandizing, purchasing, managing, problem solving and multi tasking in various situations with customers as well as team members."
bad,While working at Whole Foods Market I learned how to to live an healthier life. I akso expanded my knowledge in foods and supplements as well. A typical day at work will be a 9 hour shift on my feet  but the day usually passes by quick when we are busy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with different customers attitude and needs. The most enjoyable part is you learn how to grow and share the love of food with everyone.
bad,I enjoyed working at Whole Foods. It was a good experience and coworkers were really nice. Management was nice and everyone was very welcoming to me and to everyone who was new.
bad,"After 8 years Im making the same pay as the TM's that have just started and Im training them.  We haveTM that have been there over 20 years and the make triple the amount.  And do 1/3 of the job.  It is a rewarding job because I have learned alot and the customers are great.   Whole Foods does not practice their ""Core Values"" they so proudly talked about.  I need a change and to be appreciated Im hard work who is always their on time and go in whenever they needed me."
bad,Whole  Foods  market  Does  not  give you enough  hours  even  though  you  get  paid  15.00  dollars  an  hour  and  Because  I  don’t  work  enough   Hours  I   Don’t  have  benefits.
bad,"During a typical day our job always rotated. you went from stocking tables to reloading the bread box. On other days you would prep everything for the bakers to bake in the morning while also being forced to man the counters answer phones and bake all cookies and bread needed for that day. you would also come in and start this 2 hours after the store opened which made no sense why start baking items needed for that day after the store opened you basically came already two hours behind. You never had set schedule your days rotated along the amount of hours you would work. There was never enough time in the work day to get everything done but they consistently kept adding more displays while shrinking the amount of kitchen space you had. The store would close at 10:00p.m to the public and 10:30p.m for the employees who closed. was constantly there finishing up till past 11:00p.m do to company policies on when we were allowed to break down the bakery and prepare it for the next day. "
bad,"Do you enjoy working late hours and evenings? Missing fun times with your family and friends? Being bullied by upper management? Dedicating your life to putting products on shelves so the company can make as money as possible while you struggle to survive with your minimum wage? Then working at Whole Foods Market is for you!"
bad,They do not do transfer well. was waiting on one for 3 weeks saying i had the position just to find out from my old store that they gave it to someone else. I never received a call telling me this. I had to find it out myself. I could have been looking for another job the whole time. The team leader here often do not care about customer or employees and are most the time in the back on the computers. And I'm not the only employee to feel this way about transfers and team leaders.
bad,"Management was hostile, work environment was poor for what was paid, No direction was give on how to preform daily tasks, Very stressful with the amount that was required to be accomplished. Not enough staff."
bad,"Between the poor management and the cliques within the departments, this is not a great place to be. With poor pay and benefits, only havin 30 minutes for a lunch, and the lack of vacation days is horrible"
bad,"When I first started working at whole foods market it was great & the pay was great also. I loved & enjoyed going to work everyday & my job was the new highlight of my life. But then after months went by my positive & unbiased views turned into now viewing this work place as a nightmare because management started to become disrespectful, inconsiderate, unprofessional, intrusive, untrustworthy, belligerent, compulsive liars, inappropriate, abrasive, harassing, condescending, verbally abusive, & forming cliques/showing favoritism/discriminatory. Team members became harassive, dramafilled, unprofessional, gossipy, belligerent, disrespectful, inconsiderate, & lazy."
bad,"Workplace culture is horrible. Leadership is not inspiring at all. Complacency is terribly high because people are stuck in their jobs. Nepotism is rampant, so there is little room for advancement."
bad,"The company is based on favoritism, and you need to build a good relationship with leaderships in the store you work. If leadership does not like you well, there is less chance that you will be promoted."
bad,This is not the best company to work for. Employees are over worked and under paid. Often having to do back to back shifts and expected to do far more then the job description required.
bad,Stressful and sometimes chaotic. Always cleaning up after other employees because they do not care. Some department team leaders are in way over their heads.
bad,"Pros : they believe they are great...micro loans that are repaid with interest...local product...read the labels India for 365 physiullm powder,,China thread for thought clothing,,,Germany welda skin food,,,Mexico produce,,,then there is the health food and product w/ o bad product read the label sun screen with titium dioxide cancer causing, many shampoo with lauraly sulfates,, many many products with high furctose..they live in a world of make beleive....they build fancy buildings so people will not notice the bad product..then there are the rules..I think ate so trusting they do not see the truth"
bad,The Team leader sucked  the schedule was never put up on time and when it was it would change  there was a lot of favoritism at my location 
bad,"I learned a lot working at Whole Foods, such as how a hard day of work pays off and why customer service is so important. However, I do not like the work environment mostly because of the management. The managers do not listen to their employees and are only concerned as to how the regional team perceives their store."
bad,Whole foods does not want to hire anyone full time or pay anyone benefits. It is a place for a young person to work part time because they will allow flexible hours if you are in school. For anyone who needs a real job forget it. They will change the hours you normally work without regard to your personal life. The is a lot of back stabbing and favoritism. For someone who has worked in a professional setting this is not the job for you.
bad,"Working at Whole Foods (Bryant Park) is a great temporary job, but I don't recommend you try to make a long -term career here. There is a lot of favoritism between coworkers and shift leaders. Some cashiers are allowed more privileges like just leaving their work station to chill in the breakroom, not on their actually mandated break time. In the summer they refused to fix the A/C forcing workers to work under extreme heat ( in the midst of a heatwave too) with no regards for their employees or customers in the checking out area. Be caution, you can get fired very easily at whole foods. There is a 10 minute grace period before each shift but they are strict on attendance and punctuality. "
bad,"I always wanted to work for this organization so when we had our fantasy training it was to my surprise that training and actually working here is complete lies. Management is awful they care nothing about their employees. I am not new to corporate life, I worked in corporate  most my career and the environment  at whole foods is so toxic within less then six months most of the staff quit. This is defiantly not a long term career. The pay sounds good and then you get your check and your left scratching your head, very high turn over rate, not what they tell you. This is no longer whole foods its ""Amazon"". If you get the job here just know long term isn't an opinion so keep your resume on file."
bad,"My Meat team leader played favorites.He actually had another cutter living at his house.If things didnt get done I was to blame.Had other people in the department that know nothing about Meat,Meat cutting or customer service.These workers also got paid the same as an experienced meat cutter.Kindergarten atmosphere."
bad,"Management is lacking and there is no room for career growth. They will promise you everything and then you see people from other stores transfer and take your position. There is no transparency and no communication. You will feel like you are going to get promoted by being sent to workshop classes but nothing comes of it. Its alot of spinning your wheels and I've worked with others that this has happend to as well. Not worth it if you want a real job, I just worked there for vacation money:)"
bad,"I have no problem with Whole Foods as a company but the store that I worked at was managed terribly. The TLs were prone to sexism, racism, and nepotism. After being bought by Amazon they slashed the labor budgets and expected less people to do the same work"
bad,It can be a fun workplace depending on who is in management. It's a great place to network. I've learned a lot from customers and why they choose to shop a Wholefood.
bad,"the management was disorganized and the staff was terrible at taking constructive criticism. the hours varied, sometimes we was short staffed. management was not in control of some departments. staffers dd what they wanted to do."
bad,"Didn't have a great experience, wouldn't recommend.  "
bad,"MGMT is a mess, hours are not ideal. Retail nightmare . I would have stayed on and tried to advance but the hours were so bad I moved on. I think this is a job not a career."
bad,Whole foods has gone down the drain since the day I started they do not care about their employees at all!!! I would not recommend coming to work for this company!
bad,"Poor employer. I would never work for these people again. Wrongfully terminated for a workplace injury suffered at a Whole Foods Store, caused by a whole foods employee"
bad,Working here was chaotic. Many teams are often understaffed and underpaid. In addition to that customers are extremely rude and disrespectful and workers are supposed to just suck it up.
bad,Terrible place to work no opportunity for advancement. Terrible pay. Lots of responsibility required with no incentive to stay. Managers sit in office while lower employees do all the work for very little pay.
bad,"Do not work here! All managers and Supervisors are young kids that know nothing about being a leader."
bad,"During the hiring process, management sells you on how great the company is to work for and how it care about it's employees, but in reality, it is far from the truth. Management is ready to throw it's employees under the bus at the drop of dime. Employees are over worked and under paid, and their break policy is shoddy at best. Advancement opportunities are basically only give to those who suck up to management, not to people who actually deserve it."
bad,"Nothing at all that they promise in interviewing stages. Company does not promote individuals, pay is too low, benefits are not what they seem, they do not encourage ideas, no advancement."
bad,"Company with a good mission, but on the ground: poor hiring, ineffective leadership, confused strategic execution."
bad,This place paid well but you could be gone in a second if management doesn’t like you. Politics like any other corporate job. It’s easy just emotionally draining all that they expect of you to be peppy and feed into that fake culture 24/7
bad,"slightly disorganized management.  Confusing direction from Corporate.  Great venue to be able to deliver quality customer service.  Pleasant work environment, good physical plant."
bad,I worked with a lot of immature ex-convicts. I got a lot of hours because I was reliable. Most of my supervisors were unable to string together a sentence and the Human Resources person would make up random reasons why you weren't getting a pay increase when you were due one.
bad,"Store management varied wildly. There were some good people. There were some loose cannons. There were also too many team leaders who wanted to be in store management to the detriment of their own teams. Then there was the revolving door at regional management. Nobody was ever in a position for more than two years. It resulted in a lot of new programs that wasted time and money, many of which would be initiated and not seen through to any conclusion.It seemed like there was also a pervasive air of competition in management. It didn’t feel friendly and it dragged the place down."
bad,"Whole foods used to be a good place to work, then Amazon got involved. Yes everyone makes 15.00 an hour, however the labor budget is low and more and more work gets piled onto employees whom already are overworked and overstressed."
bad,"The interviewer told me one version of the position but the actual job was more difficult than explained. The staff lead locked me into the department because I was late once by 1 minute over ten in the punch. I was immediately put on probation and disallowed a department transfer despite expressing all of the discomforts the position I held was causing me. Both specialty and whole body had eyes on me but I was planted where I was because I was late, by a minute over the allotted 10 during a snow storm. "
bad,"Whole Foods is a great place to buy fresh products but working there is very stressful, Management is poor, you have no work- life balance, you work the schedule they want you to work not what you ask for, they put you on stations you haven't been train for and leave you there, you get written up or absent slips for everything even if its an emergency and you trade shifts with someone, its basically if you high school popular kids that didn't like you very much happened to become you bosses."
bad,"typical grocery store bs, summed up as the incompetent leading the apathetic. erratic scheduling. not as hippie as you'd think and the hot bar is gross."
bad,"At each Whole Foods location I have worked at (2/4 in my area) the stores have been understaffed and overworked. Each supervisor is burnt out, and the amount of favoritism and nepotism shown within the company is insurmountable to anywhere I have ever worked. The employee hotline does nothing to resolve issues. The attendance policy is no where near fair to a normal human being. The opportunity for growth is lacking completely, and this place is not rewarding at all."
bad,The only thing that kept me was the money to provide for my family but the management sucked. They don't understand kid come first because they didn't have any and they over work you so they can just chill in the office. They don't treat everybody equally.
bad,My boss had no idea what my job entailed and all decisions were made by folks from the corporate offices. I enjoyed working with my co-workers however.
bad,"When store first opened, it was great.  Met a lot of  "" interesting"" people.  Went down hill real fast!  Too many management changes. Too many changes within dept.   Many wonderful days with lots of happy customers."
bad,a typical day was unorganized and hostile and not ready for the flow of customer. routinely overworked employees called out or the ones who did show up just roamed the halls listening to music instead of helping fellow employees and customer with poor attitudes as well
bad,"In my current location you receive your schedule the day before the work week when it should be 3 weeks in advance. Not all locations are like this. In the beginning I thoroughly enjoyed working for the company. However, things changed and it isn't a very pleasant work environment. Again it depends on your location."
bad,"There is no typical day at Whole Foods."
bad,"Arrogant team leaders, no friendship in the organization, only concern is no one is loafing around. Heavy work load and pay is tiny with almost no career progress"
bad,"I am happy that WF exist, but the company culture is not healthy for me or my short term or long term well being as an employee."
bad,"Cons: Management doesn't value the employees input. Besides customer frustration, co-workers are for self and aren't willing to help out when needed.(that won't get you far). Management tends to bend to the entitlement of the customers. AC is broken, equipment was made by Methuselah. Customers steal everything."
bad,"On the surface from the outside it looks like it would be a good place to work, If you have work experience you would quickly and easily see that it's a facade, if you are inexperienced you'll fall for being scheduled clopenings, and more than 6 or even 10 days in a row, or being scheduled overtime without being asked, as ""par for the course"". Grievances brought to upper management are usually met with convincing concerned looks and nothing else."
bad,I can tell you from personal experience that Whole Foods market has gone downhill in the past few years that I have worked there.  Whole Foods has become more concerned about money and profits then it’s team members.  Management have promoted with favoritism than actual hard-working people trying to achieve their goals.  What once was a fun atmosphere is now just one filled with aggression and stress.  The new systems in place have only made life more difficult for every employee and the expectations are only getting higher or the pay is remaining the same.
bad,Many long time employees hated working there.  The new culture desired to replace experienced and high paid workers with newer employees...for far less money.  They basically wanted to remove higher paid employees with lower paid temp workers....No one wanted to train/help the new guys in fear of being eventually replaced.  Good people too...but no one wanted to stay there....There was a general lack of....culture...and it seemed that Whole Foods was based on a family type theme...of healthy living...healthy life....protect the environment.  But it is a lie.
bad,"My experience almost killed me . I worked in the Specialty department in Portland, Maine and it was so slated toward young people that it was demeaning . I sank into depression.Plus they don't pay well and with Amazon taking over it is not the hippy culture they pretend it is. It is a grocery store and not a very good one."
bad,"disappointing . amazon is changing the work place"
bad,Horribly under staffed but managers still expected everything to be perfect. The turn over in my department was high and right after the holiday rush they put us on a hiring freeze. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,kitchen cleaning department is understaffed. hard and dirty work. pay is only a bit over minimum wage. no other department wants to train you when you ask for a transfer.
bad,"The management was a mess. I watched managers not use cut gloves and not update binders. When I'd mention it, they would blame another employee, even though it was the manager that worked it. They could not take responsibility, but were the first to yell and criticize if someone else was not up to the codes the managers themselves weren't following. They have a very big ego about their store."
bad,"Management is overpaid and largely absent, making each job more stressful than it needs to be. Little to no training, not much opportunity for growth. The only individuals that are happy have been there for 10+ years, otherwise there is a constant revolving door of talent."
bad,A very bad place to work.I worked I worked in the kitchen and it was every man for themselves and I had one manager who would smile in your face and stab you in the back.Lacked the kitchen equipment for the size of the store.
bad,"Great work environment with great employee perks. Technical education on products is encouraged but not provided [depending on department]. Management always seemed to be absent [not true of every location]. Workplace culture was always 'pass-the-buck.' The hardest part of the job was the lack of advancement within the company. They only seem to hire  from outside the company which severely undermines the opportunity for growth within the company. Part-time benefits are extremely expensive. Despite the higher hourly wage, only hiring part-timers, makes this job difficult to live off of."
bad,"I started working at Whole Foods about a year ago. At that time, the job seemed promising; if you put in the time and effort, you could advance. The starting pay of $11.50 was also appealing. That quickly changed after actually starting there. No one's job is secure due to the very strict attendance policy. Part time employees are expected to work full time hours every week without the benefits that full time employees get. And, if your management just doesn't think you are ""good enough"" to be full time, you might as well start looking for another job because it's never going to work in your favor unless that manager leaves instead."
bad,"I was supervisor of 12 people in my department, and left for a starting wage as a laborer at double my salary. We raised standards and increased sales in our department, but repeatedly got our manpower budget slashed."
bad,"I have never been so stressed out about a job in my life. My particular location started out as a train wreck. I was let go Monday about a situation that happened 12 days ago, 12 freaking days ago!!!!!! The benefits are amazing, however the Whole Foods culture is spiraling down hill and fast. There's so many people that worked for the company for YEARS are deciding to leave. Think long and hard about working for this company, you've been warned."
bad,"I prepared all daily chef case meals , rotisserie chickens, cut meat and poultry. Very nice workplace but very high  turnover in mid to high level supervisor."
bad,the dont care for team members all they cared for was money and customers. the customers be cursing team members and they will get away with it no respect
bad,Management sucks. They play favorites and punish TMs for customer behavior. Wont work with anyone's schedule even if a day is requested off months in advance.
bad,The company is sinking fast. Cutting labor every where it can. It is the typical company that hires consultants to try and improve there sinking revenues. Consulting firm says best way to raise stock prices for the company is to cut labor. Prices are too high for the exact same product every other grocery store is buying its produce. Total sham asparagus water anyone? Don't work here dead end career with opportunities shrinking everywhere. They should of lowered their prices instead of cutting hours and team members jobs.
bad,"Management was shoddy at best. Asked for work ""off the clock."" Promotions were scarce and they didn't care what your experience was and instead followed their ""vibe."" The culture was toxic and most employees were dissatisfied. Communication was terrible and outdated information was still posted in the break rooms. They changed policies while I was there resulting in a $400 a month paycut, instead redistributing that money back into the company and pretending it was going to other employees. Coworkers were pretty great and made the experience worthwhile."
bad,"When I started whole foods prided itself on having a 90% Full Time work force, not it is down to 65% and dropping.  Company restructuring and announcing mass layoffs. Benefits are very expensive especially for Part Time Team Members which is all they are hiring."
bad,"This use to be a fun place to work. We have new mangers that are unqualified, untrained, and inexperienced. I was a manger at blockbuster for a long time! I want to move up at whole foods but all management positions are full time. I have a 16 month old baby at home so full time is not an option. I have an associate degree in social science and a bachelors degree in health and wellness. I have over 10 years of retail experience but I have been working with whole foods for over 2 hears as a cashier! Inexperienced new mangers are treating employees unfairly and without compassion or concern for our general well being."
bad,"Overall, I give Whole Foods Market every bit of credit for elevating the value of sustainability. WFM changed the way we think about food; changed our buying habits and made some of us more conscientious about what we consume. Amazing!"
bad,"Started working in meat dept. NYC store, most of the ppl I work with are pretty cool, fellow team members help me out and we get along. Cannot say the same for management or ""TL, ATL, ASTLs"" etc. They are always watching your every move and regardless of how good you work, how great you are with customers, there is nothing but scrutiny all around. Lazy leadership who don't deserve the tittle or the pay they receive. And as for work, expect to be practically slaved for your measly 10$ an hour job. If you aren't always busy or ""looking busy"" you will get written up. Management will do things like take pics of you and write emails about you behind your back without warning. Expect to be throwing up to 70 lb bags of trash out without help because of laziness. Most leadership here not the job out of high schools and know nothing else besides whole foods, so they only know the ""whole foods"" way of doing things, which is not the best. Have worked for many companies before and never wanted to quit a job so fast before. Most of the ppl who write good reviews are brainwashed with whole foods propaganda, and yes there is pleany to go around. Most of the customers are ok, some are just rediculously difficult, but that's to be expected with retail. In the end, the company is still a ""corporation"" they are no magic saviours of our environment, I've seen enough trash being thrown away to know that. If you need a job to get by, and most of us do, then try and suck it up here, if not, stay away. You can make the same, if not more money else where doing less work and dealing with better leadership."
bad,Smoke and mirrors. Too many (as in all) Senior Regional managers have only worked at WFM so they have limited abilities and tunnel vision. They see what the almighty Austin wants them to see and then executes blindly no matter if the team members are the last thought of. Really a company of administrators for the leadership part has 'left the building'.
bad,"overall i greatly disliked this job, you're worked like a dog and dealing with people all day and you get no where. the management are petty and have a "" what have you done for me lately"" type of mentality."
bad,"I had so much hope for this company and initially was very excited to work here. The orientation and everything was great, it made me feel like they really value their employees. However, after working here I quickly caught on, that that was not the case. Maybe my store just doesn’t have that great of management, but they expect way too much out of a person and could care less how you’re treated. My team lead is so head high in her position, she treats you like dirt unless you suck up to her. There is also no opportunity to move up in my department, I would have to move stores or be trained to work somewhere else. I wouldn’t recommend working here to anyone, this is one of the worst job experiences I’ve had. Not to mention, how expensive their medical stuff is. On top of that, they take a lot for taxes as well. Not worth your time."
bad,"Your value to the company is based on a point system, so don't get sick, call out for emergencies, etc. Doing so cost you points and can lead to termination."
bad,"Horrible place to work and the teams are horrible, people are rude and nasty to you and they make you do jobs that’s out of your job description. So watch out"
bad,"I think they put to much on one person and the expectations was really not good .They just need new management that cares about loyal workers."
bad,"I was hired while WFM was still a company that focused on employee happiness and integrity. Shortly after the company was made public and in preparation for selling out to Amazon, re-structured by laying off 1,500+ people and eliminating a lot of middle-management positions which were used as an avenue to move up in the company. Hours, positions, and pay were reduced, stretching already over-worked and under staffed teams thin."
bad,"I spent a year and a quarter at WFM. At first things were great. I was getting consistent hours and my team was great. Then there was a misunderstanding between my team leader and I, and I felt the environment shifted. My hours started to be cut or I would receive a schedule that was all over the place. In addition to that, I would get written up for menial things such as chewing gum on the floor. "
bad,"What I learned at this job was that no matter how. much of ones personal life is sacrificed, They still see you as a number in leaderships books. A number that brings in the money, I Feel like regardless of all the chances Leadership gave me to stay. they never considered any of my perspectives as to why I felt like I truly deserved a raise at that job before they Let me go. Also ""Back In the day"""
bad,"Took them over 3years(since before I was employed) to listen to employees about what what would make the wharehouse run smoother. Then made it look like it was their idea and changed the incentive plan, because the work ran faster, to make us work harder for the same amount of money we were getting before. More work should equal more money..... guess not....."
bad,If you get an interview with store leadership be sure to interview them too. With rapid growth Store leaders got those jobs some of whom were terrible at it. There were stores wit great culture and leaders but many more without.
bad,"Years ago Whole Foods was a fun, well paid career with a lot of room for advancement. After the economic slow down of 2008, things started to change. Pay rates stayed stagnant. They tried to force their culture down their ""team members"" throats. Wanting everyone to be vegan and eat healthy. They also demanded we find team members with open availability to work part time positions so we wouldn't be required to provide them with benefits."
bad,"The quality level of the food has gone down considerably,  since Amazon has taken over. Little by little they are chipping away at everything Whole Food Markets has stood for; eventually, it would be unrecognizable. They work you to the bone...beware...apply at your own risk."
bad,I didn't enjoy working at whole foods. It was a terrible time. People are rude and management sucked. There was a lot of favoritism and racists people.
bad,"Management does not Greet or talk to team members I tried to treat everybody the same at first then realized that a smile and hello were ignored by team leaders who thought they were in there curing cancer or something way too carried away with their importance to the world kinda a legend in their own mind mentality crazy,snobby and outright hostile."
bad,"This organization(NE Region) from my experience definitely is up to something shady.  Whether its the hidden rules and guidelines that they hold you accountable for or the stunting of growth. This might be the only organization I've witness where if you trying to better yourself they will plot against you. If you try to go for a higher position or transfer your leadership will A. not let you transfer B.Act like they are going to help then give unwarranted negative reviews to the store you are trying to go too C.find ways to write you up. The leadership waste more time walking around the store taking pictures of employees licenses plates then they do  making sure the store has what it needs. This is not an employee friendly work environment. Especially the RCM store in Madison, NJ. I would only recommend this job to people who don't care about being respected, don't mind being a scapegoat, and last but least don't mind walking pins and needles at work."
bad,WF is an ok place to work. It is definitely not a good place to work over the age of 40. It is a great place if you are a young person and don't need to support a family.
bad,"really fast pace and bad management the pay was not worth it, the only thing I learned was some of the interesting different foods the work culture is cool because everybody helps each other out and like a big family but as far as the management and work to pay ratio, I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,"poor management skills and overall waste of my time working there.  "
bad,That pretty much says it all the pay is right but the sacrifice for it is not worth it. They have lost their way with the Amazon purchase. They raised the starting pay but cut hours and still expected the same amount of work to get done.
bad,"and then they got worse and more uncaring as time moved on. When I began working there, it was the laid back place I thought it was, but over time it became more corporate."
bad,"The job and the days aren't necessarily difficult work, they are physically laborious depending on which department you're in. The best part about the job is the people you meet; it attracts interesting creative minds. However, the management is often promoted based on politics rather than true skill and the popularity contest makes for a bunch of leaders who aren't prepared to guide a team to success. It creates a really frustrating environment for team members who know their stuff and want to get the whole team on the same page, but is constantly fighting a tide of bad management and poor communication. The bonds and team strength you get from your fellow TMs is usually awesome and the only part that makes it worth staying. I would say it's a great job for young people who are eager to be hands-on with learning business practices and operations as I had tons of training in leadership and business over the years, but once you know what you're doing it's entirely infuriating to try to work with so much working against you in terms of support, staffing and you're own work/life balance. They will take every second you're willing to give them. They let those who want to slack do so and put the work on anyone who is doing a good job so that they have to care all the dead weight."
bad,"will never work here again will never work here again not happy working here full of people who are back stabbers management is one of the wrose , the customers are rude and no one has your back"
bad,Management was very poor and my boss was incredibly mentally abusive. It was a very competitive environment and the only way you move up is by favoritism.
bad,"My resignation was a result of such an incredibly unhealthy work environment, and the overall interactions between coworkers. The pay was dismal at best and even over time, after years of giving myself to that company, I received a 55¢ increase in wage per hour."
bad,"A typical day at work was slow paced."
bad,"Job culture is a joke. Team members are excellent and great to work with.  Regional and global leadership are clueless,  inept and uncaring. As a interim job or short term job it is acceptable, but a career here will kill your soul."
bad,"The company attracts great people but can be generally unfocused when it comes to organizational structure, core values, and team member retention. Management has lost focus of in-store needs to focus on larger global priorities."
bad,"This place nearly killed me, and with a smile on their face! Typical, horrible American corporation! I started there a very happy and healthy person and left on long-term disability. Deathly ill.  They deleted me to the best of their ability, all the while making it seem like they were so good to me. As if they had done me some kind of favour."
bad,"This was one of the toughest jobs I have ever had. I worked in the prepared foods department and started off in the chefs case to the salad bar to pizza, sandwiches and fresh pack. It was my hope that I could find a place within the store that I would be happy. THis never happened and its almost impossible to get out of prepared foods once youv'e been hired in. "
bad,"simply put .. don't work there "
bad,"Whole Foods is fine if your don't mind being micro-managed. Also, there is a wide pay gap for men over women (I know for a fact that a male co-worker with only 2 years of CS experience made $2 per hour more than me - with 20 years of CS experience and I worked for Whole Foods 2 years longer then that same male employee. Not fair!"
bad,"The store manager has all control with no back up for team members from corporate.  This is fine if you have a good store leader, but is horrible if you have a bad store manager.  Mine was petty, played favorites, and had a clique of people who were loyal to her over whole foods.  If you are on ""her team"" you get promoted, even if you are a horrible manager.  If you try to suggest positive change, then you are labelled negative.  If you cross her you are done, that's what all the team members say."
bad,I worked in three different locations within the company and the third was so horrific I left the company for good. Know who you report to before accepting an offer.
bad,"Overall, the Philadelphia Center City Whole Foods Market has a good starting wage. However, it is a flagship store and very new to the area with all new staff. Keeping that in mind management isn't the great and very unprofessional."
bad,WFM has been on a long downward trajectory as far as being a great place to work ever since it went public. The standards and mission which used to be taken to heart by most of the employees is now nothing more than corporate rhetoric. The company continues to grow as a corporate behemoth with a sole purpose of increasing monetary value for its shareholders.
bad,"Whole Foods was a great place to work...up until about two years ago. ""Job consolidations"" (i.e. firings) led to an unmanageable amount of work put on the remaining team. Things are only getting worse."
bad,"Sure, some people ok, no accountability and very poor ordering and buying pratices. Buyers are inconsiderate and majority of people don't follow their values. Do not recommend now that amazon owns them."
bad,"Don't ever get sick, don't ever have anyone die, don't ever be sure of yourself, have an opinion or god forbid be a woman. Some of the management is sexist, racist, and backwards. Front end is wonderful, even though sometimes the shifts are short, if you find that there is a manager is the store managers back pocket, watch your back because they're going to be shifty as anything. Good luck if you get hired, don't take anything personally."
bad,"WFM does not know how to run a business. In order to succeed you need to be great at your core business before branching out. But they cannot keep their shelves stocked, correct tags up or pay reasonable money for people busting their butts! They let go tons of people but made the rest of the employees (team members) work hard for no pay increase. Everyone higher up is either related or just knows people. They do not get promoted for actually know their job or doing it well. Yes you get a discount on food, but it is all over priced. You can get better items and a better selection at a real grocery store."
bad,Management will talk down to you at any time in front of anyone (co-workers and customers alike). Menial tasks are given out and expected to be performed immediately with perfection. They would call you in all the time and have little respect for schedule limitations.
bad,"I love Whole Foods and what it represents. Its still a young company and learning which direction to go, I will always remember my experience with WFM and how I learned to become a leader."
bad,Started as a good company but has changed and the culture is gone. Management will conspire against you. If they want u out your home.
bad,Just do your best stay positive and happy smile get the customer's what the need as far as great customer service. Do your job stay humble
bad,"Very busy everyday from opening until closing. Learned alot about health eating, organic foods, supplements, overall body care. Managment depends on what department and what store you work in. Some good products but a little pricey."
bad,"Management is cordial but strict. Pay is low and company is anti-union. You get points for being late or calling in sick. Advancement is nil. Everyone who works there seems sad and unhappy. It is no longer possible for most workers to get full time hours, because ""we can't afford the health care costs"". Job openings are flown but given to outsiders. You will get counseled if you talk too much. All in all, much like Walmart, but with a ""green"" facade: in other words, a minimum wage, dead end job, with no future."
bad,"Good starting pay, does teach you a lot about food and healthy eating. Comfortable work environment for any department that is not produce or grocery. Named departments have immature management, at least in this location, their night staff are consistently understaffed and overworked."
bad,"I had a lot of fun working at this place in the beginning and I developed a strong bond with my co workers but the management was terrible and the location was also terrible.  It was much too small to work with and, when I brought up to management about how I couldn't get to my product because of other departments leaving their products haphazardly, nothing was done. Benefits took forever to be received and the people that worked the hardest always received the short end of the stick."
bad,the job was ok but it was to much work for little pay the boss kept hiring and firing but the environment was ok i did learn new sills the training was simple and easy
bad,"Typical workday for WFM Team Members these days is understaffed and overworked with the expectation of pushing the company forward. Currently my team is scheduled 10% under 40 hours per week. "
bad,"Busy, chaotic and insane, but still fun.  Team Members make the stores, not leadership.  The hardest part of the job was trying to be something to everyone."
bad,"Promise flexibility but want you to have an open schedule. Allow some to have set schedules while others pick up the slack. Show favoritism to those wanting to post for other departments. No support from management . Say open door policy but only if it's what coincides with the company's philosophy. Not enjoyable environment . Want more, more, more from their employees."
bad,"Go in, stand at your register for your shift, cash humans out. Sometimes you get to bag, do side duties, or help out in other departments."
bad,"The job had good days and bad days.  Management in prepared foods is a joke. There is a severe communication problem there and if you complain about employees not doing their job, nothing is done."
bad,"My reviews always went well, cause I've always volunteer to help others no matter what the situation might be. For example, our new hires, our customer services boots etc.Exceptional customer service comes from exceptional employee training, which each of our sale associate must pass in order to continue  working with us. Another change I implemented was the creation of the merchandise position. The employees are responsible for receiving shipments, and interacting with customers at the registers. This allows sale associates to focus on serving the client without distraction."
bad,"contractors are not treated as a team member.  only seen as contractors.  I lived the covered garage, but I could only walk passed the gym on the way to the office"
bad,Management is only concerned when the safety or food inspector comes in.
bad,"Every day at Whole Foods was different, you may have one fire to put out or it may just be great. Overall it was a unique experience, I learned a great deal about management. I enjoyed the people and characters that I worked with, being able to learn from each of them was  joy. Although upper management was a bit difficult to understand and work with at times, I learned from them as well. I love interacting with people so that was a joy and pleasure to meet different customers daily. I never felt that I had the support of my manager as well as the upper management. So I never trusted any of them, I did enjoy my time there though."
bad,"a lot of labor for a couple of pats on the back we cant even have free food, we should at least get that after we spoil it. we throw so much food away its ridicule. They hire anyone! meaning that we hire inexperienced slow, lazy and young people. Wich in turn slows us down and our hours are cut."
bad,As a team member working for whole foods there is a lot of stress and pressure put on by management to do your job. You are always fighting wild ideas and poor tools given to you to perform your job. Extra jobs are given to you also to perform with no time to do them. Blame is alway put on the employes for mistakes that are not caused by them.
bad,"I worked for Whole Foods for almost 10 years. For health reasons was put on medical-leave without so much as a get well card from fellow employees, leadership. These were people I called not only coworkers but friends. Whole Foods does not practice the core values in which they founded the company based upon."
bad,"I worked at whole foods before Amazon bought it out, and it was not enjoyable."
bad,Amazon has changed the culture in many ways. Whole Foods is no longer  a shared fate concept so team member ownership is excluded now. Cost saving measures have caused some jobs to get phased out leaving only lateral moves or moving on all together. If you enjoy the conventional concept you will be fine. If you need the mission statements once embraced think Wheatsville or Natural Grocers.
bad,"I used to love working at Whole Foods market, but since amazon purchased the company a couple years ago the culture of the company has changed dramatically. It is not the company that I started working at nearly 7 years ago."
bad,Very dirty and unorganized work environment. Scheduling was not flexible. Very stressful and rushed work environment. Did not have many opportunities to progress with company.
bad,It’s was a learning experience. Learned how to cut meat . Learned customer service skills. I was always nice and polite to people even the management.
bad,Don't do it unless you're about to be homeless. I will tell you that you shouldn't trust any management and even some Team Members. Chose wisely who you trust.
bad,"The company has changed since Amazon bought it. I have been there for 15 years and lately I feel so stress. Yes they pay well, but they make you pay for that. I am doing the job of three people. They have cut labor tremendously and the store manager I work for is kind of bipolar. "
bad,"I worked there two weeks didn’t like and I quit "
bad,"Whole Foods Market is the most unmanaged corporation I have ever seen. I worked as a Bakery Team Member for a few months.  While the work was mediocre and unfulfilling,  they did pay well, starting at $15/hour.  Nothing you do is enough."
bad,"The culture of my store was toxic.  Daily our ASTL would tell us how we had under performed his expectation, while never offering once to lend a hand. Sad to see such a ""great"" company treat people like garbage.  I had very high expectations, but was underwhelmed daily until I gave up a year later."
bad,"decision are made on subjective base.  If you are liked by leadership, sky is a limit. If you are NOT liked by leadership, it is short lasting career ."
bad,"The Whole Foods I worked at was too political. Management focused more on keeping in employees ""in line"" through superficial manipulation tactics rather than on doing a good job at the work that had to be done. Gossip was accepted as truth and there was no chain of command for vetting wether complaints about other employees were fact or not. The employee who complained the most would often get their way and those who actually worked hard were only asked to work harder."
bad,"Overall the company has good intentions, but over the past few years thay have lost site of values and what important to  the customer experience as well as the team members."
bad,"If you must apply apply to a department not as a floater. as a floater you will go everywhere and that would be either 1 department for an entire shift or 3 departments for an entire shift. some places will be good to work at but you'll find your not so favourite departments to and you'll dread having to work there, also you won't know where you'll be working till you get to the store and find you name on the board assigned to where you go. some departments don't even train you they put there and leave you there to figure it out for yourself. management is horrible cause they don't even bother talking to you or tell you any specific details on what you may have to do and you're basically treated like !@# from the higher ups with absolutely no respect, and some that do talk to you give you fake smiles and lie through their teeth. customers are horrible as well but that comes with the territory of a grocery store but since it's higher end they are more @#$.  apply at your own discretion"
bad,"When I started working for the company it was great, but then too many corporate changes were made and management saw nothing but profits and budget, which was detremental to my store as it cut available work hours down, thus limiting staffing options. Most of the 4 years I worked there it was with the bare minimum amount of workers, less if there were call outs, and high demand from management to push less workers for more work."
bad,"Fired for unreasonable rule, as all employee s exit a back door."
bad,"Management is the worse thing when it comes to working here. They are so two face, and only care about customers. Will walk pass you without saying a simple hello. In my half year here they never introduced themselves in person, not even when they'd walk past you. Co-workers were the best thing about working here. 80% of the customers are rude, and feel too priviledge."
bad,Never done retail before however from this experience never will again. My experience with customers were brutal at times because they wanna speak to you rude and once you get someone from staff to deal with the matter they make you feel like you're the blame so please if you're interested in Whole foods walk on bye and do something else that 15.00 dollars ain't  it.
bad,"As long as you on't go against management and the way they want to do things then you will be fine.  However if you have an idea to make things more productive and efficient then they will give you a warning and then will fire you, because you made things better."
bad,What used to be a great place to work is now a daily frustrating experience. Benefits continue to decline and job requirements consistently increase with no pay increase or reduced pay (made possible by job title changes).
bad,When I worked at whole foods it was less than desirable. The language my management used towards me was absolutely disgusting. The team I worked on did not mesh well at all causing a lot of arguing and fighting.
bad,"Whole Foods provides a flexible schedule, suitable training, and opportunities to learn and grow within the company. Whole Foods also provides excellent benefits package which is very attractive for working college students."
bad,"Whole Food's culture is poor, the staff is treated unkindly by management and customers alike. The only good thing about working was my fellow team members who made the shifts a little better."
bad,"Good pay, I just had the unfortunate luck to end up at a bad location with some bad management. I worked with some racist people that called me oreo in Spanish,"
bad,"Was kept at part time status despite being worked full time during most of my employment due to a loophole used by management. As this company becomes more corporate, there is less emphasis placed on people and quality and more emphasis placed on making money. Store team leader constantly played favorites and was outright manipulative and, at times, emotionally abusive."
bad,"Management is horrible. Very hard to find a good Team Leader. All the ones I have had (but one) don't actually listen nor care for your concerns. You're their to do their dirty work while they get better hours and get paid more ;) They love to keep tabs on customer complaints on you. Point system for tardiness and customer complaints is one sided and doesn't account for harassment, discrimination, disability, etcetera. They just want to make sure that they look good, even if it is by throwing you under the buss. They expect you to be a robot. It is like any other customer service or retail oriented job for that matter. You just get more entitled people who abuse policies and dump their egos on you all day while expecting you to turn the cheek and smile while doing so. "
bad,"Too much to deal with, unrealistic expectations, poor communication between workers and managers. Fake employees who present themselves as nice and perfect but deep down they were differernt"
bad,Ever since amazon bought whole foods it's been downhill from there. positions have been cut its all about money and not the team members who work so hard to keep things going and management is well like i said a downhill affect.
bad,"Oh boy where do I start? The management is terrible. Store leadership has a control obsession over EVERYTHING! Out of 100 good days, you'll get written up for having just 1 bad day. Favoritism runs the building. Work loads are based on individual cases so equality isn't possible in this environment. Everyone is scared to lose their job over saying nonsense things. All the management listens to every conversation that everyone has around them, so eavedropping is rampant. If you're good at your job, they'll make you work by yourself each day while everyone else gets help and a partner. The management lies to you. They act like they're your friend but will turn on you and tattle to their boss on what you said. Management doesn't teach new employees on how to do their job. They rely on the other workers to teach them, which stresses them out more. Be careful working in the Napa store. The management is the worst part by far! IT SERIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE FIXED! From the very top, they aren't there to be your friend. They care about profits & the only way they'll like you is if you just say yes to everything they say and follow orders. If you like an impossible work load made for two people & then being told you didnt do it right, this job is for you. It's a bad place for employees."
bad,"The best part of the job was some of the people I worked with, being introduced to many different products and companies, and free samples. The worst part was the scheduling (work/life balance is non-existent), the pay, and being treated poorly by management."
bad,I loved the company until 2007 when the whole paycheck concept caught up with a poor economy. Raises stopped or severely cut. It really hurt when they let go hundreds of people.
bad,"I've learned several different positions which made me a better leader. A typical day at work is to put your best foot forward everyday and make sure to thank your team members for coming to work and for doing their part. The hardest part is to make sure, I make time to take a break. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you helped a customer in whatever they need help with and they come back and thank you personally, and they said, you made me look like a rockstar at my dinner party because of your help and offerings. That's just made your day!"
bad,Poor management. Workplace culture was depressing. Everything came in frozen and all you do is take it out of a box and put it on the shelf. The only thing enjoyable was my coworkers
bad,My immediate boss was a younger guy that was just trying to make things work in our area. But if you got the Store team leader's attention and it was in a negative light - you either weren't long for this job or your life would become a series of pointless meetings where you might get accused of things you never did. The name of the game was complain to the boss about whoever you didn't like until they decided to do something about that person.
bad,"Mangement is either having a dictator or someone under qualified to be in charge. The people that fall in the middle of that get it the roughest. "
bad,"Pay is okay, Poor management. No real work life balance. Benefits are decent. HR is no real help. Team member happiness is no longer a core value. Soul sucking"
bad,"Poor management, plays favorites and often does not treat employees like human beings - just numbers. Regional leadership is even worse - has absolutely no idea what is realistically able to be accomplished. Extremely out of touch and has blatant disregard for efficient workflow, instead opting for processes that create more barriers/work for tasks that should be simple and straightforward. Employees are chastised for not performing a job exactly according to standard operating procedure."
bad,"The location I worked at had an oppressed atmosphere, and most employees felt underpaid and unhappy with the lack of benefits. The department I worked in had poor management and employee bias."
bad,Honestly amazon has made this a terrible company to work for. They've cut labor to a point where it's incredibly hard to get anything done and every day is a new surprise as to what horrible new way your job will become harder.
bad,I was not a good fit for this company.  Very slow paced.  Inconsistent management.  Staffed with non-culinary people.  Wild left turn from the training and experience I received at Culinary School & at high-end restaurants & hotels.  I did not enjoy my time here.
bad,"When it was under the full control without Amazon interference, it was a much different job. It was a stressful job yes, but rewarding and well worth the effort."
bad,"They do not conduct proper protocols for situations involving staff regulations. They fired people at the Post Oak location through firing and rehiring them and firing again because inadequate evidence appeared at the hands of upper management (store manager who came from Virginia). I was always used for upper management processes despite only being a supervisor, cook, cashier, event planner which I did not get compensated for. I never worked for one department because of my versatile skills. My team, however, were pretty great people and they all supported each other through store rushes, holiday events, and weekly promotions. When I moved to a store in New York, the store up north wanted to lower my wage underneath minimum wage and said they couldn't pay me higher because it wasn't in their budget."
bad,I work for whole food for about two years  the boss I work for had made  painfully difficult management there will not listing to complaints about team leader  even when the boss have history  with problem with workers  don't get me wrong I love the place benefit top notch paid good not great but good friendly  customers    it's the bosses that made it  uncomfortable place to work at
bad,Worked as a cashier at a very busy location.  I loved the work but the ability to advance within the company was very difficult. Before job posting were every posted management already had the person who would be filling that position in mind so coming in as a new hire and working 6 months an trying to apply for other positions was very difficult.
bad,"The company changed after the Amazon acquisition. Company culture got lost in the rush of Amazon taking over. Before, and even shortly after, the company still had a strong idea of what it should be and what it was. After the purchase, the entire thing started to switch to more amazon, more prime, and less and less about the team members or the customers. On either side of the register it feels like being just a cog in the amazon machine."
bad,"This place sucks, crazy hours, bad management from team leadership ,very unstable, everyone works on the edge and mad because of the poor lack of communication from leadership,crazy amount of pressure"
bad,"In my time at Whole Foods, I saw more drama and unnecessary complications than anything else. Leadership is weak and unqualified. On top of that, discrimination played a huge role in who and how people were not only promoted but also how they were scheduled from week to week. My own personal concerns were never listened to, for instance working 8 to 10 days straight and enduring ""clopens""-where I would close and get home around 10:30 and have to be back in at 5:30 the next morning-at least twice a month. Which is all taxing not only on my body and mind but also on my morale as well as a number of other ""team"" members' morales (I was not the only one is this boat). The incompetence and the gossip culture that permeated throughout the departments-particularly Prepared Foods-was enough to make a person crazy, and frankly it did. Quitting was scary on a financial level, but when it came down to my peace of mind and ability to enjoy day-to-day life, it was relieving."
bad,Whole foods Market/Amazon is not an employee first business. There is high turnover. The company has introduced SOP but constantly changes expectations.
bad,Kitchen work is very hard but it's fun and rewarding. It builds a hard work ethic and if you're cooking you're learning life skills. But serving customers along with that fast environment is almost unbearable. Job is only good if you're just starting out and need something.
bad,When I first started with Whole Foods it was an enjoyable place to work. by 2016 many changes started happening. The many team leaders and assistant team leaders are constantly hiring unqualified people and then leaving early or going on vacation leaving the others in the department having to train while also doing the production they are responsible for.
bad,"This company has dramatically changed for the worst, and it is very clear that the team members are not a priority anymore.  The majority of upper management does absolutely nothing all day, and just micro manages.  They don't know how to perform tasks in almost any department, and do not protect their employees."
bad,Once Amazon took over it became all about money. They started firing people and only wanted to increase profits. Amazon completely destroyed the Whole Foods culture and they decreased the ability for raises.
bad,The new building had many issues. Managers were unhelpful and rude towards subordinates. Responsibility for team direction was often a game of hot potato among the managers where blame was shifted for things that went wrong. Worst of all they were more or less impeding employees to be certified for use of key equipment on the job. The team fell apart while I worked there because of poor management and lack of respect and empowerment to peers from managers.
bad,"They favor back door favoritism to integrity and transparency. team leaders can have intercourse and do drugs on company property while team members that don't ""play along"" get ostracized and targeted."
bad,"The Morristown location is the worst place to work for a Wholefoods Market store.  Management has no idea of what they're doing and does not support the Teams as Team Members would like to and need to."
bad,"Daily workload is busy, customers can be tough.  Schedule is constantly changing and you have to work every weekend if you want to get the most hours which is the hardest part of the job.  You have no life outside of whole foods."
bad,"The management were terrible! They watched workers struggle and never helped. They pointed out only negative , always looking to writ someone up. The only good part was the connection between struggling team members."
bad,"I am  health and wellness enthusiast so when the opportunity to work for WFM presented itself I jumped at the chance. Quickly work ethic and logical team success was overshadowed by personality perceptions, judgments and upper management friendships."
bad,Atmosphere went from family and supportive to restricting and oppressive when whole foods standardized. It is now just like working at any other mass chain grocery. Labor reduced while work load increased.
bad,The customers are very rude and the managers treat you like you are beneath them. There is no job security as you could get fired for anything. That is one of the reasons why they do not have a union. They start you off at a good pay then increase your work load.
bad,"I asked a lot of questions. I wasn't very happy with my experience. I was made to feel through Whole Foods healthcare that my diabetes management after a decade's worth of experience was actively harming me. In hindsight, I really wonder how they were able to get away with that. Be careful friends :)"
bad,"9 years at whole foods the last 2 years have been awful."
bad,The company has changed a lot since the layoffs that happened last October. There is NOT one person who feels secure in their job anymore and the chance of advancement to full time has pretty much gone away. The expectations put on workers are outrageous and schedules change at a moments notice.
bad,They want you to not have a personal life. The schedule was changed a day before the new schedule was set to begin a number of times after i already fit my plans around the original schedule that was posted. when i tried to make a case about it i was told i had to deal with it
bad,"Whole foods cares about getting the largest part time workforce. Same a s Walmart, so they don't have to provide benefits. Often cut hours and no guarantee/track for advancement or salary improvement."
bad,"Great Co-Workers, decent pay, but high stress and high demand for results. The company has changed a lot over my 6 year tenure.  General consensus from team members is to replace the ill-equipped, grandfathered in senior leadership with persons of retail knowledge and high business aptitude."
bad,"As a receiving associate i would receive freight, distribute to correct departments, and also process paperwork to pay companies for freight received"
bad,"Almost all of the team members complained about leadership who were always looking to make themselves look good to management. They do not care about the TMs feelings or having them work late shifts when they know public transportation is not available after a certain hour, knowing the TMs will have to take a taxi home.  They don't make enough money for that.  Team Leaders would smile  and be nice to us, all the while stabbing us in the back.  We all walked on eggs, wondering when it would be our turn to get the boot.   I'm glad I left before it happened to me.  "
bad,They don't pay enough the amount of responsibilities you are put with. Management was a joke. Difficult to move up. The company was cutting job positions even though it was expanding. Team members were fun to work with.
bad,"I don't think that Whole Foods Market is as great as they used to be. I don't think that they are thinking of their employee's futures and how they can promote within, but instead hire for outside and complain that no one want's to try and reach higher goals. The overall feeling I had my last 5 months there was of stress, overall un-happiness, and anxiety that you could lose your job at any moment. They are actively cutting jobs to keep their numbers higher, but that is instead poisoning the workforce and causing a general un-ease during your workday."
bad,"needs improvement in management, for a wellness supermarket chain, it needs to improve lunch breaks to at least an hour, half hour is not enough time."
bad,"I do not know where to begin with the issues at Whole Foods.  It is a great company that is founded on great values; however, it is nothing if there is no management to back it up.  The standards / expectations / rules only apply to those leadership wants them to; if they agree they do not like someone, leadership will go to great lengths to push that individual out; the weight of each department is often placed on the 2-3 good employees that department has; males receive higher raises than females regardless of work ethic; etc.  I dot not mind what I do and my team leader is awesome; however, the behavior I witness almost on a daily basis of our leadership is absolutely disgusting.  The hardest part of the job is when we are given unrealistic expectations when dealing with a lack of team members."
bad,"Working understaffed to management who complaints the departments aren't doing enough. "
bad,"Long hours standing all day,  management disorganised,  culture of fear regarding job security,  company values ignored by managers,  rotas constantly changing at short notice.  OK if you are a student wanting some holiday work but as a full time employee expect to be bored unappreciated and exhausted,  I've never worked anywhere that the full time staff are so unhappy.  On the plus side if you can bring yourself to stick it out they do pay better than most shops once your first year is over - avoid customer service team as all you will do is work on a till for eight hours a day for forty hours a week!!!!"
bad,"This is a lovely place to work if your job isn't your life. If your looking for a serious job to advance and learn. This is Not for you! they make it seem like moving up or getting raises is easy... totally not and there is not immediate feedback.. you only find out issues at yearly review...."
bad,"This job required being able to multi-task in double time while remaining pleasant and courteous. Many customers were regulars that you get to know by name. Mangers were very helpful, but very discriminatory and obvious favoritism with employees. The hardest part of this job was always moving at a very fast pace while remaining accurate and managing other employees while dealing with  customers at the service desk. The best part was the multitude of events and raffles etc that they did for the employees."
bad,"Slow moving internally. A real hurry up and wait company..Very political, little to zero training programs. Can not learn on your own. Lot of stress little help."
bad,"Mandatory overtime (work or get written up). Pay is not equivelant to work required. Split days off, which you work into your days off. No available training for advancement, or opportunities for advancement."
bad,"A normal day of work was quiet and uneventful. I developed a more efficient way to perform at work. The store has wonderful products and great atmosphere. Forever, the employees and supervisors are deceiving and critical. The hardest part of work was working with that weren't looking out for your well being while working, The most enjoyable part of work was helping the customers and learning about the products in the store."
bad,"Whole Foods, after they hire you, tells you later that they allow the employees in your department to vote you in or out on a purely subjective basis.  I never would have accepted the job had I known this because it strikes me as bizarre and cannot possibly be legal.  I witnessed rule breaking and law breaking while I was there for the short time I was.  My peers made it clear they did not like me.  It got to be very disconcerting so I decided to quit. "
bad,Worked for said company for 13 years before being termininated for policy violation without prior warning.
bad,"when I walked into that store in 1997, I mean wow.. I knew I was going to work there. the work environment was calmer back then. I brought an apple to the interview and gave it to the pretty girl who hired me. I'm old school.."
bad,"You receive great pay in exchange for your life. The company will not be flexible in schedule even if you are in school. They will call you on your days off to have you come in and if you refuse, retaliation is around the corner. You must be liked by upper management in order to move up despite the fact you have the skills to do the job."
bad,it is fun but i am looking for a job where I can balance my family life and my career
bad,"It is a corporation and no matter what marketing tactics are being used, the bottom line is as long as there are ""share holders"" at stake, it's about making money and that's what a corporation(s) is/are, period! But the key variable for the success or failure of a store ultimately boils down to choosing and placing the right STORE TEAM LEADER who live the culture and not just pretending but instead only thinks about his/her compensation."
bad,Very little training given to new leadership. There is no training program or outline when you are hired. Company rules benefit the employee making employee accountability difficult.
bad,"I worked in the front end at Whole Foods. The point system and constant nitpicking makes it hard enough to stay on top of yourself, let alone manage people. Upper management hang out in their offices playing around while their floor teams are out trying to fulfill intense requirements. "
bad,"Leadership wants employees that can contribute ideas to make the organization better, however, most leaders are not willing to change.  Lacking in minority and veteran representation in the workplace."
bad,"They got away from what keeping a team member happy, lots of micromanagement, and just not the greatest place other than the people that work there. Overall not the greatest company to work for. Also work ethic is questionable."
bad,"I found it rather difficult to work there, If you take any issue you may have to management they consider you a nuisance. The team leaders are very unexperienced."
bad,"Manager's have put in a lot of work and have been taken advantage of for years so they expect you to put up with the same."
bad,"Very unhappy people who work there starting in management. They took their terrible day out on the employees. They made it very clear they had their favorites. Worked with incompetent people who were not qualified for their positions. My assistant and department managers could barely speak English, read or write. Poor communication skills on top of incompetence. There was quite a bit of bickering making it hard to work."
bad,The management wasn’t good the scheduling was just Atrocious no paid time off god forbid you called out sick after working there for 5 plus years you would be written up the next day or if you come back
bad,"Poor management,  run by kids with no experience.  Upper management,  just as clueless.   No flexible schedule,  lots of micromanaging.  Hard to move up and difficult to get a raise..."
bad,"Joining this company I thought how awesome this work environment was, but I have been here for over a year and it has just gone downhill. I've had work issues involving harrassment and management would not assist until I went to higher ups about the issue and got it resolved way later.  I've been asking for a full time postition repeatedly or for more hours but management pushes it to be asked again at a later time but then more PT employees are hired that are not needed. I feel Whole foods managment does not care about individuals."
bad,"I worked at Whole Foods nearly five years as a cashier and left feeling unfulfilled. Management politics and a clique mentality made it nearly impossible for advancement. Employee benefits were slashed more and more each year I was there, as they were trying to make themselves more appealing to be bought out prior to the Amazon acquisition. It's not a terrible place to work but it's not what I would recommend to someone looking for advancement if they don't drink the kool-aid."
bad,"At first it was a fun place to work. As you continue your journey there, it becomes more stressful. They begin to ask a lot of the employees and also do not actually manage job/life balance like they say. The minute you get on the bad side of management, they try and run you out."
bad,"In the bakery the job is too stressful many because the managers don’t put in their part, don’t communicate. The store works on a “favorites” basis with the employees. I believe the hard workers aren’t even getting paid how much they should be. Unfair not enough hours, poor management, pay is bad I’m tired of living off paycheck to paycheck. This job is good for people who don’t have to pay a lot of responsibilities or you’re looking to find two jobs."
bad,"Good temp job for college kids and the discount is cool. Otherwise I don’t feel a lucrative career.  The whole kumbaya team is just a facade.  Horrible scheduling with team leaders with control issues that provide  "
bad,"The job used to be alright, but as amazon got more involved we saw less benefits, less pay, and more work.   Also the company has this whole policy of blaming the workers for management mistakes. We are expected to stock shelves but because of the new OTS policy we don't buy as much so we run out of things quicker, which isn't a big deal because we used to just pack whatever but now OTS which makes us order less also doesn't like us stocking shelves with random items in the back. So our store leaders would get upset with how poorly stocked the shelves were, but that's by design."
bad,"I worked Overnight here for a little over a year and half. I worked hard, did the right things, did whatever leadership asked of me and beyond. I started out part time and ended up full time. They trusted me enough to make me the receiver after the previous receiver quit to move back home. They gave me a decent enough raise after my 6 month and 12 month period were up. The pay was/is better than what you would get at an Acme or Giant at least from an entry level position. Sometimes we would get free samples of snacks and what not from companies that the workers were allowed to try. The decent pay and free samples is where the positives of working for the store end. "
bad,"Let me be frank, Whole Foods squashed any talks of unionizing, changes in benefits, and did everything it could to suppress its employees. I worked overnight, in ten hour shifts, to receive the daily shipment and shelve them before the store opened. But it was a team of two to four people (thanks to high turnaround rate) and rather than having it be ""get it done before we open"" it was ""get it done at a constantly increasing rate and if anyone messes up everyone gets yelled at."" Any problems in grocery were immediately pinned on us, whether or not it was our actual fault. That's not even getting into them firing me for asking for reasonable accommodation."
bad,"Since amazon has taken over the workplace has become very lackluster. Management no longer cares for team building and instead focuses on making the most money they can. They're cutting hours constantly, cutting staff, and turning away from the original vision into another company unconcerned with employees or their comfort. Very poor education for staff and management, and will take advantage of you if possible."
bad,"Thank was hired in another state. At the time "
bad,"A typical day at work would involve me showing up in the kitchen at 7am, dealing with the chaos from whoever was last there. Which involved organizing, cleaning, and cooking whatever I deemed was necessary to open the hot bar at my standard. It was a challenge but I enjoyed, mostly. The management was pretty bad, rotating door pretty much. There were a few good apples though :)"
bad,Nobody was happy. Constant complaints. No room for creative intput. All directive was bottom line affiliated. The majority of employees I was associated with were not happy in their employment. Not happy in their day to day.
bad,"Well over seven years ago, I joined Whole Foods because i was told they truly supported team members. And for a while, this was true. but the company has gone WAY down hill over the years. Now that Amazon owns the company, things are getting worse. The company shows little compassion or care for team members now. They pay decently, and the benefits can be great. So if those are all that matter, WFM might be a good choice. If you desire any sort of job satisfaction or contentment, stay away from this toxic company."
bad,"i have been with whole foods for over 14 years at the same location and have been in two different departments i started off making 8.50hr full time and now I am   making 19.77hr ""after taxes 13ish ""full time....(less then a dollar a year) whole foods does not care if you are a smart passionate hard working person, you will not move up there corparte ladder. they only look for ""yes men"""
bad,"Company can be a bit to relaxed in terms of demands for efforts in roles."
bad,"The staff working with you, your peers, were awesome. Most of them were young around early 20's so there was some fun times and conversations. Management on the other hand was horrible. Leaders got picked basically by playing favorites and the ones qualified were usually never chosen to advance. You do learn ALOT about food, whether you want to or not in my department which was prepared food. Never a boring day as every day was fast paced which was fun because of the rush."
bad,"Decent people but no place for advancement. Not enough hours and the job has a lot of politics. If they don’t like you, you’re screwed. The benefits costed more as a part timer than as a full time employee."
bad,Things were great before new leadership came in. Now they just get rid of ppl for little things. Every dept struggles to find workers. They dont always give you the hours you want and they say one thing and another. Write ups are a hobby of theirs.
bad,"It partly depends on which department you work in and If you're a good butt kisser or not. Store managment sucks period. They love it when you can bs and kiss customer butt well. They don't care how hard of a worker or past work experiences.  They allow customers to get away with belittling the employees, if you catch them throwing trash on the floor it's ok. Bringing pets in, complain about something and get it for free and lots more. And amazon prime deals... employees are not eligible for."
bad,"management was terrible, not a good work life balance for overnight bakers. a lot of unorganization and not enough communication. The management does not talk to you or lead you in the way that you need to be led.. always will talk about you behind your back or in front of other people and a violation of the HIPA policy"
bad,Some of leadership are kind of.... stuck up especially if they don't see if you're licking their cheeks. Some co-workers got away with bad work ethics because they show up to work. So if you get a lazy coworker that is on time be prepared to be stressed out especially during closing shift- you will also get lumped into whatever they didn't complete.
bad,Whole Foods has changed owners and I don't know what it's like now. I don't care for either of the owners. WF is unnecessarily harsh to it's emplyees.
bad,They take it a bit too seriously and can be very strict. You can risk getting fired for very little things. I was not fired but witnessed it a lot. Great pay but customers can also be rough since the store spoils them to the point they will yell and swear for the smallest things we usually can't control.
bad,"Company has changed fundamentally over the years, especially now with the Amazon acquisition and barely resembles the high quality, service oriented store of the past. Team members are being cut left and right, full time is very hard to come by, as they no longer want to pay for full benefits and more and more responsibilities are being dumped on the Team Leads to make up for the lack of skilled employees. The company has refused to keep up with competitors as Kroger, Target, Market Street all now rival WFM in selection and quality. The service is what stood WFM apart from the rest and sadly it is not longer valued by the board of directors. How many jobs can be done by one person is the new motto and some departments are lucky to have more than one Team Member scheduled per shift anymore."
bad,Terrible Family life work balance. Unfair scheduling. Unreasonable time to emblement changes. No creativity aloud. No Career advancement or mentorship.
bad,Terrible management no structure whatsoever. There was no room for advancement even though management falsly advertised it. The people were a joy to work with.
bad,"Really enjoyed working there when I first got hired but things got worse the longer I was there. You'll work your bum off and barely be compensated for your effort.  Honestly, you can do better."
bad,No equipment for loss prevention.. Just floor observations  contanly on feet  no overtime for court appearances  no sick time no vacation time and always made mistake on paychecks
bad,"Core values were not followed.  Job security, not at all.  After Amazon, conditions went from bad to awful.  No support from any Team Leader or Store Leadership.  There 3 years and regreted it.  Watch your back at all times."
bad,"I worked in several depts @ WFM, the only great thing about this company were the benefits,"
bad,"job requirements changed daily. overworked, new tasks assigned by leaders who didn't know how to complete. asking for help fell on def ears and was never addressed."
bad,"after Amazon it went south everyone felt more pressure, than ever before to sell. less employee focused and less customer focused loss a lot of incentives"
bad,"Politics there are shady and personality-centered. You either fall in line with management or face isolation for speaking your mind. They play favorites and will work to push you out if they think you are not drinking their kool-aid. For a company that touts how great of an employer they are, their HDQ is seriously struggling to live up that culture. Management does not seek feedback and actually has a bit of a ""closed door policy""."
bad,Tried 4 times for a supervisor position and interviewed by a panel of 6 people but never advanced.  Hired at Fresh Thyme as a Supervisor and promoted to a key manager 4 days before opening of the store.  Very Clicky at Whole Foods
bad,"I loved working for them the first few years, once they started making budget cuts and letting people go it was the end of being a good job. They started cutting so many positions and roles and expected everyone to do double the work with no pay raise. They make you feel so unaccomplished every time you left work. On top of having terrible managers that were all a clique that only moved up the rump kissers. If you were a hard worker but weren't liked you can kiss moving up goodbye"
bad,"Company atmosphere is not what you would think. Employees can look how they want i.e.: tattoos, piercing, hair color/style. But is held against them if advancment is wanted. "
bad,"When I started there, I really really enjoyed working there. Everyone was friendly, some of them were welcoming. But after months I found myself really disgusted by all the gossips and talking behind your back going around. It made me really uncomfortable working with some co-workers because of that to the point that I had to quit. The management was good but seem sometimes disorganized. I met extraordinary good people that I will never forget and some that I really want to forget. It was a relief to quit that place and I will never come back. If you can stand constant gossip and talks behind your back then that's a place for you!!"
bad,"You get overloaded with work. Favoritism does exist, management is sneaky and those who do what they're Not supposed to do get away with it daily. Hard work gets no real recognition. You get more support from fellow team members than you get from actual management. They promote allowing there workers to be unique, but, will talk and look down at you for it."
bad,the company is taking a seriously negative shift after being bought out by amazon.. I once loved working for wholefoods but everything began to change.
bad,"Frequently single-covered, little help from managers, extremely anti-union, competitive work environment, not much focus of training, no attention to raises, but decent discount."
bad,"I had good co-workers at Whole Foods (though not everyone does).  Almost everything else was miserable. It was insanely paced, stressful, and exhausting."
bad,"I don't understand why full time employees starting pay is 12 dollars. It's impossible to afford living in the college park area only making a few dollars an hour, on top of that, full timers only get around 35 hours a week instead of 40. Working for wholefoods isn't a bad experience but it is stressful when you don't make enough, which forces you to work another job."
bad,"Not a Fan. Terrible Management. The Food is going down since Amazon took over. The food isn't even that spectacular. It's dirty. No Tips. Low Wages. Only incentive is the co-workers are mostly nice, sometimes and 20% discount. That's it."
bad,"management needs to be better, better hygiene among staff, the people there are petty , the pay is little to none for the work they want you to do.  this particular whole foods was very unsanitary"
bad,This company used to be a place where if you work hard you can be anything you want . Team member happiness is one of the core values and since selling to amazon systems have changed and along with that the moral of the team member. We are asked to do more with less with no room for error. I wish the best for a team members.
bad,No matter where you go customer service is always top priority. At whole foods that is the only thing that matters. Team member morale is at an all time low.
bad,"I was fired for attendance violations. Wholefoods does not excuse absences, even with a doctors note. My child started preschool this year so he was bringing back all kinds of viruses to our family. I don't trust this company at all, particularly when they are encouraging sick employees to handle food."
bad,"Whole Foods has there mission statements on the wall of every store, I feel they personally live by none of them. The company also puts far to much pressure on their management team to succeed."
bad,I would have stayed there forever but management felt regular store visits were not worth while. The pay was fair and benefits were good. Everyone in my department however was always walking on eggshells most of the time. I still know the Florida maintenance director and he seems happy in this region. I moved to Florida last week and I’m looking for employment. Whole Foods was my first hope but he said they don’t have openings for a field supervisor.
bad,I felt the company lacked in opportunities for advancement.  I also felt that upper management favored certain employees and promoted people who were under qualified for the specific positions.
bad,"I worked for wholefoods for nearly two years in that time I had to develop the understanding that hard work wasn't going to be the key to success but how many people you had to put behind or under you. "
bad,Depending on who you work with it can be a tough place to get used to. They don't bend on any rules and customers treat you poorly. This job is not for the faint of heart.
bad,"Working at Whole Foods Market was a less than pleasurable experience. There was a lot of drama between employees and the manager would take the side of the employee with the most seniority, which resulted in new employees getting into trouble for things they were not responsible for."
bad,"Is a very positive place to work in, learning as you go, and they give trainings to be ready to move up.  My experience there was very well at the beggining, but I tried so many time to move up and there was always a reason to rejected me, so many people that I trained got promoted over me, some Team Leaders and Store Leaders have favoritism to choose candidate for positions, they dont follow the company policy."
bad,Very busy environment. Diversified Culture of Employees. The hardest part of working at Whole Foods is the lack of structure from one Manager to the Next. Very impersonal. I enjoy the busy portion of the company and its values toward consumers. I like working in the diversified culture.
bad,"The company as a whole is great, they try to offer good pay and benefits, however nothing can out weigh the complete incompetence, arrogance, and just sheer stupidity of those who ran the store I worked at, and the entire south east regional management team. I watched them lie to customers and employees alike as well as use their ""power"" of holding a leadership role to play favorites, and steal merchandise."
bad,I worked here before Amazon took over so I'm not sure how they run things now. Before they shrank the teams down to one person a shift and ran the store on a skeleton crew.
bad,"Do not work in customer service. Team leader is god awful. Store team leader just as bad. Extremely inconsiderate uncompassionate, heartless, rude, selfish management."
bad,"Whole Foods as a company is a great place to work but the management is horrible. You only work 4 days a week but a typical shift would start at 3pm and you never have a clue when it will end. The “Supervisors” sit in the office all day and they pick and choose depending on how good you select if policy applies to you. Overall if you’re seeking a job as an order selector Publix or Walmart DC are much better in terms of compensation, work atmosphere, and work/life balance."
bad,"This company emphasized how they understood when things happened outside of your work life,  yet when it came to those instances, when understanding should have been applied, it wasn't even given a second thought about enforcing policy and firing someone."
bad,"Very stressful, when sales are down, the employees get blamed.  Not everybody is trained fairly and schedules aren't fair.  Great store but not so great supervision."
bad,This is supposed to be an upscale grocery store but working here is just like ANY grocery store.  I had issues with MGMT and my supervisor's uncleanliness while I was there.
bad,"From a consumer perspective, I love the promise of no antibiotics, hormones, synthetics, food colorings (other than natural), additives, fillers, artificial sweeteners, preservatives, nitrates or nitrites (other than naturally occurring in salt)... no added hormones, rBST, rBA(s), a combination of great, sustainably-resourced natural and organic products to choose from. Health is wealth. And with the Amazon buyout there has been a noticeable reduction in pricing across the departments which is very pleasant to the bank account. On the employee side I liked the efforts made to make each department unique in its own respect... after all people are paying top dollar for WFM products, and its important to know both as an employee and as a consumer, what sets WFM aside from other markets.. an WFM truly partners with and puts some of the best business/agricultural practices in place to bring the best quality products. Love what Whole Foods is about, but its fallen victim to the byproduct of capitalism like every other company- Do more with less (hours/people/payroll), and expect the same results. How do you do more with less? That burden falls on the ""lower echelon"" employees. I'm sorry but that's a different question for each person, but without an equivalent and reciprocal benefit adjustment, how much is each willing to care to be encumbered for someone else's prosperity/dream."
bad,"Can't believe a big company like this has the worst IT systems ever from receiving to accounting. None are compatible.  Too many problems with the programs. Everyone has to make a spreadsheet for their own products. None are linked and if you get it wrong, typo or bad formula your in trouble. Make one typo and your screwed. Stay away unless you like spending 100% of your time answering emails and wondering why spreadsheets crash. Job could be done in 5 hours but you spend another 8 checking emails and making sure the spreadsheets you get are correct. If you could just do your job it would be ok but you end up doing accounting, catalog maintenance and receiving along with many other jobs. If you like mass chaos then this is your fit. Other buyers spend 5/6 hours a day doing receiving and accounting work. 3 buyers to run 53 stores and and they wonder why the turnover here is HUGE. One leaving and other gave notice too. Our manager was no help and very rude."
bad,"This company is great to work for, as long as you don't have any of your own ideas or like to speak your mind! I do want to point out that I worked in prepared foods and that department is MUCH different than the rest of the store. They pay great and promise you the stars, as long as you stand at attention and do EXACTLY as they say. I dont have anything good to say about WHOLE PAYCHECK, except good-riddance. They killed my desire to be a chef or EVER be employed in the food industry again. If you are a creative person, or aren't easily brainwashed and don't like propaganda being shoved down your throat on a daily basis, I urge you to find another place to work."
bad,"Love the work I am doing and the laid back atmosphere and store culture.  Hate the internal drama and gossip between team members and management.  Training is terrible depending on department.  Pay is on par with entry level retail and benefits are deducted from pay cheques (only available to FT). Team leadership in my department is ineffectual. They are always available to take praise, but will deflect any issues to people beneath them. Lack of team leadership accountability forces workers to try to complete tasks with limited resources allowing us to meet only minimum standards, or occasionally completely hindering ability to complete jobs.  Limited, almost non-existent upward mobility depending again on department.  No acknowledgement or incentive for lower level employees.  High employee turnover and no recourse for dealing with employee complaints.  "
bad,"Needs more room for growth, the supervisors aren't adequate and are in semi-retirement yet won't leave.  Stuck as cashier... Enjoy the company but wish I could do more and get PAID MORE!!"
bad,"I don't want to go into detail right now, but the management at Whole Foods Market in Phoenix was absoultely horrible.  I've never been in a more uncomfortable working environment in my life."
bad,Management needs an overhaul.  Initiatives are not thought out well.  Planning is an after thought.  Benefits and pay are on the lower end. No incentive to stay long term.  Some people move up in ranks.  Most move along when something better pops up.
bad,"its a job for someone in school, pretty good food, staff is okay. mangement stinks. part time is cheap with the hours. full time still isnt enough mon"
bad,"Every religion is respected "
bad,"I worked in the prepared foods department. A handful of managers were helpful and compassionate, but the majority were not. I was physically harassed and at least one other woman came to me with the same experience. They were misleading in terms of how easy it is to move up or cross train with other departments; someone has to die or get fired basically. Management would rarely come to the defense of team members in the ""customer is always right"" mentality. There's a cult mentality there. Also, the cleanliness of the kitchen was shoddy and the food preparation methods were not completely transparent. i.e. all soups coming from plastic bags that were reheated/chicken that was 2-3 days old being repurposed and sold as ""fresh"". There is also an incredible amount of drug abuse in this company. There was also a lot of food waste."
bad,"As an employee, working at Whole Foods is like an education in animal rights, organic cultivation, and food sourcing. After all of that, it is still a grocery store with grocery store issues."
bad,"The overall atmosphere of the store was nice, fun, and exciting. Learning about different fruits and veggies was awesome. Customers were nice and you always got a nice new face to tell you about their food experiences and journeys. Management was more strict and hard to work with, but you get through it."
bad,"co-workers were great; no room for advancement in-store, no job security- you are replaceable; no organization at this particular store; stressful job"
bad,The team members that make a difference  go unnoticed. A disappointment to say the least. There is favoritism. The best part is the team no matter what happens they stick together.
bad,bad horrible no good back stabbing low job security over worked lied to on a daily . bad food harassed by team leaders over hyped work place. just a nono
bad,"The office is nice, it's all open with large windows all around giving it an open feeling. The company provides Team Members with coffee, bread, peanut butter, smoothie ingredients, and we even have an espresso machine."
bad,"low pay"
bad,Its great opportunity for someone to gain knowledge of on working in a natural food environment and gain a positive experience and I think any opportunity is a great opportunity
bad,"I really enjoyed working at wholefoods, mostly because it was a very balanced work environment. I would have to stock different items on shelves. I would recommend that anyone should work there if they're looking for a job."
bad,"I going to try to be fair and say while I did not necessarily enjoyed my time there, I don't if all stores are like this, but here I go."
bad,"People work very hard, but the pay is too low.  There are warnings for everything.  Not a friendly environment.  Not a good job security."
bad,No work/life balance. Compensation is low and they don't promote advancement for some positions. Departments such as coffee do not get any recognition. The list goes on.
bad,Coworkers are grwat. Management is an issue. Complain about having to cut hours but take about 10-20 hours of overtime for themselves a week.
bad,"A typical day at Whole Foods Market was greeting customers, bagging groceries and handling money. The hard part of the job was dealing with poor management."
bad,"Don't ever work or eat in the prep foods dept. the store seems nice enough ( fake but nice ) but working in the kitchen is aweful, everything comes out of bags and boxes, management is aweful and you get paid the same as the people standing at the register"
bad,"Main issues:"
bad,It may work for some. In many cases it is a good job and company but in a highly competitive market many procedures and goals are not met.
bad,Not the most secure corporation right now. A lot of change and a lot of layoffs are causing unnecessary unrest among a very loyal and proven work force. The tenants that the company was founded under seem out of alignment now and for the foreseeable future.
bad,"Nice and clean give a lot of hours. NOt a happy place to work , wish i went somewhere else to work. they have great commuity service opertion on the program"
bad,"It seemed like a good place to work, but management is fairly ruthless in enforcing trivial rules and policies, without any recourse for challenging disciplinary actions. "
bad,"A typical day at work is very hard because they are very often have a short staff but I had been learnt too much."
bad,"Love the TM's and customers, but company is growing to fast and forgetting about TM happiness. If they stand for ""fair trade"" then employees should be able to at least pay rent for studio in the 30 miles diameter, not mentioning any larger living accommodations, with full time salary."
bad,"I had the opportunity to work with this company for 10+ years. When one naively walks into a Wholefoods, you are immediately captivated by the smells, décor, an wide range off  faces among the team members. However, once hired the smoke and mirrors begin to dissipate and the sting of the dark depth of the politics begins to be felt. They definitely allowed me to sustain a livelihood as a single parent to my two kids, and even some type of room for advancement (after several years, being looked over, promised potions that later given to someone else, etc). However, achieving much of anything is more than likely going to be at the expense of your self respect, your dignity and or your reputation. Please know that as a WFM veteran I'd always imagined myself respectfully leaving WFM with the stand up reputation I literally earned through sweat and tears, I was  terminated after I HONESTLY  ACKNOWLEDGED to my Team Leader that I'd incorrectly filled out a mispunch. He knew that the SAME day in question, that on my way to work,  I'd just found out that my offender was being released early!!! I came in that day and forgot to punch in...yep, I was late that day. Even though the error was caught, and  I was HONEST about the error, I even ASKED was there anything or documentation I needed to fill out to correct it myself, AFTER A DECADE as a reputable TM to coworkers and customers, and being told by my superior in an office full of team members, ""Don't worry, I'll take care of it"", I was still escorted out of the door like a petty criminal and told that I could ""never work for Wholefoods"
bad,Fun work environment with supportive management. Some managers is reasonable to work with. But overall the experience was excellent at its best.
bad,"Whole Foods Market was an ok company to work for.  The store I was working at would get very busy during rush hours, the management department did not handle this issue promptly and efficiently so it made the job a bit more strenuous to work at for myself and my co-workers."
bad,"Very hostile  work environment, everyone wonders who is getting fired next. The store performs well so it covers up the leadership. Over all whole foods is a great company been employed there 4 years as a team leader. Be carefull  working at the Carlisle store especially  if your male. All of us in leadership are looking to transfer out. The other store is awsome highly recommended."
bad,"Management not so great. Like that old saying too many chiefs and not enough Indians. They were always quick to notice if you did something wrong, but if you went the extra mile for something else you were not recongnise for your hard work. Most of the people that you work with were fun, sometimes hard dealing with angry customers."
bad,"-Take Trash out, Vacuum & Change carpets"
bad,"The workers are nice, poor management. The pay is less, the schedule could be messy at times. Co workers are hard workers."
bad,boss lied to me and i reacted by telling him that he was a lair. i got fired
bad,you must be a lifer to move up in this company. the pillars of which this corporation was founded on have been thrown out the window.
bad,"This a warehose environment ,A typical day is consist of preparing orders for all 53 stores and making sure all the stores get anough products to move though."
bad,Fast paced enviroment. Friendly co-workers
bad,"Management Sucks. Great Co-workers, great customers but bad management. They claim they don't have a seniority system but they have something worst favoritism system."
bad,i had a problem with the department manager with her terrible attitude and the showing of contempt towards her black employees and the older people that were under employ.the manager was constantly having complaints against her and nothing has ever been done about her.she most assuredly set me up when she had me work 11 day straight and did not come in on the 11th day due to exhaustion.
bad,at the begging everything looks good until I figured it out that they get a new manager every few month's sometimes weeks new rules for a few days. its chaos. even making $15 an hour os not worth the mess.
bad,"Each store is different but I can tell you that WFM definitely isn’t what it used to be. Management (mostly supervisors), often take advantage of their position. It’s more of a “do as I say but not as I do” type situation. They always go on their phones, but will discreetly write you up if you go on yours. They want people to “grow” within the company so if you have other ambitions, this isn’t the job for you. Unless you’re in leadership or a student, your schedule will be a mess"
bad,Typical day as a grocery team member wasn't fulfilling and physically tiring. Management portrayed position to be team driven and exciting but it wasn't.
bad,"There are a lot of nice people that work here and very good people. It's very sad to see a very corrupt environment and political management. There is favoritism everywhere, if someone does not like they will make you work twice as hard as someone else. When you tell someone about it, they say ""we'll follow up"" and they'll give them a slap on the wrist and they go on to continue to do it again. It seriously feels like high school. Literally you have to keep up your guard because you never know who will stab you in the back. If you tell anyone anything make sure you take control of it. I told people even HR about my situations and they never told me anything. I left because of an incident early in the year work related and thought my work would take care of it. Six months later I get a 30 day collection notice because no one ever told me anything about it.  And when I followed up with them they would take their sweet time to tell me anything about"
bad,The benefits are slowly diminishing. There is a lot of nepotism. Hours get cut regularly. It's impossible to get full time. It's hard to get decent shifts
bad,"Good Luck, it is a very interesting place to work, the people are wonderful and the management leaves something to be desired. Upper management on their corporate level is cutthroat."
bad,"If you're looking for a job full of repetitive & menial tasks where you feel totally unfulfilled & underpaid everyday, work at Whole Foods! The recent Amazon takeover has made it much worse."
bad,"Very nice place to work, loved working there. The location was great as well. I enjoyed the variety of the work band my work colleagues were lovely. "
bad,"Don’t let them fool you, this place is no different than the conventional grocery corporations. Not a good place to work or shop since Amazon took over."
bad,Promised after 90 day Probationary period we would get more hours and more training never happened. Was told at interview I would be in bakery then was told on first day and everyday after to go to food prep in the kitchen and pizza station instead and had to beg for months to go to bakery. When I was being trained it wasn’t clear who was supposed to be training me then whenever someone tried to they would talk for two minutes then disappear.
bad,"Whole Foods used to be the exception in retail grocery store land where the company actually cared about it's employees and customers equally. It was a fun and positive but sill fast paced environment. Now absolutely everything is about Amazon and making more money for Amazon. You want to work at Whole Foods? Be prepared to be not only your job title but also an Amazon sales rep, Amazon customer support, Amazon tech support. Amazon has completely obliterated labor budgets so good luck getting any hours either. Overall, Whole Foods made a huge mistake ever signing with the corporate greed of Amazon. Amazon core values are the literal opposite of Whole Foods. I don't understand how this merger ever happened but it's disgraceful."
bad,"In less than three years of working there, I saw the job go from one as having stress but the company provided a generally positive environment to deal with it, to being a company almost fully driven by margin at the expense of the team members' personal well-being. If opinions and ideas are out of line from direction being given at the top (often by people who look at graphs, computer screens and spreadsheets all day; out of touch with the day-to-day situation on the floor) then what you say is of little value. Conformity and being a yes man are qualities most valued there."
bad,"Your enjoyment of your day will be greatly dependent on who is on your team and who you're working with that shift. Your coworkers can make or break your day. Also, since Amazon took over micromanagement is insane. Management is told by regional to micromanage you like crazy."
bad,I worked in the prepared foods department. Customers were understandably rude because there were massive amounts of call-outs and not enough people to cover stations. I would constantly stay late and work 9-10 hour shifts while still being considered part time. Management wouldn’t provide us with working tools and injury is bound to happen. Oh and kitchen staff is using the same slicer for pork and chicken. This place should be reported.
bad,Whole Foods was once a fun place to work but as it got bought out by amazon some big changes happened that absolutely changed the work culture there. Unfortunately the upbeat vibe shifted completely and it just became a very regular place of work
bad,"Highly administrative work. Lack of training. Poor morale, rude and unprofessional team leads and store management team. "
bad,"They expect a lot for a grocery/stocking job. Its good pay, but its stressful and tedious. Management is okay but they just follow protocol. Nothing special about them."
bad,"Whole foods loves to tout their $15 minimum wage, but what they dont tell people is that you wont get more than 30 hours a week unless you're a manager.  Management in my department was terrible, poor communication and poor culture development and zero accountability."
bad,"Whole Foods claims to make an emphasis on the workplace being a team but that is pretty much talk. It is a business first and foremost. It is not some superior grocery store with above and beyond service it is a chain that uses this veil to appear more friendly to its customers. There is no real workplace culture it is just some stuff higher ups came up with to give team leaders a sense of importance and leadership and waste time. ""Mandatory"" team meetings are unnecessary and can be done in minutes through email instead of keeping workers there for a full 8 hour shift and then an additional hour to go over new protocol. Also for a company to market themselves as eco-friendly they sure waste a lot of food and make their workers pay for it still even though a good chunk of it is going to waste disposal. Also will schedule you against your own given availability and say they do not have enough staff when they could just hire more staff considering how successful the chain is and that it is owned by Amazon."
bad,"They Have Favoritism In there , they talk behind ya back a lot & they make the job as if they are competing Against you . & when they feel like they won the competition They go & tell the manager your slow & cant work"
bad,"Only work here if you do not want to exceed or grow your career, they have laid off most of their valuable team members. When I started it was a fun company but it lost that charm."
bad,"Whole Foods being a specialty grocer was a great place to work as a Cashier and engage with customers. But work quality of life has seriously gone down the toilet - literally. Now Cashiers are no longer considered Customer Service and instead lumped with Maintenance workers into a new department called Store Support, and guess what this means? Yes Cashiers are now expected to clean toilets, empty garbage bins and wash floors, and handle food in the same shift. So do not expect if you are hired as a Cashier to be treated as a Customer Service professional that the company sees as the front line person that customers engage with, you are now Store Support and not Customer Service and your job now includes Custodial work even if you did not agree to this change in your job description. Also, Health and Safety is a joke and half the staff have repetitive stress injuries due to complete ignorance of workstation and ergonomics standards in the industry. Furthermore, they ignore employee well being in scheduling by always over or under scheduling you and most of the time also being short staffed. And they often have you close at 10:30pm and open the next morning at 8am. The only redeeming quality of WFM is the coworkers. But do not expect to see them around very lomg as there is a high turnover and retention is not valued at all whatsoever."
bad,lack of training and poor management . if you like to fend for yourself on a daily basis and get no positive feedback from your supervisor treated poorly then this is the job for you
bad,The company has changed management which has affected room for growth.It was a great place to learn leadership and management skills. The company offers great benefits.
bad,"good culture but poor leadership, no understanding for work life balance. Team leadership does not care about team member growth or their work life balance."
bad,"Working was okay, especially with the recent pay raise from Amazon. Being a cashier was stressful at times because of the customers and supervisors. Whole Foods treat employees like robots and not human beings that make mistakes."
bad,"This place appreciates its employees more than any corporate office I have ever been.  Though this is not reflected in pay, it is expressed through team work and recognition."
bad,"The Prepared Foods Department is full of drama, and the rest are pretty chill, but if you want to work anywhere, I would for for meat department or Seafood department, They are the only reason why I stayed longer. Management is Ok, but they kind of pick and choose favorites. Other then that, I wouldn't work here again, but it's an interesting experience."
bad,"Management is in cliques. You can work there 2-3 years and do a great job and maybe get a 1$ and some change as a raise. They don’t raise their bottom line for veteran employees. When they started people at 12$/hr if they started you at 10 or 11 the 30 cent raises you worked for mean nothing. It’s good experience if you’re young and need a decent job with overpriced benefits that don’t really cover you, but if you’re an adult with real bills you can expect to get a second job or find a better one."
bad,"It was a fun place to work.  I cook a lot of a different kind of food for people to love. I learned a lot about time management, multitasking, and  confidence"
bad,"a typical day at work included tending to customers, packaging and putting out product, cake decorating, and cleaning for close. I learned that not everyone wants you to succeed.  management was the worst part, they played favorites and didn't do much. The hardest part was dealing with rude guests. the most enjoyable part was the team members I really felt like a family."
bad,"My store was very poorly managed at both the store level, and within the Customer Service team I worked in. They routinely replaced outgoing team leaders with outside hires instead of promoting from within the team."
bad,"High stress working environment.   Starting TMs have low wages, terrible hours, and expensive healthcare.  If you can push past that to get into a full time position, the stress increases and your healthcare costs become reasonable.  It's barely worth it."
bad,"Favortism, lack of communication and too much gossip. "
bad,"whole foods is a fine company to work for.  I don't think it's any better or worse than its competitors.  The hours can be demanding, but that's just how retail is."
bad,"The management is fear based, lots of pressure and stress to get things done, high turnover and most departments are very shorthanded all the time. Labor is always tight, people are spread thin. There is very little encouragement and support, you're just expected to do your job and it's never good enough. Everything is petty and you can be an amazing employee and have to have very petty sit down conversations about very minor things."
bad,"Whole Foods Market is not as committed to diversity as it would appear. I thought working there would be about creating a sustainable future not just for myself but for the globe. In reality, WFM is a publicly traded company with executive leadership that does not reflect the cultural diversity so lauded by their stores."
bad,"I Worked at the new dadeland store in Miami Florida , If you aren't on the same boat as management, they will try anything to get rid of you. Got bullied by management first 6 months and when I went to speak about it, nothing happens. then  in the next 6 months I was threatened and humiliated by a coworker  and then spoke to  store management about it and they continued to separating me from the company the victim."
bad,The management team is interested in themselves and not their employees. My department manager was married to the accounting manager and things were going on that were not right.
bad,"WFM paid better than the competition when I worked there, but it was still retail- i.e. no secure schedule to plan your life around as it changed weekly to daily, soft benefits eroded over time, and no union protection from new corporate policies that reduced pay increases for employees. The trajectory was downhill when I left. Even the healthcare was questionable at best."
bad,"WFM prides itself on paying extremely low wages but allowing you to wear (almost) anything you want to work, having tattoos and piercings, or coloring your hair. unfortunately, if you do any of those things your chances of advancing are stifled due to your ""lack of professionalism."""
bad,Was good. Not anymore. No room for advancement. Promotions bases on favoritism. Most employees did the bare minimum. Structure and environment changed.
bad,I worked with the company for over 10 years and I am glad they were bought out by Amazon so many jobs will be evaluated. Good luck if you want to work for this company and I am sure Amazon will be changing many things about the culture
bad,Loved the company in the beginning but slowly over time saw the 'real' whole foods. My team leader was the worst. Bullied team members. Isolated team members when she was unhappy with them and threatened the jobs of other team members if they talked to them. She would go to extreme lengths to find reasons to fire people. And she has store leadership wrapped around her finger. Absolutely do not recommend working for her.
bad,"while it used to be a decent place to work, the buyout from Amazon has made this place pretty unbearable. OTS is the real killer here. Without going into too much detail, it is a new ordering system that is needlessly redundant busy work that follows a completely arbitrary system. It is meant to make the buyer's jobs more streamlined, but ultimately it is just a huge inconvenience for everyone. Amazon has started ""trimming the fat"" already and has let go of many positions that the company was formally proud to employee people for. It is not a bad option for a student who is looking for decent pay and a couple of days on the weekend or something like that, but for anyone looking for serious career advancement, this place is an absolute joke."
bad,"I really do enjoy working at Whole Foods.  I've learned so many new things about food and self care.  The people I've made friends with over the time I've worked there have been life changing.  But for the level of personal satisfaction this job provides is very low.  I do the same thing every day, all day.  I'm looking for something more mentally challenging and creative."
bad,"While the pay and benefits are better than what's currently offered in the service industry, it comes with a price. Managers expect more then what is possible, and offer little in return. If you try going above and beyond, instead of being meet with gratitude you will be asked what more can  you do? Promotions are not based on merit, but social ties. Safety hazards abound. My store also has an extremely high turnover rate. Come for the experience, but transfer elsewhere."
bad,"Whole Foods was great when I began working for them. The schedule worked well for my family and I learned many new skills. Unfortunately about 6 months later they began to cut a lot of labor, no doubt to save money. The result was doing the job of 2 and not getting compensated for it. I was one of many in my department to leave or quit because of the constant overworked feeling."
bad,"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum"
bad,"When I worked for Whole Foods, we were constantly understaffed and delivered products that were not up to the quality levels Whole Foods was supposed to be known for. Lackadaisical management meant that some teams had to be held together by the team members themselves while management took credit."
bad,"Whole Foods is a great company to work for if you need flexible hours and are interested in health food. The benefits are excellent and there is a lot of outreach within the company towards programs and trips that can strengthen knowledge. There is not much growth within the company unless you are interested in management and even then it is very difficult. The workplace culture leans on the negative side and there tends to be a sense of contempt especially in regards to work ethics and procedures. One of the most troublesome things I witnessed, possibly specific to the location, was the incentivizing of bad customer behavior."
bad,Horrible relationship with management. Ended up fired but receiving a settlement for unjust termination. Team members were great and fun to work with.
bad,"No work life balance,  management had a huge workload, They seemed to be more concerned about profits. They also micro managed everything but claimed you ran your own dept"
bad,"Well established company based on strong ethical values and practices.  Poor management, training, and consistency for personal and professional growth."
bad,"Typical retail. Low pay, never enough hours, all about keeping labor costs to a minimum. Unless you are a dept mgr, you won't make a living wage. Ok for P/T, but not much else"
bad,"Although I know whole foods as a company has a great outlook on what they want to achieve, I feel like my store was managed by people who had other objectives that were only beneficial to themselves."
bad,I was fired without due process or inclusion in the circumstances around my termination. I was pushed out by insecure and delusional management. I would not recommend working here with the current management.
bad,"They( leadership) need to do better. Instead of playing favoritism, they need to worry about sales and hiring better employees who want to work. When I first started working here, I saw a lot of potiential but that ship have sailed."
bad,Very fast paced day went by quick every day. Management changed frequently . Which meant some rules would change . Had classes on computers you could take to further your employment..
bad,Depends on what store you work at.Every store is different .Not all are the same and follow different rules. Pay was ok however your afraid for you job everyday .Its not worth the a heart attack for the pay
bad,"Was a great job for the first few years. Flexible hours, decent pay, generous raises were all great. However, over the last 2 years the moral in most stores has dropped. With Recent changes in the company, regional leadership has made a lot of changes and set unrealistic goals for departments."
bad,"You go in thinking Whole Foods is great but you quickly have to come to terms with it's still retail work.You're not going to be able to climb much, management struggles, and you end up doing way more than is entailed in training."
bad,"The culture at Whole Foods in 2015-2016 was that of a company that cared about its Team Members, engaged in leadership training, and genuinely demonstrated compassion, engagement, and quality standards in both products and the local communities. I still believe the commitment to quality standards is part of this company's culture. However, in the last year, the corporate culture has shifted to a bottom-line, metrics-driven environment in which the value of Team Members is mostly paid lip service, but is wholly without evidence in the leadership. It has been said that people don't leave bad companies, they leave bad bosses. The mid-level management at Whole Foods is a perfect example of this statement."
bad,"found great friends along the way. work flow is pretty easy, as long as you get the work done, your enjoying your day. Every department is different in their own way and thats whats i love about working there."
bad,"Great place to make a few bucks. Benefits are awesome. Management really sucks. It's just about in every store. They cut labor, your do the work of three. No communication...one hand does not know what the other is doing. They don't care about your culinary knowledge, just show up and do as we say, or you will be written up. Management will throw you under the buss in a hot second."
bad,"This job is entirely thankless and mundane.  They are non-union which they think is good, but it really means they stick you on a register, let you stand there all day, for minimum wage, and you get no added perks unlike the specialty departments."
bad,"I have worked for Whole Foods just for a few months. It seems that the culture chews up team members and disposes them if they get too noisy. Its a job with a lot of promise, turnovers and transfers are common, therefore many leadership (management) jobs open frequently. Its a race to see who can exploit themselves the most and weather the chaos of the dysfunctional style of leadership. "
bad,Not a good company to work for unless and very unprofessional leaders  (some that have criminal backgrounds). Don't try and retain employees and everyone is replaceable.
bad,Wouldnt dare to work back here. I wouldnt even recommend it to anyone either. The managers suck. they only pay attention to things they feel is important. they dont put employees first as they say in their gig book.
bad,"WFM is an average place to work. I was a part of the delivery team, which I enjoyed. Expectations of delivery were unrealistic most times, and management wasn't very supportive."
bad,"There are over 400 Whole Foods Market stores, but my experience is for one store in particular.  Scheduling is extremely inconsistent.  Team members do not know from week to week which days s/he will be off and which hours are to be worked on a given day.  The schedule is not posted until Thursday for the following week.  Team members cannot make any plans for their own needs."
bad,"Store opened over 2 years. Started with 160 employees and now about 12 of the original ones are left. Company has changed in the last 2 years. They just want you to work, not question anything and go home.Not the Whole Foods corporation from years ago. There is a large turn over rate. When the store suffers so do your hours and paycheck."
bad,"When I first started at Whole Foods I really loved it, the atmosphere, unity, and sense of family. After a week on the job I was advanced to a management position, and expected to do the job with no training. Male employees had no problem with making suggestive remarks, and advances to me. Management did nothing about it when I brought attention to it. Overall I wouldn't suggest anyone to apply here."
bad,Whole foods is an upbeat environment with people from all different cultures. After you've vest yourself into the company you can achieve a level of comfort which in time turns to draining pressure and feelings of no life.
bad,"My original outlook on Whole Foods Market was great and I was really looking forward to working there, but the recently opened store has seemed to take a different turn. The management has been disappointing at best with the direction of the store and the treatment of the employees. With the high turnover of not only new employees but also loyal members and leadership it's become not only a negative but an unhealthy environment."
bad,Not happy with the team leader in this green valley location. Worked really hard for this company. This location was not as peace and loving as it would appear to be.
bad,"The company claims to be value-driven.  On their website they say that they follow eight core values. "
bad,"This company drifting from what used to be a terrific company to work for into WALMART Natural food style. Getting away from core values and investing in the loyal people that have worked there for so long. I am all for change but letting go of what you stand for and becoming just like the rest of BIG FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES,  GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY. "
bad,A typical work day at whole food market is okay you have your days with the Customers you get some nice and sweet ones then you have the rude one. What I leaned in this company is how to handing with different situation. The management is pretty good. my co-worker are okay they could be a handful but for the most part they okay. The hardest part of the job is when you have a customers that don't want to  cooperate and understand the store policy. The most enjoyable part is getting to meet different people and learning different type of way to make different meals.
bad,Sorry customer service and prepared foods has got to be the only bad thing working at wholefoods. The other departments are phenominal compared to just those two departments and its sad. Their policies are strict and mangers are loose.
bad,"I worked in the Cary, NC store and found the management really sucked unless you were already a Team Member. I had a problem reading the numbers on the store items because they were so small, so I was expected to memorize them.  If the manager on duty didn't like you, you don't stand a chance. Yeah, I really wanted to be a permanent employee, but the treatment I received wasn't worth it. Stay away from this location. I'm not the only one that has commented about this."
bad,"Well I just got hired at the new Whole Foods in Addison and all I can say is if you want a ""decent position"" I would advice you to take Cashier since in Prepared Foods they use the new hires as slaves while the cooks just waste their time not doing much (not all cooks just some) also there is a lot of people that don't follow the main rules but yet they make the biggest deal out of the little things. And last but not least this company dumps on average 100 - 200 pounds of food on average each day and that's just from the prepared foods department, it's so sad watching all that good food go to waste."
bad,great company but some of the staff such as managers dont really care much about people health and well being
bad,"They try and portray it as some wonderful happy land -- but it's bullpuckey. There is no core, nothing to hold on to beyond the supposed core values -- but that's just talk. Don't work there."
bad,"Typical day : loading carts with product, restocking shelfs"
bad,"For people who just started at WFM, they most likely will love it ( give it time). For people who started years ago, you know what I am about to say is true. Jobs that use to pay 12 or 13 an hour are now 10. Your experience means nothing, you could have been a team member 4 months ago making 14 an hour. If you come back, you make 10. Before if you came back within 6 months you made what you left with. No chance for advancement, don't believe what they tell you. A lot of times jobs posted (buyer or leadership) have already been filled. They post and interview for the position to make it look fair. Management can prevent you from advancements and you can not do anything about it. They can just lie on you and store leadership does nothing. The gainsharing program is good but can work against you. If you are getting a bonuse so is management. They will cut hours, try and push out higher waged team members to put more in their pocket. People use to be able to make WF's a career, now I would not recommend it. I use to love this place but now I wouldn't even shop there. Oh yeah, and you may think they are green. But you would be wrong. Not a 100% wrong but wrong none the less."
bad,Great supermarket that sells healthy food but supporting a family or yourself with their wage is terrible.
bad,"(a typical day at work)very busy and steady everyday,(what i've learned)how to operate a dishwashing machine, (management) WAS NOT open about the team members performance, (my co-workers) are very friendly & very welcoming (the hardest part of the job) is the end of the night, (the most enjoyable part of the job) is being able to work and not stop till my shift is done"
bad,"run department like you owen it, BUT, KEY WORD."
bad,"Retail/customer service jobs have their obvious cons but WF was unique in its culture and commitment to team member happiness. After 2 years of amazon buying us, Whole Foods is deteriorating. Turnover rate has increased and employees who quit are not replaced. The labor budget is constantly being slashed. management still try’s to enforce high expectations while we drown in unworked shipment from skeleton overnight crews"
bad,I really used to love working for WFM!! but as time went on the pay got higher but employees started to get treated much worse. management also isn’t good or at least not at the location I worked at. they aren’t nice either. when I had first met the store leader she actually insulted me. I learned it takes just being liked to advance within the company it doesn’t matter how much effort you put into anything. and the point system is unfair. this also isnt the type of job you can go into and just mind your business and make money. you’ll get judged if you don’t talk to everyone.
bad,It’s a fine job. You get paid pretty well. It’s about what you’d expect from any retail job. People come and people go unfortunately. It was overall an alright experience.
bad,It’s a great entry level job. But not a long-term stable job to turn into a career. Management top to bottom are very negligent of situations. Management also passes the line of professionalism and exceeds boundaries.
bad,"Initially the environment was pleasant and the pay is very good compared to other places of work, but after about 6 months the work environment became very stressful and management seemed to stop caring about the well-being of the employees and only cared about the production quota."
bad,"Some days were worse than others. Management was difficult to deal with, trying to switch departments and even stores was impossible. Very favorized in any department, making it a terrible work experience."
bad,Team members great. Poor training. Manager was abusive and unprofessional. Made hostile work environment. Would go off on you in front of store and customers.
bad,"Good place to work,but the management,needs work. They do without thinking or seeing the full picture . The store is later back. Customers are good too."
bad,"The pay is better, but still too little for today's economy. The culture is fine, but management is lacking. Managers are big on excuses, and corporate only desires for workers to meet Amazon's robotic standards now. Big changes come to stores and shift the dynamic that made the company work in the first place. Long term customers often leave due to the changes."
bad,"No longer the Whole Foods everyone liked since Amazon buyout. "
bad,"I like to give 100% at all times when I’m at work. My coworkers all liked to give about 2%. The place is disorganized and the hours are terrible. I would be scheduled on days when I needed off (like for school, not vacation) and the place was always a mess (which I had to clean up). Sometimes I wouldn’t get out until 11:30pm. Plus the customers were extremely rude, to the point where if I didnt remove myself, i probably would’ve gotten fired for saying something. My manager could never be found to express my complaints. didn’t"
bad,"management structure is always changing. One Team Leader will oversee 2-3 seperate teams, and corporate will change the designation of these teams almost every year. The pay for full-timers, supervisors, and ATLs is pretty bad. Part-timers are paid well but the full timers who have experience, and where more is expected of them get paid the same or slightly more than a new employee."
bad,"The management there had a definite us vs. them attitude - at least in the kitchen. Store management was a joke - condescending. If they noticed you were a good worker who goes the extra mile, you would suddenly get a LOT more work without any more pay (and even worse hours). The old culture that you may have heard about at WFM (relaxed, laughter, bunch of hippies) is long gone. Amazon has taken over and jobs are being eliminated due to technology changes. Food that used to be prepared from scratch in the kitchen is now mainly shipped in, precooked & the ""cooks"" now steam the bag, open it, and serve..."
bad,"Pushed myself to do active demos and step outside my comfort zone by expanding my job duties over the course of 3 years."
bad,The department management was not good and when employees raised their concerns higher management did not care. The kitchen was not kept very clean and it was just not a good experience.
bad,"worked at the crosshill whole foods in columbia sc most of my "
bad,"There was no room to grow. Hours are all over the place. Expects your life to revolve around Whole Foods. Had great benefits and nice pay, but management sucked."
bad,"After the Amazon partnership the company has forgotten its original path and purpose. Team members are divided into ""before & after"" the acquisition. The culture behind closed doors is one that now values profit over people. Our team consistently worked 50-70 hour work weeks and was then reprimanded for generating so much overtime pay. While there are absolutely those still in place that are committed to team member happiness and excellence there are also those in place that are focused on productivity at ANY COST!"
bad,While working as a personal shopper I was asked to take the customers order and fulfill it with requested merchandise. I would pick pack and prepare the customers orders so that they could receive their goods in top quality. The pace of the work was very fast and detailed oriented. Accuracy and timeliness was paramount. We were required to substitute items that may be out of stock with similar products.
bad,"Extremely rude customers,  only advance caucasian workers,  scheduling is up and down,  no advancement opportunities, attendance policy awful, no job security!!"
bad,Working for them was inconsistent at best . Everyday seemed that the store constantly changed. The store seemed to be disorganized with the management staff that was there.
bad,"I didn't work there long, but it just wasn't for me.  I came from the restaurant industry so working in prepared foods was an adjustment.  It was a little too corporate and cult like for me.  Benefits were decent."
bad,They managment is not in control they hire any and everyone to work at wholefoods...pretty much the front end mangers do what ever and dont get in troblem but i love working thier it's just need few training
bad,"Very fast paced, which was great! Gained experience in ordering taking inventory and running a dept. Enjoyed the culture to an extent and also the products we dealt with and  the vendors"
bad,Basically Some days it could be like packed and everything’s fast paced. It takes a week or so to get used too from there it’ll be a easy job. The environment is friendly and safe
bad,My manager at Whole Foods was absolutely the worse. One of the most horrible people I have ever met in my life. I usually wouldn’t bash a company but that manager made life stressful.
bad,I wouldn't suggest anybody work here. There is no incentive for staying with the company as well as the benefits and pay that they offer are inadequate to be able to live in any major city.
bad,"Scheduling is an absolute mess, no ability to predict when you will be working. Management does not communicate rules, changes in structure and daily responsibilities or scheduling until last minute and then discipline and punish employees for not executing correctly. Literally the only reason to work here is the pay. However, you'll likely never get the opportunity for a promotion. Do not feel valued as an employee at all."
bad,"I worked downstairs in Whole Foods in the prepared foods area.  It is fast-paced, and things typically flow smoothly given there are no call-outs, which is rare. There is high employee turn-over downstairs.  There is lots of ""red-tape"" due to the fact that there is high turn-over, but this can also cause the company to be disloyal to long-time, hard-working employees."
bad,"Too much work, not enough compensation. Too much stress, not enough compensation. I worked the Prepared Foods Department's Pizza station. My job station was the Pizza Department, so Naturally, I worked Pizza station, the Salad case, the Sandwich station, the Burrito Bar, and helped out the Hot Bar and Salad bar if needed. They don't pay you for sick days off, even though we worked directly with peoples food. In fact they ding'd you ever time you were sick."
bad,"The company promotes from within, so employees begin at part-time, entry level positions, then work independently to move up. The customers and managers challenge employees on a daily basis, which helps employees grow. Management positions offer a lot of variety in a fast-paced environment. Store management style varies by location and changes as store managers look for career advancement. The hardest part of the job is the lack of control you have over your resources as a team manager, because labor budgets and corrective action standards are created at the Regional level. The most enjoyable part of the job are the employees, who come from diverse backgrounds."
bad,well its like any other selector job  so its back breaking work and very cold  but the worst part is 4 day work week  and you can barely get 8 to 9 hours daily  so you average about 38 hours a week no overtime they send you home so they tell you you can earn money but they dont have the work volume here like the other big warehouse just barely enough for the 8 or 9 hour day
bad,"This company is fake from the floor up . They say things to manipulate there employees in believing there going places and the company is doing good things. With no intentions of doing so, this is a way to get the best out of there Employees. There shady in the way of brushing there mistakes under the rug and blaming others for there faults. They put in new rules and regulations that protect their upper management. This leaves the workers who bring those large bonus checks for them to travel the world with to the wolves.  But if your friends with that upper management you can do what you want when you want and no repercussions."
bad,"I wouldn't work here ever again. The place is ran on incompetence, Nothing works right. The place is filthy. The managers don't care about their employees."
bad,Not that bad of a place but scheduling was horrible. You could never keep a steady schedule. One week you’ll have 30 hrs the next you get 15 makes no sense. They just cut hrs on their own and even when u ask or speak up about it they still wouldn’t do anything.
bad,A typical day at work with coworkers was light hearted and enjoyable. Their yearly team builds were well done and valuable to maintaining great employee relations.
bad,"Unless you're in management, you will not be able to sustain a living. The hours are decent and you can work a 3 day schedule. However, if you're trying to make a living this is not the job. This job is for college students or people looking for extra income. The culture is a mix between hippie, hipster, and tree hugging but the clients are usually super healthy people who don't mind spending a lot of money."
bad,"This was a Bad decision. I always gave my best effort, worked overtime, and they still treated me like garbage. I was blamed for thing I didn't do, I was talked about behind my back. It wasn't a positive experience by any means."
bad,overall I feel like this particular store wasn't a place for African americans to move up in the company and this targeted hindrance has a lasting negative affect on the quality of this store.
bad,It was a very personal problem. When I go to work I like to see my co workers happy and smiling. But at Whole Foods it was different. My team leader mad me feel very unwanted and un needed in the company.
bad,The management is horrible the employees don't get treated as equals you must work on team work as well people do as they feel in whole foods supervisors are unfair
bad,"Most of the time, things feel relatively low-stress. However, some days there seems to be a plethora of work because of the inefficient and inconsistent way of doing things. It's somewhat difficult to learn and get your bearings when you're new because there is not much guidance and things seem to be taught on a trial and error basis."
bad,"Management will breath down your neck which the stress isn't really worth the pay . Favoritism takes place a lot in the work environment. Other than that , great coworkers & hours if you need some extra money ."
bad,"Loved my job at first but then amazon bought Whole Foods and it became worse. I would never work for them again only if it was different management. I enjoyed the staff and my fellow co workers, the management team was horrible."
bad,"Unfortunately Whole Foods doesn't provide options for advancement, relocation, or job-training. Many of their hiring decisions are based in bias rather than opportunities for learning or advancement. Pay is barely competitive and employees are kept under specific hours. NO OVERTIME EVER. Very expensive benefits package."
bad,"The prepared foods department is extremely understaffed and the turnover rate is somewhat high. It might have just been my store, but everyone is always on the go, and little help is provided when necessary. There's no time to properly clean areas, and it's pretty gross, especially for an area that's supposed to be serving fresh food with no artificial sweeteners, preservatives, colors, flavors, or hydrogenated oils."
bad,"managements attitude towards helping employees was unprofessional, dismissive, and indifferent. They didn't care about employee needs. Other than management being unorganized and having a terrible attitude, the other team members were amazing to work with."
bad,"With time and distance, I can recognize that WFM gave me (and other folks new to the work force) some fabulous opportunities."
bad,"Whole Foods has an unfortunate habit of promoting leaders through a ""next person up"" philosophy which often results in leaders who are incompetent, inconsistent, and on a power trip. Recent changes within the company (decisions all made prior to the Amazon acquisition, but upheld even after the purchase) regarding their move into OTS (order to shelf) makes doing even the simplest tasks an absolute nightmare. "
bad,"Avoid the customer service dept., the lady team leader is horrible, rude and disrespectful.  The day in the life of the cashier aside from cashiering is cleaning the cafeteria tables, chairs and recovering push carts outside. The smell of the reflectorize safety jacket is so dirty and smell bad.  The team leader isn't sincere and usually apply the full force of harrassment and intimidation if you are single out.  She will tell you that your team members doesn't like you during evaluation, totally a lie."
bad,Would not recommend. The management was bad and unprofessional and there was a lot of favoritism when it came to moving up within the company. The positions were not based on performance.
bad,If u looking for wholefoods to be a career move it’s very possible and also a learning experience how ever I’m certain locations favoritism can be a huge problem
bad,"Green on the outside, red on the inside."
bad,"Undergoing lots of changes. May work out for the best, might not. Since Amazon has taken over, policies that were never enforced are now trying to be enforced by inept management team."
bad,"Constantly understaffed with call outs and with little to no help from manager while also helping customers. No lunch breaks, whether or not you work 8hrs or 8+ hours, only two 15 minute breaks. Never given positive reinforcement when a worker pulls a double to make up for call-outs or works simultaneously in two departments. Constant ""everyone's replaceable"" attitude from the manager. The fellow (non-managerial) co-workers are amazing though."
bad,I would not recommend working there. Upper management is horrible and very cut-throat. Management only looks out for themselves and not so much helping out the employees. Not flexible with schedules and not treated fairly.
bad,Amazon came in and took over. Cut my hours drastically and never gave me a straight answer as to why. Other employees were fired with no notice and were replaced with Amazon's preferred staff.
bad,"Management is very disorganized and inept. Team members are often times expected to single-handedly preform job functions that were intended to be carried out by two to three people. For example: I was told that the station I worked would be six to seven shifts per day, but that never happened. The scheduled two or three shifts a day, and I was often left to do an unrealistic and unfair amount of work. I never got any breaks. No 15 minute breaks, no lunches, and scarcely a restroom break. I felt this job was compromising my mental health, and it is just not worth it."
bad,Whole foods is an elitist corporation who does not care for their employees. The typical misconception is that they pay decent but they are not above average and are found to be below norm now.
bad,"Whole Foods Market use to be the place to work! They provided great benefit packages, hours and compensation. In the last couple of years the culture has changed drastically from employee focused to customer focused. The way employees are treated and/or are expected to perform have changed that favors the customer over the employee. While customers are very important, I have always believed that an well treated employee results in well treated customers. I don't recommend working at Whole Foods anymore than I'd recommend working at Walmart."
bad,"They would split me into many different positions, most of the time I felt it was overwhelming. keeping the shelves faced, just to have little kids of rich families come in and push them over. I felt like a slave working at the feet of the rich."
bad,This place is stressful. they promote people who don't deserve it. Most of the employees act like high school kids. They also show favoritism between there employees.
bad,"When I first started there, the benefits were much better than when I left. The whole company began to feel a lot more corporate and they cut down on the individuality that was encouraged before."
bad,"Work environment was fast paced and management squeezed every second of productivity from employees by understaffing customer needs."
bad,"This company is great to work with. The issue that this company has is their inexperienced managers, thus create lots more operational issues. And the way they are trying to fix the issues are by sacrificing their employees instead of fixing their operational-technology-management issues."
bad,Whole Foods is now an unstable workplace and they are going through a companywide restructuring. Most of the original passionate employees have left the company due to changes in the core values.
bad,"This is not the place for you if you're a hard worker. They will overwork you while your coworkers get to stand around and treat their shift as one big social hour. It seems like Whole Foods just doesn't care that much about their employees anymore. It's a night and day difference from when I started working there and when I recently quit. "
bad,"I've been working there for two years, in the beginning it was fun and I really enjoyed working there. Now I've moved up in the company management is awful and regional doesn't communicate to stores. Now my days are awesome till I enter my store. Its sad knowing that since it used to be such a good company"
bad,"Whole Foods is a great company in general, but the location I worked at was terrible. The management is very incompetent and communication is non-existent. The workload is very unevenly distributed and there is often time one person carrying the load of certain functions in the department. There are often lazy team members who depend on other people to do all of the work so they do the bare minimum. I love everything that Whole Foods stands for, but this location really needs new management."
bad,"I worked here five years in several departments.  When I started the benefits were pretty good And the environment was positive.  The last few years have seen diminishing benefits and jobs cut, less competitive wages, and less money to the workers, not to mention less strict quality standards on the products."
bad,It was good from the beginning nice people warm welcome. but in the end i was doing several works i shouldnt of been doing everyweek and at the same time teacher did not teach me causing me to not be able to do everything quickly
bad,"You hear a lot of good things about Whole Foods, they're Fortune 500's best of companies to work for. Yet my whole time working there has been nothing but oppressive and demeaning. Store Management has no idea how to run the store and my department managers and even more incompetent. The store is abundant with nepotism, those sucking up to managers get promoted quickly and their mistakes easily over-looked. The little guys do all of the work while the supervisors/managers take all the credit."
bad,"Whole Foods Market has potential to be an outstanding company, however their management is terrible. I wouldn't expect any different though because they invest ZERO time into developing great leaders."
bad,"Whole Foods was a wonderful experience and a fun place to work. "
bad,"I worked for Wholefoods in Hawaii (Kahala) and loved it. I now work in Salt Lake City (Sugarhouse location) and can not wait to find another position. The management is quite poor. They play favorites, don't reward their hard-working employees, and resist giving full-time positions so to not give better benefits. Every person in prepared foods and bakery is completely burnt out. I know others feel the same outside of my department."
bad,"Although their are realities to working in a corporate retail structure. I found the drive for increased profits manifested itself in a thin spreading of it's labor force. In my department my tasks were many and I was always encouraged to provide great customer service to everyone as well increase my pace. Very often I found this contradictory as I was chastised for taking 15 minutes extra during my shift if I was running behind. In addition, I was very curious about the information of our product (where it comes from, margins) so that I could increase my knowledge of the business and properly inform the customers but finding this information was not easy for my entry-level position. Yes the pay and benefits are more than you can expect from a comparable company but at the end of the day this is a regular company with a great image. But that's all it is really. Food waste is immense and profits are the foremost concern. There is no desire for change in the way we buy food. It's merely an apt marketing strategy."
bad,"A typical day involves dealing with many different types of people and overlapping duties that may or may not have been a part of your original job description. I learned that I have a vast amount of patience and that this may not be a good fit for me in the long run. Management is in a constant state of flux. It's best not to get used to seeing anyone in the top tier of management stay too long. With the constant management change comes a constant store policy change which can be hard to get used to especially when there is little notice or reason given as to why these policy changes have been instituted. There is little support for the workers when it comes to enforcing store policy. It seems that catering to the wealthy is more important than following established and effective store policy. Co-workers are good to work with for the most part, although there seems to be a strong culture of favoritism when it comes to promoting individuals. Also senoirity tends to count for more than it should in some instances, especially when workers who have been there longer get away with slacking off and other offenses. The hardest part of the job is staying motivated. As I have stated before, the constant leadership and policy changes, the lack of recognition for accomplishments and the profits over people atmosphere makes it a demoralizing and energy draining environment. The most enjoyable part are the coworkers and the customers that are not pretentious. The benefits are very good."
bad,"On a typical day, we didn't get our breaks.  Sent me to a class to be serve-safe certified, although now I understand they just give you a book and ask you to take the test.  My co-workers were awesome, the managers did not seem to care about the food being organic, natural, only overall sales seemed to be their motive to being there. You never had a shift at the same time to bring continuity to your life, you might close at night, only to open the next morning.  Monthly meetings are required and held in the store before dawn."
bad,"It's become such a corporate monster, they don't care about their employees as much as they say they do. If you're a student forget about it, unless you're in good with the manager. There is no flexible scheduling... again unless you're good with the manager. The benefits are atrocious."
bad,"Worked in 40 degree cooler everyday. I learned how to cut and package fruit and vegetables. My co-workers were nice except my supervisor. The hardest part of my job was working with my supervisor, she was very rude and demanding."
bad,"Lots of lies to cover up the company changing to a 'large' cooperation."
bad,"The culture is ok, but it's not the company people make it out to be. You can move up quickly, but you have to fake who you are as a person. They pay and benefits suck!! The insurance is a joke, I had better insurance with past employers. Over all, its ok for those with school or a PT job. I wouldn't though make it a life career. Because at the end of the day its a grocery store."
bad,"Unfortunately for a company that sells a lot of great products and yes I still like to shop there, your either part of the clique or your not. If your're not part of that stores clique you will be miserable as in no promotions or reluctant promotions and immeadiate scrutiny for your new position. Many of the managers I dealt with while working for Whole Foods were more concerned in making you look bad to thier boss to legitamize thier own positions. I say this having had 20 years experience when I joined WFM and was treated as if I knew nothing of importance and was written up several times for things I had no control over. I'm just saying either you'll fit right in and be fine or you won't and you'll know if you don't pretty quickly."
bad,There no room for advancement if you are older in customer Service  the manager there only wants young people who are control-able  she talks to staff disrespectful sometimes and upper management doesn’t do anything about it
bad,"If you need a job for a little bit this is the way to go, but the first month I know that this wasn't a full time gig. Very poor management and hostile work enviornment."
bad,"Used to be a great place to work before Amazon took over. Before Amazon, the culture was very supportive and everyone was like friends - even our superiors! It was amazing and I loved coming to work every day. After Amazon, many new arbitrary rules were implemented that, I feel, contradicted Whole Foods' philosophy and culture, in some areas prices were increased for no reason other than what I can assume is greed, management became untrustworthy and not approachable at all - it feels like I'm in a prison now. It's no longer a fun and happy place to work, and everyone I work with has similar sentiments. Whole Foods used to have a small company vibe that was very personable and extremely customer and team member satisfaction oriented but now it may as well be called Walmart. It's cold, unfeeling, and greedy."
bad,"They don’t care about any of their workers even though they say they do. They also treat people like they are disposable, a bunch of old people who gossip and talk about people behind their backs like it’s high school. This place is only good for the pay but please keep to yourself no matter what if the pay is important."
bad,"Non-productive, no fun workplace, hard physical job, people do not respect each other, they're terrible to work with, bullying almost everyday. No learning, no promotion, you are stuck in one place forever."
bad,"It’s not the worst but can be more selective in choosing of Supervision/Management placement. "
bad,"The work was fine, an outstanding Department Lead and was replaced with 2 truly unprofessional candidates and from there it was a slippery slope for the entire department."
bad,"I worked here for almost 7 years before being fired for trying to please an angry customer which is what I was trained and told to do over my years there."
bad,"As far as the staff and co-worker who made going to work worth it, the supervisors and team leaders are barely helping you on the floor. Scheduling was poor and they barely worked with you as far as hours and don't get me started on when you start a family they seem to screw you over on pay and moving up in the job is based on favorites."
bad,"Wholefoods is a great place for younger people to work.  If you could figure things out yourself,  Wholefoods is perfect for you.  Your schedule will be different every week,  and you have to work weekends."
bad,but management really sucked and didn't have your back for anything and the workload got unsustainable for the already understaffed department and management did not help in the kitchen
bad,"Pros: Competitive pay and benefits. Room for advancement. Some people are great."
bad,"Able to educate yourself on nutritional healing, health, organic/non organic products, certifications, meet new people, flexible hours, good for someone currently in school."
bad,"Started a few years ago, promising from the start. When I first started with the company I saw myself as a team member that would move up and grow with the company. Now, I don't see that at all. With countless tries to move up even with having a wonderful background outside and within the company, WFM has unrealistic standards for their employees and who they hire for the simplest roles most basic roles. When I first was hired, I had 3 interviews to start as a cashier, and to move up it's only more intensive. The other issue I have with WFM is the management and lack of a successful training program in place. Management in both regional offices and in store are hardly ever helping customers on the sales floor, and when regional office comes in they rarely interact with customers. 90% of their days are focused on admin work and sales figures. Another huge problem is training. Again, started out great, now it's literally train someone for a couple hours day 1 and then they let them just work by themselves and hope they understand what they are doing...and HOPE the customers don't notice. Nothing by the books, nothing done by procedure for training. We are always getting short staffed because TMs are becoming more and more frustrated. Especially new TMs. They are being brought on in the worst times and not given enough tools to be successful and they either leave or are fired before they are trained properly. Lastly, the new OTS program. The program micromanages to the point if you don't do it all correctly you get a failing score card on daily OTS walks. Honestly, it makes me"
bad,"Anyone can google Whole Foods Market and OTS and find a plethora of news articles about how employees are miserable trying to comply with the SOP. The culture of WFM used to make me love coming to work. Now I've seen 2 Team Leaders step down and at least 15 people outright quit because of the stress the SOP brings and the demand leadership puts on you to be almost impossible standards, to the point of your job security being constantly threatened. Then you still have other problems to consider, not all teams are that great, adding more problems to the compounding over stressful environment that has become WFM. This company is on the fall, it used to be great. Such a shame."
bad,environment was good just management was poor since every one in prep foods were close friends so if one hated you then they all did. felt discriminated against as well as being the only minority working there i was got the cold shoulder from everyone
bad,"you get hired."
bad,No thanks not unless you want to pay me for my time.  I do not give marketing to former employers for free. More words to finish this up blah blah blah
bad,"When I would go to work in the morning, I would feel isolated and alone. My team in the bakery was very clique-y and would always exclude me, causing me to feel depressed. When I told management about it, nothing was done. Overall, the culture of Whole Foods was negative and stressful."
bad,"Usually the time you came in there is a specific duty for you to do,"
bad,"I can’t pin point one thing exactly that makes me hate my job. Myself and others have said there’s just something about working here, in any department, that’s just kind of takes the life out of you. Most of the customers are condescending and unreasonable. Your schedule isn’t very consistent. Most departments are always short on labor so you’ll need to work extra hard.  The company doesn’t live up to the image they sell to the workers or the customers. They want to make you feel like your voice matters and that we’re all one big team working together but that’s not the case. Since the amazon buyout our opinions means even less. "
bad,"Although the corporation maintains lofty goals for employ satisfaction, actual practice at the store level leaves much to be desired.  Promotions are given based on entertainment factors rather than solid experience and skills"
bad,"Worked here for a few years, had it's up's and down's like any other job.Benefits are ok, health, vision, dental. PTO, sick days, gainsharing are some of the perks."
bad,More and more work falsl into the responsibility of coworkers.  No overtime to make the stats look good.  Great way to learn buying & management without getting paid for it.
bad,"culture is gone! Used to be able to run team as your own business, now you have no choices everything is the same across the board.Used to be a good place to work, would not recommend anymore!!"
bad,"I enjoyed working at Whole Foods. I was happy to begin my experience, I was trained very well. The only thing I did not enjoy was the management not communicating well with me. I had a hard time getting my voice heard and I felt as if I was thrown in the worst position in the store without considering the position I would fit best. I didn't apply to be a dishwasher, and only agreed to this position, because I was needing a job and told that after 90 days I would be moved to Food Prep Services, which is what I applied for."
bad,"Extremely nepotistic work environment where knowledge and skill is trumped by who you know. Company used to be cool, but that was way before I started."
bad,"I LOVED that job but was unable to keep it because I have a young child and the hours were extremely inconsistent.  I had to pay for added daycare in order to keep my schedule open to the possibility of getting a shift.  I worked my longest hours on the weekend days and I ended up missing out on my young child's life and time with my husband. The managers said there wasn't anything that could be done and that the inconsistent schedule was a way of life for everyone, including them.  It appeared to be very true. I also wanted full time work so I could get insurance but there are very few full time opportunities.  It became too expensive to work there because I had to pay for my own insurance and because I had to pay added childcare hours. I loved that job."
bad,This place is a fast paced environment. There is always something to work on. Team Members are always friendly and willing to help the customers any way they can.
bad,"They use prison slave labor to package their products...so if you can live with working for a company that takes part in that kind of business practice. Grab that paper!"
bad,Team leader changes were implemented poorly with little foresight. Discouraging many long term Team members. Causing lost positions.  Leadership has made team member happiness an after thought.
bad,"currently, the state of WFM is disjointed and its focus is in a drastic state of confusion with both Regional and Central leadership steering the ship into each other."
bad,"The customers were the best part in my opinion. I was a supervisor and due to lack of proper leadership and upper leadership planning, I spent much of my time servicing the counter. I met some really interesting people serving coffee and smoothies. The team was very strong and really came together to back each other on the job.  "
bad,its a pretty good place to work sometimes it could get a little unfair with things. I learned thaat the customers are always right and to nourish them.
bad,They are notorious for letting people go for far fetched reasons because of inside hiring and placement. A lot of minority workers who are great workers are on a MUCH shorter leash that non minority workers. The place is bubbly and great to customers but the total opposite to its employees.
bad,"Whole Foods Market has some great core values, however, if you are a new hire, expect to not get the training you need when you need it. It can become a source of frustration as leadership does not take the time to coach and lead. They do their best, but it is difficult for them as they don't necessarily have the tools they need to structure a good on-boarding process either. It truly is a leap into the fire and you can only hope you find your way through the first 3 months of chaos. It can be fun to a point, but not when leadership puts the burden of fixing their poorly executed processes on your shoulders as the new hire. There are few systems and very little order in place to make things run smoothly for your team. A typical day is rife with customers interested in the products you carry and finding ways to make their experience worthwhile. Most people who work there maintain a good attitude, but poor attitudes are usually ignored by leadership instead of dealt with head on, easily damaging the team morale. The most enjoyable part of the job is sharing product knowledge with customers and working with your team."
bad,Working for this company was okay. the benefits were amazing. Really great. the leadership was slightly unorganized but the benefits were worth it.
bad,"overall store was cool cool people to work with."
bad,Over the last 10 years it has gone downhill for employees. No longer the company that took care of employees. standards have gone down and management is horrible.
bad,Not the place you want to work if you like warehouse work. Start pay 12.10. U gotta kiss u know what to get raise hard work don't get it. Less than 1800k a month with 2 dependents. Get your money up and leave like every one do.
bad,•	Ensure a continuous availability of sufficient quantities of goods and materials. Store perishable food items under appropriate conditions.
bad,Great paying job for college students. Healthy programs for their employees is a plus and the 20% discount. Usual in great ares.
bad,"Pay is negligible. Management is aloof. Unpredictable schedule. Clientele is generally stuck-up and overprivledged. Culture is questionable, mostly hipster college kids. Best part of the job. . . hard to say, I really despise this job."
bad,Selling of highest natural and organics products.Learn the differents products in the kitchen.Great team members in any departments.Lots of delivery during holidays is coming.
bad,"I was a cashier and your going to be on 24/7. If your having a bad day, you can't run away and you need to pretend your happy.  Its hard work, but many breaks."
bad,"Most of the people I worked with were great but the department heads tend to be complete dummies who expect their employees to follow there every whim because lord knows you have no other option. Too bad, they can't manage for carp so they have no real expectations of us except for how to drool."
bad,"Great benefits, good pay, no hours, rarely any advancements, management controlling and demanding, but great full time/part time benefits in my opinion"
bad,"Good environment, but not enough workers. We are often overwhelmed with our workloads and are not given sufficient solutions to our problems. Emphasis is placed on customer service but not do much on the happiness of employees."
bad,"A lot of one nationality who don't care about others ,they  play music like if they are  at home very loud. Management  do not do anything  about it. A lot of call in.management need to step up to help or find staff to work. Its feels like slavery."
bad,"The location I work as keeps lying to me and saying they'll give me more hours, but continue to give me two shifts a week. Also its very cliquey and you get some weird vibes from different departments."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had, and the most stressful. Coworkers were nice for the most part, but understaffed. I don't know how anyone could work in the kitchen there for longer than a couple of weeks. Stay away."
bad,The company has changed a lot in recent years...work/home life is a bit difficult if you have kids or are very family oriented...has a lot of growth  if this is the company you want to be with
bad,Whole Foods has changed drastically since being acquired by Amazon is not a place that you might want to work now! But if you wish to be unhappy go ahead
bad,"Unless the managers that work with you are out to get you, I had a great time at Whole Foods until the store managers Started targeting me for no reason"
bad,"Job was cool, wasnt necessary what I wanted to do in life,but i definitely was a nice trade to learning how to cut proper cuts of meat. An prep foods was always busy,so adaptability to the busy rush was a big change in had to learn."
bad,"I left behind a stable income to commit to the overnight position I was hired for, yet they found pathetic reasons to get rid of me within less than 2 weeks of employing me... BUYER BE WARE"
bad,"Better for people who don't know how to be treated while working for a large company."
bad,"I worked for Whole Foods for 2 and a half years, during that time I worked with and for some truely incredible people. People that I consider friends to this day. The starting wage at Whole Foods is above average for what you would be paid elsewhere, however raises often tend to be, for the average employee, less than $1."
bad,"Worked at the company for three years. During that time, I've seen plenty of changes (both good and bad, but mainly the later) throughout the company."
bad,"A fee years ago, NYTs had an expose by a former worker at Amazon. Once Amazon bought Whole Foods , the same instances began happening. Big brother company consistently watching every employee. Hires fake workers and fake customers as well.  A lot of great co workers, though you never know which ones are spies. They do pay well for what you do but everything comes at a cost. Good discount for employees. Management tends to favor the ""Do what I say, not what I do"" logic. Workers are viewed as a chess piece (pawns) to be used in what way they see fit even if goes against the type of worker someone is. Open late, so, you get out late  (usually 1045-11). Morning shifts can start at 530am. "
bad,"Typical day at work is making drinks (smoothies/juices/coffee). What I have learned is to be stable in yourself and do not let rude and impatient guests affect your already stressful day. The department I work in has no manager, only assistant managers and they are run ragged and expected to do far too much. Work place culture has gotten lost over the years I have been there. The hardest part of the job is being forgotten about and being extremely overwhelmed and still expected to smile through the stress and being treated like a door mat by guests. The most enjoyable part of the job is how much they pay."
bad,This job is just not friends it may be for someone elseI didn’t like working here at all if I’m being honest. This job and make me happy but I appreciate the money because the money is actually good
bad,It is very cutthroat.  Be prepared to be pushed to the limit daily. There is always more to be done and the end is never in sight. If you stop or misstep you will be written up promptly.
bad,"Work environment not terrible, but the management was poor. Puts all problems on people lower them themselves. Does not take responsibility for any actions of their own."
bad,laid back job but has alot of unsuccesful employees. it was actually a great start and everythig just went right down the drain hopefully all stores arent the same
bad,"I thought Whole Foods would be a great place to work.  And it was when I worked in the Midwest region.  The culture that people associate with Whole Foods permeates all aspects of life there.  In the south and northeast regions, not so much."
bad,"My personal experience was mediocre; however, based on conversations with employees at other Whole Foods locations, my experience seems like it may have been somewhat isolated. There are lots of trade-offs: low pay/zero stress, low accountability/lack of structure, etc. I worked for the company pre-Amazon.com buyout, I would imagine they have implemented substantial changes."
bad,"I enjoyed the job, then they fired all the floor workers and brought in more VP's and regional workers. From what I hear it's not the place you want to work now a days."
bad,"Whole Foods is no longer the leader in organic and sustainable foods. Some WFM fish is grown/farmed using prison labor, right alongside companies like WalMart and McDonald's. Trendy foods like quinoa are being sourced to extinction in African nations, leaving many people that once relied on this food source to go hungry. The demand for almond milk and almond based products is a direct contributor to the bee population being destroyed in America. The company has cut labor more and more everywhere they can, which negatively effects both customer and team membesr. Whole Foods has strayed from the core values that once made this company great."
bad,"The people in your department are usually the chillest people you'll meet, but the management sucks. If you ever get sick or need an extended period of time off, expect to not have your job when you get back"
bad,"Management sucks, you get a lot of free food. The customers are the worst as they feel the biggest sense of entitlement due to the fact that they shop at whole foods."
bad,"Work is simple. Just pick your favorite department and hope you are accepted there. When I worked there which was a while ago, you were eligible for a small raise every 6 months or so. If you like that kind of work it's fine, but pay was not wonderful in the early stages. Pay gets better with advancement. You become eligible for benefits after a certain period of time. Supervisors were generally friendly but the store manager was not very friendly in my opinion."
bad,"i spent 8.5 yrs there, worked really hard, i moved up to become a buyer for frozen dpt. i did that for a couple of years. but tin the end i was laid off without any warning. but these things happen."
bad,"I actually enjoyed this job but the management was so screwed up I was there almost a year before being ""voted on"" which gave me zero benefits or any chance of advancement in the company even though I switched departments and was their beer and wine buyer until they hired a outsider."
bad,"I used to love working here, but since whole foods has gone corporate, at my location everything changed for the worse. Managers weren't good, cut hours, didn't seem to care about things that used to matter etc."
bad,"a vicious attendance policy that doe not allow for absences ,even when they are legit Cannot accumulate more than 6 in a 6 month period. Dr note is required if out sick,but it still goes down as an absence."
bad,I ensured wholefoods mission in great hospitality and product knowledge.  I often lent a hand to any department outside of the front end and always asked customers of their experience
bad,"I met a lot of good people here and made some life long friends.  The work was fun, if you like cooking.  The work is fast pace, but there is always help."
bad,"A typical day at work starts with just coming in and getting ready and are greeted by your co-workers in a friendly manner, at Whole Foods the employees become best friends and everyone in their department become like a family. The hardest part of the job his having to stand for one hours and having to deal with difficult customers who complain for small things. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming into work and seeing your second family who all greet you with a smile on their face, happy to see you. Management although do their job they are approachable and are friendly to talk to."
bad,"Me and several of my friends/coworkers were laid off and had our jobs taken away ""effective immediately"". The moral at whole foods is destroyed and the way they treat the lower employees do NOT go hand in hand with their ""core"" values. Their values were the reason people loved whole foods the reason people wanted to work for them. They are hypocrites and are deteriorating their credibility. They make you either step on your friends/coworkers or just tell you to walk away."
bad,Work often had to come home due to completely unrealistic labor budgets. Extremely fragmented regional-store and store leadership-team leadership practices.
bad,"Great company, poor management. I worked beyond expectation and it got me stuck in the hardest position."
bad,"Our facility manager hired only her friends and just a few outside of the box (myself included). If you were not in her circle of friends, you missed out on promotions or other open areas of work potions. She would later fire most of us, and later herself be fired because of the treatment she gave to others. The work, pay and benefits were great."
bad,the management is the only thing that really needs to change because  they are not fair and are all over the place but other then that it is fun and a great job.
bad,"I heard really good things about WF when searching for a job out of culinary school. I have an acct degree, 6 years of business/finance experience, a culinary degree and thought WF would be my dream job. After interviewing 5 times for a buyer at prepared foods, I agreed to start as a cook to get my foot in the door. Since I started, it was clear I was over qualified and I got no respect from my counterparts. I'm on the fence whether I want to continue at a company that rewards lax behavior and makes it difficult for motivated, passionate people."
bad,Top store management didn’t seem interested in helping run day to day business. The constant issue ma being thrown at them quickly over whelmed them and it became appears they should never have been leading a store.
bad,Okay place to work. A lot of segregation when it came to women in the work place. Not my first choice when it comes to upper management. Fellow employees were easy to work with.
bad,"I was discriminated against and durning the investigation, the investigator wrote the story up wrong and made it look like j was the one who discriminated against the security guard, but it was the totaled  opposite."
bad,"It may be different for day shift, but working overnights at Cherry Hill was horrible. The workload was overwhelming for being purposely short staffed. The overnight hours were hard enough, but the poor management and lack of supervision on shift made it worse. If you’re overnights, you’re out of sight and out of mind, except for when they need someone to blame. You won’t advance working overnights and many people working there are miserable and antisocial. When you first start they present the company much differently than how it really is."
bad,"WFM changed a lot over the two decades I was there.  I got to travel to open stores, and met a lot of great people.  I had a bad experience towards the end.  Some might say WFM went downhill because of Amazon, but it also have been themselves."
bad,It’s a pyramid scheme to get to the top you start off as a low level cashier or sales floor associate and if you’re “liked” you can make it to supervisor. Extreme and constant reminder of store policies some are very ridiculous a lot of mini micro managing. If you’re a customer service desk associate you have to be ready to take the blame for a lot of mishaps even if it’s not your fault and also their so called health benefits are expensive even when you pay out of paycheck because of store policy you take a lot of abuse from customers don’t expect the supervisor or leadership to have your back and hard work doesn’t get appreciated
bad,in the begging was great very friendly and the manager was always very understanding towards my 6 month mark of being there the managers true colors started showing he was very rude would make supervisors cry and always brought his personal issues to work
bad,"I approached this job with intentions of moving up quickly to a leadership position, but ceased to be motivated to seek promotions once I witnessed the gross insubordination of team members in response to weak leadership."
bad,"Whole Foods Market used to be a great place to work, but since Amazon acquisition, the culture has taken a turn for the worse. They have started cutting down the number of employees on the floor at any given time, while expecting the same, if not more, work to be done."
bad,"I started at the Columbia, MD store in 2016. After a complete management change things got better. I was at the front end. There was a lot of favoritism. The customers were okay. Then when I transferred to the Woodmere location I had never hated a job so much. Too much favoritism. Rude and dramatic coworkers. Incompetent management. The customers were those from a nightmare."
bad,it was fun I love the team and all the benefits. it has changed a lot but overall it's a beautiful place held many position and lots of room for advancement
bad,"Be prepared to have several people show you how to do things incorrectly."
bad,"If you aren’t a favorite, you are gossiped about by leadership-people that are supposed to be mature and neutral. Hours are given to favorites but not single parents who are hard workers and need them too. I’m not a single parent but it bothers me to watch this all unfold. "
bad,"I left due to the fact that management would not give me one weekend off a month in order to watch our daughter play volleyball. Also when our daughter got hurt at school they would not allow me to leave. "
bad,I used to work at a store in Brooklyn and my team leader and store team leader were great. Then I transferred to 97th and the leadership there is horrendous. Do not work customer service!!!!!
bad,"I absolutely loved working here, up until Amazon bought them out. Since then, product quality and management have gone downhill. Most employees stick around for the benefits, but could care less about the job due to overbearing/incompetent management. Favoritism definitely plays a part in career advancement."
bad,"My manager didn't like me so it didn't feel great, she was really condescending and often made me feel like I didn't deserve to work at WFM. Other than her it was great."
bad,"There seems to no longer be any standards regarding hiring employees. Most people I directly worked with have little to do with the integrity this company once had... including knowledge of health foods, caring for customer food requirements & restrictions, having an overall positive outlook on healthy lifestyle and practices, etc. "
bad,I would not recommend working at Whole Foods in the Grocery department because it was personally one of the worst jobs I have ever had. You are not paid enough at all.
bad,Not a bad place to work.  The management is poor pretty much across the board and rarely are team members held accountable.  Be prepared to deal with call outs.  The discount is great and so are the benefits.
bad,"A typical day of work was nothing beyond any other retailer."
bad,"My time at WFM was a lot of stress mixed with making great new friends and connections. My store manager had very high expectations and (in my opinion) a very poor management style which led to a very low morale among employees."
bad,I had a great run with Whole Foods until the company was bought out by Amazon in 2016. The quality and service I was accustom to had drastically changed. Along with management looking to fatten their wallets with incentives to lower their full time to part time ratio. It is just not the same company as before.
bad,My job was cut due to mismanagement of money and false advertisements  i enjoyed the job culture and helpimg the community but alot of politics were involved
bad,horrible management. doesn't care about employees. fired someone for having cancer.coworkers are amazing and very fun to work with but the lack of respect for fellow humans from management is what ultimately made me decide to leave.
bad,"work under pressure in order to provide excellent customer service.  Team work in the kitchen to prevent any accidents, make sure to work  with all precautions cleaning."
bad,"There seemed to be little to no motivation for success at the Whole Foods Market in which I worked. Everyone just kind of did their own thing with little to no accountability. If you, an assistant manager, held anyone accountable you were too harsh."
bad,A company that represented itself as values first but then turned more to profits and spoiling the mission they set out to accomplish.  Greed pushed WFM to where it is today.
bad,"Was okay, terrible now. I wish i never started there. Amazon ruined everything, and killed the stores core values. I would not recommend this place to work to anyone."
bad,"I experienced an excess of commanding ""dictatorial"" direction from my immediate supervisor in conjunction with excessive criticism and complaining (about EVERYONE's shortcomings; including my own performance).  She demonstrated very little of the core values of appreciation or ""TEAM leadership"" that I was lead to expect.  And, on a personal note, I was not happy with the general treatment of the floral merchandise....too much was packed onto the sales floor and ""abused,"" for lack of a better word...and then heartlessly disposed of due to the damage inflicted by poor displaying methods, which my efforts to correct were repeatedly overridden under the guise of ""policy"" or some regional manager's dictate.  "
bad,Disappointed in management. They were unwilling to help with an unexpected setback. Unwilling to move teams for me to accommodate my health issue. Great team members though.
bad,The store has been open for almost two years now and still doesn't know how to be ran properly. They do nothing to boost profits and wonder why they aren't making enough money. This forces them to understaff and it's an never ending process.
bad,"Once Amazon started to take over Whole Foods started trimming and not replacing positions.  Corporate Whole Foods does not support employees on a store level.  "
bad,"I enjoyed working for Whole Foods in the beginning.  As my tenure advanced, I felt that there was favoritism and internal politics prevented me from doing my job the most efficiently I could have."
bad,"I did not fully enjoy my time at Wholefoods. It is a place where if you are not fitting in, you will be terminated. I would suggest this place for someone that only wants some extra cash."
bad,"In 2008 it was fun.  It became more corporate and stressful the closer to 2017 as we got.  Then they were bought by Amazon, nuff said.  I don't recommend working there, ever again."
bad,I do not wish to explain my work experience. I have nothing else to say about the company. It was a good place to earn money during the summer for anyone.
bad,"working for WFM was a great time in my career.  They focused on training, collaboration and skill sets that improved both work productivity but also quality of work environment.  They did not just look at the bottom line.  They looked at the people generating it."
bad,"At first this place sounds great. Gray pay, tons of free food samples, but that's where it stops. "
bad,I cooked batch foods for the deli case. Ran a food truck for about a year and did various other positions within the store as needed.
bad,A Prepared food Team Member performs all duty and function related to preparation of food and maintenance of the cases of prepared food. It is part also of their responsibilities to counter service and product stocking. Also preparing and cooking food for the hot bar for customers.
bad,Too many internal changes.  The company is not what it use to be in terms of how it treats its team members.  The work demands do not match current wages.
bad,stressful but the employees are fun to work with.you can move up fast in the company and becomes part of management in a short time
bad,"Whole Foods is a decent place to work for, as always you have your favorites and what not, like at any company.  However, Whole Foods tends to cater to the wealthy population in regards to employees and customers."
bad,"They don't take into account when we would prefer shifts, so I always get the short, late shifts. I clock in and get placed at a register. I talk to people all day and scan/bag their product. I used to get cross training in the bakery and kitchen which really helped me with non vegan cooking and baking. That was my favorite part of the job. The hardest part I standing around and forcing conversation with about 300+ people a day"
bad,Minimum wage does not cut it especially when taxes are taken out every week. They requested more then what your job description states and it wasn't worth the pay.
bad,"I started out working in the dishroom and I worked my tail off and was eventually promoted. I ended up becoming a receiver so I was doing lots of loading and unloading of produce,meat,etc pretty physically demanding work.I got a raise but the pay didn't seem to match the work I was doing, so I steadily lost motivation over time even though I still kept a good attitude and put in effort.I was constantly given more jobs to do and more expectations.Then I was given another promotion where I was doing ordering as well as doing the receiving,but again the pay just didn't match the work I was doing especially considering I never got weekends off for the most part and had to be at work between 430 and 5am. The management didn't help either,,,Just an example I got called into a meeting by three team leaders where I felt like they were trying to intimdate me, I was givin a long list of what I was doing wrong,To me that was just a  horrible strategy to get your employee's to perform at a higher level. They didn't know how to treat there employees at all."
bad,"At was doing maintenance over there ,make sure everything is fine and each floor"
bad,"Favortism, unprofessionalism, and unethical are three words I would use to describe WFM"
bad,Whole Foods needed better training for management and people who wanted to move up in the company. Great pay but hours where very long 45+ hours.
bad,See Review of Whole Foods Washington Park and take away some of the enjoyable parts.  Work/life balance was worse too.
bad,"A typical day was full of placing orders and meeting deadlines, providing excellent customer service, producing baked goods, and balancing the budget for the bakery department. I learned how to be a much better leader, how to provide the highest quality customer service. The management was not very supportive of training new team members or current team members to help them move up and promote w in the company. My coworkers were all great and fun to work w and always an integral part of my job as a buyer. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to deal w the custmers and being the person who got to deal w new vendors who were trying to get their product into the store. The hardest part of the job was trying to never make a mistake in order to avoid being written up."
bad,"its very interesting you learn alot as time goes on. whole foods has so much to offer , from benifits to the people and more. the hardest part is really nothing if you know what you doing & the best part is the customers from all over the world you meet someone new every day."
bad,I didn’t like how far it was and I thought nobody like me but I just was just there to work I would like to work at another Whole Foods maybe one close to me
bad,"If you read the news you know this company is going through a lot of change. Frankly, I don’t think it’s for the better. The pay and benefits are great but in middle management it’s impossible to do your job due to constant changes in upper management. The culture has all but disappeared and people have become rather disposable and far less valued. Unfortunate because I did genuinely love this job and thought I’d have a career here."
bad,Would not recommend very sexist establishment. Good hours terrible store when it rained the store would flood. not enough lockers for employees and inadequate first aid supplies.
bad,"Started as a fun, productive, innovative, supportive company and eventually just turned into a corporate cut throat. As a cheese buyer I would work 7-8 hours multitasking 3 different departments whilst on my own. Receiving packaging, product for beer, wine, and cheese while playing orders, walking with health inspection, and maintaining customer service. 2 years I asked for back up help and received it for a short time. I think that there’s about a 50/50 ratio of good leadership and bad leadership."
bad,Workplace is great. Friendly people. Good pay. However management seemed a bit lacking. Led to my facility being shut down. Unsanitary food handling. Busted machines.
bad,"big cuts in all areas but not at the right levels of the company, not enough labor to keep up the whole foods appearance/expectations in all departments. not a lot of commitment to ""core values"", except where the public can see. was amazing company to work for until recently and i'm sure there still are those stores that are amazing to work for, but do some serious due diligence before you decide."
bad,"A lot of work to be done with little compensation, management is very unorganized."
bad,It was a great place to start until they lost site of one of their core values and decided to have a computer write the schedule.  I will miss this place dearly!
bad,when i get to work clock in then go to the barkery and look in the log book to see when happen in the mornining and what the store goal is. Then a fast meet with the colsers. I love coming in to see my co-workers if i havent seen theem in some days. The hardest part of the day is trying to get things together to close but when customers still want bread slice after it get clean.
bad,"They hire interesting people who are passionate for what they do and are my sole reason for still working there. Work/life balance has decreased dramatically since I started in 2014, however. They want to control everything you do and say about the company. It's not the good old days anymore."
bad,"not the best place to work, imo. very rushed/fast paced and absolutely no support from management/even other employees who are along side you. Pro is they aren't hard on you when you call in for good reason, they make it work overtime."
bad,When working at Whole Foods Market I enjoyed the workplace environment and the diversity of the teams. Also the company provides extensive training for its personnel.
bad,"Honest co-workers and loyal customers and laid back environment and not stressful work duties its a go at your own pace type of job, your own boss you could say and once your duties are done your finish for that day."
bad,"Whole Foods market is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all job applicants, its an diverse bunch of team members and leadership, in an exciting fast paced environment. I also learned about natural and organic products from experts. The most enjoyable part about wholefoods is that I get to experience the pride and satisfaction of contributing to the well-being of people and the planet every day. The hardest part of my job description is lifting up every boxes of chickens."
bad,"Starting out was a little rough, since I had to learn new things that I never used before. In the end, the work just didn't cut out for me, and I couldn't meet the demands the company asked for me. I would very much prefer to work at their stores instead of their Distribution Centers."
bad,"A typical day at work would be clocking in on time, and putting on a fake smile and not knowing what direction to take at work. Because most of your team leaders don""t know whats really going on. Your always out of stock of something , so you have to be able to get creative for customers just to please them and still be unappreciated by your company."
bad,"Store Leaders generally have little to no idea what they're doing outside of the grocery department (they all were promoted from the grocery team)"
bad,The customers there are the rudest set of people I have ever met in my life. They are the richest yet poorest people around. You have to spoil the customer regardless if they treat you like.... The management is a mess. MICRO MANAGEMENT is more like it.. way too many chiefs and not enough indians. They will find any reason to get rid of you despite your amazing customer service.
bad,"This is a Fortune 500 company so you will have some extremely great benefits. Life / medical / dental insurance, discounts at other Fortune 500 companies, great breaks at work during a short shift... But the customers are rude and snobby, kitchen work is very difficult. Try to be a grocer or cashier!"
bad,"Its a fast pace environment. I've learned to answer phones, work the computer, help out in the juice bar, and also work inventory overnight. I wish we had a better management team its a lot of miscommunication. My co-workers are never able to get along so it makes coming to work a little hard but I'm always their to put a smile on everyone's face. I've accomplished everything I have not have any obstacles I could not pull through. The best part of my day is the customers I've learned so much new things that I can take with me as life lessons."
bad,Job pay really well but management is horrible an racist I love the benefits but the management makes you hate it they don’t care about nothing but it’s company it self
bad,it was okay not the best job was okay  pay should be a little more not enough schedules to rotate through the week stayed on the same work schedule for a long time
bad,"Whole foods market is a great job . It is not stressful , but it is very relaxing . Your day goes by quickly and your peers are pretty cool . You are paid every 2 weeks ."
bad,It was a great place to work. I worked mornings in the produce department. I had initially applied to Whole Foods in hope of working the in the grocery department and a little let down when I was hired in produce. I could not have been more wrong. I met some of the best people I know in the various produce departments at the four stores I worked at.
bad,"Very fast paced environment, there was never a dull moment, there are all different types of things we had upstairs and downstairs for the tourist and the regulars, people were able to get fresh food or fresh fruits and vegetables or go to the hot bar to buy the food by the pound."
good,I wanted to leave the hired me for one thing and had me doing something else and was not tying to pay .... staff and managers were very rude .... tam members wee stealing miney
good,"I've learned the importance of healthy eating."
good,"I do not recommend, It was not a great experienceEveryone seemed to be constantly under the threat of getting fired. Very threatening environment. Work life balance was non existent ."
good,Initially this position seemed a good building block however soon it was evident that this company is very unorganized. There is little to no advancement opportunity and management seems to enjoy flaunting power.
good,"On the outside all looked great, happy to have found a job to take care of my daily needs little by little everything started to change, looking at the kids (students) throwing food away was painful ,telling them it was wrong did not register , fresh cut deli meats over the amount the customer asked for ,was   immediately disposed with no sense of remorse. Working nights was pleasant for someone with no one to go home to, but, when a worker commands you to close one hour ahead of schedule because he is running late , pushes you to the side and proceeds to do just that, then you go to management, to hear them say their is no proof then , it is time to run and stay away . I will be grateful for the opportunity to have had at Whole Foods , and sad at the culture of no RESPECT within their establishment (sadly our youth has not learned that there will come a day , they will need to be respected as well.  )"
good,"overall whole foods work hard in ensuring wholesome organic foods. management themeselves is liking dealing with children at a daycare, they could care less about empolyees and act like children when someone gives them criticism they dont like."
good,"I worked for Whole Foods for 7 years in several locations in different regions. My experience ranged from excellent to near torture. Each region and store developed independently of one another so policy, practice, culture, and expectations are very inconsistent and can change dramatically based on your leadership and location. Like many places, you will get out of it what you put into it, to a point. That point is where your work and abilities takes a back seat to your ability to play politics and blow smoke. If you don't want to play games stay lower on the corporate ladder. Being a buyer/specialist for Whole Foods was the best role(s) that I had during my 7 years. I would not recommend leadership of any kind. It's too difficult to balance expectations vs. reality and holding employees accountable to a standard you don't stand behind is too difficult if you have any conscience. Time and company size has definitely changed the culture and the working environment so it just isn't as positive as it used to be."
good,"Some stores have worse management than others. not much job culture or compliance to core values or GIG. Good job if you need college money, sucks as a full-time job."
good,Whole Foods was a great place to work until it was acquired by Amazon. Customers are rude and entitled for no reason. Management sucks. Store manager was a drunk.
good,"WFM is not the place it used to be for both team members and customers. The moral in the store is horrible, and the management is the worst when it comes to being fair towards team members."
good,not for me current management at whole foods green hills ruined the culture of entire store most people have left that were there for several years and more are leaving
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with but as the company grew and started making changes it was clear the employees weren’t as valued as was stated when I first started working there.
good,"Completely unorganized and terrible communication between within the company, let alone externally. No job security or good salary. Bad support, very unprofessional."
good,I enjoyed the work. However they were not able to provide enough hour for me to work every week.  I enjoyed helping customers with physical disabilities.
good,"Management disconnected from how things work, too much stress for what they pay. Constant turnover forces employees to work overtime constantly. I'd rather work anywhere else."
good,"A non stop busy day from the minute you clock in exhaustive and a very HIGH turn over unless you drink the KOOL AID from the boss."
good,"Even though I like the pay and coworkers, I had an unfair manager who was bias to any race besides his own race. He would treat his race really well and treat other races sub-par. He would give them any days they wanted off but wouldnt and he would fire anyone that was not Mexican. He was discovered to be biased and was demoted from manager and team member. Unfortunately, I was already gone by that time."
good,A typical day at work is walking into the kitchen and going to the dishpit. I do dishes that everyone drops off after cooking and preparing with. I then prepare rotisserie chickens that are scheduled to be cooked throughout my shift. The workplace is stressful mainly for the person working in dishes because they are required to get all of it done before their shift ends.
good,since the labor cuts the job culture changed. They were more worried about making a profit more than the people that has been with the company for years
good,poor management skills from supervisors. little to no disciplinary action against problematic employees. was not provided adequate cleaning equipment or tools.
good,"Poor management, multiple labor laws broken. If you don’t kiss b*^+ you’re more likely to be stagnant and the managers act like kids and make threats  hard pass"
good,"My overview of the company, started with setting up my stations.  Getting all the supplies, and having the setup by 9:00 a.m. My day went about helping where ever needed in Prepared Foods.  The hardest part of my job was moving around and helping in any station that needed in the stations within Prepare Foods."
good,The management at the time was not organized and was sexist towards women. I have heard it has improved since I worked there. They were never fully staffed and never got coverage for call in's.
good,"in general it is not any different than working at other supermarkets, a lot depends on your relationship with management.. the manager I had was a poor choice for the role as she refused to recognize that just because a customer complained that I did not do what they wanted, is not a reason to suspend  me"
good,"Every day was different. I was trained in several departments and often moved around, helping where needed. As a more experienced employee I was given several tasks that I don't believe I was properly compensated for such as scheduling, inventory and tracking waste."
good,"I spent a good amount of time working for them, they started out far more mission based and passionate, when I left they had cut out the soul of the company and are now just a shell of what they once were."
good,"The store itself was pretty nice, near a college. My direct manager had less experience then most others in the department and was not the greatest communicator."
good,Started off good job but then as time went on Upper Management opened too many stores with not enough people to work said stores so they pulled labor to those stores causing not new stores to loose business and have lesser quality and causing them to be bought out by Amazon.
good,Minimum wage job with limited upside potential.  Managers don't know what they are doing or how to treat employees.  Many areas of the business are filled with unqualified arrogant managers only interested in improving their own situation.
good,"I liked working for this company but working with and next to thieves, liars and sabotaging backstabbers doesn't fit my profile. The location that I worked at is for depressed teenagers not grown hard working adults."
good,Cut hours.... food was not properly ordered. they started order to shelf program.  Customers always angry when we ran out of popular products. when you approached Mgt with Food safety issues they told me to do what I was hired as and go home. Store Team Leader.
good,"I did not agree to review this company. I don’t feel this is completely confidential and would rather keep my comments to myself. Thank you, stay blessed."
good,"It's fast paced and it's not easy. You need to be prepared to take on picky customers, very annoying management, and a ton of work that other team members should've done."
good,"Whole Foods was a great place to work, even though I worked 12 hour days and weekends (salary) my team still had fun but things have changed. There is no training, you fend for yourself but are held accountable."
good,"Whole Foods is an excellent company to work for. Although, this certain whole foods is unsatisfactory. I am looking to move forward in my opportunity in my career."
good,"The food isn't organic as claimed, I mean how can something be 43% organic, it's just not organic. They also have a sorry excuse for a supervision team, they're clicks and it just makes you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. Also, they wouldn't hire more than half of their own customers, very degrading job."
good,"Turnover at the Global Support offices in Austin is out of control. The culture--which is dictated by the executive team and global VPs--is awful. The poor benefits and under-market pay coupled with the lack of training and advancement opportunities is causing people to leave in droves. Long time employees who see the culture dying and recently hired employees who get in and realize how messed up everything is. Few people with drive and talent are willing to stick around to wait on a leadership team who doesn't (and never will) value the employees and see them instead as a burden to wake up and invest in the people side of the business. And now that Amazon is part of the picture, it's only going to get worse."
good,"Whole Foods Market is concerned only with its image and its revenue, or what the company would like to call its customers. It promotes a culture founded in core values that exist only as a visual indicator of the company's own good will. I believe this to be true of most, if not all of the essential values that the company prides itself on. It is a corporation that cloaks itself as an ambassador of the health foods movement by using natural foods propaganda and aesthetics to draw in its customers and its employees. The only benefit of working here is the high pay, though this often leaves others feeling trapped as workplace advancement opportunities are rare and are often heavily influenced by personal feelings rather than work ethic. I cannot say for sure what is the hardest thing about working here. I am torn between the incredible entitlement the company brews in its customers or the overall incompetence of  store management. Either way, working at Whole Foods Market is better than working fast food, but little better than working at a rich, exclusive, Walmart."
good,There's a lot of favoritism and cut throating taking place at the Memphis and Germantown stores. Even though the manager at the Germantown store is either Haitian or Jamaican there are no African American born citizens in management at either stores. The overall diversity in management at both stores is unequal.
good,Some outstanding people worked here but most were fired. I liked it alot in the beginning until they started letting people go for nothing.
good,"ALMOST every person I encountered in Leadership at the Laguna Niguel store was corrupt. They were either punishing team members for actions/events they themselves were guilty of or playing favoritism. In my department alone, we were being punished for 5-10 minutes of overtime in a pay period when ourteam leader was doing about 20-40 HOURS."
good,"As a manger, i set my own schedule but didnt appreciate the holiday season.  Like most retail sales, the stroe was only closed on Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas.  This made for a terrible work/life balance."
good,No longer has values like before. Too much pressure for one person that already does a 2 person job and they add another persons job on top just because they don’t want to train or say anything to the new people because they might leave
good,"It was an okay job at first. Coworkers are nice, the job is doable (8hr shifts); if you can deal with difficult customers on a constant basis, you'll be fine. Management in my department wouldn't accommodate employees regarding scheduling, wouldn't help out the team if someone called out, obvious favoritism, wouldn't hold coworkers accountable for slacking off, etc. Once Amazon bought WF and min wage increased, leadership saw us as dispensable."
good,Hard to move up and alot of favoritism on who does so but overall a decent place to work. It is hard work and the favoritism and commute makes it harder for people to want to work hard.
good,Good company to work for. I spent 12 years with the company it is much different in every region. I have work in 2 regions and multiple stores in my 12 year career
good,"You will meet kind people there, but you will be worked hard, you will be treated badly, and customers will treat you like a slave and force you to agree with their crazy ideas or they will tell management. You can end up making quite a bit of money in the end but it is super competitive. You needs to be begging for raises and proving you deserve them 24/7 if you want to advance. Usually that means adding more and more and more hours to your week."
good,"Nobody completely knows what they're doing. They pretty much just make it up as they go. If you try to make things more efficient or challenge anyone's Authority people get ticked off instead of taking it as constructive criticism and being better at management, (which you would expect for managers) but everyone is petty patties and only out to serve themselves. They will know you are right but won't tell you to your face and then when everything blows up in their face they act like nobody told them. This has happened several times, I've noticed most managers are inadequate at problem-solving which you would think would be a part of their skill sets... They expect you to problem solve for everything on the spot thats -NOT YOUR JOB-but when you start making too many decisions because they refuse to do their job they get mad. The benefits are nice and the pay is pretty decent but the job is very stressful when you work with several incompetent people you're basically doing the jobs with multiple people but when it comes time for promotion they give it to the person who does the least work."
good,"The name is big, but not the store culture. Exaggerated, pay is good, but management is bad, a lot of people call off, rude customers, discount not often prime is better. Some departments overworked like bakery and prep."
good,Fast paced and competitive work place. Definitely not for the weak. They have a lot of code for fresh produce; both organic and conventional which they ezpext you to learn in an unrealistic time frame. Register scales are sensitive but the clientele is mostly pleasant
good,". Monotonous"
good,"It was a good company to work for. Enough employees scheduled for morning , mid and night shift . They have a strict policy with people punching in late , and after 3 tardy, results to termination."
good,"either worked extremely early or late, fast paced environment with pressure from corporate makes for stressful responsibility. Its tough to get a full time spot that includes benefits/ decent schedule"
good,This company suffers from not living up to its own ideas and promises to employees. Local managers are poor and don’t allow progress or fairness. They should not promise things they do not follow through on.
good,The company is good. The management and decisions are not. They don’t really care about helping you or help you progress in the company either. It’s one man for their own.
good,"Management isn't always what you think it seems. A lot of favoritism and unprofessional at talking about ones personal business."
good,"I was with the company for almost 10 years and then I got sick and after some leave time I was asked to resign due to my inability to be reliable and complete my shift and attend scheduled shifts. I truly believed that I gave that place a huge part of my life and when it came down to it, I was just another number and replaceable and it really hurt for a long time. Since I have moved on to greener pastures but I still wish I was still there in some regard and had the amazing benefits they offered full timers."
good,"I worked there for 7 years and witnessed many many changes with the company.  At the end of it, I met beautiful people and learned much information, but  could no longer comfortably or happily do my job as cashier. It became incredibly unfullfilling and boring for me.  Also, tried to move around to other positions but never the less hit walls.  I felt trapped.  Standing at a cash register for eight hours a day, ringing up groceries and talking with people, simultaneously bagging said groceries sometimes nonstop for at least two hours constant got draining. pushing carts was good excercise.  Communication was everything in this job, but became redundant.  And i felt that my passions were getting me no where with the company or even at the store level.  At the same time, I learned very valuable product information, the importance of communication, social skills,and putting out positive energy into the world.  I would not recommend it to just anyone."
good,"After a year and a half of working, I no longer see myself growing there. I have a tremendous amount of respect for the people that I work with but the work hours and low wages and drastic culture change have made me realize that I can pursue better for myself."
good,Honestly the company as a whole is great place not much advancement a'lot of favorites makes it hard to advance. Managment sucks in the seafood dept..
good,"every department is team oriented. You have to be a team player to make it in this setting. Inventory every month is the worst part of the job, long day counting every single item in the store."
good,"Cut off the tops and bottoms of different vegetables everyday so they look fresh. Re-stock packaged produce and take out the outdated stuff for donations. Rush, rush, rush."
good,"if your late within a few minutes than you are recorded for that. even for an interview. if its 2-3 minutes late, you wont be able to get the food. the food there is good and some of the regular employees but upper management follow guidelines like there is no tomorrow and you could be there one week and the next week your gone"
good,"Work is stressful, Management puts more pressure, Everything has to be recorded on paper or digitally, and limited employees. The environment is good, people are friendly."
good,supervisors had their favorites. treated us like slaves. always let the customer get away with everything. very slick with how rude they were. make you work back with the customer after they let them disrespect you.
good,"Enjoyed working there. Fast paced environment with food both hot and cold. Picking up slack from other workers not being productive, which makes the department look bad. Had their favorites. Not much room for advancement."
good,"no recognition and encouragement to go above and beyond."
good,It isn't a terrible job however be prepared.  Very low ceiling as far as advancement and very often you are found without the things you need to complete the job.  They are also no the most flexible as far as schedule.  When I was hired i told them i could only work nights because i have issues sleeping.  However I was thrown into mornings and told to figure it out or get fired when I was switched to mornings.
good,"came in on my days off, worked nights and mornings back to back with 2-3 hours of sleep between shifts, management was promoted based on friendships not performance, whole foods was a mess. They care VERY little for the employees, only priority is shareholders making profits."
good,Overall working here isnt bad. It was just the store I worked at that was terrible. It was known as the ghetto store. I would not recommend working at that location but the company itself is okay.
good,I was lied to daily about schedules and required to come in a half hour earlier then everyone else. After two years i made $12.50 an hour. Very gay friendly not so much for blacks though.
good,"Whole Foods is a company that wants to be liked. They come off as very ""giving"" and ""understanding"" and ""easy going"", but it is very difficult to move through a company with so many easy going people. I would describe it as elementary. Not professional, thats for sure. No free coffee, shift lunch, just a membership into their expensive club that is all a gimmick."
good,"can be a hectic day on weekends which is your money maker and habe down time after holidays can be very slow and not high paying when those months come. great summer and holiday job good for sassy students and young achievers,"
good,Customers are great. Great location. Good benefits  No work life balance. No set schedule. Pay isn't great. Feel like a number and not appreciated for my work. Physically demanding.
good,"Cut Meat"
good,"The strong community at whole foods market sometimes blurs the line between home life and work. I strongly recommend it for outgoing individuals who enjoy niche diets or alternative lifestyles."
good,"this is just a survival job"
good,I think if the management of my particular store was a little better at handling situations I would’ve stayed. My goal was to try and make a career out of it
good,"Not my cup of tea. The company culture was ok but just was not a good fit. Scheduled all over the place, never had a proper weekend. Work and life balance was off, made me look for other options."
good,The balance between work life and personal life is not very good the management makes a very impossible for you to advance in your job and the hours are very hard to manage
good,"The location I was in Yorkville was chaos. I mean, the team leader in Prepared Food Department was totally disorganized, and the team members were bullying each other almost everyday. No respect to each other. The wages I got was fair and the benefits as well. But the workplace attitude was so poor that so unprofessional and ignorant. Prepared Food Service Department was the bad department in all departments at Whole Foods in Yorkville location. The team leader always tell me that, ""I don't believe in RESPECT"" to each other, you have to deserved to be respected. I don't know what she mean by that. In this case I loss a respect to her too. She doesn't care, she just thinking of money. She said, in our huddles sometimes, its good working in Whole Foods it pays the mortgage. That's a bad attitude whatever call it. It throws me out, that's personal, keep it to yourself. I was so disappointed to this Prepared Food Department team leader and some or few team members because they were bullies. The team leader keep hiring and the team members keep quitting because its hard emotionally working there. There's no control of emotion, not to mention the job also physical so when emotional and physical job combined it kills the person, so they quit. But many employees stays because they were afraid if they cannot find a job. They just work for money, no learning involve. No promotions, you are stuck in one place forever if you just think of the wages."
good,the job is fairly easy yet communication was not at its best. There was many flaws when considering management scheduling appropiate times to fit your schedule.
good,"My direct supervisor lacked experienced and had a power trip. Very poor leadership skills.The pay was fair. When hired i was told i was a department manager, but i was just a shift supervisor. Instead of leading a team I was telling the team to go on break thats it. if I wanted to go above and beyond outside my role to make the department function smoothly i had to ask every time. i couldn't make my own decisions. I was often talked down to and told ""thats not your job"" The ATL was very rude. Terrible leadership."
good,"very corporate, the company and higher ups only care about how things look on paper vs actual issues being solved.  Training was minimal, just put people to work and let them figure things out without guidance."
good,Whole Foods is a great environment to work in however I don’t believe management is at the level it should be. Managers need more trading especially if they are going to carry the role of “leardership”
good,It's an Ok job for the pay. The front end never had cashiers. The seafood department had no management. The work is physically exhausting and stressful. The pay is good. The coworkers are Ok. The store is dirty. Mice running around the back room areas. Lots of gossip. The dishwashers aren't great.
good,"Meh, wasnt the best place, some managers were rude and constantly on you about small things"
good,"Okay place to work, with good benefits and discount on their products. Good place to learn about food. Steady paced work environment. Big company that got bigger."
good,"It seems that there are a few types of employees at this particular location:  The higher ups who have no care, concern, or consideration for the human employees who work for them;  the more middle-management positions who are overworked and 100% always looking for somewhere else to work (be it at Whole Foods or elsewhere.) and then the more entry-level positions who are either stressed out because they care about their careers and job performance or so lazy/young that they don't care and seem to get along fine (for a limited time.)"
good,They promote friends first.   They also tend to not promote the 40+ age group.   I personally was passed over for promotions on multiple occasions and the people that filled the positions didn't meet the required prerequisites for the job offered.   I have over 30 years experience in the grocery industry.   My last attempt at applying for a position I was told that I was the only person that applied for the job and they were going to repost the position because they didn't receive any qualified applicants.   I didn't apply for the job until the 2nd posting of this particular position.  I left the company before the third posting was published.
good,"Whole foods market was a great place to work. There pay is low and ask expect too much from you. Manager act like they own the store, and every year they cut more benefits."
good,There was a high turnover rate at our location. I believe this is because of poor management and lack of incentives for those who actually stayed more than 6 months. The salary rates were decent but did not help the work environment.
good,The only thing I could say was positive was getting the discount and random samples in the break room almost daily. Management was poor and there was no opportunity for advancement. Starting wages were very considering the amount of work and company revenue.
good,Not sure how different the company is now that Amazon has taken over. When I was there the company was laying off what seemed to be everyone. Hopefully its stabilized
good,i wouldnt reccommend working at a whole foods in denver for the fact of lack of management. this place is like working in self rightous palace full of hippy scents.
good,"things I experienced  over in Somerville store,"
good,"The company was not pleasing investors. So, they became more stressed and strict. They use to have a variety of team bonding events and everyone was together. However, it just went downhill from there and people were unhappy."
good,"My time with the company was short-lived, but it was fun, I met a lot of awesome people and learned about lots of new products. Lunch could have been longer."
good,"Whole Foods used to be a decent company to work for, but over the 5 years I worked there it lost a lot of what used to make it unique and a good place to work."
good,Whole Foods lays off jobs with no regard for employees. Management is disconnected from the life of employees in the stores. Culture is preached but not practiced .
good,"Depending on leadership and location it can be a great place to work with plenty of room for advancement and pay. I didnt have a good department manager and despite the fact that I out performed senior workers in the grocery departments as well as trained and help improve productivity in new team members. My manager would only promote friends and for that reason my growth was limited, but as I stated before it's a great company but it all depends on location and leadership."
good,"Let me begin, the Annapolis location was a terrible place to work. Needs to revamp the entire store, new management is needed for all departments. Extremely high turn-over ratio, especially the customer service department. You can be sick in the hospital and it still counts as a absence on your record."
good,"It changed a lot in the 8 years i was employed there. Whole foods is owned by Amazon now, it was time to make a change and try something new. Training program was great."
good,"Job security is tentative at best. Every week I was there, at least 1 employee either left or was let go. There was a time when WFM had a high level of employee satisfaction. Those days are long gone."
good,"People will try yo take credit for the work you complete.  "
good,"I worked for Whole Foods in Chicago and loved it. When I moved to St. Paul, I started working at the one on Summit and Snelling. Not a good place to work at all. Very unfair treatment of employees."
good,This company as a whole has no structure and they know this and talk about it in orientation like it’s a good thing you won’t know where your job starts and ends and you will be placed in your job with no guidance or training I see people come and go because of how frustrating this can be.
good,"A grind with no reward. Friendly staff, but bizarre hours and shortages of resource. High turnover rate for staff because of declining working conditions."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal part-time team member during the Holidays therefore my job ended after 90 days as they were cutting back."
good,"The work was hard and fulfilling, often worked overtime to benefit the team. We all took pride in our work."
good,"In a nutshell: Poorly managed by people with little experience in their area, who moved up my wooing the right people within the company, but unfortunately had no training to get them in a place where they were qualified and prepared for more responsibility. Blind leading the blind with little respect for statistics and concrete measurement of success. MAIN ISSUE: NO CLEAR VISION."
good,"Interesting place to work, l have learned a lot from working there. Meet interesting people from employees to customers in community. Great sales and employee discounts."
good,"whole foods was an awesome place to work. Great benefits once you make it to full time dental ,health and 401k. Great people I met wonderful people there who i consider friends now."
good,"Show up, get acquainted and figure out what you need to do that day. You try to be as attentive as possible to customers and finished your side work and clock out when you're done."
good,life is what you make it. Whole foods can do better as the company continues to grow. Managers are not always on same page. Lack of respect from co-workers and customers.
good,"They are ok. Not great IF you're Part time which is the bulk of most positions in the company. The benefits are 10x more than the Full time staff and you're not allowed to use the company's wellness centers that they promote frequently. Stock options isn't something you are allowed until much later apparently. Moving up can become a chain of broken promises. If you like security, this is a safe bet as long as you are on time and are able to be disingenuous about your feelings in regards to work culture. Your pay won't go up much or at all for years. No matter how hard you try and are told you did well, the pay won't change."
good,They are very quick to fire people. If you have a lot going on in your life-STAY AWAY. Their attendance policy is extremely strict. There's a lot of competition and back stabbing and don't ever tell a customer they're not right.
good,"job became more stressful, as they cut employees and increased impossible work load, while overhiring at the 6 figure income level. employee morale is the lowest it has ever been. "
good,"Coworkers are the best part of working for this company by far... constant turnover in store for different reasons, late hours are draining, low wages"
good,"Customers are nice and the food is good. You can learn healthy habits to maintain a healthy weight and overall a healthy lifestyle. The schedule is flexible, and this is good to balance work/family activities."
good,"some of the Team Leaders don't care about the employees or their well being, or think its not their job to help THEIR team get the work finished!  A Team members health is not a priority.  some Team Leaders act unprofessional. If you are looking to work at Wholefoods I would try the bigger ones like downtown as I have heard that they are not run like this store. This store was very nice when it opened and over the past year it has really started going down hill to work at."
good,"Handale sales daily , registers count daily , invoices issues with vendors, resolved issues with invoices , credits, missing product, PRI t sales daily from store  and more"
good,"This place used to be fantastic to work for. I loved every minute of the job I did, until they got rid of a lot of higher ups and started getting more and more into budgeting people while n increasing work productivity. This place is more like Walmart now than the culture it used to pride itself on. Its unfortunately plummeting in sales because of much a cheaper competition, and everyone felt the bite. Do your job as best to your capabilities. No matter how long you or how hard you worked here for. they give promotions to those whose personality they like."
good,"I worked for Whole Foods Market for over 7 years. The first 4 years of that were great but the company definitely became more ""corporate"" over time, forgoing team member happiness altogether. Opportunities for advancement were few and far between as store leadership picked their favorites to advance."
good,good company needs to improve on quality control. Poor customer service managers are not attentive to employees. They alliw some room for growth depending on how long you've been with the company not based on work ethics.
good,"This is a thinly popularity contest here. You are not only expected to be really great at your job and customer service but you're also expected to curry favor with everybody in your department. In order to keep your job you have to be ""voted in"". So even if you do a great job if everybody in your department doesn't get along with you you can get shoved out and fired."
good,"I worked at this company for many years and unfortunately the company culture changed.  Labor dollars are low and technology is behind, so you're expected to do a lot more with less money."
good,"Whole foods market is a great place to learn key elements to success within the workplace. The culture and people you work with is amazing. Management was unprofessional, and manipulative. Great Company and pay minus Management. Tips for Management would be to engage employees and work side by side with them during training to ensure maximum productivity in workplace."
good,"Flexible work environment and good co-workers. Management is largely unqualified and incompetent, however, and benefits are constantly eroding."
good,"In my opinion ,which was shared with many others, Whole Foods located a successful, local,family supporting buisness to purchase. Steamrolled into town and in less than 2 years was the root cause of disruption and turmoil of over 20 families-(Marriges-shattered,Families broken apart,Friendships-never to be regained)   This all to change a health food store into a a teeny bopper ,workers should---Oh,no wait Will have an""ATTITUDE OF GRATITUTDE'' As I said at first in my opinion was an injustice to all of us."
good,I've been working for this company awhile & it use to be a very fun place to work but it sucks no & management only care about themselves
good,"Whole Foods Market is not the worst place to work but it is far from the best. The good parts are the employee discounts, the pay, and the co-workers. Everything else leaves much to be desired. The management changes so often that it is hard to know who to speak with when you have a problem. Advancement is limited to positions that they are constantly changing or eliminating and job security... well there is none. The turnover rate is extremely high but you can only see that if you are working there."
good,"I am thankful. Let me say I appreciate any experience in my life. The Fresh Market taught me a lot of things that made me who I am today. I was promoted quickly. They seen leadership qualities in me and made me a Front End Assistant manger. I learn how to run a successful customer service team to keep my company reputation at it's highest standards. I enjoyed building customer relationships with the customers. It confirmed and seal the deal that their experience was memorable. It was always a goal together, "" One store, One Team!"""
good,"You punch in do your work and leave.Management shows favoritism, alot of co-workers are High!!! There is no dress code."
good,A typical day at work was to prepare money for customer service and making the deposit for the bank to pick up. I have learned that never trust leadership because they can stab you in the back. I loved my co workers. they were always friendly and out going and always enjoy what they did spite what was going on with the store
good,".Assists customers with produce choices"
good,"Good place to work for quick money with decent benfits,great team chance to move up in company. The customer's at this site can be very nasty and hard to deal with."
good,It is a wonderful store to shop at. Not very diverse in culture. They like their employees one way. They don't accept vibrant personalities.
good,"Working for Whole Foods Market was suppose to be a job but it turned into a career. I never thought I would stay for as long as I did. I opened 5 stores, trained hundreds of team members and hired hundreds more. Looking back from I first started in 2011, WFM is no longer fun. They have really lost their sense of culture and you can see it in the team member morale."
good,"Even while the NE region supposedly reports the highest profits - it keeps staff levels low* and shows a lack of capable, seasoned management individuals to equal the needs of the number of stores this company runs & aims to open. "
good,"all my days are the same i go to work open or close sometimes im in between those hours.i learned to better follow directions self closure and people skills. management i didnt really liked but who likes their boss anyways. co-workers are fine once yu passed the first month. the hardest part when its a Saturday, holiday, and rush hour. the best part about the job is the gain sharing you get at the end of the month"
good,"my morning starts with checking what needs to be done for cleaning bathrooms etc. "
good,Whole foods is like no other.
good,"A typical day was restocking selves and talking with customers, i learned cash handling,stocking and taking inventory,and general basic skills, my manager were kind and friendly,even my coworkers were great"
good,"While I have been glad to be working in a position that allows me to draw and paint instead of being a desk jockey, the amount of work and the timeframe in which my coworkers and I are expected to complete it is absurd. It's probably just the store I work in, but I truly believe that we are undercompensated and mis-managed; the store manager zeros in on frivolous, time-wasting projects instead of creative ways to drive sales. The signmakers are held accountable for things that aren't requested by the department heads; i.e., we are criticized for not signing a display that was built without our knowledge, even though the department knew what and when they were building it, and didn't communicate it. Overall, a frustrating and taxing job. Certainly not what I expected when I accepted the offer."
good,"Quick pace, Temporary position, they will let you go with no previous notice. Job was not so hard but not a secure position. Environment was good, Co-workers friendly"
good,After amazon took over management was shelled out to corporate and became a very depressing place to work at. When I started it was a very enjoyable place to work.
good,"At first everyone was helpful but several months down the line it went downhill. Team leaders are on ego trips and were not flexible with time off. More than half of the employees there are Hispanic and some displaying tattoos. Employee parking is limited. You want a good spot, you would have to park on a meter and constantly run out and feed it. Or else, park 3 blocks away. They limit you parking in their structure."
good,Decent company didnt like the management but fellow employees were cool. Customer service was unreasonable and the customer is not always right. The certain location was bad
good,"At least it has that going for it at the moment, doesn't hurt to have the backing of Amazon for job security.  Other than that I've always fallen through the cracks here."
good,"Was totally ignored went bringing work  and food safety issues to management. Hiring practices were slack, they were just throwing bodies in the place just to fill spots."
good,Management at my location provides very little in terms of advancement. Little to no communication provides for a frustrating long term experience. Need to make career intentions clear in the beginning.
good,"Was  not happy. here, too much talking & planing  not enough  get out and do it attitude.   Management  are undevelop  and  afraid to. make. decisions"
good,Whole Foods was a great place to work at for the time being I’ve gained a lot of customers service experience and learnt some new things on my journey there.
good,Whole foods what is the first non-union shop that I had the pleasure I'm working in I had conflict with management well not conflict disagreements with upper management commercial the fact that there was so much upper management too many chiefs not enough Indians
good,The hoops you must jump through to advance is fine for a single person with out children. The better you kiss up the higher chances of advancing not experience.
good,"Don't know how they received such high rating as one of the top employers to work for as the culture is terrible and pay is very low, and hence lots of turnovers."
good,a typical day of work was pretty easy depending on my shift.  I preferred opening because ts quiet. The store gets very loud throughout the day. I learned about organic and conventional food items.
good,"This is a good job to get you through school or while you are looking for other work, but the career opportunities are way over-rated.  I can only speak from the experience I have had in the one store I have worked at, but the place is a circus with a constant revolving door of management."
good,"A stressful environment lacking team morale. I worked there twice, and stopped for the same reasons twice. Multiple times team members were shedding tears"
good,Co-workers made an otherwise monotonous job relatively livable. The management team has some to be desired in regards to scheduling and job dialogues.
good,"Just not enough hours to provide for yourself, let alone to provide for anyone else. You’ll definitely need another job working here part-time, and if you’re lucky you’re team leader favors you enough to work with your schedule."
good,It’s a slow pace environment and if you enjoy doing repetitive work every day then you will enjoy it there. But if you don’t you will hate it and be miserable. Management was rarely around you basically self governed yourself most of the day.
good,It’s fun work select my orders and clean sometimes unload truck it’s easy work the pay is great slow pace work I really miss the job but I pulled to many orders
good,"If you do end up working at Whole Foods, the bosses will act as your friend but that is far from the truth. They are suspicious about everything and they're not going to tell you. I've seen so many people fired for the littlest things. The turn-over of employees was very high. Thats why there is so many open jobs. Plan on working hard and be careful. Not everyone is going to be your friend, even if they act it. I worked there for 14 months and just in prepared foods i have seen 14 different people come and go including management in that area, i mean come and go quickly!! So fair warning..."
good,"HONESTLY working here is only worth it for the wage. It's 15$ for minimum wage and the full time benefits DO slap. But, it's stressful and I typically don't enjoy my time at work. I worked at one store that wasn't great but, it was more relaxed and they gave away free food at the end of the night. But, the store I'm at now has the WORST management and they're SO strict about everything and everyone is miserable. So I guess it just depends on the store itself. Because as we know, every Whole Foods store is different and the only constant is inconsistency."
good,"I like my coworkers a ton but I've seen multiple supervisors come and go even though I've only worked here for a little while. Two of them were fired, or ""relocated"". It's also unbelievably understaffed so there's a ton of people working in multiple departments despite never having applied to do so. A bizarrely demanding job for such little pay."
good,People that work there are nice. some departments are easy and some or challenging. Management are okay but can do better. whole foods is fun when people you like are there.
good,"Overall, I think Whole Foods is a good company that means well. However, the culture is horrible. I have never worked in a place with such fake, hateful people. They ruin it for the good ones. Management fuels the rumor mill by being passive aggressive and letting other members know when issues have been brought up so retaliation is standard. Supervision also does not offer any training or guidance, yet is heavy with criticism. So unprofessional. If one person decides they don't like you for any reason, they can  put your very job in jeopardy over rumors and ""personality"" conflicts. I've never disrespected anyone and have gone above and beyond to help my team members, but after calling an individual out for breaking a rule and sabotaging my ability to perform at my best, I have suffered retaliation by him and my supervisors. I cannot wait to leave. It's a shame. If it weren't for this dishonest culture where those flat out STEALING from the store get promoted while keeping honest workers down, I'd love to work there. But it's just not for me. I left the drama in high school."
good,"I have mixed feelings about Whole Foods, because it isn't the best job out there, but it isn't terrible either."
good,All they care about is the bottom line now. Slowly chipping away at benefits and replacing skilled workers with cheaper workers. No longer focused on organic integrity and selling the best.
good,"Since Amazon bought Whole Foods there were a lot of changes. And from what I can tell most of them were for the better such as the pay raise to $15 an hour. However, at the particular store I worked at the management stye seemed very cutthroat and corporate. I went from full-time to working once a week without any notice. I love Whole Foods but I need more hours."
good,"Wasn't special. Didn't have any real draws except discounted food to the point you can almost afford to shop there. "
good,WFM is going through a lot of changes right now; some good but a lot that is seen as bad. They are so hung up on preserving the culture  that they can't see the issues it had to begin with.
good,The job was okay. The management made the job more difficult than it needed to be. Favoritism was at an all time high. The customers were sometimes a handful as well.
good,"There is a lot of favoritism at my store. Those who do their jobs get yelled at when we turn around and talk to each other for a minute. However there are works there that just stand there and do nothing, and they don't get in trouble, also their works that are suppose to be doing instacart but they actually do nothing or they are taking with the supervisors, and nothing happens to them."
good,Hires staff with a false message of making employees and community its priorities but Whole Foods really only cares about the bottom line and quarterly figures.
good,Its been soo long I worked there I can't remember much. I do know while I was there the pay should've been better and career advancement just I feel wasn't an option for me.
good,"it's bad enough that people complain about a dish washer making noise doing his job, but i get anxiety from a head cook, bad management.  I took pride in working hard for whole foods.  I still would if I worked there.  Just like the pride I had for working for the US Navy, even though dish washing is 1,000x more work than a personal specialist. "
good,"It’s a good company to work for but it has changed through the years and there isn’t much future on growth, the core values aren’t as important as they use to be"
good,I went to whole foods in hopes to be a manager. I was skipped up multiple times. The hourly rate could have been better and the management wasn't to effectient
good,"A typical work day is like you clock in go to your assign register and start ringing up customers in a polite manner. I learned have goof customer service. Management was okay but sometimes the supervisors would forget to let you out on time. It's a good workplace culture just don't let yourself be taken advantage of, work the hours you want to work you don't always have to say yes to covering someone elses shift you have a life too. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes they had you go collect karts in the cold. Most enjoyable part of the job is just knowing you made somebody elses day more enjoyable."
good,Good place to work as a college student but no advancement opportunities Had to go to another company to get the opportunity I was looking for but good place to work thank this place for the 4 years I was there for
good,If you like being lied to and being expected to lie and stab each other in the back over tiny promotions that don't pay enough to justify their responsibility and ultimately place you in situations where other employees that you have absolutely no authority over can get you written up constantly and ultimately fired then you've found your home. Also I've never had so many managers that were clearly incapable of understanding the overall retail strategy the company was going for. Probably because they were head hunted out of walmart and target and didn't even remotely do the same thing that we were trying to do at whole foods. But that doesn't matter because they gave up trying to really be organic years ago.
good,"Working at Whole Foods does NOT provide a living wage in cities such as San Francisco. Many people had second jobs."
good,"When they hired me on they said they could give me off the days I needed. Over the few months of me working there I rarely got those days off. When I did it wasn't on purpose. I constantly followed up, even tried working with them to change my days off to suit them better. This ended up getting me fired."
good,No comment. I choose not to comment. I did not have a good experience during the last year an a half of my employment. The company started changing long before it was sold to another company.
good,"Met a lot of great people at Whole Foods, unfortunately, a few rotten apples spoil the whole bunch. 7 years there and they change the rules on a daily basis. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't."
good,"I left WFM right before Amazon acquired it. I had been with the company for 7 years and had loved it. Every company goes through changes and that is to be expected. I welcome and was a part of implementing those changes for my team. The downfall came when new management came into the store and started feeding employees conflicting information and expectations. On top of this, unrealistic goals were set up team leadership without any guidance on how to achieve. When asked during a meeting how we were suppose to meet these needs, we were told to ""figure it out."" This did not bode well with most. People began getting fired left and right. I gave my resignation after a coordinator lied directly to my face and to my store leader about me and my actions and had me put on notice. I was forced to sign a document I did not agree to with terms that did not occur. I was devastated the company I invested so much time and love into could change so quickly. I appreciate the opportunity that WFM gave me and the leadership skills i acquired. It could have been a situation of poor leadership/situation I was in, however I know many other stores were put under similar situations as well."
good,The job was mundane and boring. The work consisted of bagging groceries and cleaning. The customers were often demanding and rude. The job reviews consisted of 5-10 pages of questions that focused on self-evaluation. I learned I did not want to work for a company that did not offer advancement.
good,"They have decent benefits and they do pay you on time but overall glad I no longer work there. They don't care about you at all. You have inconsistent hours so if you feel you want another job with this... NOT HAPPENING. They don't work with you as far as your hours. They just don't treat you like a human. If you don't want to work the hours they give you, they will fire you. Only apply if you are dedicated and sworn to them. Only apply if you have nothing but time on your hands. Your hours will be forever inconsistent. The second they hire someone new, your hours will shorten tremendously. I went from no less than 5 days to 3 days a week and the hours shorten for those 3 days."
good,"No a place to work for people with passion and go getter-ness. if you dont drink the kool-aid, you wont be their choice and you wont get an opportunity to advance."
good,I only worked at Whole Foods when I was in between jobs and found the atmosphere to be snobby. The pay and management were lacking and I would not recommend it as a full time or long term position.
good,"managers are very irresponsible and unorganized , lazy, rude , they think training you is just throwing you on a register , this company sucks . THEY WILL FIRE YOU FOR ANYTHING !"
good,It's just the Team leaders and managers that need to practice people skills. Train new workers and not just throw them out there to figure things out for themselves. More smiles on the managers faces because workers are afraid to speak with them.
good,"a typical day at whole foods was busy. customers with extremely high expectations, sometimes rude and management not willing to listen or open to change. they want whatever they can get from you without consideration for your outside life. ultimately it felt like if they couldn't take advantage of you, they would be upset with you. I was there for five years."
good,My experience working at that location was not good.
good,Not a good company to work for and i wouldn't recommend. The food was tasty but expensive. Staff friendly but management not. Met some lovely people though
good,"Very stressful environment ,we come in ever knowing what was going on very poorly managed start at 2:00 am until completion sometimes at 3:30 pm ,very high turnover rate ,people quit daily, they want to much out of certain indivduals"
good,"8 hour day"
good,whole foods had a cool culture that allowed growth in the company if you are willing to move stores and departments.  i enjoyed the discounts the most
good,"Once the stock price crashed, things went downhill pretty quick. Cost of benefits went up, hours got cut, and teams found themselves perpetually understaffed. Things aren't bad enough to run screaming for the exits yet, but I see little hope of improvement without stores going union."
good,Working at WFM has shown me exactly what it looks like when management plays favorites. And they hold you back from advancing if they like how well you do the position you are already doing.
good,"When Amazon bought the company we had predictable concerns about job losses, but were assured that there were NO PLANS for ANY changes. We were told if anything the merger meant greater job security, but less than three months later two stores had shut their doors, leaving dozens of people unemployed just before Christmas. It wasn't necessarily the best place to work anyway- lack of communication was rife and the wages were pitiful- but it was still a job and most of us got along just fine. We all felt horrendously let down by the top brass and even some of those from London who came to ""help"" with the closure made a lot of us feel like we were lesser beings. It just proved that this whole thing about ""business as usual"" under new overlords is a bunch of tripe. They may care about the environment and their third world suppliers but Wholefoods don't give a toss about their own employees."
good,"Most of my co-workers were amazing and I meet a lot of awesome people. The Management was a disgrace, most of the time we did not have things in my department, even if it was common sense to order it. example: it is getting cold out so we should have ordered more warm cups for the coffee bar since people are now ordering warm drinks not cold, also we should have ordered more chocolate since it is winter and many people order hot chocolates in the winter. However, they just gave the excuse that ""oh, we did not realize there was going to be this big increase in sales"", mind you it tourist/holiday season and we are in the middle of time square in NYC. Plus my team leader is a really nice person, it just they surrounds themselves with bad people/assistants. "
good,"Chaotic work environment with a lack of definition to roles and unrealistic expectations. "
good,"The best part about working for WFM were the other team members that I got to work with, I've made lasting friendships with many of the people and a few have become family."
good,Wholefoods Treats the lower employees unfairly.the culture needs to change with a couple of policy changes too.overall it’s good business to work for.
good,"Attendance policy was a bit rough to have to deal with. Having to have a doctors note with a list of my symptoms was embarrassing, hard work, but I had a great team."
good,"Going in to work, you never know what to expect. Some days it goes steady and some days are an absolute meltdown. The good thing is that the people in my department pull their own weight."
good,"Point system, 6 points=termination. Accrued 3 points coming home mid shift to help my fiance with our newborn, 2 points from being sick without a doctors note. Last point for not showing up to an irregular shift scheduled outside of my documented availability."
good,don't make a career of working here.   there is little opportunity for true advancement and will take 10+ years with the company to make a livable salary.
good,"I have been in the food market business for a while so learning and picking up tips on dealing with anger customers was my main focus, what to say and what not to say how to handle the situation and knowing when to asks for help"
good,people you work with is cool but managers will stop at nothing to mess with you im part time 20 i should not be getting 14 hours so management is bad / poor and mediocre at best
good,"Whole Foods was a fun and fast paced environment. Great people, but repetitive tasks.  Unfortunately the pay was not optimal and the hours (often 4am - noon) were fairly miserable."
good,"Fair entry level position with manageable staff and affiliates, where a future in this company is minuscule. Wage does not meet the satisfaction of work environment, customer appreciation, and employee regards of safety and concern."
good,WFM does pay competitively but they do  not provide the proper training and expect team members to do a slew of tedious task that are not in ones job description. They boast about advancement opportunities but it is not an easy company to advance in and sales incentives and bonuses are no longer achievable because most stores have gone down to a one store labor budget. WFM can no longer compete with other grocery stores and instead of lowering prices or finding another way to compete they are taking money and resources away from their workers.
good,Used to be a fantastic company to work for until they became greedy and corporate. A lot of the values they displayed prior with employees are lost. If you like putting on a fake smile everyday and having no spine this jobs for you.
good,It can be very frustrating for anyone from other organizational structures. Not much opportunity for advancement. I was there for a decade and was never promoted.
good,"Good team, felixable but looking for something new. has alot of friendly team members, and some nice supervisors. customers are hard but some are awesome to interact with."
good,"Typical day at work is customer service and the hustle and bustle of a commercial kitchen."
good,I learned a lot working for the company such as different cuts of meat and different types of bread but I felt under appreciated as a worker
good,"This company is out of business, has been for some time. When I worked there it was fine, I wish they would have paid more for the job I did. Again, it's closed and there will be not jobs posted there."
good,"The company has changed and the management has changed with it. Experience is no longer valued- what they're looking for is people who will work for the bottom tier wage. "
good,"I love working for the company because of the people. But as the company goes through a growth phase, it is very clear that the culture of team member happiness is no longer a priority. This is reflected in the many decisions that are being made. It is a shame to see the company lose many employees that have worked there long term."
good,was a job where you got to go to a store and set up base then interact with the surrounding people and get there eed back on the product and have them taking some of there own by the time they left. They alway left happy great time.
good,I received little support from the managers when it was busy or when I felt it necessary to confront coworkers on inappropriate behavior. I hear it is under new management though so I hope the best for all my old friends that currently work there.
good,"It was a great place to work, but is no longer the company I started with. Benefits have been slashed, flexible schedules do not happen, and higher level positions that provided room for advancement are being eliminated."
good,"When I first started at whole foods I loved it! The company, the culture, all of the training and development of team members.  It seems great and wonderful, but unless you throw your personal life away  so you can succeed, and move painfully slow up the corporate ladder , you will never do anything here. Management says that they encourage you to grow and move up thru the company but if you have one  comment or thought that isn't on the same page as management  (such as I can't believe that new policy etc) you might as well quit. I worked there for 7 years and all I tried to do was get ahead and all I got was shot down, told no, and kicked to the curb so many times about speaking up that leaving the company was on par with getting out of an abusive relationship.  I was so glad it was over. So trust me and don't even bother unless you are ready to become the whipping post in this relationship"
good,"Pros: "
good,"It's okay. Some people move up, some people don't. It seems like it runs off of favoritism.The workers, for the most part are cool, but management is awful. Unless you're buddy buddy with them, you won't get far."
good,"Its a job. simple as that. Nothing to rave about. You get out what you put into it and that may cost you holidays, weekends, and time with your family for low pay."
good,"Nice place to work, if you don't want to see your family. Whole foods likes to bounce your shifts around, instead of a set schedule."
good,Working here is one of the best experiences you can have working in a grocery store. As far work goes it is all pretty standard. Each department has it's own leader and Team members and a bit more autonomy in their own respects. Very easy and fun job overall.
good,"This company is great if you are not a student, parent, or have any other responsibilities. They demand you have an open schedule and take all shifts they give you. The management are probably a year or two older than you and have been working for the company for a year longer than you. They have great compensations and benefits and the pay is a lot better than every where else. The hardest part of the job is basically having your life revolve around a schedule. Every week your schedule changes so one week you can have all morning shifts and the next all night shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the work atmosphere."
good,"I DID love Wholefoods. I have several interviews with several supervisors and I was hired. I started work 12/3/14. Every week I received positive feedback from management and team members alike. I helped with anything that I was asked to do. I volunteered for Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, New Year's Day. I had several customers thank me for things like warming a baby bottle or helping them load their car. I loved my job."
good,A day at work was waiting for trucks to arrive then pricing and stocking the products. I learned customer service skills as well as information on health items. Management was very helpful. Co-workers were also nice and helpful.
good,I learned a lot about health food and had a completely new type of clientele to help. It was wonderful.
good,The company ideas and philosophy are excellent but unfortunately like countless utopian ideas before it falls far short in practice.  .
good,"Rude customer and rude management. "
good,"patience"
good,I worked with white team members and management who thought it was funny to make fun of blacks and latino.
good,"General customer service, ordering product and supplies, cleaning."
good,"This is a great company to work for. However they do not care about you as a person. The customer is always right. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. However, whole foods is a good company to work for."
good,"Fast paced and hard work. This place can set you up to learn a trade or even a start a new career if you like. "
good,"It's tough to have a life outside of work and the pay is really low. You will have to work nights, weekends, holidays and you don't know your schedule until the Wednesday before so you can't really plan anything. The benefits are so-so. The 6AM store meetings on Saturdays are a joke."
good,"A typical day at work consists of rude customers, and unfair supervisors. The hardest part about working at Whole Foods is the lunch rush. But what I enjoyed most about my job, is my co-workers!"
good,Company overall is good.
good,"Whole Foods is a place to work. Their have been changing and they often follow the ""Do as I say, Not as I do"" motto more often than not. Needless to say I was very disappointed in the end."
good,"focuses on team member happiness and appreciation, opportunity to grow, tools to succeed when you show promise of interest. high retail standards and customer excellence."
good,"Their motto, if you don't like your job, quit....someone else is waiting to take your place."
good,"I would say that When you get hired for a certain position, expect that you will be doing things well above and beyond your job discription. Expect to mop floors and do 2 hours of cleaning everyday."
good,"I loved my coworkers, disliked my managers. in the beginning, I really enjoyed working there. I though whole foods was going to be a place that i would stay working at for a long time, sadly i was mistaken."
good,"This is my first long term job compared to others and it was amazing at first. The customers were nice, co-workers were fun to talk to, management was easy to talk to . But this seemed to have all changed once Amazon took over- high turnovers, rude customers."
good,This company doesn’t recognize workers who work hard and is looking to advance their careers unless you are their best friend. This company should recognize employees equally.
good,"If you get suckered into working there as long as I have, be fully prepared for the most frustrating and soul sucking job experience you may ever experience."
good,"Worked at a lower volume store, management were not open to ideas from department leadership. Conflicting standards for employees ran abundant. Advancement is nearly impossible unless you work in a metropolitan area."
good,"Benefits are decent. Management varies between departments. People aren't completely appreciated as they should be for the amount of work they do. What I learn is to be patient with customers. The job isn't hard but it is sometimes made difficult when the expectations of management exceeds time available during a shift, when you're expected to do your job well on top of doing other peoples jobs."
good,"Whole foods is great if they think that you're going to make a career of it - unfortunately, it takes a long time to move up the ranks, and starting pay is much to low to actually live on, especially if you're living alone."
good,"I love the mission of the stores and the people I worked with, but it has become very corporate (even before the Amazon takeover), and the magic that once was is no longer.  I still love WFM and it's better than working at most other grocery stores, but it's not what it once was.  "
good,You will get to learn new things and about different departments. Let them know if you don't understand or if it's to much. Try your best to move up even if it's a different store.
good,Management there was not too supportive of the ideas I had for the hit bar. Wanted to bring a good twist with new ideas and it was not supported by staff there.
good,"The Management was fair to horrible. Its a very political job. If you're good with your manager youll have the potential to move up pretty quickly. "
good,"There was a learning curve for the “grocery store terminology.” For me, personally, I felt there was specific favoritism shown within my department which made moral lower among the stronger (more knowledgeable) employees. There has been significant turnover within the last few months, but still no changes."
good,"Whole Foods is a “hit or miss” company. In other words- you either like it or hate it. You work long back to back hours and have to deal with some really rude customers. There’s a ton of strict rules you must follow, and store management can be odd at times. Although they pay higher than most jobs in the area, it’s not really worth it. You won’t be excited to come to work here. Management tries promoting healthy eating to both customers and employees, but the work setting is similar to Rikers IslandsGood luck."
good,I worked there when I was very young. I did not like it much people have favoritism and not alot of opportunity to grow in the company. Management was horrible
good,"Typical day was stocking shelves, finding expired food, and facing shelves. The management at the time was good at first, but became very unstable after one manager left the store."
good,Amazon will kill wholefoods.  It isnt worth the aggravation.  Benefits suck. Its not the same since Amazon took over. Quality is going way down.   People arent happy or proud of working there any more.
good,"I got rehired at whole foods and told the team leader in produce that I can only work night shifts he said he was okay with it but once I got hire he gave me morning shift so of course I will call out because he new I wasn't able to work morning only nights. So he fired me, didn't make sense to me because he new I can only work nights."
good,"I liked my co-workers but the management isn't efficient to me. The managers would use their authority to try to get you to stay at work a little longer, like threaten your job. At one point  they fired 12 people in all departments, I don't know about everyone but the ones that I do know that were fired they were very good workers and just didn't let certain managers bully them."
good,It was pretty okay. The management was iffy. There wasn’t enough communication with the team leaders due to her being gone when most would arrive. And she would play favorites often. And be really rude to the rest of the team.
good,"Wholefoods Market is a great company with great benefits. Typically working on weekdays are rather slow and weekends are extremely busy.  Management is okay, but could be better."
good,the job is very accommodating with hours & they’re very flexible to meet your required schedule. sometimes they give lunch coupons for good work ethic but they can also be very hard on you if you don’t do your job right.
good,"culture has changed, does not represent the core values company was founded on, they do not listen any longer to their people and the struggles that are being in the store"
good,"I mean, lots of customers are terrible, but this is a whole 'nother vibe. I could not wrap my tiny brain around the way customers treated employees. Training was just terrible, and management was lacking in training and abilities."
good,"Whole Foods definitely does not pay well for the work load they put on you. So many leaders who do not help, very stressful, they are not good about making sure you get breaks. They say they care about you but not true. It’s too corporate. The best thing about Whole Foods are your fellow team members. Benefits aren’t as good as they were before Amazon took over."
good,"Good place to work if you have thick skin,and work full time.They start off at 15.00 per hr with more raises after 90 days.Management is the worst I have ever seen,and most employees are lazy with job security because most every body that works there is related to management.Advancement only in grocery department."
good,"The company overall isnt a bad one to work for, there are just poor management skill at the store i work in and minimal room for advancement. Bad scheduling and minimal communication"
good,It was alright. Management was shifty...and my shift lead was crazy. I could feel her walking up behind me! All in all Id appreciate having job still.
good,"Entitled customers who always got their way. "
good,It’s an ok job to have. It’s very demanding but it paid some of the bills. You could have the chance to move up if you are ok spending a little more time at work.
good,it was a really low maintenance job. management is really inconsistent and shows favoritism. hours are usually all over the place. little room for career advancement.
good,I think they are good company to work for and the manager when it comes to the job duties making sure you’re much quick with everything and learning very fast with your hands
good,"I have worked at two different Whole Foods, and while they were much better than other places I had worked before and are a good fit for anyone working retail or food service looking for upward mobility, I got locked into an overly difficult position with unclear expectations and no way to advance."
good,"If you have seen the 2000 film staring Leonardo DiCaprio, this is now how I view Whole Foods."
good,"Whole Foods  HAVE VERY GOOD PRODUCTS, APPEARANCE WELL KEPT AND THEY PLAY MUSIC ON WED., NICE ENTERTAINMENT DOING SHOPPING"
good,"The benefits full time team members are eligible for are great. Full time team members get paid time off that are accrued based on service hours. Health Insurance with United Health care costs about $25 every pay period for the most basic plan. The rest of the cost is covered by the company. 401k, dental and vision coverage are available along with an employer sponsored health care spending account to pay for co-payments, drugs, and deductibles. The company compensates more than the minimum wage. Most people make very decent salaries due to yearly raises and job performance reviews. "
good,"WF does not care about its employees. Depending on the store, the environment may be clique-y and unprofessional. Corporate and HR are NOT on your side. Show up on time, do your job and keep track of your points."
good,"- Late and erratic working hours"
good,"the workload was extremely high, the morning opener for dishwasher duty was not doing his job and was not told to finish his job. Afternoon shifts would be absolutely terrible because the workload of morning shift would have to be done by afternoon shifts at the time."
good,"Store culture and management vary from location to location. I have worked in 2 locations and they hit both ends of the spectrum."
good,"The company on a whole is a great place doing great things.  Downside is it can be like a clique, which effects your ability to move up since team members vote you up to new positions.  Also the schedule is not flexible and was often given out a day before it began, which didn't allow you to make any plans outside of work in advance."
good,"Unfortunately, you have to never make an error once you start or you'll never be forgiven. My manager was unreliable, lazy, and hid away in their office. Things were not handle accordingly and in a timely manner. Had loved working for WFM until the last year. Was quite unpleasant and the turn around in our store was unbelievable. People would quit almost immediately or within 3 months."
good,my time at whole foods was great until new leadership was brought on board as far as upper store management goes. the new team leaders were not very concerned with inner departmental complaints and were not willing to listen to employees. They were also much less approachable than previous store leaders.
good,The job itself is great. Very enjoyable. However the management could use some work and not come across as hard to talk too and too intimidating. Apply if you want.
good,"Check your ego at the door. You'll need to work hard and be content in your role to succeed. Unless you want to put in years and years of service, you won't find many opportunities to advance. Regional/Corporate positions are only available for tenured employees, regardless of background and education. Great place for individuals with other jobs or partners who can support them. Recent pay hike should help, but the loss of any benefits/bonuses might offset the increase."
good,"I was only a dishwasher so therefore I was put in a back corner with very little contact with other people. I was treated like I wasn’t important to others, I was viewed at less because I was a dishwasher."
good,"Food is good and fresh. Good customer service to consumers."
good,Typical day requires to help customers but mostly focuses on order to shelf program and up to date checklists for inspections. Expectations can be met with encouragement for promotion but keeping up to date with constant changing policy can be nauseating.
good,This company is fair. They just need better management in some location. More employees and less stress for the cashiers. Uphold their standards and company will be fine.
good,"Whole Foods has a lot of politics involved for being in the food industry. If you stay on people's good sides, you'll advance quickly. If you question policy, you won't move up at all."
good,"Whole Foods Market was a good entry level job. You had to deal with a lot of customers who were very difficult, and a management team that was not functional. It was a learning experience, but overall, growing with the company is hard to do."
good,"good place to work at if you don't plan on doing much else with your day, fast paced and stressful. usually working short handed it was tough to keep up with demand of customers as well as demands from store leadership. people are super cool and great to work with but stressful environment makes it difficult. compensation is fair and there is a lot of room for moving up if your availability is open for them. Leadership in general needs help.very inconsistent and seem to play favorites"
good,Just very neutral This is the first place I have a work day at college education do not mean anything this job is cater to people live in the wild lifestyle on the other side of the tracks just different
good,"Raises are yearly and nothing above $0.60 unless you get promoted, with positions few and far between. Upper management ignores problems and leaves you to deal with angry, dissatisfied customers on your own and then get upset if its not handled ""properly"" by you. Overall its extremely stressful and and a lot of work placed on you for little compensation for it"
good,"At first working overnights was fun, the co-workers were nice and everyone did their part on the shift but over time I was getting less hours and people who had been hired after me were getting more hours then I was. I couldn't pay my bills on my paychecks and asked for more hours, but was never accommodated no matter how hard I worked. I would even go and front the store, fixing many mistakes I found and was still never given the hours I needed to be able to keep my home."
good,"Whole Foods is an amazing company! He people that work there for the most part are friendly, kind and caring. They have a very specific way of doing things that most other companies do not. The best part they allow you to try and be creative and make you grow, the worst part is the structure is very poor and certain ideas are taken to an extreame. Management are alright to deal with. There is a lot of politics. High turn over as there isn’t enogh training and way too much thrown on employees and management and not enough support. They ask how they can help but then don’t fix things as there is a ton of red tape. They always seems to favour people that have been there long term. Hopefully things get better soon."
good,"In the beginning the company set out strong with a purpose for the people by the people, along the way those values were lost in it's very rapid growth."
good,The people who worked at Whole Foods during my employment were amazing. Their presence is the thing I missed the most about whole foods. The company's policies are what make it controversial.
good,"if u not part of their clique they gonna trying anything to get u fired or to quit"
good,Too corporate don’t support their leaders. So afraid of being sued they support team members more than the leaders. Good benefits but bad politics. Lost sight of what they used to stand for
good,Constant nag like environment; The care for employees is seemingly does not exist in the workplace. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with management that does not have any structure.
good,This location is a decent work environment for those looking to try something new and have nice benefits. They also have plenty of team member appreciation events.
good,I was not too impressed with management.  There was too much micro-managing and not enough employee development.  This type of work environment created lack of motivation and retention.
good,"Typical workday for me is coming in at 6:45 in the morning,  going through my day doing my regular job requirements weather it be helping team members or doing something specifically needed from me.  I will say whole Foods did help me grow as a person and also helped me grow my communication skills talking to management or just talking to our customers  and also with the work that I was doing it taught me how to working on my own and being independent . I wouldn’t have to rely on anyone to watch or over see what I’m doing.  I can say in the beginning management starting off was on a good foot but as time progressed and went along you could tell the difference in the management and what they were doing things and once we got new owners everything did a complete 360. But besides the management with everything they were doing the workplace culture is very very incredible everyone is so nice and everyone is friendly you can get along with anyone there.  The hardest part of the job I would have to say is dealing with any type of holidays, management is in the fritz everyone’s going crazy but other than that that’s probably the worst part of the job is the holidays and also the lack of communication between management and their team members.  I would honestly say the most enjoyable part about working at whole foods for me personally was I got paid well and also I developed quite a bit of good friendships while being there even though things worked out how they did I still enjoyed my time at Whole Foods Market"
good,"A typical day at work was come in get change and do your job it kept me busy throughout the day and lots to do almost every single day. the management could have used a bit more work improvment,"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods Market overall. I think the more they grow the harder it is to maintain the overall mission of the company. There are so many people involved at the top of the ""food chain"" with conflicting visions of where the company is headed, and I think that sort of mentality trickles down."
good,"Whole Foods Market has undergone a rapid change in the past five years that I worked for it.  The in-store staff is usually some of the hardest working people around that come in daily to break their backs making sure customers get the quality products they expect from a high end retailer.  The problem is that management within the company at a regional and corporate level is so inbred with the idea that Whole Foods is unshakably superior to competitors that it watched the market share for organic groceries disappear without changing any sort of policy.  This lead to the Amazon purchase which has been a good thing for customers because Amazon is going to completely change how the grocery industry works.  The problem with this is that the regional and corporate leadership at Whole Foods has no grasp on how these changes will occur, and therefore spend every moment of their day playing catch up with Amazon's changes.  This has lead to confusion and anger with those as the store level of leadership and employment.  On a side note, if someone is willing to deal with the constant changes then advancement is possible within the company because people are quitting all the time."
good,"Good place to work for if your looking for benefits. But i feel as if they take advantage of you. The leadership at wholefoods market in Paramus is no good, for example they say everyone do garbage but every one does not do it."
good,you are def on your own a lot in that environment. It is fast paced and you need to be able to handle customers that are rude. The time goes by fast but sometimes too many things are happening at once.
good,"Come ready to work.Always be ready to learn new tasks.Be ready to fill in when somebody call out.Don t hesitate to ask for help from management.They will find another team member to help u out.Keeping a work place in which there are safe working  conditions."
good,"though the benefits were great, the actual team leaders and many of the staff do not live up to actual company standards. workers all get paid the same for jobs that are not at all equal. management is lazy,  breaks rules and are leaving all work up to everyone else."
good,"I love working here, however being a good working does not mean anything. You can even be a sneaky worker but make it look like your doing all the work and a person like me who is helping the 10 guests on my own are told I look like I am not doing anything!"
good,"Having worked here a long time, I can tell you the culture is changing with the Amazon acquisition. The focus seems to be moving away from quality and more towards mass appeal. The turnover seems to be high and management doesn't seem very knowledgeable."
good,"It was okay, there will always be bad bosses. If you have one just do your job and all should be good. Your fellow employees are fun to be around, don't slack off though."
good,It’s time to get out. The culture of the company is declining rapidly and everyone in the store has low morale. There are no longer enough people to work effectively and new things are added constantly
good,Not the company it used to be. Came back hoping to move up but there has been no development to get me there. I already have the experience but nothing has been done to get me to where I want to be.
good,"Management used to be the creative drive for the company.  No longer. You are just a clipboard commander who is responsible for every little detail and under-achieving team member.  One mistake or day off can lead to corrective action and a daily stress filled day.  Customers are demanding, more than any other place I have ever been.  With 8 years under my belt I feel like I could be fired any day and that stress effects my home life.  My left eye won't stop twitching.  My bosses are terrified of losing their HUGE salaries so they blame any problems on us store level folks.  It's unbearable."
good,"Love the people and customers! Management needs to work on it, I think if they redirected their stress team memebers wouldn’t quit. Hopefully they step it up. Great company otherwise!"
good,"Ordering merchandise everyday, supervising staff of job performance and strong customer service. inventory control. Rotation is a must, everyday. Productivity, coiling the department 3 times a day"
good,Initially a good company culture.  Prior to Amazon buyout labor forces changed making team member morale and food quality decreased. I enjoyed customer relationships.
good,"did not care about employee's schedules, draconian attendance policy, cleanliness in store was top notch and all of my coworkers were very nice, but unfortunately work life balance was terrible"
good,"its a nice place for advancement if you can just tolerate the snobby  customers literally opening bags of food after purchasing it in front of you, eating a hand full of the product then saying they don't want it without Anything explanation other than that; and you having to grin and bear giving them what they want."
good,"Good company taken in a poor direction. Store has great management and opportunity to move up at own pace, employee moral has gone down, overall a good place to learn and get experience."
good,"I would say that if you worked for Whole Foods 15 years ago, it was the place to work. It is now a company in flux with the purchase by Amazon, the culture that was there is slowly disappearing. There is a push to reduce costs and most of that is put on the shoulders of the employees by reducing the number of employees to do the same job that it took two or even three people to accomplish. That is the hardest part of working at Whole Foods. The best part are the customers that come in regularly. That is like family coming in every day and it is very rewarding to help them find what they need and to suggest alternatives. As with many companies in the valley, their pay scales need to improve. A regular employee does not make a living wage and to get to a wage that would support a family, you need to get into a management position. Benefits are still slightly better than most retail chains."
good,Whole Foods has changed a lot over the years. It was a really fun place to work and I was taught a lot. Really awesome people that work there. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all of the customers and not getting any support from leadership.
good,ok.. very busy................................fun.... the breaks were very good . they give you extra time to buy your food and eat it....you get bonus.
good,"Cashiering, balancing cash draw, greeting and help customers find items in the store.Wanted to learn more but was really given a fair opportunity. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"Show interest in the store,as a whole.Remain focused and positive in your position.Be willing to put in extra time and effort,to be noticed.You must seek Supervisor opinions,and permission to share few moments,ask for specific reasons for answers to your questions.Try to find resolution, information about subjects that are discussed and build rapports amoungst other managers,shiftys,section leaders.Always know what codes and prices products are,be first to catch ANYTHING that is NOT in main system, bringing it to the Store Manager attention.Make sure to give customers your FULL attention no matter whats going on around you,and you're GOLD.Do not stand out too much,always be on time if you can afford to stay employed w/company longterm express only positive feelings, impression about any subject especially co workers,even if they leave,they may return and any good work,no matter how many years of,or how many excellent thanks will be all forgot.Stay driven,stay cool!"
good,"On a typical work day as a cashier, the thing I look forward to the most would have to be interacting with my customers. They are truly why I continue to go to work. The opportunity to create relationships here is very rewarding. "
good,A typical day in the life of working as a Customer Service Representative was a beautiful thing. I always had a positive attitude. Always looked forward to the conversation and the knowledge we would exchange
good,"This job was just not for me, but it was nice to have a 20% discount. The management wasn't very organized, but people were friendly and Whole Foods carefully coaches and trains their managers in communicating and dealing fairly with other team memers."
good,Great pay for the industry. Benefits are very good but there is no company match for 401k contributions. In come metro areas there is not much room for advancement due to less positions being available.
good,"If you're looking for a place with good communication skills, this is not it. MY coworkers were lovely but when we were in need of help from the big guys they were never to be found. The department Leads were catty and immature. Always an unbalanced customer to employee ratio. Always overwhelmed. 2 baristas is not enough to handle a line to the door at peak times."
good,"Dependent on who you work for.   Very much a ""who you know"" culture.  There is favoritism and also a ""man's club"" attitude towards women.  Most of the people are amazing to work with."
good,"There's a club at Whole Foods Market , and if you're not in it , expect life there to be frustrating. You will have to work harder than others , and management will play hardball with you .The schedule is constantly changing , breaks are short , one for 30 minutes , the other for 15 minutes. No Christmas Party. The locker room is small and overcrowded , You have to write an essay to be considered for a raise. The 20% discount is good , sometimes we get lunch coupons for going above & beyond ,401k and benefits are decent ."
good,"The Brooklyn store is very busy, multi cultural, the staff is great, the customers is great, I was going to school so they worked well around my schedule."
good,"At first this was a fantastic place to work as you get at least 40 hrs a week and a pay rate off the bat of $11.50, which is a pretty penny, and you felt good as you thought you were working for an excellent company. However, the company itself has a lot of discriminatory issues and they never address them and always favor seniority versus anything you may say. With an ever changing work schedule and working 8hrs (At least) every day you have no work life balance with this job and is very physically strenuous. Not at all an accommodating place."
good,"I would absolutely recommend whole foods as a stepping stone type of job. You need to pay the bills while you're in school? This is a great place to work. You need to supplement your income with an extra side-job? This is a great job."
good,"Awful health benefits. Great if you never get sick or have any health problems. Pay 1$5-20 per paycheck but your deductible is just under $4,000. So until that deductible is met you will pay up to that out of pocket every year. "
good,"Mostly friendly coworkers but it is a customer service job with many high maintenance and entitled customers that do not want their ""premium dollars"" wasted on anything less than that, Whole Foods is still the best grocery store around compared to the other big grocers."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co-workers. Most of our customers were a pleasure to deal with but there were on occasion a few nasty customers.  "
good,"Company culture seemed to be favorable towards a certain working culture within the location I worked. I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever work there again."
good,"Whole Foods Market itself appears to be a nice place to work. Unfortunately, with Amazon purchasing the company, many changes are being made that are altering the image once presented. A typical day at work is now very strict, with management breathing down everyone's necks at a constant rate. The hardest part of the job is adapting to the strict changes that stress out all of the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers about products."
good,"When I first started at WFM, I loved the job and the people.  However, a lot of that has changed over the past 17 years.  I still love the people, I came to dislike the job, more importantly, the management style that is taking over the company."
good,"In comparison to other retail jobs/grocery stores, Whole Foods was great. But as time goes on, you move up, and gain more responsibility, that wonder begins to fade. They seem to have forgotten their core value, ""Team Member happiness and excellence."""
good,"It felt a lot like school. Constant quizzing. You have to know so much. The hours are crazy. There are so many rules. You are constantly being told what to do, and not in a directive type of way, but a babying type of way. Everyone is working 30 hours a week. All. The. Time. You're graded on multiple things a day. Management tends to lecture you over things that other businesses wouldn't think twice about. I could never get over the fact that we had to ask for water and to use the restroom. The breaks are very short as well. They watch you like crazy. Coworkers are awesome, the pay is good, but the management is so poor that it clouds the best parts of the job."
good,"Nice area and nice place to work but management made things difficult, resulting in uneven or unfair scheduling. Not the most organized leaders when asked to remember or listen to ideas."
good,Very high school drama atmosphere. Gossips & cattiness out of control. Can't trust upper management. Won't move up if they don't like you period. Harassment out of control.
good,"if you go into this market thinking you'll easily advance that is not the case, the managers are still corporate and messy. Coworkers can be slackers and as long as you put in years you will be given slack which it bad for go getters."
good,Most of the people you work with are genuinely great people. Most of the people you serve are genuinely terrible and/or idiotic. This place will make you lose whatever faith in humanity you had left.
good,"Organization is a challenge for the Prepared foods department at Stevens Cree, Cupertino store.   The kitchens could use more professional direction and management."
good,"I enjoy working for this Retail Company.  Diverse culture, Friendly team leaders, and members. Felixable schedule availability. Open door environment, supportive team lead, and HR team.  Good team member discount overall friendly safe and conducive atmosphere"
good,"The gist of my experience here was just below average. The people promoted to leadership roles weren't trained properly to do their jobs. And this simple fact always affects the department financially. All you have to do is be known by the higher ups and you can advance. This whole ""one team, one dream"" is pushed but not supported."
good,"Decent benefits ans better wages than most grocery stores, but still not enough to live comfortably unless you are management.  They really push company culture and standards.  Most of this probably wont be relevent much longer since they were bought out anyway."
good,The Pizza department was very fast paced especially on the weekend.  It was usually a two person operation and we were often stretched to the limits of our capabilities.  You make pizza after pizza by tossing dough and using a pizza peel and have free range to create and try any type of pizza you can think of.  The most enjoyable part of the job was tossing the pizza dough and creating signature pizzas.
good,Depending on how much experience you have in retail grocery definitely will affect your journey with this company. Not very many advancement opportunities.
good,"Always a good time at work. What I have learned here is Leadership skills, interpersonal skills, buying skills. The hardest part of the job is hearing one thing from your store leadership and then hearing something different from your regional leadership."
good,Good for short term employment. Not a company you could easily move up in. Depends on the management you fall under. Wonderful place to expand your customer service capabilities.
good,"There's a chance you'll get a raise. Don't expect advancements. Even if you've been there forever. Also, don't think you'll get the schedule you want without a fight. Other than that, once a year, you get a chance for a higher discount. That's cool I guess."
good,"Whole Foods market as a company is a good place to work, the work environment is nice and the guest are good as well. Unfortunately Wholefoods does not hold their team leaders as accountable as they should resulting in poor experiences for other team members"
good,"Whole Foods is probably the cream of the crop with retail. Everyone is pretty laid back depending on the location you're working at, but there isn't much room for growth."
good,Hard working person and honesty and respect other .I am always on time good customer services and front end . I am a  good person  I learn so much at whole food .
good,Management was poor and everyone was very uptight for working at a grocery store. Prepared foods area is a very strenuous department that doesn't care for workers talking and just focusing at the job at hand.
good,"I would work tirelessly to keep up with my team leaders and complete their tasks and requests without any backtalk and to the best of my abilities. However, they would keep asking new tasks and expect me to perform without any training or tools to be able to get the job done. Very sub-par management and put unnecessary stress on the team members! "
good,"whole foods is great for the hourly pay and gainsharing, however, their management is sub-par and unable to take criticism. did not respect the opinions of employees and not open to seriously address morale issues."
good,"Before WF went super corporate they were really about their team members. Felt like I was working at Von's all over again. Team members are great, hard working individuals that make up for lazy management."
good,"Coworkers are awesome. "
good,"When I first started working with the Whole Foods Market team I was welcomed with a such a warm sense of unity and family environment, I was estatic to be getting started. During the months of working there which were great slowly turned into something different"
good,A typical day at work was clocking in and making  sure all customers came and left with a smile on their face . I enjoyed the time their. Made sure everything was put where it goes. I didnt move on to the next task until everything was clean. The hardest part of the job was making the sandwiches because they were signature sandwiches.
good,The company says it shows appreciation for its employees but it doesn't. You can definitely get lost in the sea of employees. The benefits were good.
good,I have worked with this company for almost three years and have not gotten to where I would like to be. I find the management to be rather ineffective and not very helpful when dealing with work-related issues.
good,"I only worked there for 2 months, however it seemed like it was a good place for me to work over the summer. I got good hours weekly and there was a lot of flexibility"
good,". Would not recommend. Low wages, ok benefits, bad raises, lots of hey can you do this for me/ work sliding downhill moments. Pay was bad and opportunities for advancement worse."
good,they sell you a dream during orientation and new hire paperwork and you quickly realize that its a very office politics oriented company and hard to move up in.
good,This is a great place to work if your in school or just need to supplement your income.i would have loved to make this my carrer but thier are people who have been their for a while so advancement is not good thier
good,Its has great health benefits and great team work. The companys care for the employers. I really enjoy work for the company.
good,It is hard to advance when there is severe nepotism within regions or specific stores.  You can be very successful for years and then work for a team leader who doesn't like you and they push you out
good,"I enjoy working with the teams but, the culture of the company is changing and it's not the place it used to be. Some changes are good and others need more work."
good,very high turn-over especially in certain departments. Change of policy makes this company less employer friendly. when i first started it was more employee friendly.
good,"Shifts would change from deli, to salad bar, to pizza cook, dishwasher, cook, burrito attendant. Hardest part of the job were the closing duties and dealing with the terrible management. The most enjoyable part of working there was the coworkers. They're attitudes are mostly what made it tollerable. The scheduling was always changing. Day off requests would not be honored, especially if plenty of notice was given. Management would not do their jobs and play favorites."
good,"Dealing with the general public was mostly a pleasant experience, which is always nice!  I met some really nice coworkers that have become friends."
good,"""Insecurely"" run location of Whole Foods Market, for lack of a better way to describe it. The influences of the overall Whole Foods corporate culture are employee friendly, but this location milks its employees all it can. Limited advancement opportunities following company-wide restructuring."
good,Its ok to work if you need a check. dont expect all that green save the world stuff to be actually a thing...the company is definitely full of shi% when it comes to actually practice what is preaches lots of food education and you learn a lot though
good,I have learned a lot int his food industry however their managerial skills sucks. They do not communicate and they also do not have work ethics.
good,"Ridgewood itself was a poorly managed location and is notorious throughout the area because of that. Whole Foods Market itself is a wonderful company to work for and they will provide you with many opportunities for personal growth. Foody, vegan or not you'll end up learning something new in your day to day operations whether you asked for it or not."
good,"Whiny customers (though I was close to a rich neighbor so, that could've contributed to the high demand), terrible upper management, always gives customers everything they want for free, have to deal with constant stress. Team is your best support; I had amazing coworkers in every department. Learned a lot about health and natural/organic foods and products (which I'm naturally passionate about and the whole reason why I wanted to join the team). Up to 30% discount, starts at 20% - really nice, but don't spend whole paycheck on groceries, you will want to."
good,"Fun place to work, Family ordinated company, but not many positions to move up in company. I learned hoe to process refunds, count safe daily, and supervise team members"
good,come in load cart go check washrooms restock what is needed. clean outside around building and parking lot. check all departments restock towels soap. what I learned is how one must plan for the day. greet all coworker and customers  with a smile. hard part of the job running out of stock.
good,A typical workday at whole foods is very busy. the line system is confusing to the customers but we get through the day making the customers happy
good,Day one - I truly drank the asparagus water for the first two years of employment here at WFM. It seemed as though I hit the jackpot only to find out it was anything but that. The company makes you believe there is hope and upward mobility. No movement whatsoever! You are at the mercy of the company and their stockholders. Team member happiness does not exist. Don't get sucked into a dead end job just because they glorify the heck out of it.
good,"Whole Foods Market in not your normal company, adjusting to the culture is not easy and has a very low success rate.  The company prides itself in promoting from within 80-85%, one of the top reasons I joined them.  But being from the outside in the position I was in, was not easy.  I am happy that I was able to make it for 2 years, longer than most."
good,Going into orientation they pump you up for this amazing company thats unlike any other company. but it was all a lie. It was just like any other company. You all get paid the same no matter if you work your butt off or do no work at all. Half the time the managers aren't even there when your working. This is just my experience at the Nashua NH whole foods. They are terrible. Don't work there.
good,"A really great company on paper. Co-workers were excellent to work alongside. The company's growth made the job difficult, as there just wasn't enough human resources to keep up with the growth while properly servicing existing locations."
good,"Warehouse Facility Leader is very inexperienced in Warehouse Operations. While I was there they filtered out all of the older employees to keep young, inexperienced people in the position in order to pay them less than an experienced person. This is how they are able to reach their Metrics Goals."
good,"Great place to learn organics and food sustainabilty. Grocery retail especially working on perishable has its challenges, but the most satisfying events are those with customer service."
good,"A large company with great intentions, missions and values, management falls short on leadership and recognizing all team members."
good,"I have enjoyed increasing my cooking skills and improving my time management and organizational skills. Management has been pretty bad in the past but is on the mend thanks to recent regime changes. "
good,"Reception and Phone Skills"
good,"I've worked for WF for 2 years and I've seen people come in wide eyed thinking that the work experience will be like their shopping experience. But then they're disappointed when they have to work evenings, weekends, and holidays, for low pay ($10 start in NYC). It's food service at the end of the day and that involves 3 key things: "
good,"A typical day consisted of micromanaging coming around to give you tasks that only served to make your opening/closing duties fall further and further behind. Management of your department would spend most of their day 'in the office' or 'doing the order' staying for 10+ hrs a day, which would drop the amount of hours regular employees could work. Closing and then opening (11pm then back in at 4:30-5am) wasn't an uncommon thing, and the hardest part of the job is to just keep a low profile. The employees treated the job like a high school in which they would just gossip and spread rumors about one another. "
good,learned a lot from a lot of great men it was a good learning experience
good,"Stock coolers with drinks, helped customers find products, 'front' shelves to ensure products are easily seen, sweep bulk area to prevent accidents, submit orders to team leaders for ordering.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and 'sampling' new products with them."
good,On a good busy day it is good to work at Wholefoods. Even though the job pays good they have zero tolerance on absence.
good,"A typical day at work consists of making the customer happy which is always something of importance to me. I learned more about cashier systems which will help me with future positions.  Management, no comment.  Coworkers were lovely. Hardest part of the job was travel time and schedule print outs.  Enjoyed making the client smile."
good,"I deal with hundreds of people in one day, so the time fly's right by. I learned a lot while working there which includes me gaining more patience with the general public."
good,"The company doesn't give an opportunity to grow, Although I have met some fascinating people, it is time to venture to new horizons. With my skill and talents I can achieve great things."
good,"whole foods was a busy but fast paced and enjoyable company."
good,"Overall the coffee bar opens before the store and you have people lined up out the door waiting to get a coffee drink or fresh pastry that was made in store. I was great to meet first hand some of our local coffee roasters, and talk with them about the love of a great roast and the process. The hardest part was making every customer happy, not everyone is easy going."
good,you punch in you ring and checkout customers you clean up around registrar you bag groceries you have to check with a supervisor about anything and everything
good,I set up the seafood case. Creating a fresh and abundant presentation of all cooked and uncooked seafood product. I came to learn a great deal about different species of fish. Some of the other fishmongers were very skilled and had a vast product knowledge which made me enthusiastic about working for Whole Foods. I also really enjoyed developing relationships with some of the frequent customer.
good,A good overall environment to work in but a lot of talk with no action. Very hard to advance.
good,"Thought I would enjoy the Whole Foods experience and culture, but I was sadly mistaken.  It's just another corporation,  Now owned by Amazon.  "
good,"Working at Whole Foods Market was fine, neither here nor there really. A wide variety of co-workers who you LOVE and co-workers who you HATE. Always a busy store (especially on weekends) and customers are most often mean to you, especially minorities. The job went downhill significantly after Amazon took over. They'll always call and ask you to come in on days off, and will be really uptight if you need to take a day off. Their call-in policy is usually pretty ok, but it depends on the specific team leader."
good,"For cashiers, the days can be really long. However, you're allowed to switch departments and learn a new trade. It provides for variety in your weekly routine. I also met a lot of nice people there too."
good,"When Amazon took over, and wages went up, things seemed to get pretty murky, but if you're in school or just need some money for now, WFM is a great place to put in some work and build your resume."
good,I’m a hard worker I always do whatever I suppose to do. I also treat people with respect specially my bosses. Therefore I will be good for the company who will hire me!
good,The people in general are fantastic to work with. Pretty flexible schedule and will work with you on whatever time you need off. Gives back to the community.
good,Whole Foods is a great company to work for. You can always grow in the company and they are willing to work with your available schedule. The only down side can be the management.
good,Great place to work with good benefits. Company is restructuring and cutting regional jobs. Must be willing to cut pay and benefits with uncertainty of any future growth structure.
good,During my time at Whole Foods i really enjoyed it but my time there ended short because of a family emergency.  I learned a lot more about sales in the industry and they gave me all the tools I needed.
good,"whole foods started as an amazing place to work, but declined since the ownership is amazon, not a great place anymore. It has become very corporate and more about money grabbing"
good,trabajo  bajo presión muy poco lugar y no mucho material para trabajar  y bolsas muy pesadas
good,"They have no hours to give to part time employees to the point that they look elsewhere for employment. The staff is wonderful, but they need to work better about equal opportunity"
good,Easy to connect with other team members.  No consistent schedule - different day to day and each week.  Opportunity to transfer to different teams and to different stores. Leadership is very friendly and accessible.
good,"you're job duties here are pretty simple."
good,"I worked here for eight months before the company was acquired by Amazon. When I first started, the company seemed vital, and an interesting place to work. Toward the end, there were several policy changes, as well as physical changes to the work environment which made it feel less inviting and more corporate. Particularly, issues about product availability, and inclusion of Amazon products in-store."
good,"There are only 2 shifts to choose from.  No flexibility.  Management was not very nice. The best thing about working there was something called quartermania. Employees can buy the leftover food from the hot bar, deli counter, and bakery for a quarter each."
good,"Great place to work as long as you don't move into a leadership role, they will overwork and underpay you. I got paid $14 of hr for doing the job of 3-4 people never got the help I needed, work 12-16 hr days with little to no breaks and got one do off a week would not recommend."
good,"*Worked here as a College Summer Job"
good,This was a great company to work for. But has changed over the past 6-7 years. Decent benefits. Work-life balance declines when you are in management.
good,If you dont really care where you work and just going in for a check then this is the place to be. If you are a hard worker and care about the job that you are doing then this isn't the place for you.
good,"The pay at whole foods was great, but not worth it in the long run. They offset the pay by giving employees less than 40 hours a week. The store I worked in based treatment of employees more on personal liking than the work employees put in. If a team leader did not like you they would find a policy to use to fire you. But if you were well liked you were given preference as far as treatment. I applied for an promotion and was told I would not be interviewed for it because they had me in mind for a better promotion that I honestly would have enjoyed more. So I began doing most of the work that would have been required for that position only to find out months later that they decided not to open that specific position, and were basically going to have me continue with all the work and responsibility without being compensated fornit."
good,I overall loved working at whole foods. The only real issue I personally had was the fact of their attendance policy is a bit strict and doesn't really work out for people who could get sick often unless they've been working with the company for multiple years.
good,"If your looking to further develop a position with this company you for sure will have to suck up to management. The favoritism is absolutely absurd. Maybe it's just my experience but management hires just about anybody which furthers them cutting down hours. I had only 4 hour shift scheduled once and had to pick up shifts. If your part time, you should definitely have another source of income coming. You'll be lucky to get on average 15 hours at most."
good,"Work day depends on which department you are in. There are opportunities to apply yourself and move up in the department, the store, then the company but you have to do your time. Management is hit or miss depending on who you get above you, but that is like any place you work. You can dress as you wish at work (plus an apron) which is pretty cool, they accept all walks of life and all appearances there. Being there for many years, the retail setting becomes tiresome (working holidays, nights, weekends, etc.) but with our new minimum wage policy and team member discount, not a bad place to work."
good,"While Whole Foods offers great and relatively inexpensive health and dental benefits, the management of the store, and each individual department, leaves much to be desired(at least at my particular location)."
good,"It's alright"
good,"I enjoyed the culture, social aspect, and discounts while working here. Cons-catty management team, clique-y, supervisors are 20 year olds with no life experience. Customers can be snobby. Too corporate."
good,"Management needs to considered. "
good,Good place to meet people and make connections for a few years but is turning into a large corporation since the amazon takeover. Good place for advancement if you’re interested in moving up quickly.
good,It started well before i changed to my third store after Amazon bought us. Things became more complicated and we were very limited with options. Your experience all depends on the store.
good,if the managers weren't so greedy behind bonus money and being fair it would not be as stressful. everyone would get along and not try to put each other's job at riak.
good,"The management team at the Capitol Hill location definitely left something to be desired. I worked in the prepared foods section and we were constantly running out of things we needed, communication was abysmal and there was no accountability. Supervisors were lazy and would spend more time socializing than helping out the staff."
good,"Like all things it started out fantastic but then you realized it wasn’t what I was told the management wasn’t really about the helping the employees . I saw that all the hard workers were fired and was not defended by their team leaders , and the employees that didn’t work as hard got all the recognition . Which is sad . But I did enjoy my time there and made new friends."
good,"I love my co-workers and customers. I enjoy my role at this company, the only challenge is the pressure and stress that leadership places on all of the employees."
good,"The store managers and leads were incredible, but the leads over each department tended to act from their own biases and treat people inconsistently. Would reccomend asking for a tour during the interview and starting a good working relationship with HR. Makes it much easier"
good,"working in a place where health is important is fun but when you start getting points for everyday life incidents like having to call out or being a couple minutes late you will get fired. its unfair that people are punished for things that can be unpredictable. if they changed this policy they would have happier employees. you cant expect someone to grow in an "
good,"This company is an excellent company, they make sure to take care of their employees in as many ways as possible. Unfortunately my local WFM did not look to make like easy for their employees. Communication was scarce, there were favorites among the team members, promotions and advancement seldom were based on the team members merit but rather on their usefulness to leadership or unorthodox reasons."
good,"basically work and if you happen to have a conversation with a coworker its basically forbidden. also they will schedule off seniority and who they favor the most. I am a day/night shift, but they thought it was ok to schedule me overnight and if you have complained they simply ignore you especially if you're new. every 2 months they are hiring new people, because so many people quit."
good,"The culture of WFM has changed a lot since I first started with the company."
good,The cultural of the company has change a lot since Amazon own it. They use to care a lot about the well being of employee but not as much anymore. It is more focus of making profit than the customer or quality of its product.
good,"WFM used to care about employees and gave raises up to $1.50 a year, now the max raise a year is down to 65cents a year.  Used to have lots of positions for upward advancement, most of those have been cut out. Used to get gainesharing"
good,Some of the managers left to go to a different store cause they have poor management. My general Manger can barely set the right schedule up for anybody. Its a wholesome store that pretends to be good to their employees but it has its limits.
good,"Extremely poor management. Good Pay ($15/hour). Working hours are never the same, so don’t plan anything for your personal life bc your life will revolve around your work schedule. Cashiers experience back problems from bagging and looking down at scam screen all day."
good,company has lost it's path and the values it once supported no longer guide decision making.  work life balance is acceptable for part time work but once you are full time you are at their mercy.
good,"It's a grocery job. It may be a little bit better than your average Safeway or HEB, but the work is still retail/customer service, so expect high turn over rates and some of the usual disorganization of larger corporations. They could stand to pay people better and be more regular with their scheduling.  Be forewarned they have a VERY strict attendance policy, our team lost some really awesome staff who had occasional childcare, doctor appt, or misread the schedule one too many times in a 6 month period. WFM only hurts itself with not understanding or creating a more trusting, benefit of the doubt type of environment."
good,"Arrive at work on time, prepare food for salad bar, keep two salad bars full of fresh food, return to the kitchen to prepare food, grill vegetables, cook items, etc."
good,"The culture at whole foods is very laid back. Employees are not held accountable for getting work done."
good,"En diferentes estaciones laborales, dependiendo de cual sea, las personas son muy amigables. en customer service no es asi."
good,Employee Comfort was merely a factor.  Company put profit over employee satisfaction.  Very high turn over rate for employees.  Often looked for reasons to fire rather than improve working conditions.
good,"Overall the job culture for Whole Foods has changed majorly over the last couple of years. They tend to hire managers who are untrained and have no experience in the food industry. The hours can be a bit long depending on your job, and there is not a lot of support from management."
good,"This was a tough job for someone taking the bus. They had strict policies and I saw many people terminated because the staff would not adjust the schedules for people riding the bus, even if it was only a five-minute difference. For being such a green company, you would think they would appreciate people taking public transportation."
good,"It was okay before Makey sold out to Amazon.  The pay was garbage, but my coworkers made the job okay. I stayed there for as long as I did because of them."
good,"It a job that is competitive and you could be let go for any reason. The work is at will. My co-worker was very helpful and supportive.I work as a cashier. The software for the register was easy to learn, but you have to remember code for vegetable and fruits. Easy job and easy to be let go."
good,I loved the company value and the detail and thought that went into the products they provided for their customers. It had a very relaxed and supportive atmosphere as well.
good,"My day to day duties were fairly easy, but often things were over complicated by management. Customers were typically not the most kind and kind of snooty but usually not aggressive, however when issues arose they were often rewarded by management for yelling at employees and shouting obscenity with a gift card or other voucher, leading to repeat offenders."
good,I’ve worked there for about 3 years now but at some point you want more. You’re ready for more and unless your up under the right person that will not happen with this company. Sometimes it’s who you know and not WHAT you know.
good,Began as a fun job and I did great. They have something called 'gain sharing' and I felt the managers did everything they could to keep their numbers looking good at the expense of the workers by doing everything they can not give a raise. Turn over is high. In the end I felt pigeon holed into the job and unable to move to a different department or progress forward. The culture there is radically politically correct. Many times I didn't have the ingredients or space to do my job. Very frustrating.
good,"I would still say whole foods is a pretty good place to work, depending on your job title. I enjoy my work and my team members but it is not run very well with management."
good,"It was an ok place to work, wouldn't go back. They started me at 14 dollars an hour and other employees were getting more then me with no experience. The customer service booth is a joke. I felt so bad for so many customers with there bad experiences. I can't work for a company that treats there customers poorly. During rush hour you have sometimes up to five employees standing around in the customer service both doing nothing, while the lines are getting longer with unhappy costomers. It makes my blood boil just talking about this.Get rid of the dam booth, let the cashiers take car of the returns ect..."
good,"I thoroughly loved the people i worked with. We helped one another out and literally grew to be a family. We had nights out together and looked out for one another, But the management leaves something to be desired. They change schedules on you without a single word after you already have the schedule. They pull ""petty"" moves if something didnt go their way. Highly understaffed sections made it so you were working 6-7 day work weeks without being asked if it were ok. Basically management made it very uncomfortable to work there."
good,"Overall productive company, although some leadership and department managers may not be qualified or not even meeting minimum standards for position they fill."
good,it was ok. i don't really remember a lot fo it and and I am just doing this because I think I got roped into filling something out that I don't want to.
good,"Very difficult to transition from a part time to a full time position. I felt like I was strung along with that promise for almost a year. My manager seemed bitter she had not been promoted, we had new store management, not the 'big happy family' feeling some people think Whole Foods has."
good,"At Whole Foods, you rarely ever got a free moment to breathe. Once you were on shift, everything was very structured and moved quickly. It was up to us cashiers to make sure people got in and out in a timely manner. We stayed up to date on all of the changes in the store - including product changes, departments, and discounts. I enjoyed working in an environment like this because there was always something to do."
good,"I prefer to keep my point of view personal."
good,Love the people I worked with! Loved the discounts. Loved the chill atmosphere. The breaks were short and the customers are not always the friendliest.
good,"Whole foods market was a great place to work for the people. In general the community feel and generally lax environment was enjoyable. However, management at every level, especially the higher management, was extremely inept at leading and governing. They would play politics and blatant favoritism daily, had a HUGE issue with communicating openly and honestly about simple tasks or issues, and were very two-faced. I loved my time working there for the people and the community, but I would never return."
good,"I recommend it as a secondary job for extra cash. WF is not the same ever since amazon took over. You are replaceable no matter how many years or what time of experience you have. They do not play when it comes to time and attendance. Very stressful. They give yearly raises but they squeeze more out of you. I was there for 5 years and had a whole blueprint about my future with the company until I had a rude awakening. I poured my heart and soul into this company I once believed in but its time for me to move on. The benefits have changed and they suck, Holistic doctors mostly."
good,My first experience at a grocery store. The Redmond store's lead staff are more personable than the Bellingham store.  My position is part time. The team members at both stores are a fun group and work well together.
good,a good job for lower skilled worker. a good stepping stone. a lot of work for the money though. not for high skilled workers. pay needs to show skills involved in work.
good,Great place..in las vegas. Have not work for them in california. Good people and nice team. Other associates willing to help. All dept would assists all customers.
good,"Really great teams and people. however the working hours can be tough, you may finish at 11pm and have to work from 6:30am the next day."
good,"Working at Whole Foods was an ordinary production Bakery job"
good,Can be a good place to work. Advancement can be difficult unless you are williing to relocate within the region. Overtime is not allowed. Store leadership style varies per store. Some are laid back and some only care about cutting costs till you can't do your job effectively. One store leader would not buy us (the kitchen) a new squeegee to clean the floors with because she did not want to spend the $15 dollars.
good,"Management team is overwhelmed, unfocused, and works department heads to the bone. But hey, good benefits and paid time off. Under staffed, department leaders often work over time to keep up."
good,"The company changed once it became a corporation. Before it was normal to see employees with tattoos and piercings, but then it changed. We had to cover up our tattoos, no watches and only one set of stud earrings. Sad that they had to hide who we were to sell groceries."
good,"So, this one is tough to put. At first I was beyond excited, because I was getting a promotion and furthering my career. They did a great job of setting up a wonderful work environment. But then after the Grand Opening Crew left, we all saw managements true side. Being cursed at weekly if not daily. Being threatened to be put out on the street etc. I learned a good bit more of how to hone and better my craft as a meat cutter, but the work environment was horrible."
good,"While foods attracts a great customer base, however the pressure that the managers receive from management is felt on the floor. People who lack EQ are advanced which is backwards to me."
good,"Great place to be with colleagues. "
good,"This is a tough job for an introvert.  There is constant attention from coworkers and customers alike.  That being said, most people are moderately friendly and coworkers tend to be very outgoing.  "
good,The title says most of it. I worked in the kitchen department and it was known to have a very high turn around and be an extremely demanding department. Imagine you are working in the kitchen as you would at a restaurant and still assisting customers. The kitchen staff did not make more than the rest of the store. Would not recommend the kitchen but the rest of the positions are like any other retail store.
good,My job was pretty stressful. A lot of workers got over on management because of being cool with them. Plus they allowed workers to not do certain parts of their jobs and force someone else to do it. Whole Foods Bryant Park
good,"Managerial dysfunction and total lack of communication make working at Whole Foods. Even its has nice benefits for team members, you have to jump though hoops and deals with an unfair bureaucracy to obtain them."
good,"A typical day at work was relatively busy, especially for an Utilities worker. Utility workers focused primarily on washing dishes, both from the bakery and Prep Foods department, but sometimes the supervisor will put you in different positions. Fryer, food prep, deli, or pizza station, it didn't matter. You were basically a jack of all trades in that place."
good,"Not bad, not great.  Very hard to do anything outside of work due to inconsistent hours.  Leadership doesn't really care most of the time but expects you to."
good,"Store leaders make work really stressful, lack of diversity within higher positions, there is no training or development. The Co-workers are typically really helpful."
good,"The job has very good benefits; however, it feels like you have to be with the company for over 7 years in order to move up in the company. Hours are very inconsistent."
good,It's a nice place to work because you get paid over minimum wage and get benefits even if you aren't full time. There is no teamwork in the workplace. They are always short staffed.  Customers are very rude and the environment is very stressful if you aren't used to it. It's like being in high school half the time because everyone is always gossiping about everyone and worried about everything but themselves. You can't really trust anyone there.
good,I worked the VA room and worked veg and dip station. It was highly stressful due to cut-throat management. Management was never satisfied even when you were giving your all. We worked relentless hours without taking a break mostly.
good,"Whole foods is a fun work atmosphere, but it all depends on the levels of staffing to sales that you have. During the time I worked there the mid-level sales had the best atmosphere, staffing & learning environment. The busier stores were very challenging."
good,"As with any job, Whole Foods is for some and not for others. You will find work life balance, supportive peers and managers, and a cool work environment (free food, trendy decor). If you are ambitious, you will become frustrated quickly as the pay and benefits are sub par, and the inherent dis-organization of such a laid-back company makes driving excellence impossible at times. It's a stepping stone for some, a life-long career for others. It's up to you."
good,"Developed excellent customer service by serving at least one hundred customers everyday to fulfill their dietarEnsure a properly organized display by keeping shelves clean and fully stocked with merchandise, through the process of front-facing, rotating, replacing out-of-date products, checking codes, and maintaining correct pricing and signage. "
good,Good company and ok benefits. Mission statement is not followed as it once was and the small vendors are being slowly removed. Team members are great to work with which makes up for the lack of leadership.
good,"may be scheduled for one job, but you'll help out all departments whether a cashier or an assistant.  Each month. theres a new promotional thing you have to force out on the customer as well."
good,Many of the employees are wonderful. However management is not great. The company is moving in the wrong direction by trying to be more like its competitors rather than embracing what made it special.
good,Poor management skills . Had no idea what she was doing .we lost 14 people in the 1st month she was there . Team leaders never care or bother to back anybody up . They always gave her her way like if they where scare of her .
good,"Whole Foods Market claims to be highly motivated by ""team member happiness"" but that applies to very few. They also claim better food safety which is not necessarily the case. They masquerade as a friendly, people-loving, animal-friendly, organic/natural grocery store. In truth they exploit that image but still sell lower quality food for a higher than average price. Their commitment to being ""green"" is only surface-level as their amount of waste is astronomical."
good,"Local level Management and inter-store relations are great, regional management was out of touch with the stores. Bad information chains, inconsistent information, outright lying to Team leaders and Managers"
good,"Higher standards, higher stress. Management always being shifted around. Potential for inside advancement is slow and gives rise to a cut throat environment. Customers are usually of the egotistical variety."
good,"For a brand new store that opened in January 2018 they have a hard time keeping good employees, Upper management in non existent. They sit in their office behind their computers and only come down to help when upper management shows up to tour the store. We are expected to make prepared foods without the proper ingredients. Head chef is so disrespectful and discriminatory towards employees and has a clique of women who do nothing. It's a nice store and very busy but management is poor and upper management turns a blind eye to what is going on."
good,I enjoyed working for Whole foods Market in Atlanta Georgia. I did not enjoy working for Whole foods Market in Dallas Texas. Benefits were better before Obamacare.
good,Not the same company I started with 14 years ago. The culture has changed drastically and the focus seems to be more about the bottom line rather than providing high quality food and customer service
good,"Wholefoods was a good experience.  I learned a lot about organic and non gluten foods as well as no artificial colors or additives to foods.  I got my certificate in food handling and safety."
good,"I had the most beer knowledge of any employee who was on the team, in fact that was why I was hired. Once management shifted, I was not allowed to work with beer as much."
good,Started out fun. Management changed partway through my time there and the corporate side became much more apparent. I'm not sure what it's like now with the Amazon affiliation. I'm glad I got out when I did.
good,"I loved my coworkers but the job itself (hours, scheduling, profit expectations), and especially the customers, were constantly grinding down everyone. I still miss a few of my coworkers but I was happy to leave."
good,"it you live next to one its great to work there, it does tend to get clicky depending on the store your at. i dont know why i am having to do this. I havent workewd for them in over 3 years"
good,The job was cool but it was very HS like and you can’t move up unless you’re like best friends with management but the pay was ok. There’s opportunities to cross train in other departments if you’re unhappy with yours
good,Management are all slobs who will look for any reason to complicate your day. I would work here again but in a different department. The company is overpriced yet cheap.
good,Whole foods is a  great company that offers education in food and products. This company that has a lot of issues on the business side this often affect employee/leadership relationships such as layoffs and hours cut career advancement is a bit biased
good,"But do not expect to enjoy working in retail if you are motivated, professional, and intelligent. It is like high school or fast food. You need to stay in your lane, and not innovate."
good,Management is doing everything they can do save there job and nothing to improve working conditions and culture of general operations. Very cut-throte with a lot of back stabbing...
good,Whole Foods Market is a very casual job but it does have some advancement options. Coworkers are very nice and laid back. Would strongly recommend it as a secondary job.
good,its great but hard to get promoted specially if your part-time only company favorites get what they want. the most enjoyable would be the customer relationships you build. the hardest part is when is slow and you have no customers and nothing to do. they need something for downtimes.
good,Company is ok to work for. Relaxed. Not too fast paced. When busy it is very hard and difficult to maintain a level head. Customers were rude sometimes.
good,you will bend over backwards for crumbs and disrespect from management and customers. its hard to find any rewarding activities in a culture devoid of passion or love. the customers had a royal sense of entitlement and privilege that made me misanthropic. the best part of the job was helping those that were sincere and interested but for the most part people did not give much courtesy.
good,"Worked here for 5 years. I had a great team in the bakery and learned so much from them. They prepared me for future employment. Outside my department the management skills lacked. I did not agree with regional and although they came in to try and help individual departments they did that poorly due to the fact they had no idea what was happened on a day to day basis. It was a great stepping stone but I would not go back,"
good,"because the store is based on customer perspective, anyone can easliy lose their job because of what a customer(s) says about you. another rule is if your sick, you will not be covered for a sick leave instead it counts against you unless you have proof from a doctor (which is difficult to do, since a doctor cannot legally state your stickness the day of, instead a couple days later), and this can also get you fired if you have too many call-offs."
good,"Whole Foods has it's growing pains presently that effects the happiness of its employees, but if those growing pains aren't directly effecting you, then it can be a good place to work."
good,If you want to work with some amazing people I would say work there. If you don't want to deal with nonsense or pettiness don't work there. Whole foods in the old days was an amazing place that cared about their employees and it's all about the dollar bill sadly.
good,"typical day at work was fast paced, stressful at times. I learned how to train, understand, and manage people through the ATL program. "
good,Whole food was a productive fast pace environment. You learn how to eat healthy and all about organic foods and vitamins.The benefits are good.And you get a 20% discount on merchandise in store
good,"I started at Whole Foods in 2001.  For about 10 years, with the exception of a few due to stock market collapse, all we saw were positive performance over the prior years.  Then other natural foods stores started moving into the area offering similar product.  Once this happened the management that had only saw positive performance did not know how to keep the customers coming back.  There answer was to cut labor and therefore the customer was not getting the service that they had before and still paying the same if not higher prices.  In an environment that had once offered specialty services on demand slowly people started going other places where they could spend less."
good,"Considering it's a supermarket, awesome benefits and PTO. Low expectations for a work/life balance once you enter leadership-- and don't expect any recognition for working your tush off. But, the pay was good, most coworkers had a good sense of humor, and there was a ton of free food. Depending on the store, leadership can vary IMMENSELY. As a female in leadership, when speaking to other ladies in my same position, it was acknowledged that there was a strong ""boy's club"" mentality."
good,"Busy days start with placing orders for the department, and running the days order for it as well. keeping up on orders and checking in with vendors. Strong communication with the team to make sure what needs to get done gets done. Fair amount of talking and joking around while running the order. Personally i really enjoyed the workload and responsibility of the department. The only issue i ever really ran into is not always having the time to get everything done in a day, but at least there is always something to do!"
good,Whole Foods as a whole is a nice place to work. Discrimination and harassment has become the norm with the new management.  Nothing further to review.
good,"Whole foods is currently going through some changes as it was bought by Amazon but these changes have been occurring for some time now.  Hopefully they can learn to grow as a company while still keeping to their initial goal of helping the world through conscientious capitalism.  Your work experience highly depends on the ability/demeanor of your store leadership.  That being said, the company as a whole tries to foster good working relationships."
good,"Supervisors are all young and deep down don't care as much as they pretend to. Idiots steal and jeopardize others' jobs. Customers are spoiled and rude, and management allows it."
good,They'll get rid of you if its convenient for them. the customers you have to serve are TERRIBLE they treat you like your lower than dog feces. Management could care less about you. You are just the number they assigned you.
good,It use to be a fun place to work but dynamics of the organization have changed and made the job more stressful. Good for students looking for a part time job since part time employees are limited to 19 hours per week.
good,The only thing bad I would ever say about it  is the way it's run like a cult.  Did not appear they appreciated employees over the age of forty five .
good,"By and large the best part of working at Whole Foods Market is the people. The company is full of great people who are passionate about their jobs, great food, and making an impact on the world."
good,"Don't go work for the Greenwich store,they full of bs the whole team leader staff, it all depends on if they like you for you to keep your job,it's not about the team members it's all about management!!"
good,"Strong culture and great people along with tremendous growth make this a good place to work and present lots of opportunities to grow. Flip side of this rapid growth is that there are a number of leaders who are untested and senior leadership is stretched thin so there is less oversight that optimal. My experience there was very good until the end. Grew a ton, lots of opportunities, amazing people and challenging roles and problems."
good,"This position, and at Whole Foods is quick paced and heavily relys on great customer service and the ability to problem solve, Great place to work, Unfortunately this current position is being replaced by a third party company."
good,I loved working at whole foods market because I worked in the kitchen. I love to cook and learn how to make new dishes from different cultures. I loved seeing the smile on peoples faces every time they requested for an order and they come back to thank me for a job well done. it was very stressful at times because there were some very difficult customers but I did everything possible to make them happy. customers always come first.
good,Wholefoods Is a great place to work; but I believe its geared/ aimed for Young Adults or College Students. It is difficult to earn supervisor positions unless you transfer locations.
good,"When I first joined the Whole Foods family I could not imagine leaving. At the end I couldn't get out of there fast enough. There is a very lopsided workload where some team members expectations are much higher than others. There used to be way better labor payouts as well but they changed the program making it fairly unlikely to ever get anything over a couple of hundred bucks. Whole foods was a great place for me for many years and, it may be again someday. If you get a cool manager and don't mind dealing with the public it could work out well for you. I appreciate many of my former coworkers, vendors and customers and wish them the best but,can not imagine going back to that environment any time soon. "
good,Great place to start of you need a job fast. They let you have a life outside of work for the most part. The people who work as team members are pretty cool. Management can sometimes be a pain though. Making things somewhat stressful.
good,"I was with this company close to ten years. The first 5 were great, as the company grew however the culture and atmosphere changed to something that I did not click with"
good,"If you need somewhere to start over and help get you back on your feet Whole Foods is the place to do it. It is a good environment to grow in for the most part, but the management sucks."
good,The pay is good but when I started the management for my department was very disorganized. It is very unfortunate and sad because it hurts the reputations of the company.
good,"The store is and corperation is run badly. They play favorites with people they like and not with hardest working people. The people who make the store run are the employees, they are awesome but leadership (management) sucks."
good,"A typical day would consist of helping people who are in a hurry while avoiding bumping into coworkers, aka other team member, who are also in a hurry. I learned how to stay centered in the middle of the business and chaos. The hardest part of the job is feeling like there is no room while feeling alone. I love helping people find a different perspective and turning around someones mood."
good,"I love the kind of work I can do here. It ranges from important and leading work on seafood sustainability to fun, exciting consumer efforts like National Cookie Day. "
good,"In Boulder; Our Seafood Department was award winning. I was on a staff that set 10 Wholefoods All Time historical sales totals for single days. We also eclipsed All Time totals for weekly sales twice. Attention to detail was important and actively enforced by the entire Seafood staff. Customer service & timely follow through were our strenghts. The overall team work on the Boulder staff was Amazing. All in All, I enjoyed my time with Wholefoods."
good,"Great people at right locations. Can be a blast and a fun place to learn about different fields of interest (meat, seafood, health, alcohol, beer, produce, food production), however higher level positions are barely compensated for the amount of responsibility. Certain locations give very little attention to employee care."
good,"My regular duties included stocking and refreshing the displays in the produce department, and helping customers with questions."
good,"The work itself isn't bad, just basic housekeeping. The coworkers are pleasant as are the managers and supervisors. I just don't like the shift changes which are anywhere between 7:30AM & 10:30PM. I am looking for a day job."
good,"Working with clients with learning difficulties to teach them workplace skills, and build confidence. The clients are great to work with, and can provide a real sense of satisfaction."
good,"A moderately challenging job, but management at the time was very spotty. Found myself having to do tasks not assigned or responsible for in job titile."
good,"The Management was in a good or bad mood, it would change the vibe in the store, so the team members could feel it. There was  favoritism between store leadership and team leaders."
good,"I used to be excited about going in to work every day in Prepared Foods. Changes in management, changes in kitchen layout, changes in what products we provided, too many changes, too fast. None of the team members felt listened to, complaints increased, and if anyone spoke up, leadership would reprimand the complainant rather than address the issue at hand. Morale is in a tailspin. If you are considering working for Whole Foods, I would wait until the Amazon purchase process is complete and see what happens. Otherwise, great benefits and good pay scaling with flexible hours. Provided that's all you need from a job and aren't concerned with having a voice."
good,"They tell you one thing, and another ATL tells you something else. we never had what we needed to perform our job. They would not let me transfer to prepared foods , I had to interview for that position and then they said no, I had to stay in bakery.  It was also heavy retail sales, which they pushed all the time ""sell, sell, sell, "" and they did not tell me about that when I was hired... They also started cutting hours because of sells not being where they should have been."
good,"Was once a really fun, dynamic and diverse workplace.  The stores are full of talented fun people and can be a great place to start or have a job but corporate is really lacking in training, inspiration and incentives.  the company has lost its way and I wish it would have stayed focused on selling of really great products by really great people. It's why people used to shop there and why we worked there."
good,Good place to work if you're just out of school trying to build a savings. Not great for an actual career. Benefits are ridiculous. Never seen such a high deductible on health insurance before. They are very strict with their attendance.
good,"The only pressure you'll feel working for Whole Foods will be that of an empty bank account. Work/Life balance is excellent; come-and-go as you please, casual environment. Salaries are not competitive and there is severe pay inequality (both internally and externally) for IT professionals."
good,"I have worked for this company for over 10 years, and am currently at a point where I need a change in scenery.  I have tried to advance my career with this company with out success.  I do not feel that they are helpful with training and providing you with the tools to effectively move forward.  Despite their denial, it is my belief that there are a lot of politics and favoritism with regards to who is able to advance and who is not.  Counseling and inquiring about personal and professional issues within the company are more often than not met with harsh judgment.  They seem to like talking highly about being a leader instead of being a boss, but one must consider that actions speak louder than words.  I do however enjoy the company of the majority of my team and co-workers.  They"
good,"Whole Foods is a relatively nice place to work the environment is very nice and the people are extremely kind. I learned many ways to better communicate with customers, but the hardest part of the job had to be getting used to low hours."
good,"Great team members to work with. Easy job no brainer. Lots of waste for an environmentally conscious company. Overworked in all departments of the store grocery, produce, meat and prepared. Management or team leaders as they are called are good too much pressure from higher up causes high stress environment where the bottom line is the highest concern not staff morale and safety."
good,"Customers are often rude and unreasonable, but your coworkers really do become your family and your backbone. Management can be cliquey and advancement can be EXTREMELY difficult. Spending long hours on your feet without being able to take a break until scheduled can be grueling, but if you don't mind standing still for long hours and not taking snobby customers personally, then you'll be fine. Did give me good communication skills in terms of immediate conflict resolution."
good,"A typical day is pretty busy and demanding. Management is super unorganized, however everyone does try to help you out and be nice to you. The hardest part of the job is never knowing who is in charge."
good,"Whole Foods is going through hard times. They have cut because of labor costs to many talented people who really set the store and it""s culture above the norm. Now it's just another Grocery Store."
good,"The benefits and team members are the only reason I've been here so long. The company says they care about their team members, when in reality they could not care less. Very money/greedy. Most customers are rude, but there's a select few that everyone becomes very close to."
good,"Definitely a do as I say not as I do environment. Leadership doesn't lead by example, instead they do the least throughout the day. Too many team members there just for a paycheck which makes my job difficult."
good,"you can get ahead by kissing up, there are many open positions as supervisors. the regular jobs are mostly keeping busy while watching the clock. there are benefits like calling off frequently."
good,Grocery takes a particular kind of person to be succesful. I learned a lot about quality food and farming and met some wonderful people. Knowing how to butcher is a very valuable skill! The management structure wasn't a good fit for me. The uppity customers were among the hardest parts of the job.
good,I worked at wholefoods for 8 months really busy place to work in time goes by really fast .. I also learned a lot about diffrent types of food .. met some really good team members
good,I enjoyed working with customers on healthy food choices. I didn't like my work schedule working late at night. Management not flexible with family needs. The most enjoyable part of my job trying new prepared foods.
good,"Pretty fun work environment, passive aggressive management, just do your job and try to help out where necessary. Relaxed and cool work experience."
good,"I was really enthusiastic when I first started working for this company and over the years, reality set in and my enthusiasm dwindled away as I watched my friends being taken advantage of time and time again. They got rid of so many valuable people and positions and now everyone is stretched so thin and we can't focus on providing that awesome customer service that we are known for at whole foods."
good,"Unfortunately, Whole Foods seems to have gotten too big for its own good and now that other stores are coming up with the same approach, I feel the overall company approach is changing.  True talent and skill is taken advantage of and underpaid. Store level management means well but corporate have seemed to have forgotten how to appreciate the people that keep their company alive."
good,"Whole Foods is a publicly traded company. That is evident in an increasing attempt to streamline policy and cut once FT positions into PT ones. The store offers high quality products at high prices. As a TM you get 20% off everything in the store. Once a year, you will get to do something fun like go work on a farm and have a picnic. But, there is an ever increasing sense that you are just a number. There are some rules that cannot be broken and if they are, you will be fired. Regardless of the effort you have put in previously. There is a very high turn over in the department that I worked in (customer service). They don't pay enough to retain many serious staff members. However, generally the people that want to work at Whole Foods are interesting and intelligent. For me, my coworkers made this job a good time."
good,"having worked there 5 years i can tell you the people who arent management are pretty chill to work with, but the management can be pretty unorganized"
good,"Very high on Quality output; biggest health food store chain. Strives for leadership in the grocery and health food store industry.  Strong and ambitious"
good,A typical day at work usually means I'm over worked. It is very easy to call out of work and people take advantage of this. Management does little to fill in the void and will place the work on the shoulders on an individual that showed up. Management needs to set an example and put rules in place to help the company provide the customer service the customers deserve. Customers pay a lot for their product. There is no reason for whole foods to be understaffed or ill equipped with broken appliances.
good,"When I first started the company seemed people-driven.  They cared very much about their employees and showed it with things like team-member appreciation week giving out free meals.  However. it has only been downhill from there.  The company is trying to make all stores operate uniformly despite serving very different and diverse communities.  In an effort to make this possible the powers that be have been sending ""Standard operating procedures"" to my managers forcing them to make unnecessary and unpopular changes.  The customers and workers alike are unhappy with the changes.  Some of these include forcing workers to list their license plates and register their cars, and if they park in an unsanctioned spot one time that results in final warning.  Also, they have cut the allotted hours of every department in the store so that they can have higher profits.  As a result we now have less customers because they are fed up with poor service, long lines, and a total lack of customer support that they previously enjoyed."
good,"Worked as Produce Production Team Member and it was a great experience, co-workers were very helpful and very kind. Depends on the store and department. Worked in a Cooler cutting chunk fruit and vegetables and preparing salsas and guacamole and was cross-trained to make Cold-pressed Juices. I enjoyed going to work every day just because of my Co-workers and the customers were not as needy as previous grocery stores I had worked at. Management was very helpful when I had problems with attendance and injuries, helped me keep my job for as long as I did. Administration was terrible. They only looked out for themselves and each other and would do anything to fire you."
good,"this company has a lot of firing for very simple reasons that could be avoided and easily solved."
good,"Whole Foods has been a great company to work for, but their lack of direction and ideals for the company trickles down to the low level team members. It's easy to get into a full time position, but the lack of oversight for mid level managers leaves something to be desired."
good,"Lots of customers to deal with on a day-to-day basis, both good and bad. "
good,"Depending on you're department WFM can either be the best or worst job you've ever had. In my department the management was overly non-existent, and hardly supportive towards team members. The pay is pretty above average for the job type, but the overturn of team members and lack of incentive leads to a overall negative work atmosphere."
good,"I would set the case from 5am-8:30 am."
good,"I liked the paid time off and sick time once I accrued it.They do not compensate well for overachievers. They put on a great ""ethical face"" for public relations but, your experience will be most dictated by the personalities that you routinely work with and the efficiency and effectiveness of your management.There are plenty of different departments if you enjoy lateral movement. It's difficult to move up without being under-compensated for added responsibility. Management tends to turn over pretty frequently so the team morale changes pretty constantly."
good,"Fun, fast paced work environment with strong team member relationships as well as regular customer relationships. However, management needs some work."
good,"A lot of work, your learn a lot, easy to move up in the company, meet very interesting people who can become great friends. you will deal with some annoyance with rude customers.but overall not a bad place to work."
good,"A typical day consists of anything from emails from all the stores and buyers in the office. Daily workload consists of item issues,vendor issues, system issues and pulling reports.Over all a great place to work unfortunately not enough communication or open door policy is implemented."
good,Great company to work for!  Love the benefits that they offer.  It is a mix of people for a wide array of backgrounds which adds to the special culture at WFM.
good,"Wholefoods Market is a highly estimed place for healthy eaters, and I enjoyed being given the opportunity to work there and go out of the way to help a customer and suite there need. Compensation & Benefits were amazing, the stars would not let me gage them. Job Security was difficult, they expected you to only clock in at the exact time you were scheduled if you clock in to early or late you get points added up and this could lead to loss of employment. This was not realistic, because if you stayed over hours to finish work, they docked you for this as well."
good,"The Co-Workers are amazing and everyone is like a family. There are some issues in management and can pull the team morale down. You can learn a lot about different foods, wines, beer, and vitamins while working there."
good,"The management can be better picked. They entertain too much pettiness. Yes, they give you hours, but you won't really have a life, especially if you work nights. I worked 6 days straight before getting ONE day off and then doing it again. After awhile of sleeping all day and  working for the rest of the evening and night, you begin to think of it's actually worth it. I got tired of not having a life. This job takes up all your time, especially since schedules are made 2 weeks in advance and you can't take off."
good,"Z Gallerie is so varied, fun, and evolving that you could never dream to be bored as a shopper or employee.  Lacking in infrastructure at every level, the company managed to keep itself afloat by the its alarming expansion and key individuals.  Wish there was one in every town,"
good,"This can be a very  stressful work environment stifled by corporate limitations. However, the world of natural food attracts wonderful personalities and you often end up meeting great people."
good,"Whole Foods is definitely changing and not for the better. They have received a lot of negative press lately and recently laid off 1,600 employees. You can definitely feel the high tension, negativity, and cut backs over the past year. They no longer follow what they once stood for and are turning into just another greedy large corporation."
good,"fun place to be, but couldn't deal with the way things were going. couldn't see eye to eye because i always said something when people do it wrong, in a professional, teaching manner."
good,Whole Foods offers generous pay and a vibrant and active company culture to partake in. Frequent team retreats and a genuine love of the products that are sold. Company culture is unforgiving of anything less than 100% buy-in of the leftist group-think.
good,Good atmosphere & culture. Philosophy is taught & demonstrated at all levels. Fun place to work with supportive team members.
good,"I think it isn't necessarily a bad place to work. The company has very high standards, high quality of products, and great morals. There also seems to be plenty of opportunity for further advancement within the company as long as you are willing to work for it which is a good thing. However, the issue for me was that they hired me because of my experience within the grocery business but they started me at part time hours with a very low rate of pay. I was told not to worry because with my experience and if I work hard that I would gain full time hours and a raise very shortly. Upper management very shortly realized that I was more than just a part-time pack out guy and that I should certainly have more responsibilities and more hours which I was given. However, I was moved from a pack-out guy to the dairy buyer position without a raise. Now, I am not one to complain and I am fully aware that when one starts somewhere new, that one must work his/her way up. However, I was traveling a very long commute and was certainly not be compensated fairly for the quality of work I was providing. The majority of my paycheck was going back into the gas tank. When I expressed my concerns to management I feel as though they brushed me off and didn't take me seriously. Finally, when I gave my notice that I would be leaving indefinitely, management panicked and offered me chump change for a raise. It almost seemed like a slap in the face because A.) they were clearly able to give me a raise but were holding out, and B.) the raise they offered to make me stay was insulting. Please take note that"
good,"Great company, positive energy."
good,"Whole Foods is a well structured company. However, the team at the Rocky Mountain Bakehouse is in shambles. Once I had learned all the basics, my growth was capped. There is not much room for improvement or moving up. I do everything I can to move around the bread team to learn different aspects of the job."
good,"Pay is decent depending on department. Tenure plays a huge role in scheduling, regardless of work ethic/performance."
good,"My peers made this job enjoyable. It wasn't so much the culture, but the livelihood and personalities of the people I worked with that made going in worth while. The hardest thing, at least for me was moving up, I feel like the politics overruled the reality of what should have been done."
good,"key holder, 4am arrival, bake all morning pastries,and cookies, pound cakes, breads, granola, bread puddings, bagels, donuts.  Fill pastry case, package and display some baked goods.  Tray next day am baking, clean and wash dishes and trays.  Help out front of house (sales, and juice and coffee bar).  "
good,"I worked at the Whole Foods in Addison,TX. The general work ethic I witnessed was a bunch of lazy coworkers and team leaders who get away with doing very little, while a few team members with good work ethics pick up the slack. It's possible to move up within the company, but it has nothing to do with how hard you work. Instead, advancement is based on how well you play the ""kiss a**"" game. In my time there, I witnessed some of the laziest people move up in the company. They did so by socializing and fraternizing with higher ups while their coworkers worked twice as hard to get their work done. Instead of recognizing people who work the hardest, upper management and team leaders will promote you based on whether or not you ""toe the line"" and conform to their ideas and become part of their ""clique"". They are not looking for hard workers and almost seemed threatened by those who are. If you are ""let go"", be prepared to be escorted out the door as if you were a common criminal for all to see on display."
good,"Strange place to work. One of their core values is caring for their employees and yet they do nothing to show for it."
good,"coworkers/management is fairly nice, but it is a lot of manual labor for not a lot of pay."
good,"The customers are not so bad you just have to be able to anticipate needs and be proactive. The co workers are great there and the pay is above average. The only part about this job that is horrible is that management will fire anyone over small things. No matter how many years you have been working there as well they will not even consider that. I was fired for giving someone an extra discount by accident, the added discount was about 1-2 dollars. So even though I had been there for a long time and was a dedicated employee they decided to fire me over a couple of dollars. Great place but have to stay on your toes at all times."
good,"a typical day of me working at whole foods was pretty good, my manager the one who hired me, is awesome and funny and a good guy."
good,I was in high school when I worked here and it taught me a lot. They usually tired to help you in life whether it was advancement inside or outside the company they were generally supportive.
good,",36 hour work week, diverse customers and Team Members. Hardest part of my job is coming up with Projection and staying within budget."
good,"unload truck, stocking, cashier, customer service answering the food"
good,"I loved being apart of a team that encouraged and motivated their staff. This place was upbeat, fun and never a dull moment."
good,Whole Foods is not a bad place to work. I believe they give their selves too much credit with their core values because not every employee there lives up to them. I believe that Whole Foods has the best Benefits and Compensation.
good,"I have worked at Whole Foods market for two years. It is a good place to work, but I am starting to feel like its a dead end. I work all shifts openings, mid shifts and closings, but I tend to work more mornings. When  I open at work I'm there at 6 am. In the morning I am responsible for getting the department ready for the day. I usually start by turning on all the equipment and getting all baked bread out onto the sales floor. After this outside vendors come in and I am responsible for putting their products on the sales floor. After this our shipments from our regional bake house and other suppliers come in on pallets and I break down pallets and put products and supplies in their appropriate places. The store opens at 8 and at this point I move onto packaging the baked products and moving them onto the sales floor. After all that is done I will spend the rest of my shift filling shelves and baking bread off and helping customers."
good,I loved working for this company for the most part but I had to quit because of personal reason
good,"i was working at the whole foods in Manhattan on 59th street Columbus circle, aka the busiest Whole Foods in the world. It was crowded every single day. Constant tourists, homeless people who just love that bathrooms, a lot of people who don't speak English. Co workers are pretty awesome. You get a lot of free food, which is cool because the food is extremely expensive. The supervisors are really awesome and don't just sit around all day because they are always needed. The only time it is slow at this store is within the hour of opening, when it is closing (there's usually still a line past 11pm), and that's it. The starting pay for cashiers is $10.00 an hour which is good if you're a teenager and it's one of your first jobs. If you are requesting a day off, do yourself a favor and make a copy of the paper, make sure your switches were approved and always make a copy of your schedule and anything you sign regarding your schedule, i.e switches, requesting off, picking up or giving up a shift, etc. management is a pain. When they were letting me go my manager was smiling the ENTIRE time. She was literally jumping up and down in her chair waiting for me to sign the papers.she really did not like me at all and i really don't know why because i never got in trouble, was always on time, and kept to myself (mind you, for being 2 minutes late and reportedly not having an excuse for calling out even though i told them my my glasses broke, had new glasses, a receipt for them, and a record of an eye doctor appt) Then some new lady was trying to belittle me telling me if i ever get a job"
good," A typical day at work could be something different every day. I am a dairy specialist, that’s part of the grocery department and it’s a step up.  Not everyone in grocery works dairy.  In addition to that I also work in grocery some days or just help out normally, At times I also work in the Bulk foods department and frozen they are real big on teamwork witch is great.  Customer service is the main part of the job and it’s not normal what and where it’s very specific so you answers have to be knowledgeable.  The management team is decent it all depends on the person some are fit to lead more than others.  Most of the Co-workers are great and that’s one thing that makes the whole team work.  The hardest part of the job is the attention to detail and there is a lot of it, it doesn’t matter if your facing/fronting/blocking/ or pulling tags, rotating, perfection is the name of the game and I am good at it.  The best part about the job would be the people, if you like working with people this is a good place to work."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Whole foods Market are the customers. They became my friends through the years. I truly enjoy Sales and Customer Service. I would sometimes open the department at 5:00am and other times, I would close and clean and leave the department at 12:00am.  I got along great with my co-workers. I was like the Teams Mom. Managment-varied through the years that I worked at WFM. "
good,Whole foods is a very fun and educational work environment for the food knowledge. I enjoyed everything I learned from my experiences in the past few years as in the company. Like many of my jobs in the food industry I have learned different management styles when working from kitchens to retail. The most challenging and enjoyable part of this job has been dealing with many different customers and staff while finding ways to accommodate their needs on a daily bases.
good,"Whole Foods Market's strengths lie in providing exceptional quality foods and products for customers through strict quality standards. Where Whole Foods Market falls short under is, at least particularly in the store I work in, is the management structure, employee happiness, and affordability from the consumer's view point. A typical day at work in my position consists of providing friendly, informative, and efficient customer service. Working with co-workers will be tough, especially when surrounded by those whom really do not qualify for their position, unwilling to perform tasks that require even the most minimal amount of energy such as smiling. Management is subpar at best and job advancement is a joke. The most enjoyable part of working at Whole Foods is networking with interesting individuals, education about food in general and quality of foods, and incentives to better your health. Starting pay is good, $10.00. raises seem to be delayed exponentially for unknown or inane reasons."
good,"A very fast pace workplace. I have learned about many more foods(produce,meat,cheese and wine). The hardest part of the job is keeping good comuication. Cooking the Product was very enjoyable."
good,"I love the company and what they stand for, they are true to their values and I respect their mission. They took good care of me and the management really cared about their employees but I required a stable, if flexible, set schedule and they could not provide one with the stability I required."
good,The hardest part of my job was makin sure everyone that vist and left the store wass very happy when they exit my store.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of coming in and cashing in a till. Which consisted of counting out the starting money for the shift. I learned better cash handling and customer service skills, working in the city surrounded by wealthy businesses taught me how to interact with all sorts of personalities and needs of people. My co-workers were all very friendly and helpful when needed. They were all very positive towards customers and fellow employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. The head team leader was absent most shifts and demanded unreasonable expectations from employees. Also had a bad reputation within the entire company as being a horrible boss as well as the highest record of letting employees go for no reason."
good,"great environment, lack of hours to survive! Very fun laid back environment but when it came to surviving off of the amount of hours we were given, things changed."
good,"A typical day at work in the grocery department consist of packing out mercahndise, facing product and answering the endless questions from customers. The hardest part of the job is being able to maintain sanity due to excessibly rude customers."
good,"Overall, Whole Foods is a great company to work for, but depending on the location the qualities change dramatically. The starting pay is great, and the introduction into the company is good. But the longer one has been there things can begin to move in a negative direction."
good,It Was a Good Place To Make Good Amount of Money But Never Had Time For Personal Life
good,this is a fast paste enviroment. depending on the deparment the you are working in management is pretty good. the co-worker are the ones who make the day go by quicker.
good,Learning new things and it has friendly people. Team Leaders make questionable decisions .
good,"each store in the company is granted a great deal of autonomy, so the culture tends to differ from store to store, depending on the store's leadership. however, financial goals are set by regional leadership, and the stores are held accountable to achieve them."
good,I worked there before Amazon...it really depended on the current store director. I worked there before Amazon so I don't know much about it now. There was a high turnover at times.
good,"After they cut out team members , the job changed as did the experience for customers. Giving team members expectations they cannot meet is impossible"
good,i was working there for almost 3 years overnight it was pretty good great overnight team but daytime managers and other workers makes alot of changes constant complaining. the schedules were never flexible
good,"I started at WF not understanding that the culture there at the time was centered solely on team members and their training . I was use to other retail outlets doing the ""trial by fire "" method of training . I really enjoyed working there but the culture slowly changed and sadly it became basically another grocery store that worries more about bottom line to the point of only hiring part time employees."
good,It wasn't the best management and the hours were cut a lot most of the hours were closing or mid shifts. they were not understanding with personal or family related matter either.
good,"I left because I was repeatedly held back in many ways, if asking for a full time position it would be closed or disclosed to other employees. I needed to go back to college and they let others change their schedule but asked me for verification. I have witnesses to this behavior. Also some management would regularly gossip."
good,You get paid 15/hr but you don’t get the hours to match that. It’s not hard at all you really just stand there and talk to customers all day. But the hours just aren’t there.
good,Anyone who think you can live on $12/hr Is crazy. After TAX and medical fees it is about $7-8/hr. Try to make a living on that in New York or Connecticut! Good luck!
good,"The work is not a problem , very easy to be good at this job. I felt under appreciated by the manager but enjoyed my coworkers. I was not offered a position for the following summer because i signed out incorrectly too many time but was not aware of this fact until it was brought to my attention at the end of the summer. I felt that that was an unfair justification of not being offered a job for the next summer, that is why I feel the way I do about the management."
good,"During my 2.5 years at wholefoods, my overall experience wasn't awful, rather, the manager I had was awful and didn't make me want to work there. Wholefoods suffers from having tenured managers who shouldn't be managers in positions of power and who have terrible people skills and lack any resemblance of leadership."
good,"Whole Foods provides a ton of training and growth opportunity, lots of online classes and of-site classes as well. I personally have developed into a highly qualified professional through my years at Whole Foods. Unfortunately, Whole Foods is not a place where you want to spend your whole career. They drive their employees insanely hard and do not compensate very well. Managers can expect to start around 40-45K with no more than a 5% increase once per year, that is non-negotiable ( that policy is new since Amazon buy out, but it is the policy). The work load is immense, as a manger expect to not only fulfill all the duties of a GM, but also serve as the team HR point, dealing with any and all issues that arise. You will be paid hourly and the benefits are very average considering the size of the company. Good luck, definitely work for this company at some point, take every class you possibly can and apply for any promotion that opens, just don't stay for more than 5 years."
good,"The company was sold to California based company, it was not the same place to work as in the earlier years.I don't know about the other departments, but the workers that had been there from the beginning were very unhappy."
good,"I worked for the company for years but team member happiness and loyalty no longer matter. The pay is great and the job can be easy and simple but if you're not liked by leadership and/or have differing views, you won't last."
good,Whole food needs to have support for there staff they have no representation for the employees it's unfair treatment to people who receive compliments from customers and they're not recognize for that are only recognized for anything negative a customer says and that's not fair to only have three people report you in a negative sense and they fire you you have no one to represent you and to fight your case they don't show you proof p
good,There was not effective communication between a lot of the management and staff there. Constant change of management and introductions of newer leaders would constantly change the way things were done drastically.
good,It’s a good work environment when you start off. Benefits and pay rate is great. Couple weeks in you will see the BS and messiness with management. Not as family focused as they make it seem. Your stats on the front end registers matter more than the well being of employees.
good,"Worked at Whole Foods for a year an a half to 2 years and it was my first real job so i really enjoyed it. Met some good friends, had some solid hours, learned alot of just the job itself and the workforce in general. Became full time pretty quickly then trainer shortly afterwards. Great manager and team at first but left due to management changes and one of the managers kept using the affirmative action laws to protect himself from criticism and used that to pretty much bully everyone else into seeing things his way and exempt him from punishment and they refused to do anything about it brand I was getting forced into situations by this guy that could've gotten me in trouble with the job. Had to leave shortly after that occurred. So that is my review."
good,"Fun interactive place to work, job competition, department managers feel privileged. Everyone looks out for themselves because they dont want you to take their job. Makes it very hard to work there."
good,"Everyone you work with is wonderful, but the company has complete control over your life. Requesting a specific schedule or shift is near impossible and they shame you for even attempting to"
good,"Fun company to work for. Ping Pong tables in kitchen, casual dress code, open space, bring dogs to work. "
good,"The people here are nice and mostly fun to work with. Whole Foods really advocates working as a team and has good ideals. "
good,"Very chaotic and miscommunicated information especially in high volumn. Shoe compensation which is nice, discount helps but not a lot, see too much waste, it's either good and simple or pure dumb"
good,"Overall a pretty chill environment, but there could sometimes be some disputes among the Whole Foods workers and the Amazon associates. It is a very cramped workplace and it's very hard to get a raise or promotion."
good,"It is a great company to work for if your only focus is to work. If you are a college student, I would advise finding a different job. Also, not a great place to work if you are looking for a relaxed work environment. Most days, I would leave stressed, exhausted, and sore."
good,"I enjoyed working at the store, however, the don't pay much.  They lute you in with promises they don't always keep."
good,"It was alot drama. Just seem everyone was in a bad mood because people are always quiting, not showing up. Some people were nice. Lack of leadership from higher up in the office."
good,"My time with Whole Foods was interesting."
good,"Had to lift pull clean and stack boxes and I had to average a 160 or up while I was work"
good,"I loved my job at whole foods. I made really good friends there, but when Amazon took over i was given the $15 ph that Amazon prided itself on and 5 years of hard work were flushed down the toilet as i was making the same as the new hires."
good,I worked there while the store was just opening. Many mistakes were made and a lot of things were overlooked. Our department expected more from us than we were able to accomplish. They did not truly care about the staff and their well-being.
good,"Not a bad place to work as far as pay, benefits, relaxed dress code, and diversity. As with all retail jobs schedule is inconsistent  and the store only closes one day a year(Christmas). Huge employee turnover its like a revolving door. Few last long including management."
good,"I feel as though whole foods use to be a fun place to work for with lots of team building and team member focus as well as to provide the best possible resource to the customer with the best customer service. now, I feel as though it is more market and corporation driven. it only cares at the end of the day how much money. team members are no longer taken care of and the focus has shifted to other things."
good,"While it depends on the person, there is a mixture of people who work there that take their job as a job or as a career.  Opportunities for growth are limited and management seemed lackluster.  But, the pay is nice and you have the luxury of clocking in, clocking out, and leaving work at work.  Fun coworkers and everyone treats everyone like family."
good,"Everyone is usually in a good mood, but the workplace is very strict and it's very hard to work your way up because it's so competitive. For example, I worked part-time as a cashier and if I wanted more hours I would have to apply for full-time and compete against all of the other employees I work with which caused some tension between employees. Thats what I saw and from my experience."
good,Productive workplace with many benefits but low pay and small raises. I didn't really see any room for growth so I went to take my path else where in other jobs
good,"Worked the coffee bar/espresso machine, assisted customers in beer and cheese.I learned many things about how exact coffee needed to be prepared, learned amply of beer and dug more into cheese. Would've loved to have stayed but couldn't get full time with benefits."
good,Overall perfect work enviorment. Other than how everyone coons out to the job. The people who have been there for years will try to get you out LOL...
good,"A typical day at work would consist of breaking down loads and working it to the shelf or table. Depending on witch dept you were in. The hardest part of the job, was not getting all of the proper training that you needed to survive your workplace culture. The most enjoyable part was meeting all of the new customers & employees. The STL & or his ASTL's would make their rounds and then disappear to the office to work. I learned this the hard way, to just keep your head down and do your job."
good,"If you’re on management’s good side, you get the highest raises ($1/year) and you have more opportunity to advance. But it’s a grocery store, and I was helping head up the meat and seafood section which is shockingly physical. In my optionion, we weren’t paid enough to wake up at 3am and smash ice into solid blocks every day. People often got injured on the job. All in all though, I would go back if asked. It is a nice culture, great discount, fun people, just really physically damanding."
good,"I worked tirelessly for Whole Foods.  I was passed over for promotion several times, always to a male coworker.  My male coworkers were compensated much more generously."
good,"I feel that the WFM structure works very well. You are given a lot of training long before you ever actually start your first day, and are guided fairly well with the expectations for you job duties. Once you join a team you have to work hard to prove yourself to your team, because after 90days the team gets to vote and decide if you are right for the position. otherwise you must leave the department and seek opportunities in other departments, if they are willing to consider you. Over all I really enjoyed my time working at WFM, i was just unfortunate to have a poor retention of Team Leaders, as well as other upper management positions. Our location did very well with sales, but there were always issues with not having support from store management."
good,Nice team environment. Never a dull moment. Great for someone who likes to stay busy. If you like dispatch and working with others for a common goal than this is a recommended position.
good,"the team members that I worked with were great, but management as a whole was hit or miss.  I received little to no training in my position/positions."
good,"When I started with WF in the Prepared Foods dept in 2007 at the old Lincoln Park Store (LCN), they were still a hippy-dippy company with a rosy view of their position in the marketplace as their availability of organic goods adhering to ethical standards distinctly set them apart from most other grocers. They created a lot of conscious conversation about what we put in our bodies, and were very much on the forefront of the evolving food culture in America."
good,Not to much to say but all we had to load and unload the trucks that were coming in and out. Had to be able to lift  25-50 lbs. easy work if you ask me.
good,"Great way to meet cool people, lots to do to keep me busy. Learned a lot about customer service, purchasing, and leadership. Wholefoods is a corporate company now owned by amazon with lots of opportunities."
good,It was alright. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. It wasn’t too bad it’s was alright for the most part it was okay to be honest it was not toooo
good,"It depends on which store you work at. If you can find one with fair and good leadership, it's a dream to work at. The ones that operate on nepotism are a nightmare."
good,"Learning is paramount in this company, always some new E-learning to undertake, new ideas and ways to provide healthy and sustainable food. Great business model"
good,"Days are spent swapping between tills and ringing up customers. When problems arise we are, depending on the seriousness of the situation, allowed to deal with it ourselves or ask our team or store team leader to help difuse the situatiuon."
good,"Whole Foods has good food.  I appreciated the opportunity to work there. The management in my department was new so there were a few mistakes, but that is to be expected. overall a good place to work."
good,WFM is a great place to work for people that are passionate or curious about food. They provide food education ranging from organics handling to food origins. They have solid sustainability practices. Recycle/Compost etc.
good,"WFM use to be a great place to work with a fabulous culture. Corporate structure, unfortunately, has taken a bit of the soul. It still provides a great product."
good,"I enjoyed working at Whole Foods, Paramus NJ. The fact that I attended Culinary school didn't seem to matter in the Bakery. There were team members that had no formal training and were making the same salary as me, which is disheartening. Annual pay increases were very low, about $0.40, and you had to fill out paper work and sit in front of a panel of all team leaders to tell them why you'd like a raise.  The benefits are good, Health insurance and 401K. I worked a total of 3 years here.  It was time to move on."
good,"Working overnight is very stressful and is the backbone to the store, since we put the product on the shelf , or dont put it on the shelf. In the 4 months that i worked there i saw 10 or so people quit or relocate from my store , including our store manager and the person right under them. We were left with 2 supervisors to run the whole store and it honestly is a very hard environment to be in. My team only has two other people on it, which leads to lonnnngggg hours and high expectations from the store. If we dont put it on the shelf, it wont go on the shelf. There is poor communication skills and hard to get points across. On the way in to the company i really thought ""this is the job for me"" everyone was so kind and they really take the time to get to know you in orientation and you feel valuable to the team."
good,"Great busines. Provide benefits and such. However, advancement seemed to be ""dead-end"" scenarios. Better positions are given over seniority and types of degrees held and not based and job performance. Looked forward to working for Whole Foods Market. Whole Foods Market simply does not pay enough to pay the bills for your average American."
good,"Very competitive Team Leaders and colleagues and surprisingly very understanding. The warehouse is cold as expected, I got a good workout by working there and ate some good food. The pay did not come near the importance of labor being done on a daily basis."
good,It was a fast paced and high volume environment. People from every walk of life are and went through those doors.  It could be difficult keeping enough carriages available in the store during the holidays.
good,ok job. Very Diverse. Managers worked with you as much as possible. Great store discount on all products. More so for college and high school kids unless in a manager position.
good,"There is always work to be done. On weekends is the hardest days to work. Breaking pallets, packing out and fixing backstock is a normal routine for my job. The best part of the job is the when we are done breaking all the pallets and the backstock looks clean and neat makes you feel proud of you’re hard work."
good,Had to wait six months before benefits kicked in. It was easy work but very repetitive. Hours are pretty extreme. Either very early or very very late.
good,It’s a retail store with good food and benefits it also have a diversely spread for the first week and then a dozen people who had is the one with a fever of and the first time since I got three to go eat a dozen and a then back to sleep and until the morning I got three to go to pick up the
good,"They're very team orientated so there is usually not too much of a workload for any one individual unless it's peak hours or the weekend. When the weekends or holidays arrive, brace yourself."
good,"Things are changing everyday at Whole Foods and not for the better at least where the employee is concerned. For the customers there are better deals since Amazon bought the company but many customers are disappointed about many of the products that have been removed due to Amazon and their ""vision"" of the future"
good,"Whole Foods preaches good principles for employee treatment, but has a very strict method and workplace culture. It tries to mold people to fit their culture, but it feels rather cult-like, and it isn't for everyone. Their methods are rigid and you either fall in line or its your fault for whatever you don't understand."
good,I loved working there for the first six months but it became very hard to balance work and school to the point that the job made my school work very hard.
good,"Prior to Amazon purchasing Whole Foods, the culture was fun and relaxed. Afterwards it felt stressed and threatening. Management is unable to compatmentalise the heavy direction and takes it out on team members. High turnover results in considerable work overload for others. They truly do not appreciate or recognize their best team members."
good,"Good place to work, just doesn't fit my personal needs as much anymore. Recent acquisition has changed a lot of the basic philosophy that I believe made WFM more than just a grocery store."
good,"Learned new natural holistic self care routines"
good,"Loved the people I worked around and our guest not much advancement oppertunity, some staff play favorites, loved the community support. Family activities"
good,"It is a job, but don't expect to be a good one.  Hours all over the place, but they paid okay.  You spend most of your time managing their expectations."
good,"Whole Foods has changed a lot in the last two years working there and even more so with in the last 6 months. Whole foods isn't nessicarily the worst job ever its pretty stress free and a their befits are great. However the work environment,mangement,focus of time and work ethics of the store have degrade here especially after amazon bought them out."
good,"The most fantastic and the most unqualified people can be found working at Whole Foods. It is the great paradox of it.  You can learn so much from the old school management, but other management tends to play that game of ""playing by the book"". It not only is a lie to themselves, but a lie to the clientele that believes all employees are top notch, as the price they pay for the products sold there."
good,"We are constantly short handed and as such somewhat overworked.  We get a lot of lip service from management about how things will get better, more help, etc.  This is frustrating in that since we got bought over by another major corporation, no managers seem to know what the rules are anymore or where the company is heading."
good,Whole Foods in general is great. Cashier position is probably the more stressful of positions at the store. Especially come holiday time. Management was usually pretty good about acknowledging time off if you put it in by a couple weeks or so.
good,Whole Foods Market is a great job for anyone just entering the workforce. The company pays more than minimum wage and has many entry level jobs available. It is harder for people with families because there are limited full time positions and opportunities to advance.
good,"Good company to work for with really good Medical & Dental Plans / Insurance available."
good,"This is a retail job through and through. It's difficult to move up, no one is paid enough for how hard they work, but the hours are flexible generally. It was my best option while going to college full time. I worked in the prepared foods department, and often had to stay late to clean, after most everyone else in the store had left. I recommend it if you want to learn a lot really fast about managing your time and getting used to working in a commercial kitchen, but I would not recommend this as a career option."
good,"My manager has very poor people skills, speaks very little and poor English. Often she is under a lot of job related stress here attitude is what  I consider nasty management is often on her case and her poor job performance. if only I could get in to another department."
good,"In about 2013, this company was an ideal place for which to work. As it changed and positioned itself to be sold, the bottom line was looked at and the draw of the company was lost. Instead of focusing on employee happiness, resulting in higher sales, the focus was making money and cutting labor and benefits."
good,Selecting is not compensated well enough for the work that we do. The hours are tedious and the management is poorly trained a very biased work place.
good,"Not awful, not amazing. It all depends on how busy your location is and what department you work for. I worked in Customer Service, which was known for its high turnover rate because of how hectic the department can get. My advice is to just try to make the best out of it and always remember that it's just a grocery store."
good,Most supervisors and managers have very little experience managing people.   Really no information flow exists and the hands on people skills are pretty bad with both customer interaction and handling subordinate issues.  Stressfully busy at times and most departments operate under-staffed about 80 percent of the time.
good,"I enjoyed working at WholeFoods but once the buy out from Amazon there were several changes that did hinder a lot of people causing more stress than need be. My coworkers were fantastic on my team, but my management was sup-par."
good,"Working every day with the public, face to face. Allows me to learn how to deal with the public on a daily bases.There are all types of people that you can meet in one day, it's amazing. Not only do you have to deal with the public, co-workers can be just as crazy. Always learning something new every day."
good,"Great company that focues on providing healthy food without sacrifing taste, clean food. Internally the company to support retail stores with effective leadership"
good,"over all a cut throat shiesty environment."
good,"whole foods was a great atmosphere to work, I learned a lot about organic foods and vitamins  met a lot of great people, i am very people oriented so being able to move freely thru the store while working put me in contact with many different people"
good,"As a dishwasher, I constantly washed and put away dishes. Sometimes I'd prepare food, serve and scale out food, service customers and stock inventory. The work never ended, but I got paid okay (considering this was my first job) and my co-workers were nice. My ""team leader"" (manager) was a lazy slacker though and nobody appreciates that."
good,"Overall the company was alright, but if you didn't work your way up and had been there for years, your ideas and opportunities at the manager level were extremely limited."
good,"Great people, working along side you. My managers were honest, direct, and understanding. Shifts varied for most. Work life balance is not good. Stressful at times because lack of bodies on the floor. Fun cutting meat! My last store TL was great leader. WFM used to have a soul but then it had to do what it had to, to survive competition, I get that. The fall was slow and painful, but I will always cherish the good times. Great discounts, PTO, hourly wage, and PEOPLE you work with."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting nice customers and talking with them."
good,"it's started off great, but once you do 1 thing they don't like it's hard for you to get back in their good graces & move up."
good,The job itself was sub-par but the people I worked with were some of the best people I have ever met. We created a family environment. I did have the opportunity to move forward but it is  not a company which supports your self care or wellness.
good,Difficult place to advance due to lack of clearly stated goals/requirements. Advancement often came with knowing the right people vs actual performance and KPI.
good,When the company is making money everyone is happy you can have a win streak going for 2 plus years and the minute you get into a slump for like a month you the cancer they have to cut out.
good,"There are some opportunities for advancement but Whole Foods is very good at promoting the wrong people and there is a culture that you will have a hard time moving up in if you're not in with the right people. That said, it can be a great place to work if you're on a team with great people."
good,"I would recommend whole foods to anyone looking for a job, its a great company. The culture of the company is unlike any other retailer I've ever shopped or seen."
good,"I maintained a clean work place prep food. Made sandwiches ,pizza anything the customer wanted.Greet customers at all times. Resolve issues when customer needed help . One store one team."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a fast paced environment that looks into catering towards individuals that are eating with health in mind. From former experience, it was an opportunity in developing customer experience and witnessing every variety of customers. If you are looking to build up your profile/resume, Whole Foods is a good cornerstone to begin with."
good,"Good atmosphere, laid back. Nice people, informational in regards to products and what to expect from customers who may have questions. Overall it was a positive experience."
good,"fun place to work pay not great benefits are good wish there was more training and flexible hours "
good,great benefits and 20% discounts on any items in store  the hardest part of the job is keeping up with whole foods attendance policies and the enjoyable part is meeting a lot of new people
good,"I learned a lot. I chose to leave to pursue other avenues. I am glad I left when I did because soon after, score cards were implemented and forced employees to endure too much stress. The whole culture has changed, I am told. Many of the people I used to work with were fired for conflated reasons. Crying is normal. They pay well, for a price."
good,"great company, fun and fast paced grocery environment; team members are strong and passionate; good work/life balance; strong culture; lacking diversity in leadership"
good,"Whole foods is pretty much ""what you see is what you get."" The employees are eclectic and often very friendly. The management team is working hard to make sure everyone rotates through tasks as required. The customers are what make the job draining overall, but this is pretty average for any customer service position. There is upward mobility within the company, but be prepared to put in your blood, sweat and tears to qualify for higher positions."
good,"Whole foods used to be an amazing company to work for until 2017 when OTS (order to shelf) was started. A typical day at work consists of prepping fruits and veggies for making juices/smoothies and making sure everything is very clean, along with customers service. It is a very team oriented place- which is great. The hardest part of my job would be that we are under staffed and the workload one team member is held to is easily a 2 person job. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with."
good,Its just another  dead end grocery store job. Not a very fun place and the customers are on another level when it comes to entitlement. They will give you 40 hours if you like and there are opportunities for OT. Coworkers are usually nice but the turnover is very fast.
good,"Everything was fine, the other employees were nice and the customers were okay. The best part of the job was getting to eat the free samples after work."
good,"A typical day would be to get your station together for your shift , i learned to listen , pay attention , go beyond yourself , understand different people and cultures , management is fair , work place culture is fair , if you can work in warm temperatures around rotisserie ovens and a tight space , I enjoyed meeting new people , dishes I never thought I would try ."
good,"The greatest advantage of working for Whole Foods Market is the opportunity for advancement and the great team atmosphere. Unfortunately, the pay for the level of responsibility and work life balance is low (low pay and inconsistent & varying shifts/hours), which creates high turnover and leaves many team members struggling to fulfill the needs of the departments.  Also, team members are inconsistently paid for the exact same position (one team member could easily be paid several dollars per hour more than another, for the exact position/responsibility level)."
good,"This company can be okay to work for. It really all depends on if you are lucky to get a good TL, ATL and STL. I've worked for both good ones and bad ones and it really, really makes a difference. This is a fast pace job and can be stressful at times. I enjoy the culture of WF the most. It;s the people that make being there the best"
good,"The workplace culture is about helping each other in the team, that resonates to good customer service. "
good,"Lots of turnover in my department led to uncovered shifts. I often had to come in on my day off or for six or seven days in a row. Sometimes we would not work well as a cohesive unit."
good,"Enjoy my co workers, culture is laid back. some areas lack organization, motivation and morale. Pay is okay. My job is enjoyable. the work with my kids schedule."
good,"Whole Foods can easily become a stressful and overwhelming environment but I have found it to be a place where I feel at home. Not many jobs have I felt as though I can be my true, authentic self and finally, I have found a job where coworkers, guests (some), and management embrace me for who I am. If it wasn't for the great team I work with, I don't know if I'd want to endure some of the lousy attitudes rude customers take. It's all what you make of it. It quickly becomes clear how like-minded the people around you are! Whether that's good or bad..."
good,"This is a fine place to work, and probably better than most food jobs, but not anything special. Supervisors didn't know what they were talking about. Expect to be underpaid."
good,working at Whole Foods has allowed me to grow in my pastries skills. Whole Foods health insurance is affordable but the deductibles are too high. Earn paid time off every 500 hours worked.
good,Whole Foods has raised the quality of grocery stores and the quality of jobs for employees of the industry.  They usually invest in their employees and foster internal growth. The real drawback to the job is a problem with the grocery industry - tight margins equal fairly low pay.
good,I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods. I did not work there under Amazon ownership so I do not know how that changed the culture. I know they lowered the ridiculously high prices so I am sure that improved sales. How that translates to employees I do not know.
good,You can learn a couple of stuffs from here but management is bad in the store level. I had a team leader who hated me and didn't giv me the time to learn on he job.
good,Overall a decent job to work at. Company is undergoing drastic changes at the moment so anything can happen. But it is a very great learning experience
good,"Currently short of staff, which makes it very stressful for current employees and requesting time off. Schedules aren't very flexible. Management is average."
good,Working at Whole foods is easy you are given a task maybe asked to juggle another and that's a typical day easy. I learned nothing new that i had not already known from previous employment which was unsatisfying. Work place culture was the only enjoyable part of this job the location I work it was diverse and almost everyone was friendly.
good,"Got a 20% discount on groceries for employees. The job wasn't hard, but my manager was rather poor at the management side of his job. Got tired of having to get shifts covered because he couldn't remember my availability while I was in classes."
good,"Supervisory position equals universal cover all. If you can do it all then you will be a good fit. Workplace culture is strong and hip, but when it comes to Hawaii culture, there is a clash of interest. White collar values vs. the blue collar ideals. As for job security, when the company is in growth, restructure is very common and supervisory roles are at risk."
good,"If you are like me, you get tired of doing the samethings over and over. So cashing someone out for 8 hours a day can get pretty frustrating. Interacting with co workers and customers are the highlight of the day. But sometimes you just need something that will cause you to grown especially if you are around the age of 20 and 28."
good,I think the idea behind whole foods is great but the long beach location left me with a bad taste. Informed in the front end and the lead customer service manager is a lifer who likes to crush anyone who has ambition greater than hers.
good,"Team member happiness and excellence used to be a core value but it dropped by the wayside. While work life balance was very important for decades, it disappeared at least if you were management. There was a lack of direct communication with vague insinuations that created fear in the team member base. Direction was often given to do multiple things that were not possible and when asked for direction, none was given. "
good,"A typical day at work would include flexibility and being ready for change. I've learned a lot about organics and quality standards whilst working for WFM. I also learned and grew a lot for and about myself. Whole Foods brought me out of my shell and allowed me to flourish. Leadership (aka management) is eager to see you do just that, spread your wings and grow. Whole Foods Culture is generally inviting and open. The hardest part of the job depends on who you and your leadership is, it could be the procedural things, though it could be the competition in the grocery world. The best part of working for Whole Foods is the change, leaning to love it and be adaptable to it is very rewarding, not to mention the guest interaction. We have the most loyal guests in our stores, it's a light to see."
good,It was great in the beginning and allowed for creativity but the culture changed and it is now just a regular grocery chain. There is limited room for advancement and growth.
good,whole foods is a good company but with many flaws such as its very easy to get terminated. Employee appreciation isn't truly practiced even though its part of their motto.
good,Can be a good job depending on the leadership in the department. Turnover rate is very high as they often terminate employees with no evidence of wrong doing.
good,"All in all, a good company to work for; as the industry changes so do the job requirements. Employees must meet these demands and excel, sometimes at the expense of their area(s) of expertise."
good,"Productive and fun place to work "
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, slow pace. decentralized structure makes process improvement slow and difficult. Central office has very little authority to make changes at the regional level."
good,"Hours vary from day to day, week to week, and for someone who likes to plan and have a set schedule it's hard to plan and schedule appointments/outings or anything when you don't get your schedule until the week before. There's lots of turnover and hard get the time off when you are short staffed. Management can be very understanding and accommodating to an extent. This was not the job for me; I like organization, communication, clear direction and cleanliness."
good,Cooking and preparing food such as pizza salads and pub food. The culture was a but strange.  Whole foods was good at marketing and tricking customers. Most people shopping there thought everything from rotisserie chicken to pizza was organic.
good,"No one really went there to buy organic, Nothing was recycled, contradicting message of company, very isolated in department. Ability to improve was always possible, and beneficial from supervisors."
good,"You have to work hard to gain a livable income, management does acknowledge hard work. Over time, benefits disappeared and so did respect for the 'store level' employees."
good,Opening store was tough and the trainers were not amply training the staff. I learned how hard it is purchasing for a department while learning a new system on the fly. Met a good group of co workers.
good,"its alright but nothing cool, daily customer interaction but limited pay and benefits with high deductible. Management is all moving on as the company stock has been dropping so have standards but overall good place and vibe to be a part of."
good,Short lunch breaks only 30 minutes. Management spying on team members. Management was not professional majority was personal. Don't allow your strong characteristics show. They smother your inner profession.
good,"The best part of this job is working at an interesting business. I learned a lot about food and health. The hardest part of the job is the lack of pay. Overall, a good company and good grocery store to work for."
good,It's definitely not the worst place to work but each Whole Foods varies from store to store. I opened up a newer Whole Foods with less than satisfactory results whereas an already established store is more desired.
good,"Whole Foods is a decent place to work, you start with a 20% discount and it can go up from there. You have a chance to get a raise after the first 6 months and then every year after that. They generally pay above minimum wage and you have every right to ask anyone how much they make, even people in management. The environment can be fun and laid back depending on which department you work at. You can get paid time off but you have to work a certain amount of hours first. They also generally do very well with college students and are willing to work around school schedules."
good,"Managers doing nothing but just walk around and boss other employees around. Lots of favoritism, makes the other employees feel less acknowledged.... this job is not for everyone."
good,"I certainly don't miss it. "
good,"Work could be overbearing, lots of responsibilities for one person. Coworkers willing to help if able. Culture was very strict. Some management were not willing to make agreements with workers, regarding scheduling."
good,"But its bootycheeks, as a full time cashier anyway. You feel like a drone, you also end up doing jobs that are not in the job description but without the extra pay. good luck."
good,"Work load verys depending on time of the year. Lots of costumer service. Lots of micro training on new products, health, over all well being and safety."
good,"Days are spent preparing food as well as serving customers. Customer service is needed, however if you don't have any, you usually learn. Management is more of a person with a clipboard telling you what to do, regardless of what can actually be done. Coworkers either become great friends or learn to work with eachother."
good,Fast paced work environment. Good Benefits for full time team members. Company has gone through some changes. Learned many things along the way. The hardest part would probably difficult team members and customers.
good,Has a family feel at times however recent cuts are causing work load to be overwhelming and unachievable within a 40 hour work week. Continuous cut are causing a tremendous amount of stress.
good,Management had no consistency or discipline. There were no real standards of quality and after two years working there my supervisor never took the time to give me a review or raise.
good,"too much time on the road for me and you always had to go to calif."
good,"Whole Foods got by for the longest time on uniqueness, reputation and public goodwill. But as those things have dwindled over the last few years, the company culture has shifted tremendously. The salary and benefits are not commensurate to what you would be making elsewhere. What used to feel like a wonderfully ""non-corporate"" corporate environment has become a pretty standard 9-5."
good,Whole Foods has struggled with new competitors in the Organic industry.  Unfortunately they've responded with layoffs and team consolidations which still have not resulted in overall improvement for the company.
good,"Working the coffee/ juice bar is a fast paced and fun enviroment filled with multitasking galore. You learn about cheeses and different types of alcohols that are served at the bar, as well as the different types of coffees, smoothies, and juices available in the other part of the specialty department."
good,"Not worth working for anymore. unless you want to be worked like an animal, not cared for, and punished for speaking out. even if it's for the better of the company."
good,"I make decent money (for a retail job) but the management is HORRIBLE! Luckily at least 2 of my superiors have good management skills, otherwise im sure the entire customer service team would up and quit. The company its self is good. It all depends on the STORE you work in."
good,"customer service is the main focus"
good,"The best part about working at WFM is the other team members. I've met some really wonderful people working here. However, I think that the company is going downhill. There is too much competition and WF doesn't know how to get back in the game."
good,"Whole Foods Market needs to appreciate their workers more than what they give. Great people, use to be an amazing company to work for. Raises need to be more reasonable. People need to be more appreciated for growing in the company, not favored. Whole Foods workers bust their butts everyday in return for what ?"
good,I learned very well how to communicate well with coworkers as well as with customers and how to provide great customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job was to help customers it was always a nice feeling to know that I was able to be helpful towards them.
good,They are replacing cooks who cook from scratch with bagged food from the same distributor that services Mariano's. Why pay a cook a fair wage when they can hire a teenager for minimum wage to open a bag.
good,"All in all the company provides a nice environment, however, their is a huge lack in the leadership positions. They offer great benefits and it's super easy to transfer stores"
good,"typical work day would be assist customers and process their groceries in all functions such as scanning  items,bagging groceries,suggestive and up selling products, customer service and help out on the guest service on occasions. Maintain attractive customer service displays while supporting regional promotions, such as Whole planet foundation, Whole trade, and give support to local community center for poor families with donated can food and shelter during the holiday season each year."
good,great place to work and develop a career.  work along side hard working team members for the most part a strong leadership group of individuals who all care about what they do and strive to take the company to the next level
good,There are a lot of changes going on with Whole Foods Market as they try to survive in a competitive market.  They are trying to survive and the changes they are making do not align with their core values.
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Whole Foods Market, and am very thankful for the opportunities I was given, the people I was lucky enough to work with and the skills I learned along the way."
good,"I have been working there for many years and it's a fun company to work for.it is very good for people with no or little experience but doesn't provide training once you step up the ladder.no investment on people unfortunately."
good,"Co-workers are typically great, but management is typically incompetent due to moving up too quickly. Hard work is rarely recognized. Moving up is just a matter of doing what Whole Foods refers to as ""due diligence."" The benefits were once outstanding, but they've gradually scaled those back."
good,"Can be a great place to work but can become humdrum or monotonous at times. I personally worked on the customer service team and it does get really boring, not every customer wants to be engaged so it becomes robotic, a going with the motions if you will but much is expected of you from the management and it can seem overwhelming if not unfair at times."
good,"Lots of low morale among coworkers.  Major layoff that was unannounced, causing lots of stress to former and current employees.  My supervisor was highly inappropriate and my senior manager was very favorable of some employees over others regardless of performance."
good,The company was good to work for a couple of years ago. The compensation use be a lot better compared to now as far as taking on more responsibilities.
good,"Love working with a bunch of foodies, love the diversity. The company needs some restructuring as far as management is concerned and there doesn't seem to be a well defined career ladder."
good,"fun, you learn something new everyday. you'll learn more about healthy eating and better products. hardest part of the job are long  hours because they close at 11pm"
good,"TMSL's are basically HR Generalists. We perform all aspects of HR including payroll, training, LOA, employee relations, file maintenance, and performance reviews."
good,"weird place to be with stock price tanking - lots of cost cutting, rumors, etc. leadership claims to be transparent but that's not really the case"
good,"When it comes down to management, politics, and favoritism, the team members are the ones that makes my day easier and productive."
good,it a cool place to work. just another retail type job with the same issues and advantage great for student and people with children
good,"I typically split my time between cashier and receiving, with the main focus on receiving. I have learned how to identify errors on paperwork, how to contact suppliers professionally, open the dock for suppliers/drivers, complete opening/closing paperwork, input new items into the IRMA system. I push myself to improve my personal work and the work of team members."
good,"A lot of work, as soon as you get in there's just a truckload of work to do.  95% of the time you would be left alone at the counter to take care of 15+ people at once sometimes while management and others would walk around and talk to other departments about non-sense.  I've worked at multiple stores and this always seemed to be the case.  I was lucky when I got to work with someone who was awesome and understanding and just wanted to get the work done and go home just as bad as I did after a long day of work and productivity. "
good,"Overall decent place to work although there tends to be a lot of TL who do nothing all day and upper management doesn't seem to address it. Instead they focus on watching TM and nitpicking on their work habits when the TM work the hardest. It was an overall nice place to work at first but now it seems has though team member happiness does not matter much anymore. It all depends on what team you join depending on how you're able to stand working there. If you end up with a horrible TL then it can be a nightmare.  The customers also can be a nightmare and can come off very nasty and self-entitled, but its not so bad if you don't let it get to you"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was my team members. A very talented group of people that shared my passion for food and creating artistic desserts. I've learned many things at Whole Foods, but mostly I've learned that without respect for what you do there is very little loyalty. Being respectful of my peers and their talent opens the door to learn and grow together."
good,I feel that the work place could have been ran a little better than what it was. It wasn't very organized in some of key areas.
good,i learned a lot from working at Whole Foods because it taught me many things at once and can lead me to many opportunities.
good,I enjoyed my time working there until management decided to be shady. They only do what's best for them. They told you one thing then did another.
good,This job is way too physically demanding for a 50 year old.  I hoped for more rapid advancement opportunities than has been available.
good,Whole foods is not the worst place to work however you stay on a very low amount of hours and everything is micromanaged and they do a profit share system. However when you are just starting you make the other people s money for them and get nothing in return which is not really fun.
good,"Typical day at work is quite steady, its gets very busy but I like a medium to fast paced environment it helps the day go by faster. I learned how to count money even quicker thanks to the long lines and hundreds of customers coming through everyday. Co-workers are fun and you'll meet a lot of cool people from all over! Nothing was too hard at the job I handled everything pretty well, my most enjoyable part would probably be clocking out after non-stop cashiering for 5-8 hours. Overall I loved my job!"
good,"leadership is unsupportive. Very judgmental, great for the community, scarce training, nonpolite customers. despite being all about team, they do practice favoritism"
good,ok place to work people are very friendly.Co-workers are the best there management was'nt  the best and team leaders were not so good
good,"Really underqualified and misguided management. Deceiving customers."
good,"Fun place to work, great environment, some of the leadership team doesn't want to see you succeed and would try to hold you back. Even though its a great place to work, if they feel like you don't fit ""the look"" they will get rid of you."
good,"Depending on what position i was scheduled for, the day could be spent ringing up customers, and dealing with complaints they had or pushing in carts and unloading delivery orders. No matter what i was doing that day we always worked in a productive team and made the best out of every situation."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great company still looking to find it's place and identity. Slightly resistant to change, there is much room for growth."
good,"It is a nice place to work and grow with the company, but Team Leaders don't give you the right and proper training they give you the position without training you once you mess up your fired."
good,"- At the start of work I head to the production floor to help the staff break-down the equipment they are finished with for the rest of the evening, and help set-up what they will be using for my shift. After that, I head back to the Maintenance shop and check the daily work orders and consult with the QA team member to see which ones I will be able to accomplish, which all depends on what departments they are running that night. Once that is all figured out, I start knocking them out in-between the calls I receive from production, QA, and sanitation on jobs they need help with ASAP."
good,"My overall experience with Whole Foods Market is that they are a company that was based on wholesome and fair values but has become swallowed in the black hole that is the competitive retail market in this country. I worked in the Prepared Foods Dept. and perhaps experiences in other departments are much more positive, mine, unfortunately, was not."
good,"Whole foods is an incredibly intimate and close knit place to work. The employee/employer relationships are based upon a set of values the company holds stating that there are no real superiors, everyone is apart of a team. Customers love how friendly and easy going whole foods is a market."
good,Work with several team members per day and manage the entire department. I learned how to manage and how to deal with any situation. Management is tough but it makes you learn a lot. The hardest part of the job is constantly having to come up with ideas when you have a hundred of other things going on. The most enjoyable part is the team members.
good,Fun place to work but stalling team members in advancement.
good,"Great atmosphere and corporate culture."
good,"A fun place to work.  My customers loved me. I enjoyed my 4 1/2 years working in nutrition and supplements."
good,"The job is fun, but very demanding.  Must have a passion for food."
good,"Whole Foods is a decent company that offers good benefits, but hires from within, which sometimes can lead to poor leadership."
good,"Never a dull moment, the day goes by quickly."
good,worked there 6 years good work environment company closed due to bad sales and owner's own financial issues.
good,"My position required mostly 5am shifts which made me miserable for a year, but most of my coworkers were amazing and the work I did in the produce department was challenging and enjoyable."
good,"okay place, better than most local jobs but management does not know what to do with my team"
good,"my experience with wf started off good.i worked in prepared foods as a dishwasher.the store i was at was big,and the dishwasher worked not only for pfd,but the bakery also.this meant twice as much work,oppose to a smaller store.the dish machines door broke.the machine was down for five weeks.the work was horrible and the working conditions deplorable.not once did the store tl or atl come by and give support. not one time.one worker after three plus weeks of no machine walked out.after five weeks the part came,but not before a chiller brand new was bought.i went to the tl and atl in the last week.he said how he will make this right,send extra help during weekend hours.never happened.store meeting.not one mention of our contributions to the team and the store.no cool beans,no gift cards.the fifty dollar gift cards went to workers who helped the store get high marks during a inspection.the machine broke again.i quit the same day.i am from cleveland,ohio.its only two stores you can choose one."
good,"I have had the opportunity to work for several different department and store managers. My experience tells me that if you have a good team leader or a good store manager, you will be happy. If you have bad ones, work can suck. Some team leaders get to their positions only because they have been with the company for some time and are not always qualified to lead."
good,"scale dry goods weigh bread mold bread proof bread,bake bread."
good,I enjoyed working for this company and I had a lot of fun as well. This was actually my first job when I moved here to Phoenix and it was a good choice I met a lot of great people. Management was not that supportive in a few ways. But in the end I learned a lot and grew from it.
good,I was working on the mainline you have to deal with a lot of racist people and they talk to you like you did something by working here i couldn't deal with that job but i stayed there being though i needed money and i was pregnant with my son so i needed the money.
good,"I got hired on last year before this store opened. The man that hired me was very talented and I was proud to work under him. However he got a promotion and he left the store and after that it all fell apart. The management we were left with was incompetent and showed a lack of interest in the position. Over the course of the next 8 months, the politics of the store took over and it turned to shambles. I had to go home on many days because my flour was not ordered and therefore could not do my job. However with all my struggles good and bad I've learned more about business, my strengths and how far i can go when I truly push myself.  My co-workers it what made my job, there were typical disagreements here or there but for the most part we all leaned and supported one another in the chaos. Overall I loved doing what I enjoy doing which is baking, it is my passion and anything is worth that."
good,"On the negative, working in the Parking lot is terrible. Team Leadership is bad.Here is ONE example : Team Leadership made me work in the parking lot when I reported that my eye glasses broke. How can I direct traffic? I can't see? I can't see my hand a foot away from me without it blurring severely . It was dangerous for me and customers. There was other work I could have done inside, and out of the way of traffic."
good,"If you do not fit their mold and/or entered the company past a certain age, you will not be advanced. Brown nosing is a plus and I saw an extremely competent Store Manager, that I had a very large amount of respect for, let go after 15 years of employment, because they felt she wasn't part of the ""new generation"" of employees that Whole Foods has decided that they require."
good,"Great place to work, short-term. Lots of turn-over which can sometimes effect productivity. They are excellent in educating their employers about products and trends and you decide who you work with by voting them on to your team. Very pleasant place to work unless leadership is experiencing turnover - then it can get confusing as they try to implement their ideas too quickly without communicating it thoroughly to team members store-wide."
good,"Follow all company guidelines regarding display, freshness quality and up-selling to customers based on their wants and needs"
good,I learned that most people who shop here are major stuck up and racist at times. but overall we do get pleasant customers that actually thank you!
good,"I work with a diverse group of people, and this has given me the opportunity to learn about different cultures and form new friendships, with people I may have not otherwise taken the time to get to know."
good,customer service is enjoyable and friendly. I always get to meet new and interesting people every day. I like the atmosphere and there is always something to do.
good,Great atmosphere for those that are ultimately looking to work as a manager or assistant manager in retail.
good,"Customers at Whole Foods have a thirst for food knowledge. Lay back work environment, but at the same time every day is packed with things to do, that needed to be done yesterday. Always growing and developing for today's needs in the industry."
good,The day goes by pretty fast on a busy day. I worked in a coffee bar making tea and coffee. I learned that there are many different types coffee and teas. The management team was ok but had thier moments where they just wanted to be lazy and let the other workers do their jobs. The hardest part of the job was doing all the work while others watched you as they did nothing.Many of my co workers made my days. They were many that helped get the job done effiencently
good,WFM was full of very nice people who were easy to work with. There were some policies that were not so fun and very early morning meetings that were not that fun either but all in all not a horrible place to work.
good,Great pay but be very specific about your location. Some stores your only hired of you know someone. Be prepared tho not be trained at some stores you have to learn on your own.
good,Overall this position isn't bad its just after working overnight your sleeping habits change sometimes I couldn't sleep when I got off in the mourning.
good,"The culture here is what you'd expect. Everyone is extremely nice, respectful and easy going. Inclusiveness, diversity and sustainability is at the forefront in everything Whole Foods Market does. I would say that because respectfulness and inclusion are so much ingrained in the culture, it can make it difficult at times to get things done. It's such consensus culture--where everyone has to agree--that it can make it impossible at times to get every the smallest of tasks signed off on. Personally, I believe it's had an impact on the morale. Because everyone has resigned to the fate, things move slower than they should. People are afraid to create conflict and disagree."
good,My experience there was moderate. I knew there wouldn’t be much advancement. Work life balance was somewhat ok and the pay wasn’t what I had wanted at the time but it worked.
good,I appreciate the opportunity. Any time I’m at work im appreciative. I get to work with customers who appreciate my excellent customer service skills. That’s the best part
good,"Working at Whole Foods allows you to interact with a lot of people, leave work at work instead of taking stress home with you, and provides part-time income when you need multiple jobs or have family obligations at home."
good,"It was okay. People learn to find other ways to work and move on from the company. The bad part was not being understood as an employee. When you work for them, you just go to work and focus."
good,The leadership could be more friendly. They are scared to discipline the ones who need it & take everything out on hard workers . Which makes it stressful .
good,"There is nearly limitless opportunity to move up because the turnover rate of management is high. Amazon is slowly shifting the culture from a friendly environment, to one of data driven results. Efficiency is great but at what cost?"
good,"Things have changed significantly since Amazon has taken over. There is less focus on the Team, and more focus at driving the bottom line. Great for some but not for all."
good,"Good work life balance, they work with your schedule. "
good,"When I started - the opportunity for growth was unbelievable. After a change in management a few short months later - the opportunity for growth (along with my quality of life outside of work) was nonexistent because of the favoritism exhibited during schedule requests in favor of older team members having their preferred and consistent schedules over a slightly newer member’s need. "
good,"I thought it was going to be easy work and stress free but boy was I wrong. They make stacking apples a life or death task. Everything is a big deal. At least for my department and manager. I do love working with my coworkers as they are all nice and it's great team work. I've built some great friendships since starting working here. "
good,Good job for interim needs to procure funds in order to move back to Oregon. Products are reviewed for health conscious buyers and I trust the 365 house brand
good,Whole Foods pays slightly more than most grocery stores but the company set productivity levels are unrealistic given the general head count of most teams in the store
good,The store I worked at was ok. Store managers were horrible at their job and didn’t care for us employees. Can’t really get fired unless you try to get fired with time and attendance. Very flexible with hours.
good,"Working at this grocery has its perks, but it is hard work. The clientele Whole Foods deals with is very wide, you get sweet people but you also deal with difficult ones."
good,Overall it is a good place to work. You can work your way to top if you are motivated and focus. The pay is decent compared to the other supermarket.  I must important is love what you do.
good,"Pretty high paying for what you're doing, but the managers make it absolutely exhausting. Hard to move up in the company because everyone has favorites and there is colorism in the company (pretty standard)."
good,Not a bad place to work. Started during employee appreciation week. Free snacks and drinks for employees. Work shift from start time until your finished. Not much work life balance.
good,"Work is monotonous, however the people and the customers are nice. However you don't feel like you're progressing towards anything. Most of the staff is great."
good,"it won’t be easy, and it’ll take some real dedication, but if people see your drive and ambition they WILL help you grow. if you do bare minimum, and never seek it out, you will find yourself lost in the system."
good,"Good benefits, most folks were nice. Management was lacking but if you’re looking for a job that’ll give you good insurance and time off then I’d recommend it."
good,Whole Foods is a good job for high school and collage students but if you’re actually trying to make a living wage they do not support that especially in the Bay Area
good,Company is in decline due to changing the very nature of the team member experience. Amazon buying the company made further changes to what was already a company that had strayed from its original core values. Toxic workplace culture
good,"overall, fast paced and impersonal.  better, faster, more is the everyday climate.  company culture has suffered since the Amazon buy out.  the environment is both physically and mentally relentless."
good,"It was good for a long time and then we had massive lay offs and they expected more and more. I worked in many areas of the company, I worked as a regular team member, barista, buyer, back up store systems integrator."
good,It was an okay time for me it was something i needed to do for myself it was over whelming at times and i felt stressed out and the customer were sometimes over whelming
good,a typical day was fun and this is the perfect job for a college student. Management is willing to work with your school schedule. You will be required to work weekends and holidays.
good,All of my other team members. Everyone gets along and we're there for each other. Always have each others back. We help each other with tasks to get them done faster.
good,Parttime sales associate. Responsible for educating customers on specific cuts of fish. Ensuring an excellent customer experience during their time at the fish counter.
good,"Its your average cashier job. The staff are all very nice, however, they aren't very accommodating for out of town students for the holidays. They are flexible for students during the school year."
good,"Working here has been really great, I loved this location, loved my coworkers, and the job was great. Management was good, and the work was pleasant. That's it."
good,Working for Whole Foods Market was a good experience. Whole foods Market has benefits if you are a full time employee with Whole Foods Market. Whole Foods Market pays well.
good,Enjoyed it for many years. Things changed and things take time. All aboard. The company changed a lot after amazon acquired. I would not suggest working with WFM anymore.
good,"Being forced to write a 150 word review of a entry level retail job at Whole Foods is ridiculous.  The summary is basically the point: Best retail environment I worked at, but still retail."
good,It is a fast paced work environment with a lot of customers. Cashiers are required to stand for the entire duration of the shift and serve customers..
good,"Needs to promote from within. Decent bakery went bad by outside crazy lady hired on as manager."
good,lots of things can go over looked but overall it was fun working there.  I enjoyed the fast pace. The management team could use a little work. Enjoyed it but it can be stressful.
good,It was ok. Management does not really care for you. Schedule was okay. Customers are not friendly. Management does not stick up for anyone. I would not like to work here again.
good,"Fast paced work place,people are friendly,benefits are good.Management care about employees,neat and organize market,healthy food,give more health benefits to customers or giving healthy ideas for buying food."
good,Was a good place to work had good benefits. Its was difficult to work do to management at the time I was employed there. There was no form of leadership and lack the respect for other employees.
good,Great place to work it allows for individuals with the right goals to develop themselves in particular areas and succeed with help from management . I would recommend this job to students or adults seeking career development.
good,"Management is 50/50, just do your job. It depends on the location because it can get really busy in the store and every department has their own traffic."
good,"On your feet most of your shift. This location had a fast turn over rate.  Within almost a year, there was only a hand full of members that still worked there from opening day."
good,Love whole food i thing fit for me n my family  looking forwred to work with us please  call me hoilday cash  help me please thank you so much  i was a the job fare on oct 2 i rreally want to here back form u ok god bless u all
good,Great place to be and to meet people from the outside. I made a great friendship with some people that I worked with and there was always hours available
good,I am glad I got meet the like minded people I did working at whole foods. I learned a lot about food during my time there. I mostly had a difficult time with the disorganization of the department. Store leadership was mostly inaccessible as well.
good,"Very hectic and stressful, horrible schedule. Your personality is valued more than your worker productivity. Easy to get fired, very high turnover rate."
good,"Restocking Produce, making sure quality product was available, communicating with costumers on a daily base. Providing service to costumers and making sure that they are satisfied with the product that they are looking for."
good,"I learned a lot working for this company, I am grateful to have been a part of the company prior to Amazon's involvement. My immediate Team Leaders were not always the most supportive, especially the TL for front end Woburn from 2012 - 2013."
good,"20% discount off store items. 15 min break then 30 min. Unorganized at times. Supervisors were annoying, the lines get really long often, sometimes cold because the door always broke."
good,"Enjoyed my time at WFM, however that was before Amazon took over. Since then things seem to have become less focused on local communities and team members, but rather more focused on the bottom line. The company that once focused so much attention on team member happiness now seems to be more focused on finding methods to make a few extra pennies. In any case, it's still a fine place to work at and has a great assortment of products."
good,Hourly wage didn’t keep up with living expenses. Manager was a real Pain in the behind that all he cared about was himself. Gave other race ethnicities a higher priority.
good,fast paced and stressful. can be rewarding. can be creative with building pizzas. Good benefits make it an exciting place to work but i found that many customers were difficult to serve.
good,meeting with lots of people as customer service are fun and enjoyable. We'll find a new friends with this kind of job. If they giving me a chance to work a new career  as my previous experience I know this is a new challenge and interested in.
good,"I was a Team Leader/ATL for 6 years. The demand got overwhelming and the amount of labor I was given decreased more and more by the year, but with expectations only going up. They pay isn't bad, but the amount they want you do with so little help got to be exhausting. I left after 11 1/2 years."
good,"Working at wholefoods was great until about 6 or 7 months in after the amazon takeover. Work morale went and it didn't seem like the bosses cared too much about our personal lives. They scheduled how they please and no matter how hard you worked or how many people they lost, they refused to give anyone full time. Honestly it was a joke working there and I really really don't recommend  working unless you need the money. It was cool I guess though, the employees are nice."
good,It is a very busy place. I learned a lot of things. Had a lot of helpful co workers. But it needs new management. Costumer service is a very important thing there.
good,I Wish management actually cared more. There is a fun culture there because other team members are unique and interesting. Decent benefits. Should be better benefits considering who Amazon is.
good,It's laid back for new employees who are starting to learn the relative experience. There are a lot of employees and customers and there is good benefits.
good,No one is in charge yet some how every one in charge. There are to many chefs in the kitchen and you can be fired buy multiple different mangers buy getting on someone bad side. Work Schedules were not set not posted online and posted day of or day before the old schedule ended.
good,Thru Whole Foods you learn how to deal the correct way of handling customer service. You gain confidence on how to handle difficult situation that might come up.
good,"I was doing okay working there as a cashier. Once I was promoted to Supervisor it became very political. "
good,"I had a really inappropriate supervisor so dealing with that was difficult but everything else was fine. I also wish the job paid better. I was a sign maker /designer /artist, and I wish the job would have paid better for all I was doing."
good,It’s not a bad company if you donate your life and soul to them. You’re guaranteed to move up. Management definitely has its favorites. Slow time is always in the summer so if you’re part time PLEASEE find a second job or you’ll be homeless out here. Just work extra hard for full time and try not to get on  management’s bad side because once you do that you get no hours or promotion!
good,"Fast paced, costumer based company.  Typical kitchen duties would include setting up hot bar and food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Maintain sanitary conditions as dictated by serve safe."
good,"The job is fair, it’s not the best but it’s not the worst, it pays more than minimum wage in my state, it holds you accountable for your task, your schedule is not fix, basically whenever they need you than your schedule"
good,It's hard to make living on this salary.The start pay should be at least $17 per hour.They should also provide a better dental insurance. The team leaders are doing a good job by treating employees well.
good,If your looking for a place that will give hours this is it but it can get overwhelming with lack of appreciation in the work place.No matter how great you are at your job the firing rate for attendance is ridiculous so pray you don't get sick ever.
good,"This job was very flexible when it came to my school work and my personal life as well. Despite only being there for six months, I learned new various skills to help me in my career for the future."
good,"Basic retail environment, enjoyable people to work with. Depending on what venue in the store you are working, labor is kept tight, meaning a higher work load."
good,It is good as long as you like to move a lot. If you are a more laid back type person this isn't the job for you. The pay is very good as well. If your looking for a job this just might be the one for you.
good,I wouldnt recommend working for wholefoods unless its an entry level job. no growth potential and favorites are defiantly an issue. managment needs work
good,wasn't there for long but its very fast paced. And depending on the man power its gonna affect your workload. And if your full time you don't mind but if your part time the pressure is applied more even tho your still working 7-8 hour days.
good,"They teach you how to be healthy and eat healthy. Very pricey food even with the discount. Very busy environment, did a little bit of everything there."
good,"I worked the Holiday Temp position in the Whole Body department. It was very different for me being at a super corporate company after working at more family owned, Co-op type places before"
good,It was hard work and the shifts could feel longer than they were but the people who worked there did their best to get through and we all worked together as a team.
good,"There would have been more room for growth and better employee morale if leadership didn't have the ""retirement"" type of mindset at this store. Whole Foods is defintiletly in the mindset of the future and it would have been nice to be a part of that."
good,"cook The job of a food reviewer is to accurately convey the taste, texture, smell, and presentation of a restaurant's food. You not only comment on the food but also on the atmosphere, staff knowledge and attentiveness, the speed of service, the general impression of the restaurant or cafe. A great food review puts the reader at your table with you, allowing them to decide whether or not they want to visit the restaurant when they're done reading"
good,"I learned to sell more and how to speak to guest. I was able to close out on my own many times, learned all products that I could've. I enjoyed the work place, the team made everything easy for everyone."
good,"we seek out the finest natural and organic foods available, maintain the strictest quality standards in the industry, and have an unshakeable commitment to sustainable agriculture. Add to that the excitement and fun we bring to shopping for groceries"
good,"Whole foods can teach you a lot about business and how to run a business and if your smart you'll figure out how to start your own, but whole foods is no longer about culture and it has gotten cooperate as most successful companies do, take what you can and learn,learn learn learn"
good,"I worked for WFM for 11+ years, in two states, at seven stores. I really appreciate my time there and found a lot of joy out of my work for many years. In store management, my work-life balance was nonexistent. I never had a normal schedule, would work open to close on many occasions, and was expected to be on-call 24/7. Before having children this wasn't an issue, but it was practically impossible for me to find childcare or maintain a relationship with my children with my ever-changing schedule. I learned so much from WFM; marketing, customer service, management, a deep financial understanding, health, wellness, purchasing, margin control, and how to work as a team. I will always value my time there."
good,It's a lot of work not a lot of people but you learn about yourself and management is't always there so you do your best I learn that all food is not safe!!!!
good,"Good place to work."
good,También es una compañía que no evalúa a sus empleados y la paga es muy baja y exigen mucho trabajo
good,"Decent gig, possible raises every 6 months. You'll meet some cool people but ya gotta deal with stuck-up people too. good first job, I developed an eye twitch after working here for awhile though, which is apparently common among other workers, just a heads up."
good,Typical day at work is constant work all over New York City working at wholefoods i learned better communication skills and also how to avoid confrontation with others overall it was a good experience just not enough money
good,The companies leadership principles include “just get it done” - people call out all the time and you had better just get it done. They motivate with write ups/threats since the Amazon take over.
good,"Some days are fast, some days are slow. Sometimes we were understaffed. Must learn things quickly to be an asset. Must be flexible. Must advocate for oneself.  Will not always be able to choose your hours. People are nice."
good,"in the store there plenty of jobs to do. The work culture is very diverse, which was great, i found at the store I worked managers were very friendly."
good,I worked at Whole Foods for a little bit and it was a good place to work to start. I worked the night shift and hours were quite long which made things difficult later on. I was able to learn about interacting with customers and was able to meet their standards perfectly.
good,"You can get promoted very fast if you are a hard working person, they say they have an open door policy but it's a trap. once you complain about management you are out the door, "
good,"The team I was on in bakery was incredible. The people I worked with made the job one of the best I have had. That being said, this was mostly a place I used to get me through school."
good,"an overworked environment management disorganized, which leads to a stressful environment. most enjoyable part was punching out. I did not learn anything new."
good,"It started out as a relaxed environment but over the years it just got more of a corporate vibe and hasn't been the same since. Also, as WF's went more mainstream, the customers became more entitled snobs"
good,Dishwashers are expected to keep up with a high volume of dishes even on your first day. Take look at your phone for one second without being told to put it away but other team members in the kitchen will be on there phones and nothing is said to them. Other departments are great so get a job with them and skip prep foods.
good,They take their job too seriously. The job is not that serious. We were not allowed to talk. But it depends on who you work with. At times it’s fun but stressful.
good,"My coworkers made this job the best job ever. I learned about organic food and sustainability. I learned how to make barista coffee, and learned about craft beers. I also learned a lot about produce."
good,Great part-time gig.  High pressure and unrealistic expectations if you want full time or move up into management.  Not enough spent on labor.  Department managers are stressed and overworked.  Decent wages for the industry.
good,"Wholefood Market is a wonderful place to worked and learned more of what you already know and experience what is like to worked in a fast place in the retail and food business."
good,"Not a career unless you move into management.  Good people, poor pay.  Work can be boring but it was not stressful.  No limit to time off that I can remember."
good,"Whole foods taught me a lot of things about myself, the difference between a manager and a leader"
good,"I was a part time seafood employee, I worked openings. I maintain a safe and clean work atmosphere and was providing customer service once the store was open."
good,Working there was great making 15 dollars a hour to be a cashier couldn’t be any happier and loved all my customers If you love to bake and love to make flowers this is a great place to work
good,Great place to work before Amazon bought them. Management was good until transition. Work culture changed as did policies. Less Organic products and more Amazon culture
good,"short term training"
good,"The Whole Foods work experience is overall a good way to experience the retail industry and a great opportunity for college students attempting to make some money while they go to school. The meat department can be one of the busiest sections of the store depending on holidays, weekends, etc. Management can be flexible in scheduling and tasks, but not all the time. Workplace culture is friendly both with co-workers and customers and Whole Foods is top-tier in making accommodations for workers tased on circumstances involving sexual orientation, race, disabilities, etc."
good,"Not a bad job for those looking for flexible hours, store discounts, and health benefits.  Good management usually means good work environment. Plenty of chances for advancement."
good,before leaving whole foods market. I was the poultry buyer and supervisor for the poultry section. Learned how to all types of meat. It is a fun job if you have a good manager.
good,"While I liked the culture of Whole Foods, the management seemed to not care about employees. The OTS system implementation was extremely stressful and did not seem to make much sense. Any small mistake was seen as a serious offense. Discount on groceries was a great plus, however I never felt as if expectations were clearly expressed or that my ideas or concerns were ever taken seriously."
good,"Need to hire competent employees for specific job they are needed for. A grocery store trying to become a food offering site. Big glitches, morale not good, among younger workers."
good,I learned a lot by being their for 9 months. Sometimes the management can falls a part. For time off they forget that some people have requested to be off on the schedule
good,"A typical day looks like 1 or more persons calling in , the system is either down or can't hear you, other workers are hostile towards each other, pallet truck batteries dead, team leader does no leading nor logistic updates. Hardest part of the job is not being able to succeed to one's fullest because of technical difficulties or other circumstances."
good,"Fast paced, requires knowledge of products produce codes, it is also helpful to have good customer service skills. When I first started, I loved this company and loved the work place over the year and some change I worked there the company began to turn a different direction. :("
good,"My positive mental attitude, authentic customer service skills and exemplary food preparing skills, along with clever time management skills and the ability to receive my satisfaction based on the satisfaction of my customer served me well at this job. It is something that I should mention here however is that the starting wage at Whole Foods raised sufficiently after the merger with Amazon. Starting pay is now $15hr, it was only 11 when I started, although I was personally started at $13 per hour in recognition of my past and current skills"
good,"I learned a lot about the food industry while working at has benefitted.  A typical day at work would include finding and prepping food, communicating with the kitchen about what you need to open/operate a prepared foods section, etc."
good,"My team members are fun loving and very hardworking. They all knew how to pick each other up if someone was down. We not only all worked together well, but we all cared about each other's well being. The benefits were decent overall."
good,Whole Foods Market Unionville had a great team. Working there was made fun and worth going for because of the co-workers. The pay was fair. Overall god workplace.
good,"Really great company with alot of difficult changes in the moment."
good,This place is what you make it. You can have a great experience or bad. For the most part co workers are nice and friendly. They try to make it seem like a family. Great discounts
good,"Whole Foods just to be one of the greatest companies I had ever work for, but I recently came back to realize that with all getting paid minimum wage; some get stuck working less than others. As I progress with my daily work, Team Leader pile more on my table and treat me with a write up if not finish on their schedule."
good,It was a great part time job to learn about local companies and food production. It's a great job while going to school. I learned a lot about organic food.
good,Learned how to cut meat so I am forever grateful for that. I personally would never work for this company again but it is a decent place to earn a living.
good,"Working at Whole Foods is a challenge due to poor regional management, but the people that work there are a true pleasure and I'll always miss my time there for that. A typical day at work could be any level of chaotic, but I did learn time management there as a result!"
good,"I like this place. especially the manager is very nice. I like my colleagues, it 's a good start for me to back the job market again. I quit this job because I want to pursuiing my certificate."
good,"This job was easier knowing that there was serious considerations in the inventory buying. It was nice to know that sourcing, shipping, manufacturing were all serious considerations when the company decided to place a product on their shelves."
good,"Good place to work.  Much more physical than you would think. Lifting, bagging groceries. Always in motion. Customers are very high end and expect wonderful customer service. There are many babies and children that come in with moms, which I liked.  Runs on skeleton crews a lot of time so you must move fast and be prepared to work on other departments."
good,"Whole Foods can be a great company to work for provided you fit the bill. There are some great opportunities and great benefits. With the purchase by Amazon, the company is slightly altering its course of direction though, so just be aware. "
good,My work hours changed with my full time job soon after I started so I wasn't able to maintain a job with company my short time there the management was very easy to work with.
good,"Not much chance for advancement, but the starting wage of $15/hr is decent.  You'll be on your feet for most of the day, but it's not the worst job one could have,"
good,"Good place to work and learn more about the work life "
good,"I worked with a lot of amazing people, and a few not so amazing people. Being a team member is pretty awesome, but once you hit Leadership it becomes more stressful than it's worth. In all fairness that has been my experience in all retail management situations"
good,My coworkers were great for the most part. Could be very stressful because of lack of workers. We were all demanded to be stretched very thin and set to impossible standards that could only be met if the company was properly staffed. It never was.
good,perhaps i've become sensitive to noise but the music was always load and the supervisiors would always have to yell over the pods to other staff. And breaks was to early. if you work a 8 hr shift your 1st break shouldnt be 2 hrs into a shift.
good,Great place to work for the most part.  The staff is good and supportive.  Management is semi-supportive but good at what they do.  They are very understanding.
good,"The pay, benefits, culture, customer base, and product are a small (yet significant) step up compared to most other retail companies. That being said, at the end of the day it is still a grocery store and comes with the same complaints you'd find anywhere else in the industry."
good,Employees are helpful and friendly. Always willing to help a customer with any questions or concerns that they may have. For example if we do not have a product we will make sure to contact any other store to see if they do have it available
good,a great place to work.  flexible hours...just not during the holidays.a good place for people meeting new and working together as a team . if your young great benefits and opportunity.
good,"Cashiering is literal eternal damnation, but otherwise, it's a great company to work for. Friendly environment and the company does a really good job taking care of the employees by boosting morale."
good,When I was a fish monger there 6 years ago it was a great work environment. Since the company got bought by amazon I have heard that things are going downhill.
good,"Busy or slow, varies on the day"
good,Worked here before they were bought by amazon.  Corporate culture was very granola.  They were in the process of doing a lot of downsizing when I left.
good,"The Distribution Center that I operated in was limited in capacity. There were contact labor problems. Whole Foods HR embodied Negative Re-Enforcement regarding employee non-conformance."
good,A lot is expected at WFM. The schedule is all over the place - it is a great place to work if you don't have a family or any commitments outside work.
good,"Developed new skills while utilizing skills already encompassed.  Was able to gain supervisor experience and work on delegation. "
good,"Whole Foods started as a fun place to work, but the shift towards regional managers with no grocery experience has killed the company. Changes to product layout make no sense, and management is unwilling to listen to feedback."
good,"they start at 11 an hour"
good,typical day of work its like everyday task dealing wit team members that not cooperate s and try to help the store careless i dint know if they not happy wit the salary and they stress out
good,"wholefoods is overall a great company to work for, but where I want to be in life is to have a career job, dream job. a place where I can truly be happy and that's helping people. I do believe I help people in my current position. getting back into the medical field is something I always wanted to do since I could remember."
good,It was a decent company to work for. The starting wages were hard for living in the Bay Area. There were perks to the job and my fellow coworkers were the best part about coming to work.
good,"All in all, Whole Foods is a great place to work. My benefits are great. The people I work with are great. Leadership is pretty good. I just need more."
good,I liked making pizza but no tips sucks. The PTO is limited and the manager I had wasn't flexible about me playing soccer and going to school and working at the same time. Coworkers were cool though.
good,"regular work, i learned patient and a lot of information about retail store , friendly management ,is a nice place too work ,some of the jobs not fit me because of heavy duty,friendly enverenment"
good,If you are looking into great teamwork this is be a great place to start. As with all companies sometimes the problems rely on management. When you are a supervisor it could definitly seem as if your opinion on how to improve does not matter as long as the goals are achieved.
good,Whole Foods Market allowed me to move from a very demanding company and job and move into a more relaxed environment where you are empowered to manage yourself.
good,"It was okay. The perks with the extra pay for holidays as well as employee discounts & free clothing is cool. However, management communicates poorly & extra duties relating to other positions outside of the job description are bestowed upon the employees."
good,"Nothing spectacular; nothing degrading. I was paid average wage, tried to keep up with the ""latest"" coming down from corporate and tried to keep track of my manager's names, as they changed monthly. It was a decent job, but not one I'd go back to."
good,I had a good experience working in Wholefoods on Bowery Ny Ny. I meet tons of ppl and I enjoyed the fast pace working. I love a job that keeps you busy.
good,Good but very cutthroat to where you must be friends with everyone. And never complain about leadership even when they are doing things that are not appropriate upper management will take there side and wrongfully fire you.
good,"I was the opening cashier every day for 10 years. I knew the customers by name and absolutely loved my job. There is never a shortage of ""New Products"", so sales were important.At Whole Foods, for the first 5 years I worked there, all employee's had to take courses on a number of all aspects of how Whole Foods works,including, produce,grocery, whole body products, every item available. Quite interesting and I learned alot on how organic stores operate. Management was overworked. The hardest part of the job is not being able to satisfy all customers, but never stop trying. But on the other hand, making the customer happy is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,coworkers were very nice. There is a lot of turnover and most people don't like working there. Pay is better as it is more than minimum wage. overall too stressful for a part time job.
good,It seems a rather decent company on the surface however the location I worked at was constantly busy and understaffed. Labor budgets seemed to make no sense in comparison to the amounts of money the store made as a whole.
good,"Great Co workers, horrible management. Benefits are great, and pay was decent. Company has to stop micro managing and take care of their employees,  so that the employees will take care of the customers."
good,"If you have a family "
good,Was a great job for the first 2 years. Was not able to move up. It was very intense and a lot of the same people shopped there everyday so I grew to learn a lot about what customer's needed and their likes and dislikes.
good,"Whole Foods Market has been the best place I have ever worked, however all good things must come to an end and recent changes in the culture, philosophy and overall goals have inspired me to make personal changes in my career."
good,Loved the people working there and the friendly environment. The administration was definitely was not my favorite. Definitely a busy job always something to do!
good,"Enjoyable work environment.  Good workforce. Learned about the organic food industry, sustainable foods, the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
good,"it was not that bad at the start, but now I feel the company is not at their peak anymore. if you are starting to look for work then look them up. was not that bad."
good,Great Company during the years I worked there. I gained a lot of product knowledge and got to try things from all over the world. It changed overtime.
good,"Whole Foods Market is  great place to work at with an amazing management. I learned a lot from how to greet customers to how to ensure great customer service. The workplace is very quick and intense due to the amount of shoppers we have. The hardest part of the job would be facing some rude customers, but other than that it is a great friendly environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing old customers come in and being able to have a conversation with them is probably the best feeling."
good,Good place to work and flexible with hours. Whole foods is a great place because it assists others in learning other places inside the store and learn about the department.
good,There often appears to be a great deal of favoritism in certain departments. And wordloads in different venues of the same department can often be unbalanced.
good,Seemed like upper management cared more or less about certain departments in the store. Upper management didn't care that a huge amount of employees weren't getting breaks when needed. If you called out sick upper management made you feel bad. Management often asked you to complete tasks outside of your job  responsibilities nicely and made sure you knew you didn't have a choice.
good,I was able to grow at whole foods. I started off as a butcher and moved my way up to assistant manager after a few years. I also referred networks for employment.
good,"Working at whole foods can be fun, but it can also be challenging if you let it. There is almost always something to do, so days don't usually slowly."
good,TM happiness not high on WFM's list of priorities.  Retail is a dying industry.  Benefits are OK.  Health care not bad.  401K match almost non-existent.
good,"On a typical day i am constantly cleaning and repairing things, also helping out different departments around the store."
good,Place was a good place to work at it paid some of my bills but it wasnt worth salving myself for the facility. Facility was closed and I left for better pay. I did not decide to keep working with the company they gave me options to go to the store but I didnt
good,"Very demanding leading a team and keeping team members on task. I learned how to manage and lead by example. Store management was very concerned with scorecards performance for individual teams and not focused on team management workload. The hardest part of the job was juggling time between department conditions, team member’s assignments and paperwork. The most enjoyable part of job was developing relationships with coworkers."
good,"I liked working at Whole Foods. However, being in retail is hard when you have a family--especially working on weekends. The store is busy, the crew is fun, and the customers are very nice. I enjoyed talking to customers while I was a cashier."
good,"Their attendance system and tracking is terrible. Only allowing 2 doctors notes annually is a joke, and the fact that part time employees are offered health insurance makes it so that the marketplace doesn't give you a tax credit./ This made me angry."
good,At Whole Foods I learned how to work on my own and time management skills over anything else. If you're a vegan this is a great place to work considering the discounts and likeminded people around you.
good,I was downsized after a few months so it is difficult to really judge. It seemed friendly enough place and there appeared to be a good professional atmosphere.
good,"In the beginning the job was great. Creative, fun and rewarding. However, the Amazon merger eliminated my creative position and hundreds of my colleagues in the Marketing and Design departments. The severance package was generous, thankfully, and they gave us several months of notice including access to professional third party job coaching for free. "
good,"Management needs more training "
good,Great work environment friendly easy going work force. I felt that I was treated equally as everyone else never had any issues with me work environment
good,"A few years ago, I would have given this work place 5 stars. Ever since Amazon bought Whole Foods, the quality of the food has declined, the work environment has declined, management and company values have been coerced to change, and the overall environment is transitioning to becoming very corporate. Less room for expression, less room for work/life balance, etc. Amazon is driving this company into the ground."
good,"I've seen in the past year how much Amazon has changed the company. It used to be an excellent place to work, but with lay offs and team moral declining, it's not what it used to be."
good,"I worked in 2 stores. And the difference between on and the other couldn't be bigger. The Leadership in one might persuade me to change some ratings to 1 star, whereas in the other store it could be 5. Yes, job security is there, but not much advancement - again,  depending on your position. Overall, the company tries hard to take care of its employees. But in the end... it's all about money."
good,This place is everything you expect it to be but a lot of down to earth people as well. There are are some pretty good perks to working here. But in all honesty this job can be great or terrible depending on your managers.
good,"I was a cook/dishwasher and the job was not that difficult. The only think I did not like was the training process which took for ever. Also, the management at the store I worked in was terrible."
good,"Whole foods has, overall, been a good place to work. They're very empathetic in general and have policies and practices in place for those struggling. Some policies are changing due to the Amazon buyout that is causing significant stress on employees and slowly changing the culture that whole foods was built on."
good,It was interesting each day dealing with midday rush and customer queries. Management wasn't bad but a lot of the higher ups were seeking other employment whether it was a new job or a new position at a different stores.
good,I loved the atmosphere of working there like a family. The only thing i didn't like was that the management wasn't that great and there was no room for advancement
good,Didn't really enjoy some of the favoritism and the seniority that takes place when applying for a new position within the company. It served its purpose in finding a job that was in line with my career and paid the bills! So can't really complain.
good,The company went in a new direction and those that did not adapt to the changes fell by the wayside. It is always a good thing to be flexible learn to adapt.
good,"All and all fine to work for. Clique-ish. This location is understaffed all the time. Love my co workers, but not necessarily loving the job. Good entry level...if you are able to move forward....is a decent company."
good,whole foods is a good company to start your career in the working world. With whole foods benefits the company is defiantly  a good look to place on your resume.
good,"Working at Whole Foods was a rollercoaster. When I joined the team, we had no management, and only a few supervisors. Because of that, schedules were often made with very little notice, and knowing when you worked came down to going in on your day s off to check the schedule. However, the actual job of helping customers get what they needed was fun and rewarding, and shifts often passed quickly."
good,"Work  hard  each and every day  stay Motivated be patient and be open to learning ,Communicate with customers on a regular basis  make sure they’re comfortable."
good,"Working as full time cashier for WFM required to arrive ten-fifteen minutes before schedule, clock in on time, be prepared to work your 8 hour shift from start to finish. Schedules are prepared two weeks out. You are responsible for trading your hours with another team member if you want a day off. The work schedule is set between the hours of 6 am to 10:30 pm, Monday - Sunday. Any combination of shifts apply, never the same each day. Each weekly schedule is different."
good,"Numerous multitasking, frequent customer service, physical labor environment. Co-workers made the work environment more enjoyable."
good,Whole foods is a great place to earn some money on the side when you are in high school. It is actually a pretty good networking place if your store is located in a high end area.
good,"working at whole foods is nice. but I feel I need to expand in other areas. I need new experiences other ten retail. it is a good company, it just is not enough for me."
good,"whole foods is a great place for a summer job, but nothing more then that, as it gets very old quick. But the culture is great and open and nobody seems to take their job to seriously."
good,"Friendly environment, Great working with knowledgeable people with years of experience. Its never too busy or too slow just enough to get the day pass by."
good,not what it seems. Lots of work.  Ever-changing management ideas lead to a confusing and frustrating work environment.  Store Leadership is more concerned with bottom line.
good,worked for few years. overall good company to work for. I had a lot of fun and nice people to work with. nyc has many stores to move from store to another so that is a positive.
good,"Wake up, go to work, drink coffee, hang out, do some work. Pretty typical office job. My peers were the best part. Lots of real characters  at WfM. I do miss working there."
good,"the company as a whole is a great place to work. I've made a lot of friends and met a lot of great people. I really learned a great deal working here about food and myslef beauces you will come across a few stressful situations working here. My words of advice since i have been with the company is kissing butt will get you far here. The management team loves that and if you a hardworker looking to be recognize for it. I can tell you now all you will get for it is a longer list of things to do with a pat on the back saying you can do it, I believe in you."
good,"WFM is a great place to work if you need a solid place that's not too hateful to put in a 40hour/week grind.  If you are looking to exceed a couple dollars over minimum wage, I would highly suggest other options."
good,"Good place to work while you're in school. Managers will work with your schedule if you have outside commitments. Part Time is easy; going Full Time can be exhausting. Lots of standing (all day, in fact)"
good,"Currently working on Wholefoods but I’m about to leave, in terms of environment,management and nice staff the place is one of the best you’ll find, meet people from all over the world and have time to a good chat here and there on periods when the store is not busy,in terms of advancing in your career if you move to front end supervisor you’ll get 50p more in comparison to team members  so I feel it doesn’t worth the stress and pressure ,the only downgrade as a cashier you get yourself standing on your foot at the till for long hours and it can get a bit stagnate doing it over few months, in my time here every month people come and go as I’ve never seen before and I think it has to be for salary reasons,and that’s the way I feel now, in terms of  salary I simply can’t have it anymore, doing full time and it doesn’t get you to 1100 a month, that’s simply atrocious and that’s the reason why I’m leaving,"
good,good place to workforgoodpeople great  fast paced work goodpeople to work with earned a lot to coldto work I te freezer  a lot of people just did not care
good,This company is changing rapidly from a unique work environment to just an every day grocery store concentrating on labor and shrink control.  Full time job availability is virtually non existent.
good,Clock in very good teammate and managers. Everyone helps out with the task along the day.Everyone is scheduled for a break around the timing you came in for the day you will get a 30 min also a 15 mine later on in the day. End of day clock out and go home
good,"Working here was fine--the irregular schedule was kind of a pain, and food service isn't the greatest, but all in all it wasn't terrible for a retail job."
good,"With the increasing control from the corporate office in Austin and Amazon acquisition, all aspects of working here are changing. While historically a highly entrepreneurial culture with a strong focus on team members, this is shifting as more processes become standardized and creativity is minimized. Employment experience often varies by store/team and that leadership, but there are some amazing leaders here that work hard to support their team members and drive business."
good,"Nice place to work, fellow employees were great.  Scheduling was"
good,"the job was ok.. a lot of work for not enough pay, but that's most jobs these days. no perks when I was there maybe things changed idk.. I left. its a job!"
good,"This job really is a grind.  It's mostly who you know when moving up. Getting tapped on the shoulder so to speak.  When I began working there were tons of people who were so called "" lifers"" now if you make too much money your expendable. Positions have been getting cut for the last five years as well."
good,"most part customers were friendly, had a good time working there. Decent hours. Usually the same every week. Discount was okay. Food was good. Worked with my school schedule."
good,good company hardest part of the job is working in the kitchen area it gets hot most enjoyable part is the customers the great to interact with have good conversation learn interesting things about people.
good,Employment at whole foods is a great opportunity for students or if your furthering your career as a manager. A typical day at whole Food was fast past enthusiastic. I was a night cook so I obtained several new healthy delicious recipes. I enjoyed working for Whole Foods but it was a temp position only.
good,Was a great place to work.  Met a lot of good people. I learned a lot about food. If I could I would go back in work for them . I tell everyone I know that is looking for a job that they are a great to work for.
good,"It is not a hard job but can be physically demanding.  You have to beg for breaks and you are lucky if you get some!  There were so many supervisors that you barely know who you are reporting to on a day-to-day basis.  There is one HR person overlooking the region which seems overwhelming.  Understaffed and often worked alone for the entire shift (often with no breaks).  "
good,"Whole Foods is a great company, but since the amazon takeover and OTS regulations, it's just not the same.  Advancement opportunities are minimal and its become almost militaristic."
good,"My experience at Whole Foods Market was overall okay. I enjoyed the job, the company is great, and I had fun coworkers. Unfortunately I felt the management was a bit unprofessional, and it was hard to tell customers certain policies when my managers would go against them and make me appear as a bad person who did not want to please the customer. I learned to work with a very different type of customer, who were very demanding. It was hard because sometimes they made me feel like I didn't know how to do my job according to them, however I would still try my best to satisfy them and ask them exactly what they wanted. The best part was interacting with my coworkers. Whenever we had a cleaning break it was so fun to talk, laugh, and get to know some of them."
good,my supervisor did not care i was pregnant still wanted me to do delivery service which was very stressful and had to carry grocery bags up stairs up to the door of the customer. i had to relocate to ink block in order to save my pregnancy.
good,"Drank the punch, initially. Rose within the company but saw the cracks (that everyone in management did.) It was a great company and has great potential but there are too many issues to deal with at one time. Must be able to handle a lot of stress for long periods to last."
good,Working there was okay . We had the good and bad of course like any other workplace . Coworkers were cool and the customers were also great people at times . I was an experience that helped me grow as a person and i wouldnt forget it . Made me a bit more responsible and i appreciate wholefoods . I also learned a lot about health and discovered more foods.
good,A pretty relaxed place but low salary and little to no advancement opportunities leave you wanting more. Much better than other supermarkets I had worked at.
good,Some weeks I'd be working over 30 hours and other weeks I would be working as little as 18. This was a result of our department not having a balanced budget so they made labor cuts.
good,"Typical days at work included some great customers, some terrible customers."
good,working for whole foods is great the people and management is very nice and easy to talk to t regular day goes by fast cause there is so much to do and people are
good,"Whole Foods is a team work reliant environment that was when executed well functions successfully. However, unwillingness to provide employees with the needed hours for a livable income made it occasionally competitive for hours. Additionally, managers were stressed frequently to keep things running as detailed necessary by corporate management."
good,"It is what you would expect. It is normal for work in a natural foods store. Rich white people buying organic groceries, crazy anti-vaxxers, stuff like that."
good,There is some low key racial tension there. the environment is that in which you are expected to keep your head down and not stir things if you notice something is wrong.
good,"I'm leaving because of new horrible management in my department. No one in leadership listens when the team members complain about the manager and the environment is toxic. The company itself has good morals that i love to support, but Amazon is a garbage company led by a garbage man, and i'm sure he'll taint whatever good Whole Foods has in it. Best to leave now before he ruins it."
good,Fast paced environment that made time fly by.  It was casual clothing and had flexible school and work schedules. Allowed team members time for family emergencies.
good,"The food culture within the company is awesome! They are good at educating the team members and customers about the food industry, and food product knowledge. They are opportunities to advance within the company but it's very hard to get more than a 10 cent raised here. The best way to get a raise is to change positions, transfer to another store, or advance to a higher position.  They are a numbers company that puts a lot of pressure on team members to make their numbers. The offer benefits but some of they packages they offer could be better."
good,"very diverse place and enjoyed working for the company, learned many things work related and life related about becoming a mature young adult and being professional with very customer service skills"
good,Very rewarding job; great exercise in time managment- because you need to be able to put out food at a frenetic pace at a very high efficiency as well as provide great customer service. A very fun job that kept me alert at all times. Made the hours fly by quickly.
good,"Great place to work, diverse culture. A place to meet different types of personalities and learn about basic skills such as patience. This job has taught me what things I'd like for my future and what I don't want for my future."
good,I would not want my friend working in WFM at this moment.  I think WFM is a mess at this moment and not a great place to work. I wish they would get it together.
good,"In the beginning whole foods, in my opinion, was a good and fun place to work. the co-workers were very friendly and most bosses were somewhat fun to be around. But as time progressed it kept getting repetitive and boring."
good,typical day at whole foods in the morning would be having to work on displaying all bread two hours before the store opens. this job started off okay but slowly started to decrease  due to lack of hours.
good,"Nice work place, the company has made a lot of changes in the past year. Its changing the culture of the store. Becoming more corporate. Hopefully no more changes"
good,"Whole foods has a very diverse staff. Most of who you meet will depend on your department and geographic location. If you show up to work, perform your duties and give excellent customer service, you will excel. There is a lot of room for advancement, but you need to be willing to put up with not only difficult customers, but difficult employees. Whole Foods offers an excellent benefits package, and they always pay more than minimum wage."
good,Organic grocery chain that bought out Wild Oats which was a similar organic grocery store. Learned that they wanted their own people in place when Wild Oats was bought out. Things have improved since Whole Foods was bought out. The workplace culture was great when you had a manager in place who was respectful of all employees in the store .Liked  the food that was sold there.
good,"...than I ever wanted or needed to know. Same with gluten-free food, GMOs, organic anything, cleanses, probiotics, asparagus water, and everything else the upper classes nosh upon."
good,I don't recommend Whole Foods as a job at all. They work you very hard and their compensation compared to the amount of work that you do really is very low. The Team Leader that was in charge of my department was rude and disrespectful as well.
good,I have been with Whole foods for over five years they have been really good to me. But in my opinion they have grown to big to keep up with there core values So I am looking for something else to pursue.
good,"The environment started off friendly, and for the most part remained that type of atmosphere. The company did change somewhat as their "
good,started as a front of the house employee and became a cashier. Had to perform cashier duties along with making sure the food lounge was clean for customers to eat.
good,I honestly don't have much to say about whole foods. Management was ok. I met great people who became close friends. They don't pay enough to be able to deal with all the entitled customers that come through
good,The management needs to be improve more and understand the situation when it comes to handling problems at work but its a bit of a friendly environment
good,"It was nice but the shifts were all over the place like closing one night and opening the next morning.  Made a lot of great , lifelong friends.  THe 20% discount was also very nice"
good,"Great company that took care of me for almost ten years."
good,"Internal competition and workplace politics did not used to be a part of the culture. As the company faced 7 quarters of loss and the Amazon acquisition, company culture has changed significantly. I used to love to work there because they promoted from within and the company valued the work you accomplished over all else. Now there is judgement against alternative facades and liberal mindsets."
good,"Every Individual work experience will vary. Great Leadership and Fairness will make any environment a success. "
good,I found the corporate culture generally satisfactory but would have liked more from management regarding schedule consistency. Each day was different and planning was difficult. Benefits were agreeable but not as exciting as one would think given the reputation.
good,Leadership is very interesting(not in a good way). They want people to know things they don't even know. Also they don't like to take chances on current long term member but want external candidates.
good,great place to work at. good people. . small store. small parking lot. community store. always busy  but very friendly. customer are great except for when theyre returning.
good,Everything about this job was awesome except for management. Had a second job and was part time and they would continue to over work me due to the department being understaffed. Maybe a different department would be better to work in.
good,I really enjoyed working for whole foods market great pay and good benefits. great opportunities. over all I will recommended any one to apply to work for whole foods markets
good,"The store has a pretty healthy work environment. Everyone's friendly for the most part. The nature of retail makes the hours very undesirable, and the pay is very low considering what it costs to live in the city."
good,"Fun customers, its great helping people. The company is great and is always looking to help people. The hardest part is always being on your feet. Its a good job"
good,"Work day duties are listed in my resume. I was part of the Store Leadership group. "
good,Wholefoods market pays higher then most companies in the grocery retail business.  Schedules can be flexible is your in school or work another job.  Work life balance is decent.
good,"It was a very welcoming working environment, everyone got along and did their jobs well. I have nothing negative to say I had to leave because my mom needed my help taking care of her."
good,Its okay good customers. Best part was the food and all the babies that came in. The management time sucked and took sides and was not aware of what was actually going on.
good,it has been a overall great experience at whole foods. i have learned a lot of new skills such as buying and managing finances for a department as well as how to market what i am selling in the department.also learned how how to supervise and adapt to many different situations and make sure task are done accordingly. There is room for growth with in the company if you work hard.
good,Thank you very much because I like peaches in the summer time. I also enjoy a tasty apple in the Fall.  A nice summer melon is also hard to pass up. Buy one.
good,"As whole foods is continuously chaining its hard to understand what exactly is your job duties, always expecting, more more, more. I think whole Foods in its effort to sell itself tried to squeeze employees efforts and giving department leas manpower. And its nice getting a customer discount, but you still can't afford to shop there."
good,"the job in the bakery had very early morning hours, they stopped letting people be creative with recipes , having everything made one way only , cutting out recipes that sell, cutting positions and adding the jobs to others"
good,"Great pay if you're a college student and looking for a part-time job, they start everyone off with 11.50! That is Great! But wasn't what I was looking for at the time."
good,Not Relevant.  I find this requirement unnecessary for the purpose of finding a job.  I am not interested in providing a review of a company I only spent 4 months as an employee.
good,It is a nice place to work but it is very possible to get too many points in a point system that adds up and can result in your loss of job. good benefits and place to work otherwise.
good,Busy and demanding job. A lot of cleaning that had to be done in the meat department. If you don't want to clean I suggest working else where. Late working job.
good,My employment at Whole Foods was pre amazon so I do not know what it is like now. When I was there it was very fun and exciting at first but it quickly faded.  Once new  a manager took over the store things soured quickly.  He had his inner circle of friends and if you were not part of it you were not gonna be there long. The hours were harsh especially around holidays were you were expected to work long hours and management had the time off and reaped the rewards.  A very nepotistic place to work.
good,I enjoyed the culture and what Whole Foods stands for. They promoted healthy and clean eating habits. Whole foods is a friendly positive energy environment.
good,"Whole Foods is a decent place to work. The attendance policy is ridiculous. My supervisors did not respect availability what so ever, nor did I get full time benefits for working full time as a part time employee for months."
good,"Whole foods would be perfect to work for if not for the fact that they are constantly under staffed. They refuse to spend enough money on their workforce to support the amount of work necessary to keep the store running. You are paid fairly, but very pressured to do more than you are paid to do or hired for. The stores get by because of people that feel guilty or pressured to do more than their share."
good,whole foods has the most professional employee training programs I've ever experienced. They take great care to ensure quality. I learned that this corporation is just that.
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with.  Management lacked proper direction.  Management gave conflicting information and didn't provide proper or enough training for you to do your job correctly.
good,"Whole Foods isn't a bad place to work and does offer decent benefits if you work full time. I worked full time for a while but just didn't really like it, I am looking for a real career."
good,"Working at Whole Foods taught me alot about the food industry."
good,"Of all markets to work for, Whole Foods provides the best incentives as far as PTO and insurance benefits. They have a competitive pay for retail and may work with your schedule."
good,go to the website and check it out read about it check job posting  in the area of choice  abd select what job you are interseted in applying for learn about the company.
good,A day at wfm could be tricky at times but I was always up to the task. You are working with people with all types of different job experiences and trying to turn that into a well oiled machine could be difficult. I would use my leadership skills to try and solve problems and keep us running in track. Sometimes it was stressful but most of the time it was fun.
good,Worked in the produce area behind the scenes in the chop shop.  Was fortunate to work for an excellent team leader who really cared about the people in his department. He left there as well.
good,"Management was horrible "
good,"Typically I was scheduled to work evenings because I was in school during the day. The division between the day shift and evening shift was palpable, but overall it was a good place to work. The different departments and teams worked together well for the most part."
good,"Management was friendly and they treated their employees pretty well. It was very difficult to achieve full-time status due to the sheer number of employees. Most benefits were not available without full-time status. Pleasant team members, but sort of a mindless job. Some store policies did not seem to align with the company's acknowledged ""sustainability commitments."""
good,You meet a lot of great people at Wholefoods. Wholefoods provides proper pay with a lot of added benefits. They also reward their employees with free meals when working hard.
good,"it`s a great place with young and cool people."
good,"-busy atmosphere"
good,"the company is great to work "
good,Working at wholefoods a great experience however it is more of a temporary job. Great place to work as an in between job. Only major flaw is that they do not pay fairly.
good,"The culture at whole foods market is really amazing."
good,"fun and  productive  workplace.  But  like a  ping  pong  table  back  and  forth , once  successful  they  love  you  or  hate  you.  back  - forth. however  they  are  good  people."
good,"Overall Whole Foods Market is a great place to work.  Benefits, and wage our above average.  The company culture is geared towards a more progressive communtiy, focusing on encouraging environmental stability and bringing awareness to it's employees and guest.  You'll find you'll make great friends with your co-workers!"
good,This is an ok company to work for just like any other job it has its ups and downs. It is a fast paced environment and can get very hectic on certain days.
good,"Good company but not much job security. Poor management, I dont know why this reveiw has to be 150 letters so now im just ranting about total nonsense."
good,"Whole Foods is a beautiful place to work. I went there in a time of needing more community and the co workers were amazing in every department and every time I would go I it felt like family. Like most, the down fall was the management. They aren't managers. Most of the time the managers would give compensations to customers and play favorites with some employees because they didn't want to deal with the problems. Everyone is great to talk to and on a human level  even the managers but from a business perspective they don't know how to take leadership and deal with anything.  The biggest problem I had and why I chose to leave was standing all day for 9 hours. I asked my managers constantly if I could move around and switch up and they denied me when I asked and basically threatened to replace me with someone else who would do that in so many words. Definitely better than any other grocery store in town! They prefer you to have an open schedule and I never had time for myself I could never plan vacations. It wasn't a healthy balance of life and work."
good,"As a cashier you have to ask when to go to the bathroom and hope you don't have a line, deal with really mean and stuck up customers, have managers that are absent when you need them, remember codes to every produce item seasonal or not, and the attendance policy is ridiculous. Huge turnover rate, a lot of people get fired over attendance or not smiling enough."
good,great co-workers happy and helpful management was always fair one store one team is how we worked the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the beginning to the end of the product
good,Good place to work. The people are friendly the environment great customers are not bad. Opportunities to move away to another Wholefoods. In the benefits pretty much start after 60 days
good,Scheduling was pretty consistent where shifts were not all over the place. Sometimes management would be unorganized but for the most part was pretty easy to talk to.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different kinds of people. The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of the day :) Management was awesome!!!
good,Ok place to work. Team members are great. Management doesn't care about team members. Not flexible with school schedules. Hard to move with in the company.
good,its like a family setting working here. use to joke around and say I saw my coworkers more then my family. management can be iffy. some are great and others could use some better training for their position
good,"The assistant and store manager as well as the human resources manager are great, but I find that the bakery department is not well organized and are always short staffed."
good,"Whole foods had been a great place to work for over a decade. Some stores are better than others,  but the one I worked at severely changed. It had been a group of people trying to do better and help customers; create a great shopping experience. That has unfortunately changed."
good,"but i'm looking for more. a typical day at work would include me getting there, rolling trays of dough, setting my station set up and knocking my prep knocked out so we can have pizza ready to serve by 10am. i run the pizza station by myself and it's a multiple person job. hardest part of the job would be running the station by myself, but ive gotten very good at it and i take a big sense of pride in it. the most enjoyable part would be the discount because i shop there frequently."
good,Wonderful place to work if you love working Holiday's and every weekend. There is a lot of room for advancement. On your feet all the time. Healthy place to be.
good,The company gives you a good training to make your job easier. The customer service portion of the job is very well mannered and the supervisors are very understanding.
good,out of all the places i worked i must say that the culture they have at whole foods market is great. most the store managers seem to care about the well being of the workers in the store. but id have to say the opposite is true for most immediate managers
good,"I personally wouldnt work for whole foods, again. My experience working there lasted under a year, as I was hired when pregnant and worked two days before I labored. I was asked to push carts and bag groceries when I was very pregnant, on a summer day over 90 degrees. I feel working at whole foods enlighened me of the dissappointing truth regarding wild caught, free range, pastured etc."
good,"A typical day work is cleaning the cafe area, stoking back un bought foods, and rallying up shopping carts. As well as cashiering for about 6 hours due to high amount of sales at that location."
good,"Not having qualified employees  who preform  the expected  minimum  of the position, or care to do more. Not enough cross training . With that said. They are generous with time off requests. Team leadership will help a person who is struggling, but on numerous occasions that scheduling conflict and or call out (s) can and have put a demoralizing feel to the days' production schedule, for the person who is struggling and the team."
good,I learned how to cope with different cultures without getting my emotions involved at all times. How to stay positive no matter how mean a Customer could be? That was the hardest part of my job. I enjoyed working with my team they were very helpful when I needed them. My day was very busy during lunch time.
good,most days are spent working freight from daily shipments as well s attending to the guest and maintaining a clean and ordered sales floor.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of training and the poor approach towards training and upward mobility.  Some of the management is positive and impactful in the store while others sometimes have less of an impact with their position.
good,it is just ok working at whole foods. they have gone super corporate and it is felt company wide. team members personal lives are no longer seen as something that needs to be balanced
good,"Whole Foods is a retail job that does provide for its employes, but has been going through so changes with in the past year that are distancing itself from it's employers. I have worked there for four years and at the beginning it really felt like a family, but with position cuts and new management it has made it hard to advance in the company. It's a good job to have if you are lucky to have a good work environment and have the staff needed to meet demands, but for the past year I have not been as fortunate."
good,"Whole Foods has a million mantras and core values that they want you to breathe and live. It gets excessive and they're not practiced consistently. The wages are better than average but the pay raises were minimal and far between. Worked there for five years in two locations. Customers expect A LOT when shopping at the expensive store and are quick to complain if they feel they did not get the absolute BEST experience. Becomes exhausting to have to deliver the best customer service of your life with every individual. They took away employee perks over the years I was there, used to have sandwiches and soups pricing for employees and used to subsidize part of the bus pass. It's been sad to see the company go more corporate."
good,"if you've ever been in a grocery store you can see what their job is so there is no secret as to what they do. make sure you are ready to face product for 50% of your shift. atmosphere is pretty swell, i made some good friends while i worked there."
good,"great work place culture, upward mobility, great training experiences, open door policy with management.  great team members, benefits are good and team member discount is a bonus."
good,"It is an okay company to work at. Pay is good and you get more hours if you put in the work and deal with the crazy management.  Other than that, you really have to work hard dealing lots of people everyday and organizing departments."
good,it was very hard to juggle the job hours and my personal life. they would not work with my availability which resulted in me no longer working with them.
good,While I did appreciate how warm and welcoming my team was the environment was far too stressful. Constantly understaffed for being located in the heart of downtown Portland.
good,Whole Foods provides a fast and friendly work environment. They provide team members with excellent training and good benefits. Team members are friendly and knowledgeable.
good,"Working here is a rollercoaster. High highs, and low lows. I work in the Prepared Foods Department, which is basically a production kitchen with a sales counter and a full service bar/restaurant. The customers range from ""horrible"" to ""amazing"" with not a lot in between. The reason to work here is that the pay is higher than your usual entry level job, and the caliber of people you work with are fantastic."
good,"My time with the company was a good 3 years, standard Courtesy Clerk duties including, bagging for customers, cleaning up the immediate area, assisting customers with any needs/requests they may have and so forth, the management was something that needs to be improved on, difficult team leaders lead to the morale of the location to go downhill, the coworkers were at times good to be around and at other times they were not, with drama occurring every other week. The hardest part of the job had to be the lack of proper scheduling and help on the stores part. The most enjoyable part was the different items that you got to see in the store that many other stores do not carry."
good,Leadership positions tend to be too stressful. The pay can be considered decent and the employee discount is nice. Health benefits are expensive and coverage is sparse.
good,"I learn team work, how to work at a fast paste and also chain of command , it wasn't hard learning just getting along with whom your working with over night because it can get busy and you want to be on same page same paste"
good,"The day mostly consisted of stocking products, customer service and rotating products. Customer Service is key for front of house interaction. It was a good experience to work at a business that is worldwide."
good,"Good for awhile, but company is changing. Teams are merging, making it difficult to have good leadership in different departments. Means more responsiblity for same pay"
good,"A typical day usually consists of maintaining the cleanliness of the store, sweeping floors, emptying garbage cans, recycling, and working the cash register. I learned how to use a cash register and better customer service skills. Management was strict while trying to maintain a relaxed atmosphere. The workplace was fast paced at times during the peak shopping hours and slower paced during the off hours. The other employees were friendly, understanding, outgoing, and helpful. Peak hours were the most stressful when customers would crowd the store making cleaning a necessity to keep the customers safe from tripping and slipping hazards. Co-workers and seeing and talking with regular customers were what made the job particularly enjoyable."
good,"It is a company selling natural and organic products, they have a bakery, a deli, meat market, seafood counter, produce, a bar, a cheese counter, and ready made food"
good,"They need a revamp in the management. Major favoritism and complaints and concerns about the job fall on deaf ears. If the customer has an issue with you, they will hear your side, but always take the customers."
good,"While the work was never back-breaking, the company's commitment to customers over employees meant that you were constantly in the wrong no matter what."
good,"The best part about wholefoods are the people that work there. The fast-paced environment means that teamwork is manditory, and relationships grow from these instances. The attendance policies are pretty harsh, I have had a great amount of co-workers being fired because of the strictness of these policies."
good,Whole Foods is a healthy conscious storem They thrive for their employees to want to only eat healthy. The staff is cery helpful and customer service I will say is very much so the best that you'll recieve.
good,"Company has gone through a lot of changes.  A lot good, some bad.  Still a fun place to work at times, they have the highest quality standards for products and their leadership.."
good,"I worked 5 days one week then 4 days the next week.  One other data entry person and I shared the workload, and it really wasn't enough work for either of us."
good,"Overall it is an ok place to work. The vote in process is ridiculous, it is very difficult to move up in the company because of politics. The competition in the organic market has become so prominent elsewhere that I feel they need to lower prices or will not be able to thrive in this industry for much longer."
good,"The culture at WFM was amazing. There were many opportunities to learn, grow , and excel. Unfortunately , WFM has become more corporate. Competitive pressures have caused WFM to focus more on the bottom line than focusing on what made them so special. Still a great place for a 'job'. Not sure if its a place to make a career."
good,"Working at Whole Foods Market as a Dishwasher was an interesting experience. They are very organized there isn't anything that is not in order at Whole Foods -- although some employee's attitudes may get in the way, that doesn't stop the was business at Whole Foods is orchestrated."
good,"Provided excellent opportunities in growth, customer service and supervisory skills, and cash and data management skills. Lots of training provided on site in a variety (products, difficult situations and management)."
good,"Stock produce help thejuice bar help break down truck and clean work  area  "
good,"I worked with food and learned a lot about cooking processes and how to use a knife correctly. A lot of sales like most of my others jobs I've had, with a lot of picky customers which we'd gladly go above and beyond for. Learned about food safety and handling. Hardest part was working with the management because it was poor in it's production. I had a lot of fun learning new things at this job and hope to work in a more uplifting and comfortable environment."
good,"I love Whole Foods Market, but being a cashier gets old, and moving up into Global/Regional, is all about smooging with the right people, and not what you can offer,even if you're a GREAT Star employee.  That takes a back seat to smooging. "
good,"I made pizzas and also I worked the slice line. I also supervised about 40 employees and helped out with inventory, however I moved out of state and made it hard to stay with the company."
good,Worked here during college. Great place to work with ample opportunity for advancement if you seek it. Management is responsive to employee feedbacl
good,"the company went more and more corporate every year. they cut all the great perks for the job. no team builds, 5% percent raises unless you kiss major butt."
good,"The people make this company great, although it has turned to a more ""corporate"" company. Still pretty fun but not what it used to be in years past. I value the things I have learned from the more experienced chefs."
good,"Great people and good benefits.  Low pay for managers and lots of overtime required.  Discount on groceries, but they are still more expensive than shopping elsewhere.  Good for an entry level job."
good,"The job paid well for a entry level job. Both my coworkers and management were fine, however the opportunity for advancement was severely lacking."
good,"A lot has changed since the company was bought out by whole foods market. Do not feel like I still have job security or chance of moving up in the company,"
good,"The culture seems to be a facade, at least at my location. I've striven for growth and further responsibilities since day one, and I have MORE than proved my capabilities to my superiors. Still, I am largely ignored as a candidate for moving up in the company. Instead, they use me for cheap labor because they know they can count on me, without supervision, to go above and beyond in what I do for the company. I do not feel appreciated. It is too easy to see through the curtain and realize that the culture does not have much integrity."
good,"Though Whole Foods is still a pretty good company to work for, they have made some major changes in the last two years. Which benefit their bottom line more than their team members."
good,Whole Foods is a place where a person is able to learn good work skills and get paid for it. It is worth working for them. I would work for them again.
good,It's based on a decentralized model to encourage business skills and entrepreneurship across all departments. allows for creativity and advancement throughout the ranks is achievable.
good,"I love WholeFoods Market for the organic products that aide in helping people who are in the process of transiting from non-organic to organic, or unhealthy, unbalanced eating to Balanced and healthy eating."
good,My experience working for Whole Foods Market was good overall. The culture is fun and employees are encouraged to build their knowledge of food as well as to eat healthy. The benefits and discounts are great!
good,"Employed as a bardtender at Whole Foods Market. The position entials working with guests, sales, and education on beverage"
good,Whole Foods Market provides the employees with a 20% discount off products. I learned a lot about different avenues of healthy living and eating.
good,whole foods had great customers good vibes.. employees are friendly for the most part. Leadership changed and that made me part ways from the company..
good,"Please see previous. same company and management team. Great experience in managing staff, accountability, managing role positions, rotating management program."
good,If you have a team and a good leader is a great place to work at but once members start working individually and leadership don't  care the place is a mess.
good,"My job as a supervisor was to make sure that the department is looking good all the time by doing a good quality checking, good customer service,also work the concert with my team member, at the end of my shift I will have to leave a recap for the morning crew ."
good,All I can remember is they gave positive energy to all associates and customers. Exposed their associates in meetings to what was in process food and educated them to a better and healthier lifestyle.
good,"Rapidly changing and not for the best.  Well paid part time positions, but higher positions are grossly underpaid as compared to the responsibilities required."
good,"•	Serve meals upon customers request"
good,"very friendly."
good,GREAT EXPERIENCE. MET A LOT OF PEOPLE FUN environment . A good place to learn about different foods and cuisines
good,Will tell other to work here just make sure you pick the neighborhood that's right for you. its fun at times and you can move up fast if you are a hard worker and learn fast. the hardest part and with the racist customers and the customers who think they are better then you because the have a lot of money.
good,"Whole Foods is currently restructuring and eliminating most higher up jobs, making advancement in the company very challenging."
good,"Great place to work with great customers, but everyone was fearful of being fired at any time for any reason. Shifts were easy, but long hours standing in one small space"
good,I enjoyed my time at WFM and enjoyed the customer service as well as educating people about healthier choices with there diet and grocery experience.
good,Loved my experience with this company because of how much I got to learn while working and just bring joy to our customers. Working in Whole Foods I would be asked to organize merchandise on the sales floor from the back freezers. I would also be in charge of moving garbage from one floor to receiving area which was probably the hardest task.
good,"This was probably one of my favorite jobs because of the fun and hilarious people who I was honored to work with. There is such a great diversity of workers here, and I made memories and friends that will last forever."
good,Great work ethics from all my co-workers. Overall a good decent place where people actually care about what they're doing to put the products out to make people happy.
good,"The best part is to work with different people, every day has own challenges. I have learned good customer service, good cash handling and problem solving skills. "
good,Its not a bad job for someone who is just starting out. Brown nosing will get you a long way. The management mentality is sink or swim which you will be tested with the constant change in store management and leaves the efficient development of team members to the wayside.Strict attendance policies used to get the best employees fired.
good,"Duties included but not limited to: maintain potential customers by answering products questions. "
good,"I think the management can use some changes. The store in Boston is always busy and needs to be staffed more accordingly. On the other hand, you get to meet very interesting coworkers and customers. Although it can be stressful at times."
good,"-Conveyed knowledge about local market bean roasters to patrons resulting in a connection to sustainable food systems"
good,always work to be done and each department is like a store within a store. normal retail hours. good management. responsible for the operations of your specific department
good,A good company that does what ever it takes to motivate their employees.  Also willing to work around employees schedules to ensure they are able to work.  They also offer good benefits and advances for their employees.
good,"The job site is ok but it needs to get better, instead of 12.50 an hour they need to start paying New Yorkers $15.00 an hour  I am not satisfied with the job."
good,If you do the best you can and show up to work on time you will be able to keep your job. It's an okay place to work. Most of the people are friendly.
good,"Delivering excellent customer service daily.  Focusing on the cheese production needs of the department to focus on sales.  Assisting customers with cheese, beer and charcuterie choices."
good,"There are leadership and advancement opportunities within all departments including all Whole Foods stores throughout the region, as well as nationally."
good,It was fun while it lasted but the growth was low. There were a ton of politics in the store I worked and my promotions that I did earn caused rifts as friends were not promoted.
good,"very busy days "
good,Solid Company for retail career to start in. Advancement opportunities generally available. Would recommend to friends.
good,"It's a great environment to work in and a lot of good people with great attitudes, except for management - they don't seem too happy to be there - not sure why. "
good,Learn more about people and why they make the decisions that they do. Great place to work with  a lot of different races. A place where you can learn about different countries.
good,"Available at interview.  I feel it is inappropriate to review a company where you are still employed.  I am open to discussion during the interview process."
good,"A very customer-based company/store."
good,A typical day at work would be coming in at the time of your shift and you would expect everything to be up to par in order for you to start everything right where the person left off but this was just done if the right person was there before you.
good,"Help customer and explain about different products and enjoying it."
good,"I've worked for Whole Foods for nearly 7 years and I've only seen this company turn more and more into a corporation favoring its shareholders. A lot of the values that the company once held dear are beginning to dissipate. Now understand, at an entry level job with no requirement for a degree of any sort they pay pretty well in the current job market. However, advancement within the company can be extremely difficult especially now that the company is downsizing it's workforce to supposedly reduce prices for the every day consumer. Favoritism runs rampant throughout some stores, where the only people that receive promotions are those that seem to be much closer to the leadership team rather than the legitimately qualified. If you need a summer job or just something to pay the bills for a short while, then this may be a good company to work for. Just don't go apply here if you're looking for a career, because frankly, you won't get it."
good,It was a pretty easy job but I couldn't live off from it since I barely got hours. I worked as a cashier in both costumer service and the whole body section.
good,"clean debris and dust from the assigned areas. use specialized equipment such as blowers and mower to perform cleaning duties. perform both major and minor repair work around the building such as repairing and repair broken doors, locks and widows"
good,As with every company WFM has its pitfalls...but it also has its perks!  Its a great place to get going and learn a new set of skills.
good,"When I began working at Whole Foods Market it was a great place to work, and was very positive. But for the past year the stores ""team"" has become very negative and feels hostile."
good,They claim to be much more friendly to their staff and they do not fulfill what they say they will do. There are very little benefits to working for this company unless you can get into a full time position.
good,So far has been a good standing experience. One of the best markets I have worked at so far. Co-workers are not rude and everyone is very happy and motivating.
good,"Whole food is a wonderful place to work. you meet all kinds of interesting people that you work with as well as a very interesting customer base. Excellent benefits for Team Members and a fun work environment. over time the company has lost its roots and is becoming more corporate which is unfortunate, but to be expected of a rapidly growing leader in the organic food world"
good,Decentralized structure allowed for each store to make decisions that best fit the needs of the community and Team Members.  Advancement into leadership positions at the store level is strongly supported.
good,"Management has become ineffective, and favoritism runs rampant  due to rapid growth. I loved the Team that I was leading, and will miss the guests that relied on my personal service."
good,"I work for this company for a little over there three years and work in different locations.  Depending on the location will effect your experience at this company. When I first started i love my coworker, management was super friendly and helpful, particularly easy to move up in the store.   But now in my currently location none of people are happy to work, nearly impossible to get promoted, and the process getting is unbelievably long."
good,"Walking in and being greeted by your peers, checking in the office of the store team leader and then going to my computer checking emails and addressing any issues from team members and or team leaders"
good,"Whole Foods is a great place to work, especially if you are a student or just starting out. The work environment is great, and the compensation is very competitive. However, as a  long term employment option it is not as attractive. The company is very much focused on developing internal potential based on seniority. Therefore, outside applicants need to be in the system for several years before serious advancement. Also, several of the departments have notoriously high turn over, and the ""team leaders"" tend to be over worked and underpaid. In conclusion, Whole Foods is a great option for people starting out, and especially those who do not have degrees, The emphasis on internal hiring means that a productive team member can go fairly high in the company within their first 5 years. However, pay is not competitive with a BA/BS degree in most cases, and external applicants may find that people less qualified than they are will be preferred for management positions."
good,"get to work at 2:30 am, and start work at 3 am. take out the bread that gets baked off for that day. get all my flour that I will use for that day. mix the breads for that day. then start the mixing and shaping of the sour dough bread for the next day. with all that done start cleaning up my area and do my dish's that I use that day. and help out were needed. co-workers were great to work with, the holidays day were the hardest part, but we all got it done."
good,"Employee benefits and promotion of Company Culture is top-notch but my experience was that if you question the leftist zeitgeist, your stay will be short-lived."
good,"Average work day is fast paced and understaffed."
good,"I enjoy the financial aspects of the job such as tracking sales, and using those as a means to motivate the staff. On a typical day I will run reports to communicate to staff to help execute our shifts. During that time I will also manage the sales floor, and set up and direct any guests to our department."
good,"working at the retail level is tough... first retail job I ever had in my life"
good,"Team Members are updated with trends in the industry"
good,They have a lot of friendly people to work with. I have learned about the all natural and organics meats available in today's supermarket industry.
good,"A typical day at works would consist of handling customer complaints, helping out with cashiering,etc. The days are usually fast paced so its sometimes hard to keep up with all the tasks but i always get them done on time or before hand."
good,The experience was great. I love the work enjoyed working there getting to know new people it was a great job. I was very involved with the people and helping others.
good,"A typical day at work includes answering calls and implementing my excellent phone etiquette and in person interactions with customers. At this job, I've learned to work in a fast paced environment efficiently, wearing multiple hats as I cross trained throughout different departments (including the meat department, grocery, bakery and front-end). My responsibilities include filling special orders, helping customers with merchandise, and cleaning registers as well as departments during closing hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is having the ability to interact with different people everyday and provide substantial customer service. It was also great when I received recognition for these abilities by receiving multiple ""Outstanding Customer Service Cool Beans"". The camaraderie and team work I get to be a part of really helps with the enjoyment of working with this company."
good,"The job has a great atmosphere. There isn't much that I learn, however, I was able to teach what I learned from my past experience. I have nothing bad to say about my co-workers, other than people have different personalities and we all must learn to adapt to one another."
good,a typical day at whole foods is a daily routine. most of the time it;s not necessary to report to management. whole foods had help build my great customer service skills and healthy eating habits. One bad  thing about the co workers i have previously work with is gossip. the best part off the job is the great benefits they provide.
good,"Whole Foods was one of the better jobs I've had. I still can't believe I no longer work there. Don't expect any kind of favors or reward from all that hard work you put in...the moment you're an inconvenience to someone, they'll find a way to get rid of you. Even if you're in the middle of a legitimate life crisis."
good,"Typical day at work included roaming the store and keeping it maintained. End of work shifts always had us disposing of all trash and cleaning all bathrooms of the store."
good,I have seen Whole Foods locations that are incredibly easy to work at and operate smoothly and others that are far more challenging to be productive within.
good,"great place to work, great pay. with all the perks available, they really hook some people up. anytime they upgrade or remodel, that's when I really did well. when it came time to upgrade the computer system, yep, I asked, and sure enough they gave me about 20 computers, but I guess they did so thinking that when you unplug a computer all the info disappears. lots of info on those things. really was interesting to see what other employees were doing for their own personal gains thinking their conversations were private and secure. all I would do is ask leadership if I could have something, if it was in the way or not being used, yes. so many times, I was more than happy to get their hand me downs. this is just a few  things they gave me, a $15,000.00 espresso machine(worked perfect) a meat slicer worth a few grand, $10,000 sausage stuffer, a couple different pressure washers, commercial grade, those were not cheap things. just ask and you shall receive. like I said, great way to make some extra bucks. they have so much money, its no problem for them to just toss all kinds of good stuff away"
good,"fun place to work. if u like working evey weekend and holiday. you get a discount on food always a plus. great food, lunch is to short only 30 munites."
good,"Prepared foods team, working various venues with coworkers. I learned how to work in a kitchen and sort organic foods. Most enjoyable were the benefits."
good,"Easy to move up in company, but because of this, no one is trained properly so things often go astray."
good,Surrounded by great and positive people. I learned alot about healthy eating while working there. Great place to gain experience. Customers are interesting to talk to.
good,i enjoyed working there but not everyone was enjoyable.. the customers are great and remeber you and most coworkers talk and laugh some are rude
good,I really enjoyed the company and people there. I learned so much while I was there. it help build my character and strengthen me in the places I needed to be strengthen in.
good,"It was okay working there, the days became more and more redundant but it was okay. The managers were rude and aggressive, but the co-workers were kind."
good,"Answering a lot of questions about cheese and gourmet food items. always merchandising. good thing is that you learn something new about cheese everyday. The hardest part of the job is probably closing my department, there is always a lot of work when closing. Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers, you see them a lot so you get to know them well."
good,"A common day of work will  start a 5 a.m. The first thing was to set up meat case with sale items, etc.   until 8 a.m. Put away the meat load, order meat for the next day or weekend before 10 a.m. I also order meat supplies ad spices.   Filling up meat upright coolers with merchandise, changing displays, cutting and packing meat. Most of all this was done with a crew of 5 to 10 team members. Most of this activities was done in coordination with my Teal Leader and regional policies. Doing recaps, spoilage, punch reports on Mondays, pay bills, etc. Once a month I Inventoried al the department assets and also did  the inventory reports to the regional management."
good,was an expirience good coworkers the managers were ok i guess but low on staff the hours werent really good customers were stuck up had a good time most the time
good,Good Place to work if you are willing to drink the coolaid and are a person that likes to work hard to move up to be led by a bunch of idiots.
good,Greet customers most would be repeats so you are happy to see them. 20% off whole foods products which was a big help because it is an organic grocery store so most things are pricey.
good,"it is retail so they do not care about you , you will be replaced quick if you are not liked.  the pay is not worth the amount of work you have to put in."
good,"What I like about Whole Foods was the people I've worked with. They were very friendly and we all worked as a team. We all got to know one another in the slowest part of the year which was during the summer. It brought us closer to understand one another and worked as a team a lot quicker. "
good,"average place to work, customers nice to deal with as customers go. time to move on. good bye whole foods"
good,"I learned many skills working for Whole Foods Market. I adjusted to many different leadership styles throughout my employment. I formed many friendships with my co-workers and leadership. Had fun working with a diverse group of team members. "
good,Overall Whole Foods is a good company to work for.  However there needs to be a lot of changes in the company starting with some of the managers.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Whole Foods Market. It is exciting and fun with great people. It is a great environment for making connections and learning new things everyday."
good,I worked here while in college. It was my second job in addition to another part time job.
good,"It is a very stressful company to work for at least at the store level. The amount of pressure placed on management from Regional leadership trickles it's way down to the Team Members, bringing down moral. "
good,"typical day- a work came in gave out banks to cashiers/team members"
good,"very high stress level job , at any time you can get fired , management act very funny"
good,"A typical shift begins with running payroll for the entire store, and will encompass a variety of tasks depending on the day. I will run a variety of human resources reports for teams and leadership, and discuss benefits options with Team Members. I will also consult with team, store, and regional leadership on concerns of the store including leading investigations. Conversations throughout the day vary from discussing the health of the store and the status of new hires to serious matters within the store. I also post jobs and process new hires. Every day brings a different set of deadlines, which has helped me develop a greater sense of prioritization and time management. "
good,"The pay and benefits are good; however, there is little job security.  It can also be hard for some to advance within the company.  Overall not a bad place to work."
good,"the people that work there are cool just  always working "
good,Everyone were fairly friendly. A typically day consist of standing for long period operating cash register. Time to time short competition in speed of cashing out customers.
good,Learned alot. Lovely team members that work well together.
good,You will work hot and cold calls. If you want to work on your sales skills this is a good entry level position that will train you.
good,"Working at Whole Foods was a great learning experience, i was able to perform multiple assignments nearly everyday such as putting chicken on and taking them off a rotisserie oven, making pizzas by hand and from scratch,slicing deli meats and cheeses, preparing and prepackaging food, assisting customers, and maintenance of the department and tools we use daily.The hardest part of the job was being able to make sure every person we serve was satisfied completely, although it did not prove to be such a difficult task at all. Management and team members were almost like a second family when in the work place making it a very comfortable environment."
good,"Typical day at work started at 5 am. Responsible for setting up the floor, delegating work out to team members, writing the orders among other administrative work, and ensuring the p.m. crew was set up for success. I learned a lot about time management, critical thinking, and working with many different personalities. The hardest part of the job wasn't the physical labor, nor the administrative work; but the people and working with many different attitudes and motivation levels. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to put a plan together, order for it, motivate the team about my vision, and of course MERCHANDISE IT!!"
good,Productive and fun workplace with co-team members.I learned a lot about what the quality of fruits and vegetables..and also to communicate to the costumers and how we give their satisfaction.The hardest part of the job was the schedule.The most enjoyable part of the Job was while im refilling the rack and the Isle and do the value add products
good,"The Whole Foods Market organization is a good place to work, it can be stressful dealing with the public but if you can handle taking on the needs of others before your self while on the clock then you have most of the job down pact.  the hardest part of the job is the travel distance as i live 60 miles from my current store and make just enough to cover my bills and gas,  What i enjoy most is the people, between team members from all sorts of backgrounds and even the customers who on a good day will have a joke to tell or a story we may enjoy the people make the job what it is.  I have learned that working as a team is the only way we can succeed not only in this industry but in life itself."
good,"The work was rather easy, labor intensive but I like that. The benefits were great paid time off, decent health insurance at an affordable cost. I like most of my co-workers, all types of different people. However the management takes it very personal if you decide to take a second job, or decide to change your hours to better your own life, major downfall in my opinion. Its one of their core values to keep their employees happy in that aspect the fail miserably."
good,"Great company to work for a very friendly place to work at."
good,If you have passion and are recognized for what you do than you can move up pretty quickly.  If you don't then you are stuck at the bottom of the barrel.
good,- Marketing based with an emphasis on client-engagement and community involvement.
good,"Always keep you rule book. "
good,"cake decorators for the most part have full creative control. leadership tries to help out with suggestions, but for the most part you are able to be as creative as you want."
good,I worked at Whole Food's because I needed a summer job. Whole Food's hires employees with the expectation of giving them a career.
good,Always room to elevate and everyone works together. The compensation is excellent and they start pay paying well above minimum wage. Great food as well
good,good place to work not enough hours. great people to work with. duties keep store clean and safe for the customers and workers.
good,Served as a first point of contact for the general public.  Worked with multiple departments to coordinate special orders and requests.  Built and maintained relationships with vendors and a variety of community leaders.
good,"walk into work start working product no in right location, selectors always complain about you in their way, 3 breaks which is nice"
good,"I feel the Hinsdale IL location specifically has to weed out and disperse some of the long time people there.  It has allowed for some bullying and underhanded behavior.  Other locations are far superior in work environment.  Not a recommended place to work at all."
good,Days at work are typically slow but enjoyable. Lots of great information as an employee about healthy diets.
good,"I loved my time at whole foods, It is a good company with a lot of benefits, advancements are there for those that choose to advance"
good,"At Whole Foods, it is a necessity to work with a large number of employees as well as customers.  I learned how to represent the company positively and efficiently while carrying out day-to-day responsibilities. Management's expectations of customer service representatives are very high and sometimes exhausting, but helps keep service at a high level.  Co-workers are fun to work with and easy to develop a nice relationship with.  The hardest part of the job is the speed of customer turnover and being able to stand for long periods of time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is developing a positive relationship with customers and fellow employees."
good,two thumbs up..learn alot of new things..enjoyed the people..
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was going home at the end of the day.  The positions I have held did not allow for a social life and all I do is work.
good,Typical retail environment. Managers sometimes seem to rarely be in unison and don't see take in consideration that employees have family lives also. I don't understand why people get so strung out with retail jobs. Its retail.
good,"Excellent customer service, making deliveries"
good,I had a learning experience. meeting new people and just being able to have a great work environment was overall good.
good,"great place to work at, with room to improve yourself."
good,Whole Foods is an innovative company. However they are a somewhat closed culture and if you are not part of or do not participate in their culture you will be left to feel like an outsider.
good,I am a food handler. I inspect food and maintain appropriate temperature settings.  I maintain proper hygiene and sanitation of food stations.  I also restock food stations as needed.  What I have learned is how to eat healthy and live better. The management in my department they have been fair as needed. My co-workers are fun people to work with. The hardest part of my job is pleasing the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is sharing the laughs during our shifts.
good,"they treat you like you work in a corporation, and expect too much from some team members. its all about who you know"
good,"A typical Day at seaworld was making sure u put the customers first. Seaworld or management felt like because of the money that was spent to get in the park customers should always come first which made them our priority, the reason why we worked to satisfy the customer every need so they may return to the park, this was my first job I had I was a minor and wouldn't take back this experience never in my life, it taught how to become responsible, my fellow coworker was fun and loving."
good,"I learned a lot about food and cooking while employed, and having freedom in creating menus and recipes was enjoyable.  Unfortunately, customer service tends to suffer due to managerial constraints, and benefits and compensation, while above average for the field, are still lacking"
good,"fast paced environment, which allowed a constant workflow"
good,earned how to budget money for department. Placed orders for product through vendors.
good,"A typical day consisted of packing out product on the sales floor, baking bread/cookies, cleaning and sanitizing the department and completing any tasks given by leadership."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working for a company that gives back to it local community and other communities in impoverished countries in need. Whole Foods works in a local foundation where women in Africa make baskets by hand as their business. The basket are call Blessing Baskets. We sell them at higher prices where the women can have money to support their families and themselves.The women are able to sent their children to school, buy clothes and shoes for family. We even help provide clean water wells for villages and build schools. When customers come into the store and notice them it bring a smile to my heart sharing the reason for the foundation and its importance of customer purchasing the basket and the impact it will make on the lives of the women in those countries. There are many more foundations and non-profits Whole Foods Markets and everyday I am able to share with my customers the importance of them all and how they can or helping to change the lives of others."
good,Good place to work and get some good food. Discount and opportunity for growth are great
good,"We kept really busy there. There is always a task at hand so the day would go by really fast. Really busy, huge working environment since it was the Whole Foods on union square. "
good,"First check sales, place orders, set up full service seafood counter, help customers"
good,Great place to work. Really enjoyed the opportunity to work there.
good,work conditions are ok. company no longer exist around this area. Outsourced.
good,"Whole Foods Market in Charlotte, NC is a unique store compared to others I have worked/visited, however, the management is beyond the poorest I have ever worked for. The grocery team leader is by far the least experienced manager I have ever had and doesn't know how to manage a successful team. Other departments are experiencing the same issues especially in the front end. I was promised advancement with the company for the experience and history I have had with the company but instead received nothing but aggravation."
good,Delt with mobile pallet jacks & forklifts to select items for packaging & distribution via freight trucks.
good,Whole Foods is very healthy and environmental friendly company to work for. They have an excellent discount program for their team members.
good,assist customers with health food stocking co workers were professional
good,"A typical day at this job would be coming in at 8am and pretty much get right to it. This job had me learn good computer skills and great motivation. management was very nice always there to help. My co workers were very friendly and easy to get along with. There wasn't really anything hard about this job, you just have to zone in and do it. The most enjoyable part would be the people i worked with."
good,Its very reputious. They pay decent. I've learned alot about differnent foods.
good,"Fun and exciting place to work. As far as the opportunities for career advancement; it is not by your qualifications but by who you know period. Thats unfortunate, Wholefoods has lost a lot of great people because of this type of treatment. This is why I'm looking else where."
good,The company has core values but does not live up to them. There is a lot of back stabbing and double standards.
good,whole foods is fun and great environment but i want start career
good,Its OK to work there but there are other places that offer more money.
good,"Great learning experience. I became very knowledgeable as far as healthy eating was concerned. Also this compa.ny prefers to promote from within, as a result there are plenty of opportunities for growth. The benefit plan is excellent"
good,Prepared Food and Customer Service. Management was good. Co-workers were on task.
good,"I enjoyed coming to work and creating new pizzas. Management was cool, they kinda let us have our way as long as we didn't violate company policy. The job wasn't hard at all."
good,I worked at WFM for three years.
good,"Depending on your department, a typical day would include stocking shelves or displays, handling back stocks, checking for losses, logging information, packing out, facing product, working with fresh food and/or cleaning your department."
good,Excellent benefits. Fun environment. Management needs consistency.
good,They claim to hold team member happiness among one of their core values as well as environmental consciousness. That all takes a second seat to profitability.
good,"Loved the people I worked with. They truly cared about the environment, products and everything you think of when you think of whole foods. The leadership is questionable though. Lots of products repacked instead of thrown out, and play strong favorites."
good,"Working at Whole Food was a great experience to have. Although the scheduling was hard because they make it 3 weeks in advance it made difficult to take days off. Also, some customers were friendly and understanding some were a little rude."
good,A decent work environment with the typical task for your job description.management can be way better.The pay is great with alot of different people with other backgrounds.
good,"you can learn a lot of things working for whole foods in small amount of time. you do have the chance to move up pretty quick for the company, if you have the ambition and the goal to do that. they do offer pretty good benefits for full time employees. the management isn't always the best. i've worked in 2 different departments, one of the team leaders was ok and somewhat understanding in some cases, but the second team leader was pretty bad in communicating, schedule making, and understandings. sometimes they can promote people to certain positions that don't acquire to have all the knowledge they're supposed to have to help management. it is pretty predictable that in most cases in most departments, there isn't much team work, and some employees can cause more work for other employees, which isn't fair."
good,"I love whole foods and what it stands for but I am stuck in my position. They promised advancement and eventually becoming full time, however this never happened, even after speaking to all the right people. They would assure me to keep applying and keep letting them know I wanted to advance, but nothing would happen and they would continue to hire other individuals for the positions they told me I would get. They definitely do try and treat everyone equally but it is still retail and it does feel the same as any other grocery store. The individuals you work with are what genuinely keep you here, not the company. Not to mention you are made to do Amazon returns and possibly Amazon shopping, but you do not get any benefits through amazon. Some individuals will be hired as a cashier and made to be an amazon shopper, and others were hired on as an amazon shopper and made to be a cashier, and some were hired to be a barista and are being made to work in bakery or prepared foods. Very frustrating."
good,"The most thing about whole foods is that the help you grow as an employee and kept you pushing forward. Although, a typical day for me would be a successfully complete tasks throughout my shift. However , not having what the customers wanted in stock would normally be the hardest part of the job I can think of. Management itself is out standing, but also need a lil improvement, other than that everything’s good."
good,"Depending on which department you work for, each is different. however, the benefits overweigh the ""bad"" parts about the job. Mostly just terrible supervisors or higher-ups and the workplace is just depending on which location you will work in. However, the benefits are really nice and so is the pay."
good,"A typical day at whole foods market is basically helping customers with questions and selling product, cleaning department, stocking product that's a normal day."
good,"Working for Whole Foods was a good experience, management takes time very serious and having a preferred schedule is out of the question. The people are relatable but the hours are crazy because they are open late."
good,"I did my best to advance and step up but when it came down to my yearly reviews, they always found a reason to not give me my raise. Not the kind of company you wanna work for. Not unless your young."
good,"Very stable job not much room for advancement. Same routine everyday, good for teens or retired elderly looking to make a few extra dollars with not much labor."
good,"They have a strong lack of communication there specially about their policies what changes mostly every week, schedule issues forcing you or to work part tine or leave,"
good,"The pay is minimal and company decisions are made according to immediate customer response. They will definitely throw an employee under the bus in order to make sure a customer is ""satisfied."" The pay is barely enough to afford groceries there, even with your discount."
good,Enjoyed learning about organic foods and specialty diets/food.  Food seems to be a lifestyle to the people that shop there and I found that very interesting.  Store management was amazing and seemed to actually care about the employees.
good,Customer Service is front end where we check our customers items make sure bags are stocked our registers are clean aprons are on and name tags were present and It was always room for growth whole food is a fast paced company that you just have to stay on top of your game
good,"Whole Foods is often quite busy, but as long as you have good communication skills and are willing to multitask and work with like minded people, you'll enjoy working there."
good,"Great company to work for with co-workers/culture - not so great in the long run. Long / strange schedules, multiple department help from own department, awesome bar shifts."
good,"I am a whole foods shopper thru amazon, I just shop for customers. Whole food is a nice place but I  paid thru amazon prime not thru whole foods market"
good,"Whole Foods Market was a great experience and a great opportunity for me. I learned skills that I could carry on to other jobs in the future, as well as, that I can use in my everyday life."
good,There were lots of great benefits of working at whole foods back when I worked there. All those benefits are gone. There is no bonus scheme. Less incentives. But still the same pressure.
good,its a good job filled with inscentives to up your pay...its only a hard job if you let it get in your head ..very fast paced...well rounded group of workers
good,"I won’t say that my experience is typical of what you would expect at Whole Foods, as I only worked there over the holiday season. As a whole, it seemed like a good community of people working there, who all helped out each other and had good communication between departments."
good,"Better work life balance needed, desperately.  Excellent benefits, excellent pay. HARD work, HIGHEST standards. No consistency in scheduling unles your specific position requires it."
good,Company had good benefits. Work life balance was decent. There was a lot of scratch cooking involved. There were not a lot of employees. They made you take mandatory breaks.
good,First thing you should respect customers and coworkers around you. Second thing you should be on time. Third thing you be Har worker than other. Thank you
good,"I began working for WFM in 2009 and for years I was nearly completely content there. I liked the work I did and the community WFM fostered among team members and the surrounding community. But as the company grew, the sense of community was sacrificed for the sake of profits. Raises that were given were revoked unjustly, benefits and pay decreased, and workload increased. Also, the amount of money buyers were permitted to allot to local profit was drastically reduced in favor of product that was mass produced and from afar."
good,I enjoyed working for Whole Foods but after they were bought by Amazon there were staffing budget cuts and increased workload.  Whole Foods did not compensate employees for parking in San Francisco. Management did not participate in filling gaps in departments made by budget cuts.
good,Some days were crazy and some were fun and relaxed. if you have a true desire to move up I would say its totally possible but it is competitive and if they don't like your attitude or you don't get along with your store manager it will be pretty difficult.
good,"It's ok to work at. U mainly have to stick with yourself but there are some people who can work as a team, help customers.  There are some nice customers but they are some who throw things, they curse at u for no reason"
good,I didnt feel I would be able to move up in the company with no benefits after 6 months and the constant cut of hours every week I didnt always feel noticed in my hard work or get recognized for anything
good,There are many specific guidelines and standards that have to be followed making the job labor intensive. There is a lot of opportunities to move up in positions if you are willing to move around stores.
good,All locations differ but i worked on 23 street. It was total favoritisim. They are more for senority versus morals. The workers were kind and shift management but the higher ups were complete aeeful.
good,Prepare to put in a full day’s work. The location I am currently at is constantly fast paced. Best advice is buy comfy shoes or crocs are your feet will hate you in the morning
good,"hours can be from 5 am to 12:30pm, or  3pm-11:30pm"
good,"Great part time job at $15/hr. Hard to move up in management. Learn a lot about cooking, flavor palettes, and recipes. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. Typical work easiness depends on management and how well they do - can be hit or miss."
good,"Entry level positions are not very demanding in terms of stress or workload, so long as you are good at working with people (very Team-oriented, and customer service is always your number one priority.) "
good,"there is a lot of pressure to perform well at work. talking to co-workers is discouraged and there is no rotating to different jobs on the floor. managers will talk down to you like a child. some supervisors are positive and upbeat, but they don't spend very much time on the floor or help unless its slammed."
good,Management could be better that is the only one flaw because they don’t take responsibility for there own action and mistakes puts it on others but they do work with your schedule
good,"Working as a team member in NYC was fine as a temporary job. The most unhappiness I see is with people who stay hoping for things to come to them without changing themselves and trying to grow as employees. Your workplace attitude and approach is one thing, but the Team Leader's ability to delegate and encourage employees really sets the tone. As a young, college-educated woman in NYC looking to advance her career and work hard, I was regularly thrown under the bus and mistreated. Team members belittled me for my work ethic. The culture, at least for me, was upsetting and often disappointing. While the big picture mission is great, it's not relevant on a daily basis. I wish it had been."
good,Store leadership sucks. Team leadership was ok. Took me over a year and half to get full time. I was fired for filling out the temp log wrong. Theres no union so...they do have a system but basically they do what they want. Overall it's a good place to work and pay is pretty good.
good,"$15/hr starting salary is indeed very attractive for people looking for a first job, and the benefits are indeed really good for this caliber of occupation. Work is fast-paced and demanding, especially on major holidays. On the bright side, co-workers can be very friendly and cooperative. The store tends to attract the affluent and trendy, depending on what the type of area the store is located. "
good,"I was a specialty team member at whole foods market at first it seemed like a good job everyone was very welcoming and supportive. Then as I approached the six months probation Everyone started to change management began to Cast Negative Feedback towards me such as scream and yell at me i was never exposed to that in my life and it is a shame that whole foods hires people like that. Also, I was never able to find the spot when I had to start my shift As where the store was located in Brooklyn in Park slope This store had a parking lot that was quite big enough to accommodate employee parking but was not. it was a constant battle to find a parking space when i had to work And it was also an excuse from management to write you up for being late. Also, The discount that I receive as a whole foods market team member was very little it was only 10% Which in my opinion Is not worth it because everything is very expensive and you just save a small portion from the discount. Also, I never had An easy day on the job It was always constant pressure and also doing things that were not part of your job description. I would not recommend to people Who is not able to work as a team and also don't mind going crazy on a daily basis trying to find a spot."
good,"Transition to Amazon caused many issues, workplace culture suffered greatly.  Demands on employees have become unattainable.  Local management is under a great deal of stress and this can be felt throughout the whole chain of employees."
good,"Although some things I did not care for.  Overall when I worked with them I had a good experience. I understand the need for informing the employees with information needed to give the customers the best products, however sometimes I feel it was overkill."
good,I was able to move around to many different departments within Whole Foods and learn a lot of different things.  There is a lot of room for growth of culinary knowledge.
good,"Worked here in college, would recommend for students or artists/musicians building a portfolio. There is growth available if you do a good job and talk to management about what you can do next."
good,"I was a Guest Services supervisor. The work was fast-paced and, overall, I think of my years with WF fondly."
good,"It was good to work there."
good,"Great place to work if you are looking for stability. When it comes to advancement the work culture is subject to a lot of bias. If leadership doesnt have a good relationship with you your accomplishments, work ethic, and skills do not matter even if those skills are with customers. I would not recommend Whole Foods Market as a career under certain leadership."
good,"The management wasn't all that great when I` was working there but the pay and hours were excellent. The company gave time and a half, paid time off and all types of benefits"
good,I wasn't please with the layout and overall feeling at this particular wholefoods. employees felt cold and distant. The training provided painted a much different picture of the overall attitude people would have towards one another and how they would interact with customers was completely different
good,Although the cashier position is simple and this job can be very repetitive. I learned a lot about health and about a wider range of foods. The management can either way your job fun or a hassle. This job is quite diverse. The hardest part of the job can be patience with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable is the friends you make with other employees. Although this wasn't the job for me. I can see it being the best for someone else especially if your very social.
good,The money was above average they try to stay competitive with wages. You can really advance in your career with hard work it only took me 3 months to go from a part time cashier to a leadership role.
good,"Stressful environment, lack of staff, poor health insurance benefits, and a ridiculous amount of tasks for one person to accomplish.  When I started there were 8 people working, soon there were 5 with the same things expected of them."
good,"The pay, benefits, culture, customer base, and product are a small (yet significant) step up compared to most other retail companies. That being said, at the end of the day it is still a grocery store and comes with the same complaints you'd find anywhere else in the industry."
good,"I liked the culture and history of the company. Learned a whole lot about food, produce, and healthier ways of living. Enjoyed the culture of the company and the ""free"" atmosphere."
good,Great company but poor management. Benefits were great and pay. Customers were hateful and management would take their side. A lot of gossip and assumptions that would lead to accusing great employees of doing something they weren’t. Great healthy food variety though but extremely expensive.
good,"While the management is somewhat lacking, you will not find better peers to work with. Compensation is adequate for job responsibilities and there are plenty of advancement opportunities if you are willing to do the leg work and possibly relocate."
good,"This job was okay. The hardest part is adjusting to a constantly shifting schedule, and is not good for people who don't like a regular routine...."
good,"When you work at wholefoods you don't get a fixed schedule unless you are going to school. Hours & days changes practically every week. You' re entitled to a raise every year but it's 40 to 60 cents. Also whenever their is a pay raise company wise, if you already making over that amount proposed you won't get a penny. For example, when I got hired 4 yrs ago, I started with $11.5 since then there been 2 pay raises: $12.50 & $15 next month ( Nov 2018). I wont get anything cuz  now I am getting $15.50 as a buyer/supervisor. So I will get pretty much as much as our future new hires even though I am considered a lower level management with 4 years experience at the company."
good,"I worked at two separate locations during my time with the company and met a lot of great people, many of which I still call friends. However management is atrocious at understanding their team members and the Amazon takeover has made things worse. I've worked for several grocery chains and I can tell you there are definitely worse places to work than WFM,  but at the end of the day it's still retail."
good,"Working at Whole Foods Market here in Miami, FL was very odd. The management was horrendous. Working by their logic felt quite catastrophic compared to what I've witnessed and heard from others in other locations."
good,It's not what they make it look like. But for the most part it is a nice environment to be in. you get a few snappy customers but thats customer service for you.
good,Overall day at whole foods is more relaxing than your typical job although it can be overwhelming depending on the time of year and which Location you are at. I recommend it
good,"I enjoy my job but it gets a little routine. Management is good although my position is pretty much self managed. Excellent culture but not what it used to be. The hard parts of my job are what I enjoy the most, balancing product levels with purchasing targets."
good,"Typical day at work come in and clock in. Walk over to the supervisor working at the time and they'll tell you to bag or be a cashier. They'll see who needs a break or who is off and you'll take over for them. Since the introduction of prime savings the hardest part was being an employee of Amazon. Being forced to market for Amazon Prime was tiring and did not come in the job description. I applied for a customer service job, not marketing. Had to ask every customer if they're a prime member then proceed to wait 5 minutes while they fumble with their phone and you have to give them a sales pitch about how it all works."
good,typical retail grocery store life.  grumpy customers and unreliable coworkers.  has its good and bad days but gets boring after years of the same thing
good,The deli section was really fast paced. The management was great but the job itself was harder than expected. The work environment and people were nice however there is hierarchy and drama. You meet a lot of nice customers and workers.
good,"A great place to work but not if you're a single parent in leadership. They didn't care about my family life, weren't understanding when my children were having troubles. I was in leadership I should have have been treated respectably"
good,I worked in the meat department. I had a great time learning something different. I would of stayed if I was able to become a meat cutter or full time position. A lof of the jobs are Part time.
good,"When hired I was absolutey grateful and excited to feel that i was finally going to work for a company that I've believed in for 10 plus years. I can only speak for myself, but right from the beginning the experience felt completely backwards. I'm not sure if the problems stem from management and being very corporate in the way things operate, or something more obvious like adhering towards customers that can afford and desire a certain level of ""treatment"".  I suppose that's how it has to be in order to become such a massive company.  "
good,The management says they care and are flexible and at first thats how it is. But eventually they will stop caring about you as a person. The Customer base also thinks you are a robot and will treat you as such. Their policy on saying 'Yes' to ever customer every time creates monsters and the management will let the guests go off on you with only a meager sorry. They don't care about their employees and will bribe you to say that they do.
good,"It is a fun place to work. The communication between the supervisors is not steady. I would prefer if my work schedule was the same more often. I do like the benefits and the pay. Human resources needs improvement in my opinion, but overall it is a nice place to work and all my coworkers are very friendly."
good,"Whole Foods was my family for a time, I loved the people that I worked with and enjoyed the time that I spent there. Their culture used to be centered around Organics and humane practices while growing with the community. While I was there I learned how to cut meat, clean fish, cook and push sales while working in 3 different locations and multiple teams. Management at Whole Foods was always different, each department was run like it's own store.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the clientele, you could expect to be catering to a crowd of vegans after the stores were already closed, only to have them return the items for full price the next day. Overall the company was a good experience for me and helped me to develop my work ethic."
good,"This is a great job if you are in college, however, if you support yourself, it is hard to live off of the part-time hours. By far the most annoying thing is the requirement of full-time availability to work in a full-time position. Basically, if you want full-time, they can schedule you whenever, you cannot give any preference to your hours."
good,"I enjoy working with the team members, got so many multi task due. "
good,Whole Foods Market offers opportunity for people to work in an environment that is accepting to everyone. Offers great health benefits and room for advancement.
good,I spent many years working there and it was mostly a great experience and I learned a lot. My job got crazier with time and was eventually eliminated .
good,"Whole foods prided itself on going against a ""corporate"" vibe for the duration of its lifetime. In my time there I saw that change entirely around. We had new managers rotate in all the time and with each new one it felt less and less organized."
good,"It was Slightly stressful for me.  I worked alone, and sometimes had huge loads left over from the night shift.  Fellow employees were very nice and helpful.  I enjoyed working there."
good,"Theres some good and bad things about it, like any job I guess. The benefits are really good. The management is mostly really bad, but, hey, its retail."
good,"Managing daily operations of food production and providing customer service. This includes interviewing, hiring, corrective counseling, training and scheduling staff. Purchasing and spoilage control, inventory management and coordinating menus/ production. Department maintenance and stock replenishment of products. Weekly and monthly leadership/ staff meetings to communicate new menus and ideas for department. High- profile vendor interaction, vendor contracts and negotiations, marketing and promotional support, department projects and creating systems. Duties also involved driving sales by creating incentive programs, direct emails/ faxing to store management, Corporate Office, vendors and clients. Implemented catering systems/ production, scheduling of catering events and times, cross merchandising with other departments to boost sales and supporting culls program to assist with other departments. Opening and closing of department, employee evaluations, time details, support and file maintenance."
good,"I did enjoy working there as a team member, however, I felt like I just didn’t fit in with the young crowd.  I got along VERY WELL with millennials (while in the workplace). I guess I would have been included in activities like “happy hour,” but most of the “kids” looked at me as “mom!”  One of the downside of the job is they schedule cashiers to be “baggers/cart retrievers” two shifts per week.  I’m 60 years old and another cashier was 65 and hauling carts out of snow banks (no cart return in parking lot), in rain, sleet, snow, windchills in the negative numbers...it wasn’t pretty!!"
good,"really does a number on your body after awhile. the environment is real cool and friendly. its really a fast pace store, especially on the weekends. the hardest position is being a cashier assistant, which means taking care of carts and baskets and getting price checks."
good,"i enjoyed the people that i worked with, the discount on groceries, and the benefits. I enjoyed the seasonal products, looking around the store at all the new products, and spending time talking to my fellow employees."
good,"I feel that the WFM structure works very well. You are given a lot of training long before you ever actually start your first day, and are guided fairly well with the expectations for you job duties. Once you join a team you have to work hard to prove yourself to your team, because after 90days the team gets to vote and decide if you are right for the position. otherwise you must leave the department and seek opportunities in other departments, if they are willing to consider you. Over all I really enjoyed my time working at WFM, i was just unfortunate to have a poor retention of Team Leaders, as well as other upper management positions. Our location did very well with sales, but there were always issues with not having support from store management."
good,"Not much more to say. People get comfortable there. Unqualified people get put into higher positions based on popularity, not skills. I moved up a lot in the 7 years I was there, but ultimately, the pay didn't change much. I attribute a lot of great experience from there to get better jobs after."
good,I helped open the uptown whole foods and it was such a fun process. Overall the pay just is'nt enough to afford to live in the area that it's located.
good,"very strict policies that are easy enough to abide by, but once you mess up enough you're done. other employees are usually really great and accommodating."
good,"Good place for learning and training . I made a very good friends."
good,"Constantly busy. Properly got breaks."
good,Working at Whole Foods Market is a good opportunity but the management over here have favoritism. They always get away with a lot of things but overall it’s a great place to work.
good,The company was going through a lot of changes and I feared that the culture that made it special was going to get swallowed up by a monopolizing corporation.
good,part timers write their own schedule. Constantly short staffed. Expected to fulfill all leadership duties while also working a venue every shift. Very unproductive work place
good,"I am not comfortable giving my opinions. "
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods in theory, but ultimately, their lack of desire to have full time employees killed it for me. People work there for many years before you even have a chance to apply for full time; some people even move to different states to get this position. In the end, everyone moves on unless they have someone in their house that can support  them while they struggle to get a livable paycheck. Their random hours made it impossible to keep a second job as well."
good,fun place to work as long as you don't want to move up. I worked there before the Amazon takeover so I don't know how it has changed. It couldn't have gotten worse than what it was.
good,"Whole Foods was probably one of the best jobs I have worked. You get some benefits and fair treatment. It was pretty typical cashier work, sometimes boring. A lot of people quit or get fired because of attendance. You cannot be late more than a few times a year or you will be fired on the spot. I have seen managers, and co-workers working here for 15+ years fired from coming in late more than 3 times in 6 months. "
good,"It used to be great.  As the marketplace has continued to fill up with competition focused on organics, local suppliers and clean products, Whole Foods has seemingly made poor decisions to combat the pressure."
good,"I was excited to work there, when I finally got the job I was met with rude coworkers. Not everyone was rude but unfortunately, the teams/departments felt so segregated that I felt such a lack of support from most everyone there. I worked in bakery and supposedly that department was particularly cursed."
good,"I usually began my day stocking product that had been received earlier in the morning. I enjoyed helping customers find the products they were seeking and answering pertinent questions. I did not receive much training but had to do my own research to be prepared for the job. I spent the closing shifts in the evening going through the department and ""facing"" the product so the store looked like it was just stocked."
good,a good place to work but there is a lot of unnecessary stress and tension. there is a lot to remember but overall a fun fast paced workplace. the management  is very unfair and problematic.
good,"The company is changing as acquired by Amazon, still the poor strategic planning remains and the company grown in this country is equal to zero. Low wages, good workers community. Lot of daily tasks and duties, thre is more than enough to be busy. There are strong company ethics still the attention for simple workers is low, not easy to grow a career. Most of the people work on weekly shift basis."
good,"A good company if you want to change to different departments within the grocery store also if you want to locate toan other location in the USA. "
good,"fast paced work environment you have to really push yourself if you wanna compete to be one of the best workers in the building, hardest part is trying to stay motivated when others around might be losing their motivation"
good,Whole foods is a great place my place just had bad managing. Whole foods is still a well respected place to shop and learn and my experience in whole foods and with people took a big leap
good,"Management do not really help as much as needed on front end. customer tend to be rude, when they want something priced differently or free without management approval."
good,Whole Foods is a great job to have if you are going to school. It is great too if you are looking to move up in a company. They promote healthy eating and diverse culture which was my favorite part of the job. I was able to meet different people and learn about other as well as teach them.
good,"Jobs is great for students who want to make money. The co-workers are very hard working, but rarely a few are just lazy and do nothing. Job starts to get very repetitive after a couple months and many people start to get bored. By all means, if you love what you do then do it, but if not, then find what you're passionate about and follow that dream."
good,Working at this place is great.  The environment is warm and welcoming.  The benefits are great as well but the hours are lacking badly.  The managers need more training in their position as the store is new in the area.
good,There was benefits and downfalls like most jobs. My manager at the time wasn't very professional and wasn't willing to listen to his workers. Besides that it was fine.
good,"You have to be able to juggle lots of things at once including customer, sales reps, upper management and the store itself.  By organizing yourself, the job keeps you on your toes."
good,"I was very happy there and would have continued working there, had I not had to move out of the area.  The company has recently been acquired by Amazon and I would definitely work for them again if I get the opportunity."
good,"I wanted to work in the Global Office and thought working in the store would help my chances of getting ""inside."" After talking to a number of people, I learned that some even worked in the store for 10 years before being able to move to corporate level. This was disheartening and a big part of why I left. I could not make a career out of cashiering & it did not seem like there were other opportunities for growth."
good,Good place to work .its going through a big transaction now . I feel like they need to get back to want made them a great company . They need to hire better people
good,It was not so bad place to work. I had fun. One time we went to the zoo. The zoo is kind of a messed up place though. They give us a lot of rewards there
good,Good place to work overall. Wide variety of jobs and a reasonable amount of opportunity for growth. Pay is mediocre but otherwise a fun place to be. The discount is a definite plus.
good,A great place to be in the team .learn new skills and have a great time .Learn to be patient and help your customers be in a great environment .Had a great time and experience working with Whole Foods
good,"Once the company was made public , the decline in the culture shifted. It was all about stockholders and not the team members . Benefits were cut and hrs were cut too."
good,okay place to work at first but chances to advance was slim if at all and if you are good at something they try to keep you in that same position and not let you advance
good,It was difficult to have a personal life and work at Whole Foods. I met great people there but overall it was very stressful. Looking back I'm glad I have this work experience.
good,Always confused as to what was needing to be done at Whole Foods. Regional management was not good about communicating and so our management in the store was always stressed out about something.
good,First time working and was used as quite the experience. Learning how to interact and communicate with people was definitely a pro from working here. Very friendly environment as well.
good,"Job environment is very chill.  Lots of things to do within a certain department, but also many opportunities to cross train. Flexible hours and a motivational staff."
good,"A very fun job, the hours could be more regular. Checked movement to order or discontinue products. Researched new beers to add. Reduced time on hand to control back stock."
good,They keep on requiring me to leave a review just to preview my own resume.  I do not want to write a review nor do I want to write one hundred fifty characters.
good,Whole foods is a ok place to work you do the sae thing every day which is fine but they rarely give full-time. It takes a team vote in order for you to even almost acquire good hours. No job to survive in this expensive Los Angeles city
good,Great job just got tired or working late hours. Had some good managers and bad ones. The culture had changed since I first started and didn't the change.
good,This job was boring and stressful at the same time. Managers were always looming and being critical of tasks so simple that they were impossible to screw up.
good,good place to work. very friendly work place where every body knows and is friendly to every body. very social place to work. and entertaining. i like working there.
good,"It seemed that I had a different work ethic.  Thinking back it may be because I had been unemployed for a period, but most of the employees have long term employment."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Whole Foods, particularly the people that I worked with. The company really cares about their employees. The job was overall very fulfilling."
good,"A typical day starts with reading the store for opening, a 5 minute store meeting, receiving and stocking product and a continual focus on customer service."
good,"•	Diagnose and execute all necessary electronic, electrical and mechanical repairs or upgrades."
good,"While boasting great values, this company does not utilize its employees well.  Management is haphazard at best, and uncommunicative at worst.  Very difficult to advance without being friendly with people higher up the chain, and working hard/accepting more responsibility yields no positive feedback or advancement.  Very high turnover rate in employees of every department at every level of management.  Good culture, bad management."
good,I believe it really depends on the particular store that you work at. There are things that as a company I believe could be better but the personality of the store itself makes working there positive or negative and fortunately I work with good people in an accepting store environment.
good,"A typical day at work was to come in and pack all the items that were on sale. I was responsible to fill all the counters with merchandise and tag them. My job responsabilities was to create a helpful and pleasant environment for our guests. I was always supportive to the staff and friendly to our guests.  I learned how to be under supervision and work under a lot of pressure specially on the weekends when most of our guests would come in to shop groceries. It was a multi cultural workplace because the staff was from different ethnicity backgrounds.  The hardest part of the job was insufficient work orders which created a burden on everyone. I really enjoyed helping our guests with all their concerns, questions and complaints. I met so many great co-workers and customers at work."
good,I like it a lot besides all the closing shifts. It felt like a real team that I was apart of. Everyone respected each other and stayed out of one another business. Overall it was a pretty opportunity.
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great company to work for. They offer really great insurance benefits, a 401k package, as well as a really awesome Paid Time Off program. It is a really awesome place to work as far as grocery stores are concerned, however, beware that this company takes customer service very seriously. They will almost always side with a customer if there is a dispute, and team members can and often are punished when a customer is displeased. I have often said that I love working for Whole Foods, but I hate the people that I work for. The management at my specific Whole Foods is overall very inexperienced, and will often take the most dramatic measures in terms of corrective action."
good,This is a decent place to work.They talk a big talk but don't always live up to it. There is an emphasis on working as team and while other team members are good at providing this it doesn't always seem to be leaderships plan.
good,Whole Foods was a company that valued their employees before the wide spread of store openings throughout the chicago area. The hours are fair and with 2 paid breaks and unpaid  lunch it isn't bad. there seems to always be a shortage of towels. Favoritism plays a big role in the store. Equipment is always malfunctioning.
good,some of the management was helpful. overall a fun place to work. discounts on groceries and all product. be prepared to spend more time working than at home
good,don't feel I was treated fairly by my superior. Would use responsibilities as an excuse to slack off and avoid doing work. delegates well but only because he wanted to sit in the back all day
good,Starts with me checking our cold drink case for the lunch rush this allows our grocery truck to get to the store check in and unload. After our truck is ready.
good,"I been in the company for 5 plus years, I move from team member to Team Leader, offers great opportunities to grow in the company."
good,"WFM offers opportunity for growth if you really want it and gives you training opportunities to enhance that growth.  Also, a great opportunities to fund raise for local and global community."
good,It was tough because it was my first job plus i only worked 2 days out the week for 4 hours not worth the travel. I couldn't learn the codes because i was barley there due to only getting 2 shifts a week.
good,"Great location to work for and great staff, but the pay rate is very low. You can't make a living and balance personal life with one job! your forced to take two jobs. How do you give 200% of yourself when you can't balance out your life, with out your personal freedom?"
good,"Come into work, read pass downs of what to do for the day and prepare for the day/night. Management only cares about making the most profit over the health of team members and shorts labor to compensate. Coworkers such as other team members/cooks/dishwashers always friendly and great to work with. Hardest part is receiving little to no help from the Team Leader when days become overwhelming or when questions arise from customers."
good,"I appreciated the values Whole Foods was first established on. But within the past few years, the company has made severe changes that I don't think agrees with the 'values.'"
good,whole food offers many benefits to their employees along with incentives like gainsharing. essentially you get money every month if your team exceeds sales goals.
good,Working at Whole Foods has taught me all about the importance of preserving and protecting the environment. Whole Foods also offers remarkable benefits and decent pay as well as gain-sharing bonus checks.
good,If you have the right Team Leader it can be a healthy fun place to be. There is definitely room for growth and advancement. They offer competitive wages for a retail company. Overall it was a great experience.
good,"Whole foods has become more culturally corporate in recent years, but in my experience you can still have a relaxed work environment if you find yourself on a team of people with similar mindsets."
good,"Once I clocked in, I would walk around the store, check for new items and changes made overnight. I would meet up with my leader for a brief overview. The management needs improvement on communication. The hardest part of the job was staying in the freezer loading up items on the cart."
good,"First thing done upon arrival is put on my uniform, prep and put rotisserie chicken in. I go to the dish room wash some of the dishes for 45 minutes to an hour then take the chickens out package and label them and put them out for customer consumption. I return to the dish room and continue the dishes."
good,"The work isn't challenging, but sometimes customers can be a bit insane. Hours are exceptionally tight, so good luck expecting to survive unless you luck out and get a full time gig. Advancements are rare, and often lateral. Corporate minimum wage keeps going up, though, so that's all right."
good,I learned alot about customerservice the management needs improvement hardest is remembering the code for the produce section but the customer are always greetings & very open minded
good,"A typical day at work starts with you opening your register and getting ready to ring (however if its mid day customers will not allow you to open your register peacefully lol) "
good,"good job, great place, awesome discount, good produce, long hours at times, awesome management. just needs to be better at promoting from within."
good,"Was a fun store to work in before things got a bit ugly. A lot of unnecessary drama between coworkers that seemed to be encouraged by the management. A cashier would tell management they don't like another cashier for personal reasons, then the manager would have a sit down with the unliked cashier and tell him/her to improve his/her behavior. Anonymous reviews of new hires were required by all team members to submit and then the team member would have to listen to negative feedback which was a lot of the time of personal nature or unfair. Overall, a beehive of gossip, unnecessary stress, and high school level cattiness."
good,overall not a bad place to work but the corporate representatives do not give much room for advancement. The atmosphere of the workplace however was very good. some benefits provided.
good,it was a ok job didn't like the fact that the manager moved like he had favorites.i didn't feel the spirit working here or maybe its jus this location.
good,I have learned so much and have gained plenty of experience. The wage increases have been decent and depend on how hard you work.
good,"Building relationship in a Team"
good,I learned their are more healthier choices you can make with nun processed foods and to stick to the healthy salads. Management was ok I didn't really like the way some managers were treating some coworkers as in favoritism. Hardest part of the job was the schedule because at the time I didn't have reliable transportation and they were scheduling me way past the times the hours I was able to have transportation home. My favorite part about working at Whole foods is learning and sampling some of the new foods available.
good,"Up until 2014, WFM was a great place to work with emphasis on team member happiness and a casual atmosphere.  The actions in last few years, reported in most media, have shifted the focus of WFM from employee friendly and health conscious to a ""compete at all costs"" mentality since there is now so much more competition in the organics and healthy food market. This resulted in the laying off of 1500+ employees in late 2015 and a revamped direction in which both seasoned and new team members could potentially be given only part time hours or separated in order to reduce company health insurance spending overall."
good,"I would clock in with my uniform on head straight to the cashier i would be partnering with and start bagging i learned to be very productive. Management was pretty good the managers kept a tight ship, but for the most part work ran smoothly. My coworkers were fun we would all be laughing every shift non stop. I feel the hardest part of the job was during the holidays it was extremely busy and customers would get really angry but it is always important to stay professional and remember to keep the customers happy. I really enjoyed cart duty because i have always been a fitness individual and i love a good workout and being outdoors so that was always my favorite part of the job also it was a good way to interact with the customers."
good,"Wholefoods Market was a stepping stone for me. I started back in 2012, now I am ready for the next chapter in my life. I learned a lot working at wholefoods my lifestyle changed. Definitely would recommend this job to a friend or family."
good,"I spent 4 years at the Columbus Circle location of Whole Foods Market. Being the most visited store in the company as well as being directly across the street from Central Park, the store is almost always crowded and full of interesting characters. The environment is very competitive and allows you to really flex your customer service skills. The hardest part of the job would definitely be having to be ""on"" constantly because there are people everywhere and maintaining good customer service is key. The best part about it is that because it is such a big store, it requires a big team, and meeting so many different people from various backgrounds was eye opening and life changing. I'm so much more comfortable interacting with new people and being thrust into new situations because of Whole Foods Market, and I'm very grateful for that."
good,Working with this company has allowed me to learn a lot about health and nutrition which has resulted in a lifestyle change for myself and my family.  Everyday is unique and challenging at the same time.
good,"Whole Foods is a great place to work. It is not always easy, the retail world, especially a grocery store is demanding. Weekends and holidays are usually part of the game. The compensation and benefits are above their competition. It is easy to become part of the team. WFM strongly encourages growth and career opportunity. Almost everyone is a foodie and you will receive and education in multiple facets."
good,"company is turning more corporate ""claim it not but being competitive"", alot of job cuts in effort to save money and team members are leaving for better jobs. alot of morale issues across the company, and bad decisions from those in"
good,"This was a great position to learn the ins and outs of retail management from financials to merchandizing. Team member issues were rife and the process by which you disciplined was drawn out and fraught with danger (they involve lawyers out of Texas). Store Leader was absent much of the time and being away from mid-Atlantic regional offices meant he could get away with it. He got away with a lot. As each store has much freedom, the quality of the individuals running it can determine how things are. We were a highly profitable store but as the 2nd in command I had to witness some abhorrent stuff go on including inappropriate dealings with female team members. When reports were made about thefts it just depended on who the person stealing was, and whether any thing was done. The company as a whole was great although you better be prepared to play the politics game, however that is most companies. I have to say I loved my time at the company except for the last few years. A lot depends on your immediate manager. I worked under 5-6 different leadership teams and only one was truly horrible. The rest I was able to learn valuable retail, customer serivce, and people skills"
good,"For the most part , the company does promote happieness for the employee. But the rate of pay doesn't way out for the amount of head ache you have at the end of the day."
good,Excellent business philosophy. Good culture with lots of flexibility. Learning in store marketing practices and understanding of food preparation and display. Glad to be part of a company that lives its values.
good,no real communication throughout team and leadership. Just go in and provide customer service and stock shelves with fast mover's or sale items.
good,"Fun and rewarding environment. Work is never boring. CEO is a visionary. Whole Foods offers many programs that give back to the community."
good,"The best thing about this place is the vibe going on. its the people that work there and some of the people that shop there. In terms of advancement, there wasn't really anywhere to go after I graduated college unless i wanted to move to Austin. "
good,"Pacific North West isn't the best place to work at a Whole foods, with all the competition is makes for slow business and with the recent job cuts motivation is at an all time low. It throws any incentive to try and move up out the window. "
good,I really enjoyed my job as the Marketing Team Leader at Old Town. It was an umbrella type marketing manager job that covered a number of areas from community engagement to budgeting to event planning to social media marketing and marketing research. I built a team of six team members and we were very successful for the two years I led the team. We were Top 10 store in the company three consecutive years and were widely known for our weekly Winesday Wednesday event brining in almost 500 people in a two hour period. I built partnerships with the community and worked on a number of community initiatives to build brand awareness around Whole Foods Market. I was a major player in Hunger Free Alexandria and the Alexandria Food and Wine Festival. I was the lead on Décor and Merchandising in the store as well as Market research in the Alexandria community to highlight where our opportunities were. Working towards customer retention and  acquisition strategies implementation. I dealt with competitive openings and strategies to combat that. I really loved my job.
good,Whole Foods Markert taught me how to be a leader. I learned how to balance being independent and lending a hand to others when in need as easy as receiving it.
good,"It was a grocery store heaven that quickly turned purgatory due to insufficient staffing, management acting as if they were crabs in a barrel and tons of non properly trained or prepped staff."
good,"You can start out small and grow with the company but it will be hard work. there is a lot to learn throughout the store departments and most people try to learn about the other department by filling in at times, taking some quick study classes on the store computer or talking with those who work or who've worked in that department before. "
good,"Management is always willing to help you grow as a team member"
good,"Job duties were ok, worked differents shifts that I liked. There was poor management and no direction. I was able to write my own recipes and menus which was fun. Out of product everyday."
good,"The Osteria was an interesting place to work. There was one cook to open the 39 seat restaurant each morning; generally myself. We were responsible for prep, cleanliness, seating, taking orders, getting beverages, cooking orders, serving food, conversing with customers, pre-bussing, cashing out, bussing and dishes all while trying to continue prep and general productivity; not necessarily in that order with little help if any."
good,good place to work for if you have a good leadership. if not they can make your life miserable. growth opportunity if with the right management.
good,"I either set up my station in the kitchen (cutting board, recipes, and other cooking tools), or I'm out on the floor maintaining the salad bar, or hot food bar. My day is interaction with my team, and or customer service needs; I also am responsible for cleaning duties, temperature of food storage locations, and also looking out where I can be of help to others in my department. I enjoy seeing return clients, who I've developed a bond with, who know me by name, and I also remember what they are in my department for; I like my co-workers, and enjoy helping and joking with them, to make for a peaceful, fun motivated work environment."
good,"This is a fast paced, learning and exciting grocery store to shop everyday.  Greeting, listening and answering the customers questions or request with a smile."
good,"Working At Whole Foods Market is okay if you wanna talk about your co-workers, beside that everything else I believe needs more improvement. Thats is just my option."
good,"Good company culture, learned inventory and proper storage and handling of food.  Also proper sanitation was taught. Decent management."
good,"Horrible training and bad management. "
good,Fun workplace with a good environment.  Management isn't the best but there's room for advancement within the company if the proper work etiquette is shown.  Schedule is given only a 4 days in advance to coming week so planning a personal life is hard.  Work life balance isn't the best.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a good team based environment.
good,"Whole Foods was enjoyable employment for the most part. I believe that there was a lack of constancy among employees, as well as not enough training provided in order to excel and move up in company."
good,had a lot of things in the beginning process of opening a store in Milwaukee..... now it is where it needs to be and is a great place
good,"A typical day at work would manily be customer service.  Answering customer questions about the seafood we sell as well as retail excellence, which involves pre-packs of certain items we sell in our seafood department. Also filleting fish if we need for the case. As well as stocking the retail floor with products we have in the freezer and cooler.  After the first half of the shift is done then we get started on cleaning the department which is the closing procedures.  Then when we are all done we check out with a shift manager at the end of the night."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a very productive and fast paced environment. They work well with your schedule, and will do anything to satisfy a customer. Everyday would be a busy day at WFM. We would all have to be at our ""A"" game. A lot of friendly co workers and a variety of departments to choose from."
good,"High Energy, great product, great people, positive environment. Hardest part of the job is availability. To move up you must literally be available from 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. 7 days a week"
good,I was going to school while working and given so many hours that it became hard for me to balance school and work. I asked to go down to Part Time I status and my ATL said she would do the paperwork and never did. My TL never seemed to care about anything that didn't directly benefit him and my store leader never knew what was really happening in the store. Benefits and pay were good though
good,"A typical day at work for me is an all-store face of departments. Then, a face of the aisles assigned. This varies highly due to the capricious nature of customer demand. I learned how manage my time wisely, how to face product, handle cash, help customers find their desired items. Management at this store leaves something to be desired. The co-workers are usually college aged and lack responsibility. The hardest part of this job is the lack of recognition. The most enjoyable part of this job is talking to customers."
good,Great business but not so friendly workplace getting used to meeting new people everyday allowing to gain you meet wonderful customers and gaining a relationship. Very busy when holidays come.
good,I learned that this job is learned the fastest by doing it hands on. I am always finding new ways in making my job easier. I always update myself with new products. I learned what most would learned in three years. I did it all in a year. All my coworkers and leaders loved how I worked and what I did for the department. Everybody in my department loved working with me because the job always gets done before I finished my eight hour shift. The hardest part of my job is when we have big orders and I have to break down from seven-nine pallets by myself before the second employee came in. I learned that young people with big egos cant work as a leader for the team because they always think they are right and don't like to be wrong. I learned always to depend on myself and not on others to get the job done. I also learned how to work with any type of people with any type of personality.
good,"It's a multi-faceted company that likes to promote from within, embraces diversity and rewards hard work. A typical day consists of interacting with customers in a professional manner. Enthusiasm and product knowledge in conjunction with effective communication skills help drive sales. "
good,"Set up the store for opening"
good,"A great place to work, unfortunately it seems the company is becoming one of those only part time places."
good,"Overall WFM is a growing company with good core values but growth for team members is more or less on a per store basis."
good,"Oversaw all aspects of daily receiving."
good,A typical day at Wholefoods is always busy. I learned about retail and production work. Management people are supportive of their team members and co-workers are great. Hardest part of the job is the production side since I haven't worked in production before. I love cake decorating.
good,Whole foods in my experience is an alright company whether you're looking to work for them short term or long term. If you're attending school it is a good place to get in work your shift get out and make a few bucks. For those who are seeking to work for whole foods long term there is much opportunity for advancement but its on the individual to put him/herself out there as somebody who wants to pursue higher positions. The health insurance is good and profit sharing is a nice addition to your check. 
good,always willing to help people move up
good,"This company is driven by their mission, company culture and valules."
good,u stay busy. U have to work fast paced. u have to memorize PLU codes(prouduct codes) u have to make sure the customer alawys leaves happy.
good,"A good work place, employees are easy to work with, but too much power is given to the customers."
good,"Typically every day was filled with meat cutting, customer service, placing orders and rotating stock of new arrivals. Management in my department was laid-back as we all new what had to be done and for the most part created a very good situation. Mostly I enjoyed working with everyone from every department. The since of oneness between everyone was great."
good,I enjoyed working for Whole Foods Market but the demands are very high at times especially if you are in management.
good,learnded how to manage a large work force.
good,"it was a great experience, hard work and most of all it wasnt that easy."
good,Great place to work if you love retail and grocery stores. I purchased certain items for the store to be sold at a mark up for profit. It was fun but lots of hard work and weird hours. Co-workers were great but higher store management was terrible. Most enjoyable part about the job was all the freebies given out and the team member discount on items in the store.
good,"It was a fun place to work in the beginning but I saw a lot of good people either leave or get terminated.  I felt like we were expected to be perfect  all the time and to not make any mistakes, otherwise ""corrective action"" would be taken."
good,"Although the Whole Foods has changed in the years I have worked there, it is still a place that offers flexibility and movement within the company. However, items that can sometimes fall by the wayside are things like communication between regional and store levels and the training of new employees. There are things i haven't liked about working for the company, but my overall experience has been incredibly positive and it is a place I am sure I will work for again."
good,On busy times it gets really crowded which might get a bit stressful. It also depends which department you are working at. Being a produce member at smoothie bar was quite difficult.
good,"As an Associate Team Leader I was required to maintain availability 24/7. Per company policy they could not even offer me one set day off per week. Shifts and days varied from day to day and week to week. You would close one day and then open the next frequently even though they tried not to schedule this way. Each week was a surprise schedule so absolutely impossible to plan anything in personal life. However, this was not the case for all ATL's and above, some were ""grandfathered"" in under an old policy that let them have set schedules. That meant I worked every weekend while they rarely did. Absolutely ZERO flexibility for scheduling and was the ultimate reason I left this job. But yet, you were required to give THREE WEEKS notice if you wanted a day off. I loved my coworkers and the job itself. You are so busy though that you never really get to know your coworkers at all so that was sad. Little chance for coworkers to become friends because of that."
good,the other team members are very friendly. There is a very warm environment in all the departments. Even the managers are friendly and say hi to you when they see you.
good,"A typical night at work  involved numerous items to be stocked. Learned how to strategically stock shelves. Management was very helpful, but expected very fast pace work environment."
good,"Experience is dependent on the store you work for and the people you work under, My experience was very nice at the Tarzana location but the management of the store was very poor."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working for Whole Foods, as I had a great manager. My hourly compensation was not great, and my benefits were expensive considering what I received. May be a good position for someone looking to advance in a retail type setting."
good,"Management is very cliquey and unless you are in their circle, you will be passed up for any chances at advancement. Enjoyed my time there at first but after a while, I got tired of the company culture and cliqueyness and left."
good,"It was a really easy job, you easily learn everything but there is too much drama. They over work you at times and the hours sucked. I've also heard that other locations are amazing so I do believe it all goes down on who you're working for and with."
good,"Whole Foods compensates better than most supermarkets, although the health insurance got worse over time and they did not raise their wages in response to local changes in minimum wage.  However it was a reliable 40 hour a week job that offered many opportunities for advancement through the company."
good,"Though I no longer work there, I try to avoid shopping there now that Amazon has taken over."
good,"My only problem with the job was my co-workers in the dish room. A few of them left me to do 90% of the work while they walked around. Still, a good place for advancement and learning about food prep."
good,If you into eating healthy or wants to start eating healthy whole foods is great place to work. Great benefits for full time. Diverse group of employees and customers.
good,"Whole Foods is a company that hires exceptional people. Almost all of my coworkers were focused, efficient people that took pride in their work. This crossed over to my management team as well as my Store Leader. The only main complaint I had was the horrid pay that Team Members receive, which leads to a lack of retention that the company prides itself in. For my annual review of a years work in a supervisor role, I was allotted 85 cents, which was considered on the higher end of my possible raise. This was less than 1 percent of what I was making in my position, and if anyone is looking for a higher pay bracket, they must advance in the company to receive any sort of reasonable raise. This problem will most likely only grow with Amazons continued interference with the Company, with its recent Health Care cut to part time Team Members. Enter with Caution and low pay expectations, but expect to deal with these problems with the best coworkers you will meet in Grocery."
good,"Management turnover while I was employed. "
good,"Whole Foods Market has changed radically since its inception in 1980. However, the starting pay is very competitive and there’s is room for growth in the company."
good,"overall it's a good place to work, however compensation and paid time off are below market average. people are friendly and advancing within the company is supported."
good,"Before the Amazon merger, the starting pay was $12.50 per hour in Portland, OR, which is not a livable wage in this city. Now I believe the starting pay is $15 per hour."
good,"Whole Foods has many systems in place, that blanket a number of areas.  Food Safety, Inventory levels, purchasing dollars, etc.  Locations are very similar, so transferring from one location to another is easy."
good,"I really wanted to like it here at Whole Foods but ultimately the poor management made it really difficult to do so. Within two months a coworker was tired of the mold inside the fridges we worked in and brought it up to store leadership but was ultimately ignored. It was also hard to receive sufficient support in order to satisfy customer needs because we were so short-staffed. Ultimately, these problems didn't make the employee discount or even free food worth it."
good,"The core values of wholefoods are what makes this company great.  The dedication to not only customer satisfaction but also employee, from a company of their size, is what makes them one in a million."
good,"I love my team member there, so people in management team like to take advantage on system, let's other people work for them."
good,The overall work is healthy. And the management is very poor.  Shifts starting 6am -10pm. The most enjoyable part of working at whole foods is the team member appreciation week each year.
good,"Whole is a great company but at the same time don’t have  sympathize for your personal life.or your life period... "
good,"Enjoyed my time working at whole foods."
good,Hardest part of the job is handling others jobs because there is low staffing most of the time. There is also the issues of entitled customers who don't realize there are other people in the world and demand immediate service.
good,"Co-op feel but not necessarily co-op treatment of employees, and new systems implemented when Amazon bought the company left employees stressed, overworked, understaffed and underpaid."
good,i miss the benefits and work atmosphere but the politics of the place was unfair due to the fact my team leader at the time had new hires that were kiss butt and got there way leading to my termination i feel the excuses they gave me for letting me go were bogus and when i go to visit and shop former colleagues that lead to my departure are not apart of the company.
good,This was a productive and supportive work environment that one can experience and enjoy from day to day schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I always had the support of the team on all different parts of the job.
good,"To start out, it was a great job, but the more corporate it got, the more stressful, and counterproductive it became.  Ultimately, I was fired because I was costing the company too much money, and they had people with degrees applying for entry level positions..."
good,"Pay ad benefits are great. Job advancement and security are pretty good. However, your schedule is crazy. all over the place. They guilt you for calling in sick or taking time off. You really have to ""live for the company"""
good,"Fun and good company to work for, not sure not how it is now that amazon has gotten their hands on it but always good vibes when working on the strip."
good,"People are great there,great benefits,they have Christmas get together,not to happy with the managers hiring process,they hire managers with no experience"
good,Very flexible when it comes to working with your schedule. Also a job that is willing to allow you to advance if that is what you are looking to do while working there.
good,"I personally would never apply for Whole Foods Market again, due lack of security. Whole Foods Market can and will fire you for anything. To be successful with this company you will have to put your whole life into this company which is difficult for anyone that has other responsibilities. If you have no other responsibilities this company is for you."
good,"Management can be confusing and inept at time, especially since the Amazon buyout. Customers can be temperamental at times, but such is life in retail. However, the people you work with make the job worthwhile, without a doubt."
good,"a typical day included working in the kitchen for salad bar, hot bar, chefs case, and wine bar along with sandwich global and pizza station. i also bartended."
good,"a typical day at work was very hectic. from the people that showed up constantly to the different burger that HAD to be present, i could barely get e break in. the most enjoyable part of the job was the discount. but even that was limited."
good,"Specifically at my store, I can't speak for others, there was a severe lack of staff in my department for my shift, the closing shift."
good,Whole Foods Market's organizational culture is one of the most distinct characteristics of the business. This culture permeates all areas of the firm. Whole Foods Market uses its organizational culture to provide quality service and to strengthen human resource management.
good,Worked at Whole Foods for three years now and it's a decent place to work. Easygoing people and room to move around from department to department until you find a good fit.
good,"Whole Foods is a good company to work for. They strive to make a unique culture & pride themselves in diversity for their employees & customers that you wont find in any other health foods store. Work is extremely fast paced & requires critical skills such as attention to detail, decision making, adaptation to new tasks & responsibilities, working as a team & the ability to perform consistent & sometimes strenuous physical labor."
good,You meet a lot of great people and can move around within the company to learn different roles but it is very hard to move up which is what I'm looking for!
good,"Whole Foods was a great place to work. WIth the right manager and staff the time can be fun and productive. The environment is fast-paced and there is always something to do. I enjoyed getting to know the regulars and working with my amazing team. I learned a significant amount about how to lead a team and how to deal with an ever changing workforce. I also experienced the Amazon change and helped team members and customers get used to the new changes. I would recommend this place to a friend, there is plenty of room for upward mobility and the time sent here can be rewarding."
good,"very straight forward, repetitive activity. Always busy. management is not always fair.  customers are rude, but you can change that.  customer service is key when working here."
good,"I worked for whole foods for almost 4 years and opened many stores for them. I worked closely with mainly the regional team after a year of working for the company. I learned a lot from regional but never learned much from my superior staff while working in the store in PA. Once I came to PA, the staff was a lot different. They didn't  like that I wanted to gain knowledge about the company and saw it as a threat vs a gain to them I always wanted to know more and asked questions and since it is a smaller community, they did not like to teach me much. I loved this company when I worked in NY and the change of pace was significant as well. I would recommend people work for this company but not in Philadelphia, my honest opinion."
good,"i typically enjoy going to work on a daily ive learned alot about different foods from different cultures "
good,Whole Foods is a great place for people to work and learn about healthy food and lifestyles. They promote non smoking and they have a great 401k program along with great health benefits. Like a pay card for your  prescriptions and or doctors visits.
good,the job can be very stressful at time because we never seem to have enough help in the store.the seafood is always looking for help as is the bakery.The company is always holding job fairs and those who do get hired never seem to stay with the company very long
good,Customer interaction was well rounded. I was business savvy and knew ordering and purchasing techniques so I was successful in managing a department and inventory control.
good,The health benefits are the best around. The paid time off is great too.  You can get paid time off even as a part time team member.  This over all is a great job for anyone.
good,Poor management caused me to leave the place. The new managers are terrible and doesn't know how to adjust as a new-comer. Doesn't appreciate an effort of her/his employees.
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work but management could be a lot more supporting and friendly. I have learned a lot about customer service while working here and how to be a barista.
good,"I worked with some very nice people.  They did not mind helping you when you asked a question."
good,"Was over all a good place to work. But too many politics to deal with i.m.o.. and general favoritism of certain persons. Being in upper level management, you are not supposed to be allowed to work with family members under you. When I was there this kind of thing happened all the time. So family would promote family. And people of no relations rarely got promoted unless there was no other choice."
good,"Whole foods do things manually in the large scale of things, such as ordering and pressure to order correctly without backstock. While Amazon took over, they try to streamline everything, the transition is rough. Decreasing employees and increasing sales is good for the overhead and profit, but I was working 50 plus hours a week and encouraged to work on my days off."
good,"Whole Foods was a great company to get hired onto.  You can easily fall in love with their mission and want to buy into everything the walls say they stand for.  The main issue is, only a few employees actually feel this way.  "
good,I learned a lot as an individual and grew in my skills immensely. The job was enjoyable because of all the great benefits. Wish management was better.
good,There are two types of people who work for whole foods. Those that are trying to make it into a career and those that are using it as a temporary position until they find something else.
good,"Overall what it's like working at Whole Foods is that the staff there are amazing and working conditions are great (comes with benefits), no complaints. However the downfall of working there are the customers from the glebe area and the management team. They are so focused on making everything perfect because it's the only Whole Foods in Ottawa; and in regards to managements' position and their work responsibilities are questionable in a sense of performance-wise. Whole Foods isn't the same as it was two years ago and it's becoming more pressuring to work for them. I got out at a good time."
good,"Management focuses on smaller details opposed to the bigger picture. Sometimes, they don't take your knowledge into consideration just because they are management."
good,The associates at Whole Foods are wonderful as are the supervisors. The biggest issue is the mangers who fail drastically to communicate with their team and meet their needs. The mangers lack time management. After being hired on it took me over two weeks to start because one of the mangers forgot to process my paperwork before going on vacation. The only reason why I was able to start my job was because I contacted HR to get the ball rolling.
good,"I didn't like my management team. There was no team player attitude.  The Assistant Bakery Manager was new at her job, and inexperienced   I did not feel valued, and received very little respect for my experience and education. She was very hard to work with and carried a lot of anger.  Did not support Team efforts."
good,"Management was pretty bad at doing anything beyond their normal job. So any actual issues that need to be fixed won't get fixed. Almost impossible to get fired as long as you show up to work. Meaning if you work hard and your coworker is the laziest person ever, not only will you make the same amount of money, but the most management will do is talk to them and nothing else."
good,"not bad a bad place if you can handle the messed up internal upper management, but the people on the floor working with you are all good people. i enjoyed working in the produce department"
good,hard work pays off but not like it used to. company has changed over the years and is run by managers not leaders anymore. its harder to move up unless you know someone. not a lot of training even though they say they train you fully
good,"The only thing I like is the flexible hours since I'm a college student. But I didn't like the way they scheduled me outside of my availability, happened numerous times."
good,"It was great when i started. then  it started to get bad when the best people left.All and all whole food was a good place to work. Great people, great store leadership."
good,"I started as a cashier which is an easy job overall, memorizing PLU codes, scanning, bagging, money handling, talking to customers, etc. But the same reasons it’s easy, are the same reasons it can be hard. A lot of the PLU codes won’t stick at first which can be frustrating, sometimes you have issues with items that won’t scan for various reasons, talking to customers can be exhausting (especially when they’re super particular) and often you’re left without someone to help you bag when it gets busy. "
good,"For the most part this is a very fun environment great for people of all ages. The benefits are great and you have the opportunity to learn a lot about health and nutrition. "
good,"I have worked for Whole Foods Market for 8 years, and seen it change drastically in that time period. It has become very corporate, and labor cuts and layoffs have created stressful work conditions with less job security. Nonetheless, I have loved my time with Whole Foods. I met my husband, made many lifelong friends, made good money to advance my life, had time to make my art outside of work, and had so much fun on the job. I've done a ton of work that I'm proud of at Whole Foods, and been able to express my creativity, especially during my time in the Floral department. The pay is great, and the culture is too (even if it's not as good as it once was). The benefits are decent, and the hours are standard. You never take work home with you. The things I tire of now are new corporate policies, less attention to Team Member happiness, the tedium of retail work and customer service, and the early hour + very physical exhausting work. Fewer career employees, more part time employees who don't truly care. Working holidays and weekends."
good,It was good job not hard. I liked the people they wore nice and respectful clean environment fresh air pretty area location. 2 breaks 30 min each dont have to go far for lunch.
good,"Very enjoyable place to work part time, paid lunches, good discounts and paid sick days off. Most of the employees were quite friendly and had a good sense of family, only issue was poor management."
good,The workplace was very diverse and good to work in. The customer where easy to work with for the most part. Depending on the time and day you are moving most and sometimes all day helping customers or doing things around the store. If there was a problem most managers would help but some give empty words of help. I would say the best thing about the job though is the good pay and benefits but the people working there can be hard to work with and some of the rules make no sense.
good,"it is a hard working job but I think you don't earn as much as you work. also they will raise your rate slowly, beside that it is a friendly place to work."
good,"I signed up for this job because I always shopped there and ate food from the hot bar. The location I was at was poorly managed and not staffed well. The head of my department was a bit of a pushover and allowed others to make decisions for him. The pace was very slow. It only picked up during lunch hours, and sometimes dinner depending on events in the local area. It's not a bad company to work for, if the people you call your boss are capable of handling their jobs. When you work in Prepared Foods there are certain things that are necessary to satisfy customers, and when we are out of different selections it becomes a problem with management that isn't really capable of turning the situation around. The pay was decent and given the right opportunity I would work for the company again under different management."
good,"All days are different and present a new challenge. There is a very relaxed workplace culture and quite a bit of creative freedom available. This is by far the hardest part of the job, as structure and guidance is required for advancement."
good,"how to work a scale, about temperatures "
good,"Free coffee in the mornings, great people to work with, we have one of the best team in the store everybody helps , I learned a lot  from all of my bosses. it is really hard work by yourself."
good,Typical day at work wasnt so bad. I really didnt learn much being that I worked in a supermarket before an the codes are basically universal. Management was pretty good. The culture there was very diverse.
good,"It was s good experience and learned a lot about the natural grocery store culture and sunstainable foods."
good,"Fast paced and interesting.  Gained incredible knowledge of healthy foods"
good,Whole Foods was okay to work for. It was a typical cashier job.  The hardest part of the job was that the company was in upheaval before I left which ultimately led to them being bought by Amazon. Departments were being cut left and right.  The department I was trying to move into was cut so I found a new job elsewhere.
good,great place to work . good customers . great working class of staff. from all productions.  neat clean job . great class of customers . steady place for all needs and select goods.
good,"At my store, high level managers were overheard calling employees slurs, and other employees regularly used slurs against their coworkers. Despite being reported to HR, nothing ever came of it, and if you tried to go higher up, you were referred back to the people who refused to address the problem. In the right department, you could have a great job with awesome opportunities, but under poor management you might be fired with no notice for a violating policy that was made up on the spot."
good,"getting there early to start making pizza and other foods for the line"
good,"The best part about working for Whole Foods is the culture that supports team member happiness. We are able to pretty much wear whatever we want (within reason) and have visible tattoos/piercings. Chances of moving up with the company are obtainable as long as the individual makes an effort to apply for higher positions when they are available. There is some nepotism in this company, but I feel most companies this occurs. Overall, it is a good company to work for, but now that Amazon bought it out, who knows what the future will hold."
good,"All you have to do is show up on time and listen to your bosses. The problem is that some bosses think they know everything and refuse to do certain things differently than what they are accustomed to. A lot of the people in management positions seem to lack common sense. If you are respectful, outgoing, and obedient then you will have no problem moving up in the company and making good money."
good,"With time, the business became more corporate and the value of the team member diminished. Benefits shrank, work loads increased and ultimately you were deemed less important than the almighty stockholder. While the stockholder is a key component, WFM used to be one of the few companies where the team member's role was weighted higher than the norm, but this changed for the worse."
good,The company is in trouble and needs to find a solution soon! The tech they use is out dated. It use to be a great place to work. You could be yourself and have fun selling food. Those days have changed.
good,it is a good place to work . i have learned a lot and would tell her a friend to work there while in school. The job culture is very welcoming and you do after a while start to feel at home. also you're introduced to different culture other than your own when you try different foods
good,"The responsibilities that are left to us in management are getting more and more ridiculous. They reduce the amount of people you  have to work with, but expect you to get more work done. And if you can't, you will receive corrective action."
good,its a great place to work for someone who is looking for a full time job. They will  give you hours and you will work a lot. Depending on which department you work in things may be really busy on the regular. The job at times can be overwhelming.
good,"I enjoyed my job at this establishment. It was clean and friendly with a positive staff. I liked the products that were available, company practices, and the benefits."
good,You are always being watched and are told when you can eat and use the bathroom. Super easy job but it can be miserable because of the rude customers you encounter. Management is okay.
good,"Great company for people very interested in health and healthy lifestyles. When the company first arrived in the area, they employed  people truly interested in the mission of eating healthy and well. Now its just anothe rgrocer."
good,Stable job. You can move up if you have the ambition. Able to transfer to different departments within same location if desired. Appreciative towards the employees.
good,Overall a team oriented company that does try to help team members grow with the company. They teach you lots of skills that you will be able to use for future employers.
good,"Very productive and a fun environment to work in. It all really comes down to who you have in Leadership and what department you work in, but most of the Team Member are great to work with. They're pretty dope people ."
good,Fun place to work great culture. You can advance here but the pressure becomes ridiculous the further you move up (like anywhere ) of course. Great pay and benefits.
good,"It's a great place to work, they care about the employees the management is great. It's a friendly work space. After a while it gets boring. At least for me."
good,"I gained valuable customer service skills while working for Whole foods. I learned how to multi-task, work in a team manner and most importantly how to handle unsatisfied customers in the spare of the moment."
good,"I've been working for Whole Foods Market for 5 years now.  I started as a cashier and am now a graphic designer. I am at the highest point at store level that I can reach in this position and I love it, but since there have been some cuts at regional and global, the opportunity to grow is now limited. "
good,"Prepare and stock for the backups for service. "
good,I have worked in Whole Foods for less than a year and what I have noticed the most is that management really expressed their appreciation towards good and hard workers. In 6 months I was able to get a raise.
good,"Nice job petty people, customers treat you poorly  & think the world of wholefoods is thiers at times. Cool fun place for the most part great food calm settings"
good,I was able to learn alot about the grocery industry working for Whole Foods.  I learned how to be a Barista and how to bake bread. I learned about marketing and a great deal about quality foods.
good,"Typical Work Day;"
good,"Management is great and works hard to support employees. The culture of Whole Foods is great, really fun and everyone is free to be themselves. Employees are truly happy when they are at work."
good,Very repetitious much of the customers really didn't help to their car. I was basically just gathering shopping carts and from time to time return products back in place.
good,"...and not always for the good. Currently, shifts for salaried Team Members look like 50-65 hour work weeks and continual pressure to perform. The company has shifted it's Learning and Development department so much that training in the stores has become difficult for leaders to navigate alone. Co-workers are awesome. For the most part, people that work for Whole Foods believe in the products and the mission. Whole Foods is ever evolving, like any successful business. They have had to change their model over the years, but have stayed committed to some foundations of the company's original mission. The biggest problem? Compensation. Insurance is extremely high deductible policy meant for healthy people, and between wages and auxiliary benefits make it a lower compensating corporations. But if you'd like to get in with a company and work your way up, the company does have a commitment to developing it's team members, especially to fill leadership/management positions."
good,"Wholefoods is a refreshing place to work, you learn about healthy eating, constant customer interaction, and good work ethic. The Grocery Team was consistently under staffed, and had the most labor out of any other department. The retention rate was low, and employee morale was low, which ultimately consisted of overtime. Also, starting pay for a part-timer was fair and above the minimum wage."
good,"-Departments worked as a team"
good,"productive and fun place to work at. i meet a lot of interested and fun people. great place, have great benefits (healthcare), great place to meet new people and interact with customers. fast pace working environment you always  going to be on the move"
good,"My experience at Whole Foods has allowed me the opportunity to grow my management skills as well hone my merchandising skills.  I have assisted with hiring, training and managing of staff as well as coordinating allocations and promos.  I have ensured financial success of my department through meeting sales goals and making margin each period.  I have excellent organizational skills and strong communication skills.  I am a quality and detail oriented person who is self-motivated and enthusiastic in the work place."
good,"clock in, do the same job you did yesterday, clock out. Remember high school? Kinda like that."
good,"Fair compensation, Team based work model. "
good,Co-workers are what make you really want to stay with the company plus benefits.  It SUCKS now that they only hire part-time employees. They pride themselves on CORE VALUES but to be honest that went out the door 2 years ago.
good,Fun place to work with people from all around the world.  Learn about different types of foods and alternative lifestyles.
good,working along side colleagues was the best.Fun place to work.I wish there had been drug testing when applying. You were free to do your job with not so many hassels
good,A good job for young adults to gain experience. You learn a lot about food working here and a lot of health tips. For the most part everyone is friendly and helpful.
good,"A typical day at works involves ordering product according to deadlines, down stacking pallets, assisting baker, directing team members and guest service. I learned a lot about purchasing, baking and leading a team. The hardest part of the job is working night shifts and raising young children."
good,Lots of standing and remembering codes there are a lot of managers and assistant managers around for help and to observe you
good,Whole Foods Market strives to be more than a grocery store but an integral part of every community in which they operate. Growing pains as the company has added stores nationwide has changed the company but they remain innovative and have an incredibly talented and loyal team member base. The hiring of full time team member seems to be eroding as more part time team members fill open positions but Whole Foods remains dedicated to team member education and excellence
good,"Usually I'll get to work and clock-in. I then go and get placed on a register where I ring up customer's items and bag them for them according to their preference. I usually have a small conversation with each customer. I would ask how their shopping experience went and if they where able to find all items they needed. Usually I would get a break half way though my shift. Once I am back from my break , I continue doing my job until my shift is completed"
good,"Spent 5 years with them, most of which were great. No consistency in how each store is run.  New stores are staffed with management favorites.  Growth can be difficult if you're not part of the favorite group."
good,The changes that are happening at Whole Foods Market are troubling. The increasing pressure to show growth and profits are causing and increasing amount of pressure that can be felt all the way to the team member level.
good,"It's actually a great company to work for with great benefits.  They give raises to team members every six months.  They pay most of the team members medical insurance along with many other great things.  Where they fall short (mainly in the SoPac Region) is there is no room for advancement.  I'm already a Team Leader but have drive to be much more.  Unfortunately, unless I move to a different state, I will not be promoted anytime soon.  Also, moving doesn't guarantee anything as well because I'd have to still interview for the position and them not knowing me, it's very difficult to land those jobs."
good,"Great Place, Cares about the employees, involved with the community. the job was enjoyable, but stressful. management at my particular location seemed to care more about productivity than the employees. Skeleton staffing, terribly managed hours."
good,"A typical day at work for me included the many retail duties, and interacting with customers and other team members in order to provide the best possible customer experience with the stores with which I was involved. I learned about what makes great customer service experience, and how to implement this knowledge and problem solve, in order to provide the customer a good shopping experience and drive the sales of the company. Management generally cared about team members, but were clearly driven by the profit of the stores, the region, and the company as a whole. My co workers ranged in age and brought many unique perspectives and experiences which contributed to the company culture, and interactions with one another and customers. The hardest part of the job was having to ""take it on the chin"" and deal with deluge of retail responsibilities. Including dealing with customers that were for the most part positive, but with some very negative experiences in customer interaction. I enjoyed getting to know the many personalities and interacting with the customers."
good,"Whole Food is an overall great work place. Most managers and supervisors are understanding and reasonable, and co workers are enjoyable. The work/ life balance is okay if you don't mind working on weekends and holidays."
good,"Customer service is the main focus at Whole Foods Market. Also, there is a major commitment to product product integrity."
good,Co workers are good and the customers are nice. A good environment over all.
good,great people I just out grew the job. My management was wonderful.
good,"I spent 1.7 years working for Whole Foods Market, specifically on Waterman Street. I was a team member in the Prepared Foods department, and I worked front of house or pizza. I quickly learned that (at least within the department I was in) everyone was miserable under the happy faces that we were being paid to put on. Many hated the team leader because he did not appropriately support and guide the team, and many times he seemed ""checked out"". There is a lot of favoritism being played in the store, tricking all the way down from the store management. If you are able to do the most physically demanding job in the store for the same amount of pay as the cashiers, then this job is for you. Know that I personally walked into work every day with fear of losing my job (and so did others). If not, I would recommend the customer service team, bakery team, grocery team, or produce team."
good,This is the place the started it all. Where i found my passion for cooking. I started off as a dishwasher then worked my way through an atl. Ive learned the different concepts of asian cuisine. Enjoyed working with the people here.
good,"Very structured, friendly, fair work place.Co workers are great and has quick opportunity for advancement. Management can be a hassle, ""too many chiefs and not enough indians"" , people with seniority act like supervisors and can cause for unfair treatment."
good,I enjoyed my time at Plano. I was always challenged to learn and move forward while I was there.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the cross training.I've learned a lot but it is very hard to find advancement room.
good,At Whole Foods there was always work to be done and many new things to learn. Keeping up with standers and quality were very important. I worked as a supervisor and enjoyed it very much. I like to have the extra responsibly. My favorite part was helping customers and the one on one time i got to spend with them
good,"A typical day at work consists of monitoring a break chart, handling cash, and helping customers. I also process refunds and coach the cashiers on how to provide better customer service and sales. I have learned about a major company and their mission and values. I have also learned how to watch sales projections and labor projections. Management is not the greatest at this location. There has been a lot of situations where favoritism have played a factor. However most of the time they are there when asked to be. I love my co-workers and they are what I would miss most if I left this job. The hardest part about this job is when the store is slow there is not much to do. We always find things but it is so much better when we are busy. The most enjoyable part is being able to try new foods and meet new people."
good,"Customer service skills"
good,"As a Team Member in supplements and body care section of Whole Foods Market, I provide excellent customer service and assist customers to nuture their physical health and wellness.  Our workday consist of buying, receiving, and stocking shelves using effective merchandising techniques.  My department runs smoothly and consistently receives positive customer and management feedback along with positive growth signified by double digit comps.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to assist the public in their pursuit of optimal health and wellness, for which I am capable and passionate."
good,"A typical day for me at Whole Foods Market would consist of me managing the front cashiers. Making sure initial loan till is placed in register & main till for the day is all set. Then begin planning for the rest of the day for our customers needs. Our return policy is 100 percent guaranteed so anything thing a customer buys since its we are high priced and high quality for what you buy we am to please. I've learned a lot about the grocery store there are a lot of little things that need to be done to run a organically certified store. Management has a open door policy were you can easily talk to any one from leadership about anything you might have concerns on. Co-workers work hard in day in and night to get the job done. We are a big family. Hardest part of my job would have to be documenting those customers who are being disloyal & catering for our individual shoppers who need assistance shopping. Only cause the lack of team members we have at our disposal or the rush through day but we always end up aiming to please. I loved my customer & cheering up the team through out the day with either a joke, cheer, or something to boost up the motivation to get through most of the day we have ahead of ourselves. ROCK ON ANDOVER!!!!"
good,Received daily grocery shipments. Assisted customers and all other departments. The best part of the job was learning about healthy eating.
good,Employeur valorisant les competences de ses empmloyés et cette experience est tres bonne pour une premeiere experience
good,"I worked on the overnight stock crew which required a lot of hustle, cleaning, rotating and stocking.  Communication is key to ensure the team is on the same page."
good,"Have amazing customers"
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work, but it is also unfair. I have worked there for two years and I do to much work for the amount of money I get paid. I almost do all the work when I work with other co workers because they are lazy. On a daily basis I am the lunch truck specialist and I take the catering to the reginal office along with selling lunch."
good,"It was a fun job met new people made friends helped customers, but some customers were rude at times."
good,"A busy place to work in. One learns about organic products and other alternative health products. Offers good benefits but the hardest part of the job is lifting heavy boxes and other items."
good,Was a challenge to keep up with a new schedule every week since I had a toddler at home.Learned that a duty of mine was to learn to be flexible with the schudule
good,"Interesting culture, diversity, opportunities for professional growth"
good,I love being greeted by everyone when you enter the door on a normal work day. I get great information about our upcoming promo and let customers know about our sales and coupons we have in store my team members are very helpful and kind. Its very stressful when you cant help a customer find a certain product you are not sure of and you want to help them. But most of all i enjoy working with a great community
good,"help customers, cut, wrap, slice meats and cheese. a wide world knowledge of wine and cheese"
good,"I found that there were rare moments to sit back and relax. As a cashier, talking among yourselves was not allowed most of the time. It depends on the location of your store how much management is going to control you. At my location there was a lot of micromanaging aspects not only by the Team Leaders but by your Team Members as well."
good,"I worked with a great team and very approachable leadership group. There was always opportunity for growth and career development programs created for any employee who wants to grow. My favorite part was the team i worked with, the connections we had ""one store one team""."
good,"This is a good place if you want to make $15hr but if you are hoping to advance, better luck somewhere else. People hardly leave and when they so someone whose been there for 5 plus year will be thought about before you."
good,"A good experience as it is to learn an extensive knowledge on the organic and natural field."
good,"This was once a fantastic place to work, but the years weren't kind to the culture or the work environment. The procurement of the company by Amazon was what really pushed it all over the edge. It became a soulless husk of what it used to be."
good,"Whole Foods taught me many things from how to treat customers the right way, all the way to the right ways to handle foods being served. However, one thing I disliked is how dangerous and insecure the organization can be when management has its favorites. The main reason for my leave was due to being treated unfairly by a supervisor who was very close with the store leader. Her complaints would constantly get through to the store leader and get others in trouble. The complaints made about her were always just pushed aside. It wasn't a work environment I wanted to be a part of anymore. My team leader was great and encouraging but couldn't do much in fear of retaliation towards himself. My advice is to work well with others but don't rely too much on individuals based off of first impressions. Although Whole Foods likes the whole team aspect of the job, they aren't really supporting it."
good,"When you come in, everyone feels like family but with family there can be drama and that's where I feel the supervisors lack in their leadership. They do not do a good job with handling drama properly or lead by example very well and seems like they would get offended if you gave them constructive criticism. Other than that we are all pretty helpful and kind to our customers ."
good,The job is fairly okay but doesn’t promote high levels of growth when promised. What could be better is a better leadership in produce. Once changed i believe that it would be better opportunities.
good,"Very customer oriented, must be able to function in a high activity environment. Company is very accommodating for schedules (i.e. School, second job, children). Lots of room for advancement. Can be overwhelming during holidays and busy times, like any other retail position."
good,I’ve been with WFM for about 10yrs. I’ve enjoyed my time working here. I started in the bake house then moved to the stores. The benefits are awesome too.
good,"The team members are the best part of working for Whole Foods Market. It is like working with family, and makes the work environment so much more bearable than it would be."
good,If you are considering whole Foods Market make sure you are flexible and can Atleast work the weekends because they are usually strict on that . When you first start you will get a full-time check because they give you good hours for first two weeks so you can learn then you go to your scheduled hours . Every location is different so I can’t speak for other stores but You would want better
good,"I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods. I met a lot of great people, and learned that i am capable of things that i never before had imagined. It really helped me to develop skills that i could use in other jobs"
good,There’s a very limited view behind the scenes at Whole Foods. The regulations are excessive and they need for speed is worse. The team member atmosphere is generally depressing.
good,"I left Whole foods because of lay-offs for supervisors.  I was offered the job back during the process, but I had already found another opportunity with my former employer."
good,"the job was easy going for the most part . Sometimes customers would be rude but you have to learn how to deal with them , the job it’s self wasn’t hard at all"
good,"Great employees staff to work with. However I wish to get paid more, so I could afford to eat at Whole Food Market. They do have a great benefits with for the employees."
good,"Some TLs are great, some are terrible. "
good,Great company to work for but could really use some valuable training for team members. Not great with communication and follow through. The company is very laid back.
good,"A typical 8 hour shift at Whole Foods is a breeze. You have more than enough time to get your tasks done. Management was nice. The pay is great and, you get two 15 minute breaks plus a 30 minute break."
good,"Whole Foods was a job with a pronounced culture and the best part were the people who worked there. Customers and business volume depend on the area that the store is located, as each town has its own personality."
good,"-A typical day at work is cleaning dishes and closing down the department and getting it clean, stocked and ready for the morning shift."
good,"Great company to work with, I really resonate with the founders perspectives in food production and quality.I love the attention to waste and green (eco) awareness...also really admired the incentive to have employees take care of themselves by providing discounts for being in good health."
good,it was a cool gig for transition. opportunity to try new foods. diverse customers. the location I worked at was filled with privileged and entitled people.
good,repared Food for costumers using Organic and all Natural ingredients. After Two years of being a Team Member which lead to a promotion as a server recommending Craft Beer/Wine pairings with meals for the customers.
good,"With any corporate job you have to know that some things are just out of your managements hands. Even if they believe in you, there’s only so much opportunity"
good,"Work started at 5am with our team strategically organizing inventory to be stocked. We spent the next several hours stocking, replenishing, and cleaning the departments to be ready for opening at 9am. Throughout the day we would provide product information to customers, helped with any questions they might have, all while keeping areas maintained and stocked. WFM was a very friendly workplace, in thanks both to the customers and the employees. Management was helpful and kind, ready to help you learn, but not afraid to be stern in expectations. The hardest part of the job was doing two, or sometimes three, times the amount of work due to co-workers not taking the job as seriously. I enjoyed the people the most. They all came from different backgrounds and you can find some serious networking opportunities here."
good,good company to work for very positive attitude. Great workers team players Whole foods was a store that i love to work at you learn new thing daily the work place was great
good,"I had my first job at the local Whole Foods Market as a Grocery Team Member. I would break down pallets, load them onto smaller carts and U-boats, and stock the shelves neatly with the new product. Also refilled bulk product dispensers (nuts, dried fruit, candy). Would offer assistance to customers and help to the best of my ability. At the end of the night, I would go down all the aisles and make all the products look neat and presentable."
good,I wish amazon never came into Whole Foods. It use to be such a great place to work not so much anymore. They do not hav ether same values as just Whole Foods did.
good,"Really enjoyed the other workers at whole foods. Some policies were strict such as point system and dress code (no brand names can show, etc). twenty percent off discount"
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great company with a lot of opportunity for advancement. Although benefits are great, positions in leadership can be extremely stressful."
good,"Great company to work for, I would definitely recommended whole foods to anyone who would like to be part of a company who cares about their employees."
good,"When I first started I loved the job. I loved and believed in everything that company stood for. It's value and belief system have rapidly declined and now moving up in the company is more about who you know, not your work performance."
good,it is a decent company that offers good benefits to its employees. it has a good culture and it is pretty much consistent and fair with most of their employees
good,"no reveiw, company is different now that Amazon owns them. I enjoyed my experience and learned a lot , but the it systems were very difficult for me at the time"
good,OK entry level jobs. Provides a linear career path to management. Must have some sort of customer service experience. Lots of standing up. Decent monthly bonuses.
good,"I worked at whole foods for almost a year and a half most of the customers were great I received a lot of awards and the raises are pretty fair,, however this store does play favorites( certain people get in trouble for things and others get off  scotch free) there is  also ALOT of drama there and he said she said stories but the co workers made work fun there. you are only allowed one point per month- you will get a point if you are sick or more than 30 min late to work and a half point if you are more than 7 minutes late & only allowed two doctors notes a year. overall I had a good experience working there but I do not whatsoever agree with some of their management or policies."
good,"I enjoyed many of my years working for Whole Foods.  However, it grew too quickly and at Central Support, there wasn't basic structure in place, such as HR, etc."
good,"promoting from within is the method, the result is having some not so qualified people become leaders. "
good,"If you're a hard worker you can move up in the company but you must assert yourself. Do not be late, and call outs are ill advised. Attendance is very strict and at times draconian. The culture is relaxed and ""fun"", as in management is friendly and at the very least seems to care about their employees well being. If you get hired here, do not take what they offer you for pay, ask for more. But do not disappoint them if they take you up on your offer."
good,"It’s a Great job To have depending on the department you are in. If your not used to handling raw foods or produce , etc this job wouldn’t really be for you. Also it’s a lack of professionalism my first day there I was just thrown in to work. I didn’t really get proper training. Basically I had to learn on my own."
good,"Great job working in the specialty department. Management was good, plus the discount was a perk. However the pay was lower than I would have expected."
good,"When I worked for Whole Foods, it was good except for the pay. I heard it got worse after I left and not sure how it is now that Amazon owns it. They need to pay their employees more."
good,It was ok the environment was stressful at times and there were helpful employees. Customer service is s must . The benefits were pretty good but it is also hard to move up in the grocery industry.
good,Whole foods was a great place to work until Amazon took over. All the core values that made WFM who they are suddenly didn't mean anything anymore!!!!
good,Management sucks. Its like HS but the pay is good. It is what it is. It depends on who you work with. Switch departments if necessary. AVOID matty in preparded foods in tribeca.
good,"there was constant standing that wasn't practical this caused many employees pain, a large part of why I left for a job I could sit at. Great bosses, paid well but still not living wage..."
good,"Working over night wasn't easy, but I did work with a great team that taught me how to do my job. My managers we're very professional and reasonable.  a typical day at work consist of baking baked goods, stocking the shelves and doing inventory once a month"
good,I am always thrilled to show up to this place. There are nice coworkers and comfortable lunch rooms. Overall its just a welcoming job. Just i really like company.
good,A typical day at work was in and out of the cooler moving 40 to 50 lb boxes. You will learn a great deal about organics and diffrent farming practses.
good,"lots of people at this whole foods are ""lifers"" with no other career history or goals. the staff is usually dedicated to making a good work environment but the strains of city living wears on everyone. the customers dont seem to have interest in connecting or having relationships and would prefer to be serviced."
good,"I go in do what I need to do for the day and leave.  I've been there for 6 years. I am ready to leave this company.  Im happy they have benefits and I helps out a lot with my disease.  "
good,"The only issue was the every morning meetings to talk about unrealistic goals. However, everything else is great, the environment the people, the pay was good as well, the opportunities, it was really the first time I thought it was possible to actually have a career in a supermarket."
good,"The Meat department was a very busy department. Everyone had to be giving 100% or it just didn't work. Upper Management would tell me a ""Policy"" and then my immediate  supervisor would contradict that and vice versa."
good,"Can expect to learn plenty of skills and products along with daily interactions with regular customers. "
good,"Although it was a nice place to work, the management is inadequate. You are able to share ideas to help improve work productivity, but when it came to discipline you were at the mercy of what everyone assume."
good,When working at Whole Foods market I enjoyed the work I did my job was to help the customers find what they were looking for in the store. To make sure they was satisfied about the product they brought and if they didn't like to recommend them to another location or somewhere they sell the brand they were looking for. Also made sure that I keep everything organize and clean for customers to be able to shop the right way without out things being hard to find and for my team members to be able to work through things clearly.
good,Very laid back and chill. Cool atmosphere. Sometimes favorite employees but other than that cool place to work and discounts. Everyone gets along and easy to move around and get experience.
good,"WFM gives you everything you need to succeed.  Team member culture is amazing.  Outstanding benefits, open opportunity, community and environmentally driven."
good,"What I took most from this job was how to be a team player. A typical day would be breaking down pallets and then stocking the shelves with the product. Answering phone calls, taking special orders, maintaining end caps, cleaning as needed."
good,"Whole Foods treats their full-time store-level employees well, rolling out benefits packages, guaranteed availability, and benefits votes for employees whenever a change is made to the existing package. However, as a part-time employee, it's impossible to get the benefits of a full-time employee, even when they're scheduling you for full-time hours. A part-time employee can become a ""Part-Time 20"" employee, who is scheduled for at least 20 hours per week and offered the benefits package at a price that's almost double what it is for full-time employees. I worked at Whole Foods for almost two years, and wanted to go full-time after nine months (I finished my BA early and had the time to kill), but was given the run-around for the rest of my time as an employee. Ultimately, it was the inconsistent hours that made me leave (one week I would be scheduled for 23 hours, and the next 37), not management or corporate. "
good,"When I worked there they payed higher than minimal wages, Whole foods has high standers, if you can make the cut and work hard you can work there for a long time."
good,"I gained some great experience working at Whole Foods. Culture is good overall but had been slipping my last year there. Like many large corporations, those who have been with the company for a long time are pushed into management. Unfortunately this means a lot of unqualified individuals are given management positions since the company does most of their hiring from within. Some fresh faces and ideas would be a good change of pace for Whole Foods. There are some great leaders there, but also too many who are just trying to move up the ladder by any means necessary."
good,A typical day involves hard work and diligence. I learned patience and understanding from working with customers with varying character. Management treated me with respect and for the most part listened to anything brought up with them. Coworkers were nice and fun to be around but often only stayed for short periods of time. Holidays are tough work but the discounts and deals for team members often made it worth it.
good,Great company to work for. Very flexible hours to fit your life. Good advancement with hands on leadership. Your creativeness is encouraged and opinion valued.
good,"It is not easy to work at Whole Food Market, but I managed to work hard as I could and finish all my task on time. I am proud to start my career there."
good,"I can't call the guests customers, only friends. I felt part of their family when they came through my line and I checked out their items. Each friend appreciated my input and that was special."
good,The Managment demands alot out of you even within your first week. Regardless of prior job experience. The pay was nice but the hours were demanding and the workload didn't fit.
good,"Good place to work, but I prefer an environment with higher professional conduct and appearance standards. Extremely high rates of unnecessary shrink are considered acceptable, and support of poor/disadvantaged growers in poor regions is greatly exaggerated."
good,"Whole Foods is a great place to work. However, sometimes the work can be overwhelming. The positive side is if you wants to move up, the leadership is there to guide you."
good,"All the years I have worked her, I have seen this company's professionalism change with the individuals they put in charge to run their stores. This use to be a very fun place to work and I enjoyed my job. During the recent years, it has become to corporate and full of individuals that don't like their jobs including leadership at a higher level. Whole food has lowered their quality standards of vendors and who they choose to do business with. This was a huge turn off from this company for me. things started to get more, and more complicated with the leadership in place. This use to be a really good company to work for but, not anymore."
good,"i learned that you have to be constantly work at a fast pace, management was decent but there were some team leads that werent qualified to lead. Overall the team members were really friendly and always willing to help each other.the hardest part of the job was trying to do the job of of several people at times and the most enjoyable part is getting to know your coworkers"
good,"Cool coworkers, good management, most enjoyable part of the job is lunch. The hardest part of the job is, well, selecting."
good,"This was a great place to grow and work with many amazing people.  "
good,Only Liked Working With Current People. Dislike The Team Leader Of My Department. Communication Wasn't Always There. Speak Horrible To Team Members In Front Of The Customers. Always Had Something To Complain About I Never Had A Manager Who Was Always Negative. First For Everything.
good,I'm in charge of 10-15 cashiers per day. I count tills. Work with some really incredible people. And have made life-long friendships. The work load is getting larger and larger.
good,well a typical day at work would consist of me being in the front end cashiering and what I learned about management is that they are nice people and you can learn from some of them. My co-workers were the best we all got along and was always willing to help when they could the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers and the reason  said that sometimes they can be very differcult and then u hve the ones that they are the reason u come to work everyday.
good,"Great experience, I have the opportunity to interact with hundreds of people on a daily basis. I have learned plenty of people skills."
good,Lot of problems in enforcing rules. There were a lot of unsure rules
good,"It gets quite chaotic working at Whole Foods. One has to be ready and be positive when dealing with customers.  You never know when someone will lash at you or ridicule you. You just can't take things personally. That by far is the hardest part of this job as a front end cashier, customers sometimes forget to respect and appreciate your hard work.  Nonetheless, it's great to work with people, we called it our team members. I enjoyed having my team leaders evaluate my work and my customer skills. It is a learning opportunity to have team members to work with you to ensure that you are at the speed and proficient level as they are. We are all reaching the same goal (s) and it's just wonderful to have a dedicated team to work with."
good,can be stressful because of the customers but overall a good place to work.
good,The environment definitely helps to cope with fast-paced work speeds. I learned more about food than I ever have meanwhile working with many coworkers at once in a very friendly environment. What mattered the most to me was staying busy as it helped balance my focus on priorities in a non-stop fast-paced environment.
good,"The Artist position is very relaxed.  A job could not endeavor more to resemble paradise.  All you have to do is endure a ridiculously shifting work schedule, early mornings (5, 6 and 7 a.m. most times), and micromanagement.  "
good,Some people like it a lot. I thought is was okay. It can be laid back. They place a big emphasis on customer service.
good,Whole Fod values it's employees personal time.  Shifts are 8 hours and non-stop.  Customer service is the key.
good,"I have a smile on my face all the time at work, because it's generally a happy place to be. I have learned about healthy eating and healthy cooking, and in my job specifically I have learned more about managing a large team and ordering for a large business. Management is great-- IF you are on their good side. If you're not so lucky, work will be miserable. "
good,"A typical day at work starts with receiving a load. This can mean anywhere from 3-10 pallets, at busiest. From there the shipping labels discern break down and things are put into locations. As the day progresses maintenance of aisles is required, but customer service is crucial. From the structure of the workplace I have found attention to detail especially helpful and time allocacation to be required. Management has seemed to be solution oriented and my co-workers seem poised to be directed. The hardest part of the job is balancing handling the required grocery aspects of the job with the customer service aspects. But at the same time the challenges that arise are the most satisfying."
good,"You could possibly be doing something different a few times a week due to them having many departments which is nice to have change"
good,"Whole Foods is one of those companies that makes you feel like you are replaceable any second of the day and they will not care. If it wasn't for some of the strong bonds I have built with CERTAIN TEAM MEMBERS, I would have quit a while ago. There are multiple team members who act like they are still in high school and care more about being your friend than getting their job done. I definitely recommend going into the building with your guard up and eyes open."
good,"A typical day at wholefoods is waiting on great customer's and working with good employees. Every now and then you would meet a celebrity that would come to the market. You would be able to sample some different types of food, snacks, fruit.  I learned a lot of different ways that some foods are kept like the eggs and meats.  How some foods don't have GMOs"
good,They tell you one thing and do another. Unreliable when asked for assistance. Very little room for advancement. Very cliquey. Opinions matter to a very slight degree.
good,"Enjoyed working at Whole Foods market, didn’t see personal growth available so I want to achieve it somewhere else. Would recommend as a job for someone in need of one who needs good pay and benefits."
good,"The Amazon acquisition increased everyone's wages and brought a lot more business, which led to some employees being overworked. If one is looking to move up it has good opportunities."
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work and offer benefits! Fun to work and everyone is super friendly. It’s just a huge community that really cares about their employees
good,it was overall okay and i do not understand why indeed is making me fill this out and at this point i am just typing to fill the character requirements
good,"Good Pay, Flexible Hours if you go to school, Managers could be a lot better, but overall a great place to work and i enjoyed my time while i was there"
good,A typical day at work would be a large amount of people entering and leaving the store constantly throughout the day. Typical customer service duties to help customers find what they need.
good,A typical day for me would be just mainly helping customers. Working in seafood it can be harder than most dept. due to the amount of extra work we have to do. During really busy days it is expected to get no breaks and work hours for the week can be cut really fast if you're not full time. Working as of now 1 day of the week it is impossible to make a living in the city.
good,"Wholefoods is a great job to start out with, Customer service wise you learn a lot and your able to advance and work your way up pretty quickly. You work with a lot of different people and interact with so many different kinds of customers. Its a good learning experience."
good,"not a bad place to work but You can be bogged down in one position if you are there for too long, but They do allow you to move around either to different locations or different departments. Its a retail job though and is very customer oriented."
good,"overall good pay and benefits. very hard to keep leadership though, feel like there was too much coming down from the global aspect and they didn't have their numbers correct."
good,I had a lot of fun working for whole foods. I was mostly in the back and wanted to get promoted but they refused to do so. At the time I left the management was terrible as well. It got better later on...
good,"It was a relatively laid back atmosphere, but that was a few years ago. No real knowledge of what the culture has been like since the Amazon acquisition."
good,Work life balance sucks with the inconsistent hours. Weekends are tough. The coworkers keep you here. It can be fun when it isn't busy in the store. Managers are cool.
good,Poor Management. Must have management approval to even apply for another position within the company. Can cause issues even if you are a good employee and the management doesn't like you.
good,"Friendly Customers"
good,"Whole foods is ok. JUST ok. There's nothing special, but the people you work with. The managers sometimes help but they really don't do much. Sometimes they will make you do A LOT of work because we are short people and we are ALWAYS short people."
good,"Nothing out of the ordinary keep the store nice, help customers, and help out other areas if needed be. it was a simple job where you had to work fast."
good,"While foods made me feel like I was at home while i was there. Minus the work part . The customers know you and you know all your fellow coworkers . Very comfortable place to go on that aspect . There policys don’t make sense , they actually contradict each other . It’s easy to get fired , iv seen a lot of hard workers go."
good,"- over seeing cashiers/enforcing accountability"
good,"Working at WFM was fun.  I was at a point in my life that I wasn't able to have open availability, which was a requirement to work there.  If someone can have open availability and adhere to the corporate culture, this is a great place to work."
good,"Really good company overall but became very downhill due to upper staff. After a restructure which saw most experienced staff lose their job a very obvious pattern of friends become team leaders which led to favoritism. Some staff got away with murder whilst others had to work harder. The rotas, made by team leaders, were a joke with often mistakes, The job kept you busy but you lost your social life (working 12:30 to 9 then 8 to 4:30 the next day in many cases)."
good,The company is good it has good benefit & good hours some of their stores rules they need to change & alot of the management need to be change.but beside some of the rules it will be a good place to work
good,left whole foods due to corporate structure. I enjoyed the food very much and the people that worked there as well. I worked there for 7 years. Glad I left though
good,It was fun when I first started but it can be very stressful the customers are rude and the service is not what they make it to seem. I would never work for that company again
good,"its what you'd expect for $11 an hour. my store was very short on workers and it showed, we were often understaffed and people quit often. managers were cool though."
good,Most employees have been there for a long time and it creates a sense of family. The company as a whole has a greater understanding of organic food and animal welfare which makes it a fun place to work knowing that they care about what they sell.
good,"The typical work day is quite busy and revolves on customer service. Along with keeping up with daily logs and responsibilities, you must maintain a positive and friendly attitude to communicate with customers."
good,"They are quite fair. they work with you and every one are treated as equals. they also offer alot of benefits like 401k and Healthcare. apart from the benefits and quality, your able to move around in the company if your not happy with what your doing aslong as people are needed."
good,"I was forced to resign after my manager did not ""vote me on"" in time, and I had to go home due to an injury that had actually happened the previous day at work. The management was poor, my boss was a flirt with me and other employees. The job was difficult, but I learned so much about healthy body products and natural remedies that I don't regret it all that much."
good,"Started off great"
good,"On a typical day I would organize and merchandise my department. I would make sales, cook, and deliver customer service. I learned a lot about recipes and how to use company programs. Management and myself did see eye to eye on a lot of things including workload but could not make compromises at times that helped both parties. The hardest part of my job was multitasking between preparation, cooking, cleaning, organizing and customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job was informing a customer about a product and seeing them be satisfied and thanking me for what they had learned."
good,"with the company almost 13 years, met a great group of people,decent environment the 1st 10 years, it at one time catered to a select group of people but some thing happened cant explain"
good,"Customers services "
good,"Great benefits, great food, outstanding culture and easy to learn. Can't move up within the company fast. Alot of changes within the company.....not for the best interest. Pays okay."
good,stocked shelves customer service price tag changes management was terrible co workers some were helpful others not so helpful the job was simple enjoy all aspects of the job except not being shown any respect from management who was open to my thoughts and ideas what would better my department
good,"the job is highly demanding physically, mentally, and emotionally and fast paced. on your feet 8-10 hours a day. a lot of job responsibilities from administration, team member development, ordering, receiving, planning, merchandising, customer service. hardest part of the job is it's very demanding and exhausting. most enjoyable part of job are the people that work with you."
good,"At Whole Foods Market the work environment is very accepting and everyone is made to feel welcome. Throughout the day many tasks will be taken on at once. It provides good experience for those who wish to learn how to navigate a fast paced, growing company. Team members are typically upbeat, friendly, and hard working. I have grown both as an employee and as an individual with Whole Foods Market. I would not be where I am today without them."
good,"There are a lot of different WFM circumstances.  I've seen terrible situations and managers who shouldn't be in charge of anything, ever.  But I've also worked for good, honest people who want to make things better.  The jobs themselves aren't usually difficult, though expectations can be vague and ever-changing. The customer service expectations are moderately high. Smaller, older stores tend to have better atmospheres than the new mega-stores that are getting built now with bars and restaurant venues."
good,Great security only if you work full time. I been working part time for a year and still I'm part time. I'm seeking for a full time. The pay rate is reasonable. The team members however curses too much
good,"perfect for students"
good,For the most part I have enjoyed  working at Whole Foods Market. I have learned a lot and love the 20% discount on groceries.
good,Greeting customers and co-workers. I've learned how order products to keep in stock and on hand for customers as well how to do inventory. Management was very helpful for me to succeed with the company. The nicest co-workers i've had the pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was telling the customers we're out of stock of a sale item. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a new Grocery record in sales in one week.
good,"The one thing that I can't stand is that we have to work so much harder because WFM hires less people than they used to. We also have sooo much foot traffic in our store, and it gets so overwhelming when the space isn't big enough to hold all of the customers."
good,"From a high level, I saw a lot of favoritism. But, most believed in the core values of the company. "
good,"Was generally a good company. Pay, and benefits are good, but, good management lacks, and, team members are unhappy. They have some team members that have been there for many years, some departments have high turnover."
good,"nice place to work, very diverse, it allows individuality, room for growth, and overtime. they are only close on Christmas but allow bonus pay on other hoildays"
good,Great and productive plus very busy on soon days based on the work load but overall i love the people i met when i was there as well as all of the different foods i tasted when i work there as samples as i was working
good,"If you worked in a department besides Fresh Foods or Meat you probably wouldn't be rushing as much to finish closing, but it's just awful for closers. The openers made the place into a train wreck that  single person had to clean up."
good,"Whole Foods is an excellent place to learn the grocery business. They offer advancement opportunities on a regular basis and give reviews every 3 months that include potential raises. "
good,"I had a amazing time there, great place, people and customers. I would have never left if it was one closer to my new home. My manager was awesome, once she realized I wanted to move up, she did everything she could to help me."
good,It was ok. The management was not that great but a lot of the co workers were. I limed working with the public and that's about it. No real advancement opportunity.
good,Was a very good place to work.  Very good work culture. At the time I worked for Whole Foods the working staff was very open and easy to work with. Would work at Whole Foods again if needed
good,I loved working here everyone was really nice and always helped each other. Every night we locked up together we left together. Everything was ver work orientated.
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work if you are looking for a job that teaches the benefits of eating healthily. You are constantly speaking to people in this regard.
good,"Management was pretty fair, but some managers have their favorites. The job overall is pretty easy and I enjoy meeting different customers. You get more benefits if you're full-time though."
good,"Provided immediate and undivided attention to every customer, assisted customers in selecting cheese, beer, wine, housewares, and other specialty products, followed department procedures to maintain supplies, back stock, and coolers tracking transfers and spoilage"
good,"I enjoyed it at first, but slowly I came to realize it was not a place I wanted to work. The only and main issue was the management as well as other team members. Things were not organized well such as information they forget to tell us, constant scheduling issues, and incompetent co-workers (some, not all)."
good,Get ready this is a fast place job that you will sink or swim in. They will always feed you at the job. At 1st the job will be fast and fun.
good,"• Organized and prepared seafood display "
good,A typical day at work would be me coming in getting right to work with the other two people i worked with as a team. Then we basically finish out the rest of the shift alone which is still as a team to finish the work in the most efficient way. Everyone's pretty nice which makes a good work environment. Nothing about this job was hard to me but the best part was being able to listen to music while i worked.
good,"Whole Foods Market has the best culture or should i say friendly work environment i have ever experienced.The management was poor in my opinion , the supervisors failed at exceeding expectations due to issues or lack of communication with whom it mattered."
good,"High demand of customers and very fast pace environment, friendly people. Good Health benefits, spending card included."
good,Great place to work and start a career. There is ample opportunity to advance within the company. They tend to promote from within.
good,"Whole Foods Market offers reasonably good pay with excellent benefits, such as profit sharing, health and dental insurance, personal wellness account and paid vacation, among others. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere, while professional, remains lighthearted and fun."
good,The job was good. The hours were hard to get through Amazon. They pay was pretty good. I would apply if you like a busy and energetic environment. The store has people to help you out when you are looking for something you can’t find.
good,It is important to know that the company really thrives on togetherness and being a team player. You really can involve yourself with a good cause and future as an employee working at WF.
good,"Clock in, then straight to the kitchen. The aprons are hang up on a rack, then you go to the dressing room. Wash your hands then off to the oven and we then decide what will be displayed on to the floor."
good,"I enjoyed working for Whole foods but the lack of health benefits for part-time employees was not ideal. "
good,"Easy job, but if you put in extra work and talk to the right people, moving up is very easy. Management is usually annoyingly incompetent and lazy. Don’t let this bother you though, they are easily replaced by hard workers like yourself."
good,"A typical day at work would be laid back especially when you're enjoying time at work because of staff that created such a welcoming place to come work. everyone is very helpful, and the customers are friendly and patient. As time goes by you realize that you have expanded your knowledge by applying them not just for work but as a life style."
good,"Making sure everything was ready to go before the store open up in the morning.All jobs in about learning me personally i got to understand the grocery,the stocking of it etc.Good to have bosses that understood an listen when there was a problem,easy job an nothing was hard about."
good,"I worked in the meat department. Always helped customers to the best of my ability. With orders, special orders, etc. Kept a smile on my face. Had a great group of team members to help me along the way."
good,Give task to team members as well be aware of other task that needed to be done off the sales floor. As a leader you need to understand that there's different team members that work different and have to be talked differently. Love working sided by side to my team.
good,"I certainly gave me personal growth in personality,character,and people skills. I became educated in the nutrition arena."
good,"Whole Foods Market has a set of core values which must be followed daily in the workplace. One of my most exciting jobs thus far due to the new customers and our frequent customers who are loved and appreciated dearly. The management definitely needs a bit of work and I believe that the employees should be treated just as fairly as the customers because without us there are no happy customers. The hardest part of the job was leaving the job to better opportunities, but throughout it all it was definitely worth it and I enjoyed learning many new things at Whole Foods Market."
good,"Excellent Company,excellent company,honesty,fun,exactly,good pay,good team member,good management,clean work,good benefits,i am happy whit working ."
good,good company to work for
good,Working there have met a variety of people and we all work as a family more than a team. They encourage advancement within the company and also if interested in other store locations. Management is great stand behind the team members. Hardest part of the job is that they offer no alternative for senior workers.
good,"A very busy environment, always something to do. Management are very understanding and flexible which makes it easy to communicate with them. Hardest part of the job is completing all the tasks in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions with the customers."
good,"it's a good place to work, they have a lot of benefit  and you also have good discount. I can't say anything wrong about the company. its also a growing company"
good,good to put on your resume. good starting salary. not so much work life balance for full time employees. good type of job to have if you are a student at the same time.
good,$15.00/hr should be the minimum pay with the amount of work this company requires you to do. $11.00/hr minimum wage is not sufficient for anyone. Especially after taxes are taken out. Not cool.
good,"While the perks are good, a job in management will leave you stressed out and missing out on your life. It isn't worth the exhaustion and misery for a grocery store, unless you are a lifer."
good,Always something new when working and what they do to help the environment is outstanding and very positive all around. The staff was very friendly and acknowledgable about the products the carry and employee discount as well.
good,Learned a lot of great things. Great productive environment. I loved all my staff members and did my hardest to help each and every one of them improve in any way they could.
good,"Great discount, learned about organics, learned about different foods and preparation methods, made me a better shopper. Health and wellness focused, can earn addition discounts with positive yearly health evaluation."
good,it is a great place to work with great benefits. you meet some interesting people. good hours and great team members and good customers and the chance to advance in the company
good,"-Check and answer emails from my store team leader and my regional leaders.  At the same time reviewing sales and making sure that all my team members were at work, say hi to everyone and become informed on the upcoming issues of the day."
good,"Was after I was unable to come to work due to a massive parade occuring down the street."
good,"Whole Foods is an incredible place to work if you want a stress free-no rules job. They recently implemented a new program that gives each role a lot of structure and makes it a lot easier for you to know what you should be doing on a day-to-day basis. That being said if you want a job where they do not hold you accountable for your daily actions, then Whole Foods is not the place for you any longer. They have cracked down hard on Team Members who do not follow their new plan and are not afraid to take action for the furthering of the plan. Whole Foods is an employer that treats every day like the building is on fire and that is the sense of urgency that they expect you to have as well. It can be very difficult to move up, despite what they try and tell you, especially if you are not ""Whole Foods-y"" or if you are not in the good social graces of your Manager, Store Manager, AND Regional Manager(s). It's a boys club for sure as men make up the bulk of the ""popular "" departments (Produce, Grocery, Bakery, Prepared Foods, Specialty) and if you cannot find where you stand in that club you will always be an outsider and will not progress easily."
good,"Hours sucked, had no regular schedule. Could not have a normal life."
good,"The company as a whole has a strong message and it is a good one. Promoting clean living and eating is an important message to the world. They're focused on putting clean, natural and organic substances into your body and on your skin, and the benefits of it  brings the most out our minds and bodies."
good,they help kid hunger and the green world and alot fun on the store
good,"Employee happiness is not a priority, the health insurance is great if you don’t need anything from it but if you have any kind of medical condition, it’s going to get expensive very quickly. Your voice does not matter."
good,"I liked my job and my customers, but I did not like management.  They were very condescending and rude. There was obvious nepotism within management.  I ended up quitting to go elsewhere."
good,"Whole foods was different than i previously thought once i got in. Management was poor and treated workers poorly. Turnover rate high because of the lack of respect for workers personal lives, work life balance, and schedules."
good,"This is def one of those kind of jobs that get bills paid. Mostly a good job, but not very much screening on people in higher positions. Do not let them preach to you about how its always room for advancement or growth. in order for that to REMOTELY occur means that a slightly higher postion is open, when its next to never. Most people get content on where they are at and dont want move up or do better. Which will put you in a position that is VERY unfavorable."
good,It's was really hard to see someone take all ur idea and make them their own. Non motivated managers and team mates. Didn't acknowledge ppl that really was passionate of their jobs. Managers didn't obey by the rules and if a team members dis the same it would not be forgiven totally not fair
good,Management could use some tips on not being so rude. I liked my job until I got transferred to another location.  At this location the management was really harsh.
good,I Loved Whole Foods. However the time clock issue was a problem for me. I am a worker and did not want to wait around for lunch. So we were not a proper fit. I am a person of Vision and whole foods is behind in this area.
good,My department management lacked leadership and compassion for the workers and were harsh about rules despite the work environment overall they just seem like they don’t care
good,it is a good place to grow and learn your craft if you willing to put the work in. its a face paced place to work and the client will eat you alive only
good,"At the specific store I work at the management is terrible. "
good,"Pros"
good,"Nothing bad to say about this Company, Exept its pay to employees"
good,We had a successful department but well poorly run. The only reason things ran smoothly is due to the due diligence of all the team members who made up for the lack of work from the managers and front office.
good,"WFM has a stressful culture that includes poor life balance and minimal benefits. However, employees are fantastic and perks are abundant. Atmosphere of uncertainty surrounding the changes related to the Amazon merger."
good,"My initial 3+ years with Whole Foods was promising. Offering advancement, trainings and the pathways for team members who wanted more. I was able to seek and obtain trainings to help further my advancement within the company. "
good,After clocking In to work I would report to the customer service desk to check in with leadership and head to a register on either local or express. once my register is set up tp take customers I would great each customer with a warm welcome and a smile and hold small conversation either about their day or there groceries that they are purchasing while reminding them about our memberships.
good,A Wonderful First Job. Very Cooperative with scheduling and payments. Worked Full Time and Recieved Great Payment Raises. The cons of Whole Foods was the stress level due to employee communication and employees requesting time off last minute and having to pick up double shifts sometimes
good,"Over all it was a great work environment. There were a lot of friendly faces and laughs, but if you want any growth you have to be aware of your actions and work ethic. No one is going to tell you to work harder or push for more customer interaction. If you want something you have to go for it 100 percent and you have to make sure management knows this. Tell them what you want and then show them that you want it."
good,"It started out fun.  Then all of the good people left.  Long hours on feet, lifting heavy objects.  Management just ok.  The culture has definitely changed."
good,a lot of work for little pay...hours are unpredictable..turn over rate is bad...job can be very fun but they will fired you out of anger or favoritism
good,"Fast- paced but relax environment. Great pay, and great potential to move up in management. Also working here is a great way to learn about fresh, organic different produce and products."
good,"I enjoyed my experience but I'm ready for a real job now. Good cooking skills, fast paced, and gave me great interaction with customers. Communication is key."
good,The team members in this store are amazing and are willing to help each other out. Its amazing getting to work at one of the healthiest grocery stores
good,"Long shifts, usually 8 hours and hard on the body to be on your feet for that length of time. The good part was to work with people in customer service."
good,It was a great learning experience. the company was family oriented and geared towards health which is what i am ultimately looking for in a career. They taught me product knowledge and gave me an opportunity raise the bar on my customer service knowledge.
good,"My personal experience at Whole Foods have been fairly positive. As with any job, problems are bound to arise, but my department manager typically listens and responds to any issue. A majority of the employees are fun and motivated to get work done."
good,"Good work environment, Bad if looking for benefits. Working environment was good but they did not provide good benefits or affordable healthcare. Very little to no training in position."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people make better choices as to the groceries they buy. It has a challenging atmosphere. Good place to work
good,"Ethical at the local level, fun work environment.  High expectations from all team members makes this a very team based environment. Must be comfortable in that environment."
good,"Worked with a lot of great people there. Positive attitudes were pretty normal and greatly appreciated, Just wasn't enough hours nor pay. But I loved the company."
good,best part of the job was the customers. i also learned alot about organic produce. management wasnt that great. the culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job dealing with co workers.
good,I have worked in Whole Foods Market for 2 years. its a great job with tons of benefits and discounts.pay is good but could be better.You environment defines your work space
good,"Overall I loved the company. However, I wish I worked under a flexible manager. I was stuck working most holidays. We only received 5 or 6 floating holidays per year. Requesting time off from my manager was always a hassle. No work life balance in the department I worked under."
good,No one a specially with kids can really live off this salary unless your in some kinda management roll. I like the job its just i need more funds because of the cost of living.
good,while whole foods is a good place to work i would recommend making it short term and not long term. I felt that the pay was low and their was always issues with management communication
good,Growing business with limited employees.  Poor middle management with unfair labor practices.  Favoritism is common.  Hired on by a in-store voting system that is it.
good,"You work at a grocery store, nothin much more about it.  Basic retail, you wont be given much leniency, employees are micromanaged. If you can be on your feet for 40 hours you got it."
good,Whole foods gave me a new perspective on the industry after graduating from culinary school. I was able to get more experience with customer service and cake decorating.
good,The best job I have had . However smaller stores do not get the staff they need so most times employees are given more tasks that was led to believe to employees.
good,Culture has changed over years  but now is not much difference than Kroger . The Team Member discount is a very good benefit though. Would still recommend working here
good,I've been at Whole Foods Market for several years and each year brings new changes and challenges. Most of them have been exciting and rewarding. Hoping the company can continue to maintain the culture in future years.
good,A typical day working in whole foods is pretty satisfying knowing that you helped people with their groceries and the enviornment. The pay is fair as well.
good,"I enjoyed working at wholefoods for the most part, would probably reccomend to anyone honestly. They pay fairly especially for retail, but the managers they hire are something else, good luck."
good,great work environment people are friendly. learned a lot while employed there the job wasnt demanding but slightly challenging at times
good,Very busy place to work; long tiring standing hours; attendance policy is garbage. But the relationships you build with customers makes it all worth it.
good,"Straight Forward, Grocery Store with focus on health for all customers. All of my co-workers made it very pleasant to work there. The hardest part of the job was when the Layoffs and labor cuts started, so that we had to do more with less. However, the team environment made it tolerable, and the ""family"" came together to make it happen."
good,Good company till it was bought out. You park at Am tech and then go out to the site till the end of the day. It was decent money for the work we needed to put out each day.
good,Working as a cashier for a higher end Food Market required a lot of customer service and through this I believe I learned valuable lessons in conversing with people.
good,"I loved Whole Foods! When I worked there, I learned so much about different cultures and the importance to natural and organic foods. The information I learned opened my mind and has made me much more of an opinionated and informed consumer. I am so glad I learned what I did because I am much healthier and know what products help/ don't take advantage of other countries. The problem with Whole Foods was the good ole' boy system in which in runs under. There were many individuals who had been with the company for awhile who would go for a promotion; only to lose to the new guy who was hired by a friend of theirs. It was sad to see. Very disorganized with zero leadership because leadership positions were given to people with no experience or they just didn't care."
good,"- Great learning on the job"
good,Rather not say. It was a fun experience but as far as managemeny they need to reevaluate the people cause some should not have that title but overall it was a great experience.
good,Whole Foods had a casual and helping management team. They were supportive and listen to your request. I had a fun time working there and will again work there if an opportunity arises.
good,"I can say that the unity of Whole Foods Market with Organic vs Conventional or fair trade products you get a sense of instinct on food conscience. As a team member, that's what inspired me to have a goal of growing in the company. Unfortunately, in the location I worked for, was hardly any room for me to grow. There was favoritism in display and I guess one day another endeavor will see my potentials to grow in their company!"
good,Management is strict and unfair other then that great place to work got fired for sending a text i mean i guess in my opinion that's not something you fire someone for especially when i told them the situation as to why i needed too I'm not saying not to sign up because its a great learning space
good,It was a good place to work but before I left as catering supervisor. My boss was being very unprofessional. Talking about me behind my back.binwas trying to do the best job possible. She could have communicated to me what she wanted out of me.
good,Changes occurring at the global level are effecting the frontline team members with exaggerated stresses. The feeling of support is lacking as trust is being eroded.
good,I was ridiculed and treated unfairly due to my religious beliefs. Made my job experience very uncomfortable. The Company was great but the employees didn't make me feel right. other than that it was a fun place to work.  I left because i felt mistreated and the problem was never resolved. Store Manager was AWESOME!
good,Better hours. But they have get pay. Better mangers who care about the jobs and also enployees. Care more about employees with children (mothers). Do better
good,For you to be on the team the current team members must approve you.  I had two tries at this and despite the fact that I would help everyone and did my job well I did not pass their test. I am naturally an introvert and though I listened to everything the other employees would talk about I personally didn't have much of a connection.
good,"The company allows corporate office Team Member to work from home, once a week.  If the weather did not allow for corporate TM's to work from the office, TM's were allowed to log in from home."
good,"It was a nice place to work and a good environment to be in with friendly people. It was never hard work or uncomfortable, we had  20% discount on everything in the store."
good,"Great job. Requires great time management, focus, dedication, and willingness to work as a team. "
good,"- Customer service"
good,If staying for a longer time and moving to more interesting tasks I could see it as a good company to work for. Nice break room and discounts for employee use.
good,"I enjoyed my nearly three years working at WFM as a cashier on the front end team.  I loved my team, my customers and my job.  I tried numerous times to move up into management but was overlooked many times for others who had less time, younger, and or less experience.  There were times when I found out later that I went through the process to obtain the position; prepping, due process, interviews, only to find that they already had someone in mind and intended to hire that person from the start."
good,"When WFM started, it was a brilliant idea and a becaustiful culture was created.  In recent years, Stock Holders became more important than Stake Holders and the culture began to slowly die.  Now that Amazon has taken the reins, the culture has disappeared."
good,"A great work environment with it's quirks."
good,I decided to take a job at Whole Foods because it was a new store opening in my area and they paid really well.  The management was very relatable but I feel as though they were very unorganized and not structured.  They didn't understand that the workers had other things going on and it was very difficult to take off or find someone to take your shift with such a small staff.
good,"Prepared foods is a depressing environment with over entitled employees who use seniorority to control work atmisphere and flow. There is a huge disrespect towards customers that poisons the work atmosphere with bad attitudes, and it is a collective issue that is accepted by general store managers. There is no room for creativity inside the kitchen and prepared foods departments, unless you are lucky enough to work for catering orders."
good,"Worked in the Meat Department. Team Leader was a joke. Too much work for little pay. Promotions given to known drug users. It's a job. If you work too hard, they'll put all the work on you and find excuses to write you up so they don't have to give you a raise."
good,"This used to be a fantastic company and I loved working there. In the past few years though its gone downhill. The OTS and Amazon transitions are hard enough, but add in bad strategy on sales, poor leadership, and inadequate care for employees... the team member commitments aren't being honored anymore, the bonus program is dead and gone in all but name, and the hours/labor are cut, cut, cut. Losing dollars to save pennies."
good,I used to love working for Whole Foods Market. I left the company after the 2017 Amazon buyout. The glory days are over. I will credit Whole Foods to teaching me a strong work ethic. Met some of my favorite people on the planet while working for this company.
good,Pretty good company to work for. A few changes and the company will be set. Family emergencies and life happening things doesn't matter to management.
good,It was far better when I started there but the culture has deterioriated and frequently it is a do as I say and not as I do mentality. Mostly because of the outside middele management.
good,Whole food was a great place to work. its a friendly environment with  helpful staff and usually pleasant customers. They pay well and there is room for growth at the compny
good,"Team members (hourly workers) are some of the best and nicest people you will ever meet."
good,"I like working here but lately it’s been rough for new manager so lots of things are all over the place "
good,"completive but fun, works around availability if not full time. Gain sharing every two week. people will help when you ask a question. great staffing."
good,"As said above, my review cannot be super helpful. However, room to advance in the company (within a store) is difficult since people stay once they get a higher level position for a while. All my coworkers were amazing, discount was eh since the $$ of products is above average anyway, and holidays are rough but they are busy compared to the dreadfully slow weekdays."
good,The store was failing before amazon bought out and ran on the bare minimum. The work load was too much for the cuts they were making. not worth the time.
good,"The culture of Whole Foods was a concept, but the follow through of management made it a  turn from great to unbearable. Any time you put on do stress on your employees"
good,"Is working with the public, customer service and selling product I believe in. I enjoyed my many years with Whole Foods Market. I would recommend working there"
good,The work was alright it was just the assistant store manager was trying to be the store manager. A day at work was coming in getting production list done and if I had an order coming in or that needed to be placed  placing that also.
good,I learned a lot working with different people. I can be challenging some times. I think that management can be successful if they involve and work for the core values of the organization.
good,"Whole foods is run the same as any retail chain. Maybe even more cut throat. It has been a while since I worked here, and maybe Amazon will change the overall culture."
good,Loved my job and what I did but was expected to do all of the work without pay and at first it was fine but I felt attacked because my boss told me in front of customers on the sales floor that I wasn't going to be given a supervisor position
good,"It's a decent job, however, there is no way to move up unless you're a favorite. Many people who hardly work get to be in supervisor positions and the rest of us hard working individuals get stuck at the same place."
good,"Not a good job for people with back problems or physical chronic pain. A great environment, but sometimes I felt like Whole Foods doesn't care about their employees as much as they say they do. I did always find cool new intellectual people to converse with."
good,Great quality of food products and education that makes you proud to stand behind the whole foods name as a worker. scheduling makes it har to balance life outside of work. great pay for it being a supermarket.alot of opportunity to move up.
good,The environment is a fun one where team members get along and have fun. The customers are also great and from time to time you can get on friendly bases.
good,Management was not much understanding. The work environment is not that great. Some Co-workers were rude and with nasty attitude.
good,"Good company to work for, company is customer centered, management is very hands on in the company. Very fast paced, always something to learn."
good,It lost its culture it built itself upon. I'm no longer happy there mainly because I can't move up with all the restructuring going on. I thrive to move up the ranks and learn that I can
good,"Steady work and always something to be done. "
good,"fun workplace for a high school student. minumum wage with almost no benefits, but yet great experiance for a fist job."
good,"Whole foods as a company is a phenomenal business structure, and a lot of their purpose thrives as a great idea in modern grocery shopping. "
good,"Day-to-day duties included granting access to employees to Whole Foods financial systems. Setting up new employees, deleting old ones, cleaning up the system for audits."
good,"Not the fondest of this job, West Van had some of the hardest customers to deal with and there was no benefit for being hardworking and biking to work every day."
good,set up dept so it was ready for opening. put loads away cull dept check codes give out tasks to be done that day . I leaned all about organics.  its a fast pace company. high expectations. great customer service. management is more low key as to other companys i worked for walts food 9 years jewel food 28 years. my team members were great .trained to do there jobs all had great attitudes . which is very important at any job. they all worked for me we all had a good time we all had respect for each other. the hardest part of the job was when the buyer didn't bring in enough product and you start to looked empty in some spots. then your disappointing the customer. I have leaned through out my years. you don't want to disappoint the customer. setting up a  dept you can be proud . and listen to the customers feed back .how great it looks or I love shopping here. I tell all my friends about your store that's all it takes to hear. then go back and tell your crew. guys you did a great job today. give every one high fives
good,"Stock up on Bags, Ice and other Front end items. "
good,decent place to work. management leave a bit to be desired. though the pay is good the treatment of it emloy
good,A typical day for me is as follows: I clock in at 6:30am. I am part of the sandwich team and I am the one (when on duty) who work on making wraps. Most of the things that I know I have already known from other jobs. I did learn about different organic products and the benefits of them. Management comes and goes. The current management is great but is seems that they don't really care about what is going on. There are co-workers that don't deserve to be there and then there are ones that are great to work with. The hardest part of the job is where there is not enough people on the shift to take care of the customers. That's a management scheduling issue. The most enjoyable is working with food and learning new ways to make great food items and the early morning shift.
good,"Good place for a part-time or summer job. Depending on the store you work for, the experience could vary. A pretty good place to make friends, But the schedule could be difficult depending on the store you work for."
good,"Prepared Foods Department is where you want to be, for interaction with your team members and regular customers. You will alternate and gain expertise in all areas of the section."
good,"I liked whole foods. Good culture, got to learn a lot. I'd recommend it to a friend. It was good while I was there and I had a positive experience. I am still a customer!"
good,"I would opena dn close the department, keep inventory of all products, order all products for running of department. Send daily recaps of sales and what tasks were performed and what needed to be completed the next day."
good,"Great people to work with, a different way of retailing in the uk, good awareness of animal welfare and sustainability and are able to train team members on this culture to a high standard"
good,"Its okay. Pay is highest in the area but it's still a struggle. Small room to advance mattering on your department lead, they sometimes wont approve your transfer/application for advancement."
good,"It wasn't unlike other kitchens I've worked in. It was fast, noisy, busy, and more than a little stressful. I liked it most of the time, but the kitchen management was sometimes discouraging and the work load seemed never ending."
good,it is a good company but in the past few years it has changed we used to have better benefits and it was a team member happens focused company not any more.
good,"A typical day at work exhausted me for more than it was worth, but I enjoyed the work itself, and appreciate the relationships I gained through working for Whole Foods Market."
good,"If you want to advance you have better have the ability to create relationships with the appropriate people.  Skill set and the “team” decision making process is a joke. If a complaint is filed there is really no follow up through the company.  I was up for a promotion and applied. The “panel interview” process was a waste of time. Unanimously “voted” me in but the single manager vetoed it. "
good,"decent work palce .Awesome food. Great Wallaby kefir, cheap vitamin D milk. Best tasting chicken and beef, brioche, fresh fruit, mention it. They've got it. Checked out using Amazon prime QR code for a discount. Accepts phone pay"
good,"The culture of the company is fantastic. My time spent at Regional offices were pleasurable. When you trickle down to the store level however, I found that local management teams were overrun with soap opera level drama. Store Team Leaders tend to run their locations like a mini-kingdom. They are spoiled children with attitudes of entitlement, and self-appointed royalty. They throw tantrums when their way and rarely, in my observation, do they follow the guidelines set forth by the Regional teams.  They just do what they want with arrogant attitudes. Ego is in plentiful supply at the Store Leadership level. I've watched good people make their way from Team Member to Associate (Assistant) Store Team Leader and their personality goes in the toilet, matching the resident leadership model."
good,If you work hard you will get promoted. This is a great company to work for and if you qualify for benefits they are good. There are plenty of positions and there is always something to do.
good,"It really depends on what department and store you work in. The store supervisors at my store often brush serious matters off. There have been plenty of complaints from cashiers about customers acting inappropriately/ making the cashier uncomfortable, but so far there hasn't been any action despite the fact they said they would do something. Customers are rude and incredibly entitled. "
good,"I personally think its better to work at health food type stores if you are going to work in retail/customer service/stock/prepared foods. I have found that they provide an overall comfortable work environment. The pay is at least a little above minimum wage, but not by much ($10 an hr) and it's difficult to get full time work in any department. Which is also the case at most retail stores, but you're at least being paid somewhat better here. The point system for attendance was unfair in my opinion. When I first started, I had fellow coworkers warn me that they were very strict about being over 7 minutes late and had a point system to go with it - 3 and your out. That was how most employees ending up getting fired. If you live further away from the store and live in a state with harsh winters/occasional bad roads, this point system can catch up with you quickly."
good,For me personally it was alright that’s why I stayed for a long time. But once you start getting into a higher position you have to be more careful. You are more at risk to get fired. Some leaders are cool in each department some are not.
good,"Good company for a corporate giant. Good benefits and discount, pay is paltry, at least in Chicago there's no way to make a living from WFM. No training whatsoever"
good,A very monotonous job with very little room for growth. I saw multiple team members more qualified than other candidates lose job offers due to favoritism.
good,The pay is decent but you are constantly worried about getting a write up or a warning. 10 minutes late and it counts as an absence. You get paid but you're only allowed 3 before you're fired.
good,Great work environment with coworkers and customers. Very organized work space as well. Most productive grocery store in Kendall. Well put together departments.
good,"I liked my time I was there they could of given better hours and just the management overall could of been better, but overall its a great place of business"
good,Good place to work. Not very much balance between work and person life. Wish the pay was better for how hard you work. Wish there were better opportunities to move up the ladder.
good,If your in with the clicks.. I was there to work not to be in clicks or have drama. It’s almost as if you can’t keep your head down but you have to be loud and out there to be noticed and promoted.
good,"Pay is good. "
good,Greet and meet customers as well as help them with any their needs. Learned different sources of eating healthier. The work place culture was very ire and not inviting. Hardest thing about the job would be having the ability to keep composure when dealing with angry customers. The most rewarding thing about this job would be the great people that you get to know in the neighborhood by name.
good,"People get very stressed here and there are pretty high expectations at the same time you can get away with a lot but it adds up and then you have to work a lot harder to fix what someone didn’t do, people are typically friendly, management has issues."
good,"Downtown environment isnt the best, new apartments and buildings coming soon. Many departments and positions to choose from. Diverse enviroment/workers."
good,"Good place to get job experience, lack in advancement, lack in pay raise, not a place for a long term career or pay to live off,  only management, "
good,"The prepared foods department is a very busy, strenuous department to work in. I enjoyed the pace and working with the customers but the non consistent work schedule and the amount of physical work took a toll on me physically. Its definitely a job for younger people. A perfect job for students."
good,"Wholefoods is good, but the leadership is sometimes biased and unfair. Team members work alot and often pay does not reflect how hard you've worked. Honestly, it's the team members who make Wholefoods."
good,"Overall, i enjoyed working with Whole Foods as a company."
good,Whole Foods managers tend to have huge egos and I think that's what is leading to the inevitable demise of the company. Too many teachers pets and snakey backstabbers.
good,"Was happy work if at Wolefoods had a good experience."
good,The relaxed atmosphere made it a good place to work.  The manager I had didn't really want to be there anymore so it kinda made it a pain to work in my department.
good,"This is an amazing company to work for.  I have been working for them going on seven years and have thoroughly enjoyed my time there. I manage one the juice/coffee/gelato bars and although it can be fast paced and stressful, the culture there makes it enjoyable."
good,"I loved working at wholefoods the only problem was there weren’t that many hours giving out to their employees . It was a faced paced environment, very friendly associates, managers that are very understandable, I just hate the amount of hours that are giving out ."
good,"Great place to work - super busy, fast, chaotic environment."
good,Whole Foods Market is going through many changes in ownership and upper management causing stress and changes all the way down the line to the floor personnel.
good,"The people you meet are great, benefits are great,management is poor. Very childish, pick favorites and mild harassment towards females. lots of healthy living information given."
good,"Working at Wholefoods was overall fun and relaxed. Such an upbeat culture, and friendly coworkers. During the year I've worked for WF I learned how to be patient and clearly communicate with customers. The hardest part of the job would have to have been standing in the same spot for 8 hours straight and not being able to move around too much, also not having a set schedule because i was ""open"" so i would have to close then open most times.I enjoyed working with my team members, the part of my role i enjoyed most was interacting with different people all day."
good,"I wouldn't call it a stable job, a lot of young kids work there so it is fairly easy to be let go. Some jobs are very boring like customer service. Definitely a bad option for someone with a degree because many people in management don't have one and won't care that you do."
good,Great Company with good values. Hard to advance. Pay could be a lot better.Management are idiots.They punish the hard workers.They will slowly break you down till you choose to leave.
good,"very basic job, training is something that just happpens as you go. once you've learned your position, thats it! most team leaders either did not train new hires well, or were just very rude."
good,cool place to work sometimes.. just have to know how to get away with certain things. its more about getting to know ur co workers cuz the managers don't really help much
good,"Whole foods is the leading supplier of natural and organic products on the market. They pay well and offer a lot of room for advancement. If you are looking to travel with a job, this is a good one as they have locations all over the country."
good,"Fine work environment, good benefits, terrible pay. Little room for advancement. I excelled at my job and worked way harder than other employees but because it is so corporate there is limited room for advancement."
good,"Great work environment to be in and come to. The people you work with are all friendly and easy to get along with which makes it a nice place to work. The management could have been better, there was favoritism and unfairness in this work place."
good,"At Whole Foods a typical day at work is like a workout, you are constantly busy because we are such a busy store. I have learned how to work with a lot of different personality's. Management I wish was a little bit better on the way they talk to people. The culture is very beautiful. The hardest part of the job is being short staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet people from all over."
good,"This is an interesting place to work. You will have opportunities to learn about food and organics, they offer profit sharing. The management is not very experienced."
good,"Biased management. If you are not buddy buddy with the team leader you are on your way out, not fair, to individuals trying to movie up.  I spoke with Walter Robb, VP of whole foods, and he asked me how I was finding things in my department.  I answered in confidence and told him our department was not doing well and our team leader was not doing his job.  Somehow my team leader got word of this and ever since then he has been looking to get rid of me.  I was one of the hardest working employees there, my department can vouch for me, and other leaders in the store can recommend me for this job.  I am very qualified."
good,"We get to do cool stuff and work with cool people and eat cool food. Great things happen, nice people. Sometimes we even get to go to parties and do party things"
good,"Expectations are made clear from day one and are enforced. Must me a ""yes man"" to advance in the company. Hard work is not rewarded. The benefits are fantastic but pay is lacking."
good,This was my first retail job and it was great atmosphere and learning experience. fast past. all co-workers got along very well. management was respectable. great team members.
good,"Provide excellent customer service by displaying all of Whole Foods’ core values"
good,"Working for Whole Foods was great until they change the upper leadership and started expecting the warehouse to be run like a store. People who had been working there for more the 10 years were fired because of the way they did things. Which the way they did things were not wrong just not what the leadership wanted. "
good,"Every weekends is the busiest day of the week. I learned a lot from my previous work, it allows me to expand my knowledge not just on my field but as well as other related field of work that will help for the company. I also established a good relationship towards my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is by working long hours, I am paid 8 hours a day but I am given a very long hours of break e.g 4 hours break is added to my schedule a week. What I enjoy most of my work is the relationship we had with my co-worker, we establish not just friendship but we treat as a family."
good,"I like my job the hours are set so I am able to work around it. The only thing with that is the days are not guaranteed. Currently, we are required to change our job description."
good,i learned alot working for this company with room to grow and also moved up in working only two months here. i left on good terms with options for rehire.
good,"Pros: you can accumulate vacation hours and benefits are great."
good,"Great place to work, great management team."
good,"They are very understanding of college student's scheduling and will work with you to change your hours if needed. The only downside is the amount of time you get for breaks, compared to how long you spend standing and looking at a screen all day. You're only allowed a 15 min break if you're working 6 hours, if you're working 8 hours you get a single 15 min plus 30 min lunch."
good,"Day to day I would manage our HyperV environment, a multitude of servers, AD environments for 5000+ users. AV servers, backup servers, WiFi and Access Points."
good,"Two of my favorite things about Whole Foods are the standards for products sold and the company's global initiatives.  While I enjoyed the intellectual environment surrounding the store and loved helping the community.  the commute and scheduling became a problem.  At times, would spend four hours on public transit, and could be scheduled to leave for work five hours after getting home."
good,"A typical workday at Whole Foods consisted of staying quite busy. I enjoyed my co-workers, but management was less than desirable to work with."
good,"Typical day at work consist in interacting with many customers who enjoy  making new recipes and want to learn about new foods and what s good for you."
good,I currently work as a supervisor and buyer. I enjoy my days work. My guests are always a cheer to see each day! My ideas are excepted and my career is always pushed to further depths.
good,"I come in at 5am and pull pork butts and briskets from night before reload smoker with chickens and ribs and start setting up counter for service ordering supplies, customer service.One of the main things I learned is you have to watch your back especially if you are in management.The hardest part about the job was cleaning out smoker it made me hate barbaqued food but the part I enjoyed the most about working there was being exposed to all the different foods and I saw a few celeberties there."
good,I learned a lot about organic foods and I also acquired a lot of skills that will help me in future employment
good,"Its a good and fun place to work. the environment is good but the work load is a lot because there always short staffed because hey don't wont to spend money on hiring people, so usually you will be doing double work. the schedule is made a week in advance but yet when the week comes they always have to make changes, asking you to switch your days off. they micromanage a lot and when the higher up bosses come and don't like the work the managers always blames the employee."
good,fun and courteous people to work with pay is lousy.    There is no benefits and the pay is lousy.  Their food is very sustainable and good.
good,"*Check in with everyone assess the needs of the department and take care of them."
good,"As front line agent, my role is to sell ."
good,"Great place to work if you are in college, or need a part time retail job. Not much room for growth, but an outstanding amount of learning opportunities in the food culture."
good,"In hind sight this job was one of the best I have had. Compensation was fair, and the job was secure. If you did a good job you were rewarded, and the work environment was not bad. I left because of a ""grass was greener"" opportunity, turned out not to be!"
good,"very nice place to work with tons of great new things to learn,especially for those who are interested i organic foods//fruits"
good,A great enviormnt to work in and they give u the ability to feel in ower in your position
good,"It was a great place to work.the people are nice to work with.  The customers are great and the place is always stocked, clean, family friendly. The management is good and work with you."
good,Easy job to handle but the hours can become scarce sometimes. Fun work atmosphere and the workload isn't too heavy. The only bad thing I could say about the job is that sometimes hours aren't available.
good,It was a good company to work for. I enjoyed working there and everyone was friendly. I worked in the bakery team and i enjoyed attending the costumers and my co workers felt like family.
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work because you can make a lot of friends. You learn a lot of new things about organic and sustainable food and the team is always there to help you if you are unsure.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods, and found it to be a rewarding experience. One of their Core Values is 'team member happiness and excellence' and I found that to be true."
good,The starting pay for Whole Foods was great. There are always pros and cons to every job. Please consider this when applying to any job. It is important information.
good,"There is always something to do at Wholefoods. No day is exactly alike. The customers run the gamut from really lovely people to the most difficult. Unlike other supermarkets, Wholefoods tries to develop a teamwork ethos and camaraderie within the stores. The customers are both the hardest and the most enjoyable parts of the job"
good,"My time at Whole Foods was awesome. I learned so many things and met so many great people. The work is consistent thought the day.  The only down side is that if store management isn't sweet on you, they won't hesitate to get rid of you."
good,There're a lot of different skills this job taught me. I learned new cooking techniques and recipes. I also learned different ways to fillet different types of fish.
good,"I cannot tell too much. The store closed and moved to a location that was too far for me to get to. When I was working , I would prepare the work area and make sushi."
good,"relaxed job "
good,"Decent place to work. Sold out to Amazon after I quit which is a huge bummer. Now they rely on customers money to fund any charity thing they do. Aside from that, if you enjoy food, especially health food it's a great place to work."
good,"Cons: "
good,"I have had a good experience with Whole Foods Market overall.  In my 15 year tenure, I worked my way up through the company, had many excellent leaders, and enjoyed the work culture."
good,Very typical for being a grocery store. Gets very busy at noon and evening around 5-7. Management was very flexible with scheduling. Customers can be a bit mean but management will help when they are being difficult.
good,Whole Foods is a nice place to work overall with how they treat you and everything that they have going on for the employees. But then on the other hand if you work in prepared foods it’s a complete joke. If u have experience in the kitchen then I suggest using that somewhere else. Never enough staff and not enough people that actually know what they are doing. The standards that they swear by are not what they live by. Cool spot other than that though just don’t work in the kitchen .
good,"nothing bad to say was a good job nice place to work with nice coworkers and they really care about there employees but wouldn't put people in positions they aren't ready for and better training and patience with "
good,"No other grocery store highlights the importance of product and people in the way the Whole Foods does. From its strict adherence to quality standards to an overarching emphasis on taking care of customers, Whole Foods is serious about being a great place to shop."
good,"The company is a good company if you looking for something  temporary, minimum wage one of the best..."
good,"I enjoyed my time at whole Foods. The location was still new when I was hired on so things were a little crazy, with customer traffic being unpredictable. The day started with preparing the food cases and bakery/cheese/deli departments for opening, and then preparing fresh ingredients for the pizza deck and made-to-order foods. Keeping a clean work environment is essential, as is taking periodic temperatures throughout the department and educating yourself on food restrictions and allergen concerns. Ending shift was predominantly cleaning and packaging food for storage. Taking down any equipment that needs cleaning, as well as disposing of food products that have past their ""best-by"" dates. The co-workers were the best part of my time at Whole Foods, while management was struggling to maintain the new location in 2015. Many people I worked with then are still there now as they love their jobs and what they do."
good,"It was a great environment. The hours were always available but the flexibility for time off, holidays, and personal emergencies was a bit skewed. It is a full commitment and they do push to help you move up in the company. I loved everyone I worked with."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods Market. It is generally a relaxed environement, with no strict uniform and encouragement to interact with customers and make them feel welcomed to the store. The benefits are great, such as discounts on groceries and paid time off."
good,Whole foods is a great place to find a family type relationship with staff and the management. The work place was always kept clean and comfortable for employees.
good,Company culture is great although there have been some changes not for the best since Amazon has taken over. For a retail job the pay and culture are very competitive.
good,a typical day at work involves interacting with customers. Depending on the store and the department you may be interacting with anywhere between 5-1000+ customers a shift.
good,"A very good job "
good,"Was't hard work, managers expect a career for part timers. Long nights tend to have to stay later after the store closed to clean up various parts of the store."
good,"good place to work "
good,It used to be the best place to work. But things change as they become more cooperate and now its less about the employee and more about the bottom line. Still a good full time job for a grocery store.
good,"Whole foods market was, overall, a positive environment to work in.  My team was supportive and management was approachable.  However, there are limited full time opportunities."
good,Great company to work for and you meet amazing people. It can get really busy but when you have a great management team and helpful coworkers the day goes faster.
good,"The culture was the highlight, but it didn't quite fit with my values. No big deal, but I was there during a period when we were severely understaffed, making it massively stressful."
good,I work in a kitchen so it can get very busy sometimes it gets understaffed. Hours are respected. Managers are mostly cool. Most employees are cool. We get paid well. Full time get benefits.
good,When I was there after one month they combined departments and Bakery ended up with personnel that had no idea how to order how to bake if needed.  Very frustrating
good,"Typical day chopping vegetables, breaking down, cutting or grinding meat, weighing and mixing ingredients, washing and preparing vegetables, storing food,"
good,"I first started at wholefoods in 2010, needless to say it was an entirely different culture. Training was a huge part of the onboarding process and other team members were excited to do so. Now not so much. 3 days in a class room and then it is more of a sink or swim mentality."
good,I enjoyed the work environment. I think Whole Foods is a wonderful company and sell great products. You are interacting will all sorts of people which is great
good,"Good company great benefits , growing company competitive pay I’ve been with the company 7 years I’ve learned a lot n moved to a few stores and opened 1"
good,"Company promotes a collaborative and engaging environment."
good,Can get busy and expect the most customer service from you. Wiling to work with schedule only if it benefits them. ability to move up in the company if its really what your looking to do.
good,I was not there for long due to the job being seasonal. I held responsibilities of stocking the freezers and shelves. Management was very helpful any time I had questions about the job.
good,Very great coworkers and nice people. Customers were rather snobby but the workers were cool and kind. I never received my PTO upon leaving even though I only called off twice in one year. Not good.
good,Good place to work. Enjoyed the interaction with customers. Good compensation. Good benefits. Flexible hours. Organized environment. Opportunity for upward mobility
good,Work balance can be tactical but manageable. Relaxed crew members. Learned a lot about Organic Food Culture and humane practices. Event and gift raffles. Promote a healthier being. Great discounts.
good,I enjoyed interacting with the customers who came daily. My co workers were very friendly and open. I learned a lot about customer service working here.
good,"Employees basically have no rights... It is whatever management wants."
good,"As a cashier, expect to be standing in the same place for a long time. But the day would go by fast! Customers were generally nice, managers were cliquey with certain cashiers, but overall coworkers were professional and it was like any other customer service job. Pros: great samples, discounts, product knowledge, Cons: your shifts were always changing, finding parking"
good,Each department has its own community. They all share inside jokes and wholehearted laughs all around. Management is friendly and very supportive of employees needs.
good,"good place to work , the company at this time was in charge of poor management people,but the organization is really wel,a lot of employees leave the job  cause the manager without experience an bad aministration"
good,"Fun company. Great place to learn, grow, develop new skills. I enjoy working with customers, management does a great job in helping team members become with tasks or operations. There are opportunities for advancement. My experience has been positive working for a 'flagship store""."
good,I was a cashier and had a chance to meet a lot of great people. I also learned a lot about different foods which changed my diet for the better. The environment was college age kids mainly which kept things interesting for the better.
good,"The cashier job at whole foods is nice because everyone is a bagger and a cashier. There is no hierarchy. Also they pay well, with monthly bonuses based on the store. This was before the amazon take over though so i don't know what its like now."
good,"Was a fun place to work, had my regular customers and made friends but everyday was new day to learn whether it was about a product or the company. Plus it helped that we had team builds and appreciation week"
good,"Fast paced with flexible hours. Nice atmosphere. Good management. Very strict attendance policy. Over all a good place to work, but moving up mostly means relocating."
good,"It's really easy to move up if you work hard, culture is highly dependent on your location but is overall very positive. I'd say management needs to work on communication and a lot of the issues come from higher up in the company. Again it's an awesome place to get started and the people are worth staying for."
good,Coworkers work well with each other and really embrace the team dynamic. Everyone is dedicated to doing their best and the company cares about their employees.
good,"A typical day was restocking beer and wine, also resupplying inventory of  cheese's while answering and helping any customers with their shopping needs."
good,I was hired by a different company to do demos at the whole foods so i did not directly work at the whole foods. The staff there was very helpful and friendly in helping me set up and take down however.
good,"A typical day at work rushed by quickly. Very fast paced. I learned how to cook many things and work with a lot of different people. The management was good, but sparse. The workplace culture varied, but I generally felt camaraderie. The hardest part of the job was the lunch rush. The most enjoyable part was getting to work with food."
good,Everything is pretty nice except how difficult it is to find a full-time position that allows you to work more hours. As with most retail jobs I think it comes with the territory that your schedule will vary week to week.
good,I enjoyed the time i worked there. After a while though i became a bit disenchanted with how much they were changing. As well as some management issues. The work culture seemed to encourage a bit to much slacking for some and extra work to make up by others.
good,"A productive place and nice people to work with. You work hard and try to stay busy at all time. They seek out the finest natural and organic foods available, maintain the strictest quality standards. They really believe in all customers should have good customer serves."
good,"It didn't really matter what department you worked in. Everyone there is super nice, because it is a very relaxed environment. As long as you follow what management is telling, they will trust you to get your job done."
good,"Every day here is a learning experience. From leadership, to your fellow coworkers and even the customers, you are able to learn about new and exciting things that keep you interested in the job."
good,A typical day of work at Whole Foods Market is fairly simple but some of the tasks are more time consuming the others. The culture is one of excellence where employees are encouraged to do their best. Our office motto was everything is everyone’s job and everyone is everyone’s boss.
good,"i liked it while i was there, but i hated the management. managers did nothing all day especially store managers... walked around doing nada. need to improve ALOT."
good,"I love everything about working there."
good,I have always loved my time at Whole Foods especially with the people that are in leadership and helped to mold me into the worker that I am today. They rock
good,"-Good place to work."
good,I enjoyed my role however the management was incompetent and unsupportive. They were extremely short of training and quick to implement write ups for poorly trained employees. It does not appear that management takes responsibilty when things do not go as planned. They expect perfection but do not have the capacity to train for it.
good,"Whole Foods makes sure to get the most out of their employees. I appreciated the discounts and experience. Also, Whole Foods has a great system set up for safety and security."
good,"If you're lucky to work at a Whole Foods with good store and department management, then you're golden. My two managers got promoted or relocated to another state and the new management is an asswipe. Store management claims that they care about the employee's wellbeing, but they really don't. They could care less if you dislocated a finger. Just don't work for the Dadeland store."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy battling customer returns, complaints, long lines. "
good,"sometimes short staffed and can be on register without much of a break, supervisors don't pay attention to the needs of the cashiers."
good,"I would say it is a very relax job as a grocery team member. Most of the time, I was just restocking and helping customers. It was generally fun, but could get repetitive."
good,"I had learned a lot of new recipes and good customer service skills. People are very nice always helping each other. Only management has challenged. Our store leader had certain favourites people , not to fair with everybody. It makes us difficult to deal with . "
good,Wholefoods is a pretty nice place to work. They walk you through everything and make sure that you understand what needs to be done. Everyone is friendly and treats you nicely.
good,The food was made from scratch on a daily basis. I learned a lot about natural foods and their benefits.  Great health and wellness programs. I would work for Whole Foods again
good,Good place to work but super stressful overall.  Did really like the discount and would definitely reccomend as an in between type of job. Long term is easy burn out.
good,"Great job for anyone, probably the best part of working in a grocery store is that most people are qualified to do so, and it is a chance to meet a wide range of people."
good,management could use little of work  and the customers are very rude to the cashier they very spoiled but some people are really nice once you get to know them.
good,Excellent company that cares about its employees. Can be rough working in a grocery store at the holidays but they tried to give breaks and food. Constantly expanding.
good,A lot of work for not a lot of money. Team environment is good. High turnover rate. Managers are very understanding. always moving. not worth the stress.
good,Lack of decent in store managment. Was a good company to work for until global management decided to cut back on employee incentives. Store managment seems to have gone downhill when the company decided to hire people outside of the company to fill those rolls. Many of whom are totally clueless about how the grocery business actually works. It's almost like the blind trying to lead professional people who know thier jobs over a cliff. It's really sad how the culture has changed so radically. I hope they will listen to the dedicated employees on future surveys.
good,"It's an easy job that pays decently for what it is. Management can tend to be a little cliquey. Coworkers were generally similar, like-minded individuals. Lots of teamwork involved."
good,Working for Whole Foods was my introduction to the world of natural foods and I haven't looked back. It was a fun and engaging work place and I appreciate everything I learned there.
good,"Great Job , Great Pay , Room For Growth , Co-Workers Good People "
good,"I was a dishwasher, it was ok. A lot of work and a lot of dishes to do for one guy but I was able to fit in some school on the side. I also helped with food prep out front."
good,I loved working with customers who needed help because I love the concept of customer service and I like making sure the customer leaves satisfied. Knowing where everything was at was good because if a customer was struggling with finding something I was able to tell them where to go.
good,"It was a fine part time Job. I had trouble trying to get into a new department, but overall people were pretty good. Management is ok and the culture was pretty chill."
good,I enjoyed most of my time there. They work on a points system that can get the best of employees let go over unexpected life crisis. Some of what they say you have access to as employee you will never see
good,I would come in on a busy day and most times I wouldn't get help in my department but I would have to help other departments. My Job title there could be very stressful or very easy. Hardest part wast keeping up with all the tasks on your own.
good,"I like working here for the most part. it’s a fast paced environment and the people are friendly. The pay is good. It’s just repetitive, there are no challenges so it gets boring after a while."
good,"Great place to work, very friendly. only problem i had was with my team members but other than that wholefoods is a good place to work.if you start working there you should enjoy it"
good,"Exciting work place, always new items and recipes to showcase to our customers.  Felt that the company was true to there CORE VALUES, that was important to me and the team."
good,I liked working there and was hoping to work there for a while as it was a new store. They simply didn't have a lot of work for part time people and let me go.
good,"There was always a new challenge and opportunities for growth. As a buyer, there was autonomy with just enough structure to provide guidance. definitely great benefits."
good,working at whole foods was okay. It has its ups and downs but very productive always busy. Leadership was very helpful and always willing to listen to new ideas. But its not something one would like to spend their life doing.
good,I would work there again if possible. Great place to work they allow you to be yourself as long as you show up ready to work. I had a great time working there the time that I did.
good,It was good but I didnt want to stay. I found myself hating having to go to work. The job wasnt for me anymore. I was working full time which was great because I did get paid nicely and they people who work there are great. I have been working in customer service for a while though so it grew to be so tiring. I was burnt out.
good,It started going downhill when amazon came around and while I loved the environment I worked in and would enjoy the opportunity to go back there it is because of the hardworking individuals there.
good,"nice environment they care about their employees, tough to move up in san  Diego. But the transfer process is easy, every location is different from the other"
good,I like working at wholefoods but I want more. I want a job I feel like I’m doing something that makes a difference and wholefoods I’m just working to deepen the pockets of amazon
good,"They really drill their vision into your head. Good management, good benefits.  A little bit heretical about their philosophy. A ton of training involved. Very competitive when it comes to advancement."
good,"Day-to-day functions at work vary but most work involves keeping areas clean and functioning. Extremely high turnover rate so when the crew for a team gets low it is important to remember that more employees will come. Perhaps that is the nature of service jobs but I suspect it's more to do with the morale level at the store which was pretty low. Management is not tyrannical or outrageous. Basically if you don't complain, finish your daily tasks on time and keep to your own business you will succeed."
good,"I had a great experience at Whole Foods. The schedule was extremely flexible as I worked towards getting my degree. The people I worked with were like family."
good,"I think this is an overall good company to work for, every retail job has its ups and downs and I don't think anyone should blame the company for it.."
good,Whole Foods is a great place to grow. If you are interested in a better living and specific diets it's the perfect place. It has a great employee culture.
good,Easy to transfer departments because there are several different departments. Everybody in the store gets along and there are many events going on often. it can be a fun place to work.
good,"Accommodating place to work, good people and benefits are good. Managers are good communicators. Productive balance in produce is not balanced. Customers are cool."
good,"Whole Foods provided ample opportunities for learning and growth on a day to day basis. Creativity is somewhat lacking on a store level, which is ultimately controlled by the regional level. Great company to expand knowledge, build connections, and move up."
good,"Agile team and very well versed with the upcoming technology. Maybe thats why Amazon bought them. "
good,a typical day at the warehouse would be for the associate to select their equipment which are your PIV and headset that provided the selector their work. once you receive work selector builds pallets of product to be staged and loaded. repeat process. I learned various aspects of logistics and how to operate sit down or stand up forklifts. the hardest part of job is the physical demand and long hours. the best part of job are the paychecks.
good,they give you a discount card for when you and ur significant other shops there and you have an opportunity to  increase that discount up to 30 percent if you go thru a series of test to prove that you live a healthy life
good,"Management was poor. I worked at the Irvine location as a produce team member. Although the management was poor, the work itself was very rewarding. Sampling, stocking, and constant moving were all apart of the job."
good,Working at Whole Foods Market was a relatively good experience. My supervisor was very flexible given I was in school at the time. They worked with me to make sure I had enough hours and was able to balance school as well. There was decent pay every other week.
good,"I loved working for Whole Foods Market. I loved my team and the opportunities I had to advance. The pay is pretty low, especially if you've climbed up the ladder. I also hear there has been a lot of restructuring in the marketing department since I left. I would recommend working at Whole Foods Market in a variety of positions. I was a cashier, a florist and a marketing specialist and each position had its strengths and weaknesses. Overall I would say I had a great experience and I would go back to the company for the right position and salary."
good,"Great people, good managers, Great products."
good,"Very good company to work with.                                                "
good,"Staff and coworkers are friendly. fun place to work and easy to get acclimated to the job.  duties include cleaning and cooking, prepping food and reading recipes."
good,The perception of WholeFoods from the customer pain of view is much different than the perspective from the employee post of view. The customer is always at the forefront and that is noticeable from the way employees are treated in comparison.
good,I love the team work and capability of having your voice heard. Good work structure. Very comfortable to get situated and give you a great opportunity to build you skills.
good,"Overall, working at Whole Foods was a good experience. I met  lot of people whom I consider good friends to this day, just from working with them. It is a good job for someone that likes to work in customer service, and can complete multiple tasks in a timely manner."
good,"Everyday can become a bit repetitive, but is a great job to get in a groove in. I learned to keep the drive for the money I needed by working nonstop."
good,"This is a good job. Benefits are good. Pay is industry standard. Lots of perks, discounts, gift cards for a job well done. Can't really complain too much."
good,"It's retail, it's hard work, hard hours.Pay is good, benefits are great compared other retail stores. Lots of turnover, however. Fine place to work if you handle the hours. Amazon changed a lot."
good,"It was a okay job while it lasted, pay was okay could be better.  The people that work there are great the food is great . Depending on the location and management it’s was okay place to work."
good,Whole Foods is in the midst of a bunch of change. Their new OTS system is causing a lot of stress and is not working the way they want it too. A lot of empty shelves which makes me worry about the sustainability of the business. High-stress and very corporate culture.
good,fixed schedule and well paid. Good working environment and appreciated by other team members. Good team work. I learned the management and team approach as well as ways to monitor subordinates in a better ways.
good,very hard to want to move up and management is intimidating. working in my department sucked because I was alone most of the time. made you feel bad when goals aren't met.
good,Work is very fast paced and deadlines are set daily.  Team members work closely so good communication is an absolute necessity. Product quality and customer experience are the highest priority.
good,Easy going working place . Very professional. The leadership  sometimes have days but overall they’re good workers. The team members work extremely hard for customers.
good,"It was cool as long as you have cool ppl to work with. They're a little strict on the parking lot policy and attendance. Also have great benefits, I had no co-pay during doctor visits."
good,It's alright  the staff is really nice and the customers are quite different than your normal store customers.  the hours are flexible so that's a good thing.
good,working for wfm has been an incredibly rewarding experience as i have learned the challenging trade of slicing fine charcuterie meats and wiping the slicers with sanitizer solution.
good,"I would work there again in a management role. Working at the ground level was strenuous and didn't balance well with home life."
good,"I would ring out customers, I would great the customer and ask them if they found everything okay. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers everyday, especially the ones that you would get to talk to and become friends with and know them by name. Because ever since the Whole Foods in Draper shut down I see two if my customers on a regular bases at Sam's Club and I think that's really neat."
good,"Fast pace on some days"
good,"With high turnover, it seems the prepared foods department is ever-changing.  There is an overall positive atmosphere amongst staff, however it is easy to feel overwhelmed with many new company procedures and expectations being implemented throughout the store.  There are many benefits available through the company, and if interested, there are opportunities to move up within each department."
good,great place to work but couldn't get full time. cant trust everyone and have to watch what you say because not everyone is out for your best interest. enjoyed interacting with customers.
good,"Little to no communication between shifts or leadership. Employees lacked necessary skills, training, equipment. Very little actual management. Constant hostility between employees."
good,"A workers cooperative.   Training was simple and encouraged to manage yourself.  "
good,"Whole Foods market is a great company with really good benefits if you are a full time employee. Great team members "
good,"This is not a sit-down position, you'll be on your feet alot. Otherwise, good for customer service and merchandising experience, with a benefit for employee purchases."
good,The pay is out of whack. I got brought it at a certain wage then someone with similar expiration than me and a lower position is brought in at more money.
good,"I work in the front end and I feel that the team is very inclusive. I enjoy working with my team, my managers are great and I have no trouble confronting them if I have an issue."
good,"I liked working for Whole Foods but there wasn’t much room for growth at the Folsom location. I didn’t quite understand some of the scheduling methods and some of the certain roles that management would take, instead of passing that opportunity on to others for advancement."
good,Honestly it was a great place to see how people express everyday struggles and how just helping with someone finding something that was in front of there face the whole time.
good,i learned good business skills because every department is like its own little shop. very nice co-workers and fun environment. always something to do and plenty of food to eat.
good,Hours are flexible and best job to have if you lack experience. Great first job to have. Hours of operation are from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m. 7 days a week. Every department gives you freedom except customer service.
good,"Whole Foods Market is filled with wonderful employees, and some of the work can be enjoyable, but the environment is demanding without providing adequate fulfillment."
good,"The Whole Body team worked well together and everyone pulled their weight evenly. The team leader was fair and honest. If there was an issue, it was solved right away."
good,great people great people grat place to work great mangers great coworkers great food and sea food nice people good pay nice people nice people  nice people
good,"good stepping stone for those that seek experience in order picking, there room for advancement depending on production rate, the freezer and refrigerated areas not for all"
good,"I worked here before the Amazon buyout was completed so I can't speak for it now, but this was a great place to work as a college student. As I progressed in life and wanted to move up or to a different team things got a little difficult. They said they support growth within the company but it seemed only a few we're successful at this. Sometimes it seemed like they liked me as the employee I was and wanted to keep me there. On top of that, the work environment can be really stressful and if you're a hard worker people seem to take advantage of that and make you do more than you're paid to do."
good,The people I worked with were very kind and relaxed.  I felt valued as an employee working there and it was great being taught new things.  I learned a lot about produce.
good,"I’m interested in the job I currently do now such as filing papers,faxing,checking emails,I.t troubleshooting and some supervisor duties.this place allows you to grow within the company."
good,"Started out with a lot of potential, then Amazon bought out and it turned around completely. Raises are annually and when you advance that resets instead of it being based on your original hire date."
good,"Fast paced, lots of customer service skills and proper kitchen cleanliness etiquette. It was an easy going environment, the manager at the time didn't create the healthiest environment but she was rarely on the floor. I had a lot of fun learning how to bake as well as interacting with customers."
good,"The staff are friendly and the management is understanding. You get a chance to win free gift cards, and food is often supplied in the breakroom. It feels like a community there."
good,"From the moment i got there for the interview process the place was full of bright, upbeat, and dedicated people encouraging me and wishing me the best. Whole Foods Market is a great place for Students to work particularly because they are very flexible and work with you because they want you to succeed in everything you do. Great company overall."
good,"My team leader was great, and the in-shop assistant leaders were very helpful. Store management was lacking. They took a long time to process requests, and simply passed down tasks rather than assisting and providing advice."
good,The culture of the job is great. People generally enjoy working for the company. Only issue I have is that there seem to be too many cooks in the kitchen manager-wise. Can be very stressful answering to 5 managers about very mundane aspects of your job.
good,It was a good working environment. The people were friendly from my coworkers and customers up to management. I enjoyed my time with this company overall.
good,"It's good place to work, if your workmates are nice. "
good,"work starts at eight AM to five PM Monday through Friday. You wash trays, set the product up to be freeze dried, and box and stack pallets for it to be shipped. Super easy relaxed work environment"
good,"The management at WFM is terrible. They would rather have employees that say ""YES"" to everything but cannot pick up or perform the basic job functions consistently. Rather than have employees that speak up for themselves but can perform the job requirements flawlessly without help each and everyday."
good,"always wiling to train but easier go in with no knowledge clean slate. stress around the holidays and managers werent always the best. overall, its wasnt that bad of a place to work"
good,"a very fun place to work, your always busy, which is fun. the employee discount is really good to, and the opportunity for advancement is there for you if you want it."
good,"The job wasn't too difficult and I was reasonably accommodated. Most dissatisfaction with the job, other than the sick day policies , was personal issues with coworkers and favoritism."
good,"taught me professional job skills, a great work ethic, how to continuously move up in a company, decent work environment , ok pay, management ranged from awesome to mediocre"
good,"I worked at Whole Foods for two years."
good,"If you are looking for a place to meet others and learn basic things about team building and how sales operate at a grocery store, this is a good place to start. If you are looking to advance, do not go here. They do not even give base level employees the option of overtime, while leadership etc. Take up to 40+ hours or overtime! This takes from the gainshairing (a pool of extra money [labor surplus]). Leaving some with no bonus money and others with about 40 extra hours of time and a half."
good,"Specializing in coffee, working at WFM was a great place to learn about the the origins and characteristics of coffees from all over the world. With coffee being in the Specialty department I was also able to learn about other specialty foods like; cheese, olives, chocolate, etc."
good,Enjoyed my time working in this store. Staff are nice and friendly and it was a nice working environment. Offer of money off health care and PTO was a great insentive.
good,"Most employees are in high school or college and employers seem to be generally untrusting of employees. Low-drama environment and an easy job. However, employees work 6+ hours with only 15 minute (timed) breaks."
good,You get the opportunity to move up when you work hard. I started there as a cashier and through my hard work and dedication I was promoted to a supervisor within the same year.
good,This is a good place to work if you are really into the whole culture.  I was maintenance and it was a cool place to work.  My boss was fair and the pay was just ok.
good,great company to work for looking to work in a different field and expand my career  full time work benefits discounts great employees  stress free work environment
good,Working for wholefoods was a great experience lots of great people work there and the customers were awesome.In my eleven years there I loved my job and the customers.
good,Overall a lovely place but due to location I believed it was hard to properly express opinions that would lead to change. Even though this was my first grocery store experience I love customer service and was a great place to show and express that
good,"WFM offered excellent benefits for entry level work, but the base pay was not great. The company promotes (at least it did before Amazon bought it) a healthy and supportive culture."
good,"Whole foods is a great place to work for people who don't mind being flexible and having ample amount of days off. For certain departments, you are only given 19hrs per week."
good,"Good working place, very high pace, only apply if you can handle working long hour standing up and if you don't get stress out easily."
good,It's a great place to work for and grow. Although the management could improve a bit more.Team members need to be recognized more for their hard work.
good,Whole Foods has a strong culture and lives its core values on a daily basis. Store team members are highly skilled and most are foodies and/or health nuts. Regional office is understaffed.  HR is a mess.
good,"Depending on shift-"
good,There is a very welcoming atmosphere. The attendance policy is strict and has very little room for error.  Though I do really enjoy the amount of self-expression I'm allowed a work.
good,They combined multiple teams but did not compensate assistants as they should have. Created much harder positon with no compensation for harder job. Increased hours took too much toll on social life and too much added stress.
good,Love the culture and the people who work there. Very collaborative and lives up to the companies core values. Enjoy the pace of work within the marketing department. Career advancement is challenging. Good work/life balance.
good,Everyone who works at whole food is usually pretty nice. It's a very laid back work environment. Gives you a lot of freedom as well as responsibilities.
good,Work was fast paces. Had great manger but also not so great. But would consider going back. Customer at certain location were not as friendly but had some awesome customers.
good,whole foods is a place where you can end up becoming stuck in for a long time because you become comfortable with working there.  It is not a bad place you can make a career.
good,"A Typical day at work"
good,"It was a great and productive working environment, and the people that were there all had one purpose in mind which was: to get the job done. It is hard to find that kind of atmosphere in todays society but was unique and welcoming at Whole Foods."
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work.  The work atmosphere is very lively.  The benefits and employee discounts are good.  Teams and team members are actively engaged in making the store the delight that it is.
good,"▪ Providing pleasant shopping experiences for customers"
good,"it really depends which whole foods you work at and who is the store manager. the two stores i worked for were decent, managers need improving but good experience."
good,"There are worse jobs than this one, I know because I've had some of them. If your expectations are low enough, Whole Foods has a fighting chance to make you very happy."
good,"At Wholefoods, what I learned to be very important is teamwork. Without teamwork the store would crumble. We all count on each to do the job and it was great. We all got along and we all helped one another when in need. The most enjoyable part was working together because we did a better job and time went by faster. Not mention I made good friends at work."
good,"Fair and reasonable place to work. High pressure environment and very demanding. Start as early as 5am and can be working as late as 11pm or midnight. Also, overnight inventory shifts could be something you have to do."
good,gained customer service experience. the food is of quality the only thing is it can cost more then the average buy. the work environment is fun and comfortable.
good,I enjoyed my experience. I was able to learn new things and experrience an new healthier lifestyle from working there. The benefits at Whole Foods were great for my family and I. The hours were not always good because I was unable to have a work/ life balance.
good,"Working for whole foods taught me a lot about merchandising, working with perishables, ordering product, which items work within a community, how to work with a team as well as how to work independently."

good,"fast paced work with great coworkers"
good,I was afforded ample opportunities to grow within the company and find my own niche.  The company invested greatly in the professional growth of committed team members
good,"Whole foods is the leading supplier of natural and organic products on the market. They pay well and offer a lot of room for advancement. If you are looking to travel with a job, this is a good one as they have locations all over the country."
good,worked there for 3 years and got fired over a $1.50 cup of coffee that was going to get thrown out at the end of the day all because i did not fill out proper department requisition form.
good,Lots of workers don't seem to really want to be there making work draining sometimes. But higher ups are very reasonable and the work isn't stressful and coworkers tend to be really cool people.
good,"Excellent benefits. Generally decent co-workers. Management focused on meeting corporate goals exclusively. Excessive waste. Fair hours and decent compensation. Little room for advancement without ""knowing"" people."
good,there's a friendly staff. you get to interact with great customers daily. pay is sufficient. great medical and dental coverage. the work is straight forward and easy.
good,"The company itself was a good company, but I've seen has changed since I worked there. No uniforms was a huge plus and we used to have pretty good perks. We had a 20% discount as employees."

good,love to work at wholefoods with good benefits but too bad now they dont give me a chance to continue to work for them anymore  there now so sad tho. i wanted to go back again to workd at wholefoods in las vegas if they will give me a chance here .
good,"A typical day at work would include helping customers with questions, ringing up orders, and providing customer service."
good,"I am indoctrinated into researching the epigenetic-underpinnings of behavioral evolution, and nutrition is one of the primary components of understanding this lineage. Coming into this job, I already had a good background on raw foods and the products they sold, for supplementing and nutritionally taking care of the body. I fit in well with the customers, while reinvigorating the environment for my coworkers; we were all like a family, helping and complimenting each other along the way. There were some issues with management, a slight dissonance between their well-being in the idea of their positions. Regardless, I know this isn't the company's mission and varies from store to store. I do recommend working here if you'd like to expand your knowledge toward healthier alternatives to life and to meet progressive like-minded people who are unique as they are diverse - always more to learn and take in."
good,"This is a great job if you enjoy customer service and thrive on being busy. There is always something for you to do or someone to help. Overall, great experience."
good,Whole foods is a good company. The work environment is one of the best I have ever worked at. The benefits were amazing. I would definitely consider working for that company again.
good,You come to work everyday feeling like you aren't really working. I had limited knowledge of organic and healthy foods prior to getting the job but it was exciting to learn about the company as they are more than just a supermarket
good,"The company has a good foundation. I really think that what the business stands for is an incredible asset to all employed there and the community each store is in. Unfortunately, there is often an immense pressure to meet certain standards, and this counteracts their good intentions as a company."
good,Good sense of community. Able to try new products and learn a lot about food products. Discount on any purchases made in store.
good,the workplace here was amazing. everyone was nice it was like family. good place to work. from the managers to cashiers everyone is genuine
good,"As someone who lives a healthy life style, Fresh Thyme Whole foods Grocery Store is nice because you get a discount on the wide variety of healthy food they have. There are multiple departments so you can be crossed trained in order to work a full forty hour week."
good,"Fast-paced work environment with many locations standing and more to come in the near future. Good company with excellent benefits, a very good company for anyone new to the workforce."
good,"Generally I would be in charge of pizza making and customer service. Other tasks would include cleaning up counter space, maintaining proper quality standards for the foods that we prepared and cleaning up at the end of the night."
good,Always a learning experience. More knowledgable on organic and natural foods and supplements. Meeting people from all walks of life.
good,"A fast pace is required to keep up with the changing demand of Seafood. My crew is well managed. Preparations for holidays and televised sporting events made some days longer then most. Learning is a must, and the formula used when i worked with management or vendor was hands on. Short order style cooking and Prep. Custom orders along with bar service create fun new challenges almost daily."
good,"Whole Foods Market is very different than it was when I started 7 years ago.  Competition from all angles has caused us to really have to be on our A-game at every single second, evolve, change courses, and push through.  This has cause much of the company's culture and uniqueness to be compromised, but at the core it is still the same amazing organization."
good,"I liked working there, but it depended on who your manager was. The people around me were great, but the company is changing and restructuring a lot and it isn't really the same."
good,"Whole Foods is a mission driven company that sell natural and organic food.  Started in Austin, Texas it now has stores nationwide and in Canada, and the U.K."

good,I really liked working at Whole Foods. I think the culture has changed since I worked there but I had some really good times while I was there and am still friends with those who work there. I often think about coming back.
good,"Decent place to work, People are great, business is iffy based off the recent lay offs. You get to work with a lot of different types of people. the management is good."

good,"As ATL my duties included, proper scheduling and financial movement, team member development and ordering as well as merchandising product."
good,It is hard to get noticed for hard work unless you know someone.  Which is the best way to get in.  Good benefits and you will learn a lot.  Company looks at ideas to move ahead.
good,Could not have asked for a more relaxed atmosphere. Team members are great and leadership will encourage you to grow. Would recommend to anyone looking for full time or part time.
good,"The company prides it's self on taking care of it's team members and giving back to the comunity, and it does take care of it's team members and we have great benifits. But that seems to have taken a back seat when the company's stock dropped a bit. they started cutting positions and giving leadership less support to do their job. I have seen coorperate agendas pushed over the core values the company claim to run on."
good,"First and foremost cleanliness and food safety are key. "
good,"great part time job working with friendly and helpful team members, besides the repetition and mindlessness involved on some slow days."
good,"Sysadmin, usually assignments via tickets and change control. Consisting of user admin and software installation. I also work storage and have a increasing request quota of additional space. work environment is pretty staid, but the work life balance is great."
good,"the most enjoyable part of a cashier position is providing a high level of customer service. What i learned most about this job is answering product questions with up to date knowledge of sales, and in store promoti"
good,"I found there to be an unlimited amount of opportunities to grow and advance within WFM. My career here has allowed me to be the leader I'd always wanted. Its an environment where the doors are open, you just have to grab the reigns and use the resources available to you."
good,"awesome company, recent restructure has been a bit shaky, flexible hours, short staffed sometimes and there is a high turn over rate but not as high as usual retail"
good,Whole Foods Market is a publicly traded company.  Accounting is on 13 period 4 week close calendar.  Oracle (PeopleSoft) accounting software.

good,"Learned how to Screen and direct phone calls and visitors as appropriate; Collected and processed customer transactions (credit, cash, check, etc);"
good,Ive worked at multiple locations and it really depends on where you work. The co-workers are diverse and amazing despite usually being understaffed. Its a great place to work for if the management is right.
good,"I have worked in different departments and had fun. I did work as a cashier for a year, but needed to learn more so I went to seafood, were I had gain a lot of skills. I also worked in The café and meat but overall I enjoy working in the café more. I have learned to make so many different drinks, and the interaction with customers were the best."

good,"Many learning situations, especially concerning peoples health."

good,"Was responsible for prepping for all stations like were located in a our prepared foods department and worked on the line for the different stations that we had including (Pizza station, Sandwich station and the Bistro). Was also responsible for training all the new employees that were brought on."
good,"I began Whole Foods loving the company and my job with food. I work in the Prep Foods department of the store, so dealing with the cold cuts, pizza, burrito, chef case, hot food, salad bar, soup bar, and rotisserie sections. I specifically work the front of the house, so if the customers have any concerns, I am the first person they bring it to. Many of the customers are fine, but many are very particular of their food. some expect service as soon as possible, but get upset even though there's a line of customers ahead of them. You have managers breathing down your neck so any slip up is noticed. Not a very good job if unless you like smelling like onions at the end of the day and enjoy not feeling appreciated for your job from both customers and managers."
good,"Whole foods market did a good job of hiring great people, but the last few months they fired a lot of these good people. So I think Whole foods is like every other greedy corporation."
good,helping people with decisions on what to purchase for better health and vitality. Every one should work there at least for a short amount of time.
good,They know how to treat their employees and the discounts help alot if you shop there. I worked the front end and most people liked working that position. I know that all the other departments are great too as everyone in the store always seemed to be happy with everything.

good,Love the environment from the team members to the customers. It has helped me grow through my time at the company and I have thoroughly enjoyed working for Whole Foods Market.
good,Great Company with lots of room for growth. wonderful leadership and knowledgeable team members. Provides the community an healthy option and promotes health throughout the world. The best job i have ever had.
good,Whole Foods Market is pretty amazing grocery store. Work life is pretty basic depending on department and position. Customer service is crucial in this company and the management is reasonable and understandable on majority of problems.
good,"Taking the initiative to bringing people to my lane, providing excellent customer service. I have learned that working fast is not the best way because we can miss the opportunity to make customers have a great experience. Same thing goes with working to slow it will create a terrible customer experience. I moved up from Cashier to Customer service Supervisor in 4 months of working with this Company, I am a team player with co-workers and making sure that I am able to help anyway possible. Hardest part of job was dealing with customers that were always trying to steal and take advantage of the return policy. The most enjoyable part of Job was just dealing with the customers who were just great people that I saw and served everyday. I had a fan base of Customers who loved me because of my personality, and they would sometimes wait until my Lane is free, so that they can check out with me. Also, I enjoyed being the Number One Fund Raiser for the Whole Planet Foundation in the entire nation."
good,"Everyday I would learn something new. To learning how to bake something to how to decorate cakes, cupcakes, etc. I would also learn the importance of eating and maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
good,"Customer service is a must"
good,Another busy and sometimes stressful environment. But what can you expect from a kitchen. The benefits are great and you are constantly encouraged to interact with customers.
good,"Managing employees and creating operations to have the team run smoothly is the largest part of the job.  From daily production, to administrative duties, to keeping track of inventory and sales the days are filled with plenty to do."
good,"-Recruit, hire, train, and develop a team of 7 team members to achieve daily, weekly, and monthly sales goals."
good,Laid back environment with good company core values. The culture of the company is upheld by its leadership and training. Micromanaging i frowned upon in this company and team members are treated as equals.
good,"I learned a lot about costumer service here, more than any other jobs I've had. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the difficult costumers. But this job has taught me how to deal with them with no problem."
good,Whole foods is amazing you become a family with employees and customers. Everybody is nice and its busy theres always something to do.
good,"Great benefits, great education , great people to work with . Good working conditions, very competitive pay and benefits!"
good,Good place to be if this is the environment that you like. it is not for everyone but I think it could be beneficial to anyone.
good,A good place to work. The company was run in a manner that I would consider non traditional. but if you could deal witht the culture it ca be a fun place to work. eccentric is the word i would use to best describe the company. Not good or bad just different.

good,nice work environment not a lot of growth potential. the work load is nice and i would work with them again. good company. good work schedule
good,"I very much enjoyed my time at WFM. While it was, at times, frustratingly disorganized, I would work there again. They really look out for their employees and pay them well. We received new non-slip shoes from the company every year and a raise once a year. I learned a good bit about the food and was able to go to college for pastry and baking while I worked there full time."
good,The hours change every week but seeing a customer's smile is worth it. Working customer service is demanding but it helps get the customer the satisfaction that they deserve
good,"A typical work day was fun and enjoyable as long as no one called in sick and everyone did there part. I learned a lot about the company, the products we carried and where they came from. Management was good, but not great. Things seemed to fall through the cracks a little too much. Most co-workers were fun to work with. They had knowledge of what they were doing. Hard workers seemed to get punished for little errors while the ones that didn't care and did not want to work got no punishment. The hardest part of the job was keeping the customers happy because while we are in a drought, it was hard to keep all local grass fed items in stock because they were just not available. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing team members from other departments because everyone was so friendly. Smoking meats was also a great part of the job for me because i love doing it."
good,"Whole Foods Market is in essence an excellent company. They treat their customers with ample respect and their employees with somewhat the same mindset. In the last months with the company, I have learned much more about the food than ever. However, I crave different means of living."
good,"Friendly work environment"
good,"A company that promotes wellness and health to its customers and employees. Plenty of opportunities to move up the company ladder, alongside countless job options across the country."
good,"A typical day at Whole Foods involves making sure the chef's case is full of salads and other products. If something is low, then I need to go grab or make more. If there isn't any more then I need to find something else to put in the case so there are no holes. Most of my day is spent helping customers, serving salads or slicing deli meat.cheese. My coworkers are wonderful to work with, they're very easy to communicate with and we all work well together. If there is any confusion about anything, I feel comfortable asking for help or clarification. The hardest part of the job is keeping up energy when talking to customers especially when it's busy and people are in a rush. At the same time, the most enjoyable part is talking to customers and knowing that I helped them."
good,Whole Foods has been a great place to work over the last 10 years I have learned a great deal with the help and guidance of a very strong leadership and room to grow and develop
good,A great place to work while doing amazing work for the community  and the environment. Management is helpful and insightful with career growth.

good,Great starting pay; detail oriented work sure to keep you busy. Plenty of opportunities to advance and become involved.
good,"Maintained high standards of customer service during high-volume, fast paced operations."
good,This is a great company to work for.  Hince the reason why I re-applied.  You can definietly learn about business and there are many ways to advance and move up.
good,"A typical day at Whole Foods Market is clocking In at the time clock for your shift. Then checking in with a supervisor to see what your duties are for the day. Giving great customer service. Making sure they are happy with there shopping experience. Doing service outs, checking prices, offering sales through the week/ one day sales are all great steps to management. Co-workers are a huge part to the customer service team. Simply asking for help from another team member is always a great choice. Team members are always willing to lend a hand. I would say a challenging part of this job is getting  familiar with produce codes (PLU). Having to memorize over 100 codes can take some time. The most enjoyable part of this job is my team member discount card."
good,Working for Whole Foods Market has been an enjoyable and beneficial experience. I have learned great multi-tasking and customer service skills at the company. Whole Foods Market is a welcoming and positive working environment.
good,"I found that while working for this company there is a lot of room for growth and success, if you would like to pursue a career at a grocery store. I like what I do currently, but I feel there is more to life, hence why I went to school. This company is all about the people you work with and there must be good leadership/role models to follow. I would rate it 8/10, but I would like to find another area of work."
good,"client service based with grocery and natural products, you have the power to make the success in the company otherwise you are not growing in the company."
good,"Whole Foods is an excellent company that proves businesses can be successful by treating their workers, customers, communities, and the larger world with respect and dignity."
good,"I enjoyed my time at whole foods market. I learned a lot about the products, and what whole foods market was about.There is nothing i would change about my time spent here"
good,"Very busy from the moment i arrive to when i leave, constantly on the go. Making smoothies and juices all day long. Learned about some coffees, didnt know about instant coffee and was able to learn about that. Learning how to roast our coffee beans. Management wasnt very professional, didnt talk to their employees with repsect whatsoever. My co-workers were amazing, always helpful, smiling and a team player. Hardest part of my job was knowing every coffee we had stocked. I really enjoyed interacting with all my customers regardless how busy we were. Making sure they were satisfied with their drinks was what i aimed for."
good,"A typical day is their not being able to plan out your day because it changes as soon as you hit the door. I was a manager for WF and was constantly being pulled in many directions to put out ""fires"". upper management (above store level - 5 people essentially) were constantly coming up with last minute gimmicks to increase sales or promote some cause. In my position I was responsible to communicate and sell these changes to my team members. It's exhausting for myself and to the tm's to constantly be bombarded with things we were required to learn. (including giving tms homework) I was embarrassed by what we were required to ask of our tm's. The Kool-Aid was force fed. "
good,Customer Service in food service production & supervise a team of 7 to 14 tam members at a time. Always keep a positive attitude to maintain customer satisfaction.
good,Maintain a cash register. Assist customers with any sales questions. Properly handle a cash draw. co workers are very nosey. stay to yourself and dont make your business public. no there is your friend.
good,"It is nice to go to a job you enjoy. A typical day consists of producing myriad recipes to meet the needs of our guests."
good,"The different crazy hours sucks. The management could be way better, well in my department at least. Starts off with $11 an hour which is way more than the minimum wage in NY."
good,The company treats you right.  You are treated like an adult and provided good benefits if you are a full time employee.  Staff and coworkers are friendly and say hi to you.
good,I have been with the company for over 12 years. I have learned so much about health and supplement. Would definitely recommend others to work for Whole Foods. The atmosphere is always fun and exciting and always busy
good,I enjoy it greatly.  The work day is never the same.  Fellow team members and leadership are outstanding.  So glad I took a position with this company.  It was the best career decision I have ever made.
good,"Great team members, great benefits, and fun working environment.  The company also likes to recruit within which allows a lot of growth for team members nationally and even globally.  "
good,I enjoyed working at Whole Foods Market very much.  It is an uptempo work pace while still embracing the day to day tasks.  Many people I worked with maintained great work ethic while still having a diligent approach to the daily tasks within bakery department.  Working for Whole Foods also provides essential benefits i.e employee discount
good,"long hard non-stop working but great workout, I learned how to lift and move furniture the smart way not the hard way, and the manager was a great guy he got dirty and worked like one of the guys, my co-workers there welcomed me with open arms, and made sure I mentally stable to work the job required, hardest part was loading and unloading heavy furniture, and most enjoyable was when I was able to drive the moving truck."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great company to work for. I specifically enjoy the people i work with but with any retail position the customers can be and are challenging. I've learned great patience and people skills working here. the customers have become accustomed to being ""glorified"" and aren't very receptive to hearing ""no"" and not getting their way. Some shifts it is a constant battle to have a good day for the simple fact that i do my job based on how i was trained and not on what the customer wants for free."
good,"this is a good place to work at with a good amount of great people, i have learned a lot my three years working for this company.  it can teach you many different things about different lifestyles."
good,A very friendly environment not to mention a lot of room to grow if you want to get involved in the grocery industry.
good,"Amazing co-workers and a fun place to work in. The organisation which has stores in mostly London and one in Scotland + one in Cheltenham is going through a restructuring."
good,"Retail is an excellent training opportunity, especially Whole Foods, which is a ripe environment with its transparency, peer training, and promotions from within culture."
good,great place to work / shop for healthy foods also get to help the customers on a daily basis
good,I love the customers and the coworkers. They make it a lot of fun.
good,"fats-paced workplace. stock floors, greet and assist customers. strict safety/sanitary procedures."
good,"Whole Foods is an exciting work environment filled with interesting coworker and customer interaction. As a worker, you are constantly surrounded by delicious and healthy foods."
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods.  The benefits were incredible, the team members were amazing and the atmosphere is very different from your regular grocery store.  But when they would pay raise all the new people, they wouldn't grandfather everyone in, so the people doing twice the work would not get compensated for their hard work.  It also meant that people who slacked off were getting a free raise to do nothing.  "
good,Since it is a grocery store and I do work only weekends so it is always very busy in weekends and time run so fast.
good,"for this job you must be on your toes from start to finish, keeps you in shape but sometimes could be overwhelming and stressful due to longs hours, and seasonal demands"
good,"Great Management, Great Benefits, Great Atmosphere,"
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work!  Fun atmosphere and everyone who works there is awesome.  Very dynamic.
good,One of the best place to work for. A relaxing environment professional environment and very relaxing place to work
good,it was good but at the time i was hired they didn't train me and kind of disrespected me
good,Whole foods was a fast-paced grocery store.  You never had to stand around waiting for someone to need your assistance.  My direct manager was always clear about what he expected from all of us and was always eager to praise if the job was done right.  My co workers were for the most part great to work with.
good,"The job in the produce team is good, if you like to work by yourself you cut and re arrange the shelves to keep everything neat. The schedule for part time employees is 8 hours if you are new be ready to work the closing shifts n the weekends."
good,Felt like a member of the team as soon as I began working at the company. Everyone is helpful and friendly
good,One of the best place to work.New challenges every day. well benefits are available for employees and over all great company.
good,"typical day can be fun filled and exciting.  You get to learn about healthier living through the foods you eat and pass that knowledge to customers.  It can be a fast pace place to work but the people are friendly and knowledgeable.  The hardest part of working there is probably picking the right department for you.  The most enjoyable part of working there is the customers, from the regular every day people to the rich and famous."
good,It was a good experience. The company is good to their employees.
good,What I enjoyed about working for Whole Foods Market is the positive energy.There was a lot of team player attitude from the staff. There was constant movement. Always busy which made the position exciting to be apart of.
good,"Over my past 6+ years with Whole Foods Market, I have undertaken many challenges, grown my skill set as a marketing and social media strategist, and been given the opportunity to connect with the Los Angeles community on a much deeper level that goes beyond only groceries. This job most closely integrates my beliefs and who I am as a person with day to day tasks. Difficulties faced now include a lack of growth and challenges to learn different facets of business, which is a strong desire of mine."
good,"I managed inventory, organizing product on the store floor, and handled money at the register. I helped customers find what item they are looking for in the store and offered them a great shopping experience. I made sure customer was satisfied as to guaranteeing they would retur"
good,"I really enjoyed my time spent at Whole Foods, however, it was short lived due to my moving to another state. As a cashier, the shifts were fast paced and went by quickly."
good,Great atmosphere and cool people who work and shop there! Highly recommend.
good,I had six Sales Reps that I took care of and I enjoyed everything about this job.  At the time I had this job I just wanted the one on one with customers.
good,There were flexible work hours and it was a great environment to work in.
good,"A typical day involved many different tasks. On any given day I could be working in the kitchen, spending time in meetings, counseling team members. I learned a lot about how to deal with many different people and different attitudes. I loved many of the people who worked in my department. But the STRESS level was high every day with little room for error. The best part was working in the kitchen. Food is my love!"
good,"Fast-paced, boisterous retail environment that demands prioritization, time management, and attention to detail. Customer service draws heavily on one's ability to be patient and empathetic even when it is difficult--not for the short-tempered or easily insulted. Store culture values independent problem-solving and taking initiative. Loose leadership structure with frequent opportunities to advance. Benefits are the best you can get in a retail setting, including 401k, stock options, and HCSA. Heavy focus on team-building and mentorship embedded in company policy despite high-turnover nature of retail. Pride of being company's #1 store undergirds everything it does."
good,It is not the worst place to work. In the beginning it was an exciting place to work but later with different management; it became really hard to work there.
good,"Good job allot of room for advancement, the work was easy. the hardest part was the schedule"
good,Responsible for Operating various heavy equipment. Unload provisions quickly and accurately so that temperatures are safely maintained. Inventory each truck carefully to minimize loss and monitor for damaged parcels.
good,Every morning I arrive at 5 am and prepare and present foods for guests before the store opens. I set up a food case (refrigerator) before the store opens. The rest of the day is compiled of preparing food and cleaning duties. The hardest part of the job is how labor-intensive it is. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the in-store discount.
good,"Whole Foods Market nurtures creativity and guides you to harness that energy to work with what your are passionate about whether it is learning about working the bakery machinery, to cake decorating, creating new and exciting cupcake flavors, or to creating espressos. The ability to have that freedom and responsibility makes it a fun environment to be in.  The people are also stellar parts of keeping morale.  It also certainly does not hurt for Whole Foods to keep appreciating their employees in a yearly Team Member Appreciation Week, where for a whole week, Store Team Leaders decide what to freely do or give to employees as a ""thank you"" for their hard work (free cupcakes, steak BBQ, t-shirts, gelato, massages, and additional employee discounts to name a few)."
good,Whole Foods is a great company to work for they are very flexible with scheduling and have great benefits and perks.
good,This is a good company to work for however that doesn't always mean that management will be good.
good,Cashed in each customer bagged and packed their grocery. Learned  about interesting foods.
good,I loved working for Whole Foods Market. The company is very catered to the satisfaction and attention to their employees and that's reflected towards the customers.
good,"A typical day in my role as Marketing Team Leader is hard to explain! Due to the nature of the position there is never enough time in the day to get everything done! As a Marketing Team Leader I am responsible for all aspects of the store's social media, PR, events, donation request and advertising. I am also responsible for managing the entire marketing team that is comprised of a chef, Healthy Eating/Green Mission specialist, 2 Demo Specialists and 2 graphic artists. In this role I have learned invaluable communication skills, team management and organizational techniques. I have also enjoyed getting to learn more about the natural and organic food industry. Everyday there is new information to absorb and continues to broaden my knowledge. I truly enjoy being able to get back to the community and help those that are less fortunate through our monthly donation budget."
good,• Packed sea foods and printed labels
good,"Whole Foods was a good company to work for, and value their empoyees."
good,My typical work day included daily cash balancing at the beginning and end of every shift. Checking out customers and helping them with any and all needs.
good,"Order, receive products. Work closely with other departments managers. Help to select products for customers with different nutritional requirements. Hire, supervise and direct employees."
good,"Associate Shop & Delivery team member oversee the timely communication (phone and e-mail) setup and completion of all shop and deliveries for customers.Consistently communicate with team through multiple media so task and responsibilities are completed. Train, mentor, and observed fellow team members throughout the day. Create positive and lasting relationships with customers and fellow team members. Monitored and managed a team during periods of high volume and sales. Engaged and promoted the Chicago community by emphasizing local products and charities."
good,"whole foods is a fine establishment, I learned something new daily"
good,Lots of opportunity to learn and the fellow employees are great. Management will promise you the world and give you a crumb. Never board at this job and plenty of challenges.
good,The day was always long and busy. I learned a lot about organic products. The management team was always on stand by when you needed them. My co-workers were helpful always ready to lend a hand. The hardest part of the job was keeping the customers happy.
good,I come in and get straight to work stalking shelves and costumer service. I learned about a lot of different health foods i never new about. Management was very nice but made sure you always gave your best. My co workers were very fun and friendly. There wasn't really anything hard about this job. the most enjoyable part would be seeing different costumers every day which made it seem not that same every day.
good,Whole Foods Maine is a great place to work! The team there is great
good,DOCK AND FORKLIFT OPERATOR / TRAINER – Responsibilities include:
good,"Learned about produce department, had fruits and vegetables I have never even heard of. Great work atmosphere."
good,"WFM has a terrific work atmosphere, I fronted shelves, stocked product and ordered several product lines"
good,"There are few places more fun to work than a grocery store. Being a part of a store like this - where, depending on the location, the customers' needs are truly what the employees have at heart."
good,Easy to become complacent. Staff diversity provides interesting environment to work in. Learning to cook and about various aspects of food and general health has been enjoyable.
good,I have learned all about natural and organic foods. I enjoy working with the people and the management. You work as a team and everyone is give the opportunity to succeed.
good,"WFM has a huge commitment to their customers, the quality of their product and maintaining good organics."
good,"Whole Foods Market of the NE Region has been, and continues to be, an extraordinary experience in the world of culinary arts. The opportunities to work with talented chefs, premium products, and strong teams is endless. As a professional cook , it is by far an amazing experience"
good,"Fresh Whole Market was a very fun place to work ,Everyone got alone great and everyone was a team player .I recommend anyone to join there team. Its every excited and fun place to work to can even try there sample they have out there on the floor. But overall very excited place to work .."
good,"Felt a sense of community as a store, like the company's ethics and practices. Stressful at times with endless lines (but this was specific to my store). Helpful and caring supervisors."
good,"I advanced 3 positions in under 2 years, with the opportunity for further advancement. I left because I disagreed with lying to customers about composting and recycling. That's store to store though. Otherwise, I loved my team like family and felt very supported."
good,Worked  hard to make sure floor was full of product and guests were helped in a timely matter.  Workplace culture was very diverse and company policies were focused on non-discrimination.
good,"flexible scheduling, opportunity to advance within the company, good compensation, available certifications, positive workplace culture, team member appreciation week"
good,The store/corporate culture has changed a lot since I quit working here. Love the company’s commitment to the environment and local growers.  And how they provide an education to the general public on the benefits of eating ‘clean food’. Pay could be higher and benefits and jobs have been cut since Amazon took over.
good,"I worked for WFM when they were not owned by Amazon so I am not sure how the management is now but it was terrible when I worked there. The managers which are the Associate Store Leader and the Store Leader were pressed over the limit to make sales quota which meant that they would almost harass all departments to make sales quota. However, it was a fun job with a super relaxed atmosphere. They offer leadership courses and certifications and also a huge room for growth within the company. By the second year I was there, I was a buyer and also a travelling representative who opened up several stores all around Texas. I would go back to this job, it was that much fun. The benefits and pay were really good as well."
good,"The company is customer service heavy so they force you to interact ."
good,"Work schedule is a nightmare. Changes constantly and hard to have a steady schedule. It is done by computer and based on business need, without regard for staff needs or preferences."
good,"It's a good environment, the pay isn't enough to live on however. You may need a second job. As with any job there are good people to work with and negative ones as well."
good,"No comments at this time, still evaluating my position and my views and opinions. Because my time here is still continuously changing and not always good or bad. So, thats why I'm still uncertain about my views and wish not to express them at this time."
good,"Fast based work environment, high level of responsibility."
good,working there is great but management have an office mentality (if that makes sense) putting more emphasis on the paperwork and rotas than the job itself unfortunately its the regular employees that tend to pick up the slack.
good,"I personally learned many basic things at Wholefoods,and that's why I always feel as if it is my second home. I worked with many different people and did many tasks as a team member. There is usually a good team work between its members."
good,"I loved my job and had a few great coworkers...don't like some policies they have taken away from employees for advancement from pt to ft but hey it happens it's a large company....overall though a great place to work and I had very few issues here, great pay and benefits are available to everyone not just ft employees"
good,"The company, at the store level, is full of wonderful, talented, caring individuals from the cashiers to the store managers.  Beyond that, the corporate structure is out of touch with customers and team members, focused on image over profits, and completely uncaring about the stripped benefits as the company has expanded.  If you can deal with the bureaucratic nonsense of the corporate side, its a wonderful place to spend 40 hours a week."
good,"It was great. People were nice, HR was accommodating, Fast speed, and always busy, so it made the day go by fast. I had to leave the job rather abruptly because of a personal emergency and I'm just sad I wasn't able to give a 2 week notice."
good,"A fine, upstanding company that is passionate about their customers and their ideals. "
good,"Good job. What really makes the job is the people you work with. Raises are not easy to come by. Definitely have to ""pay your dues"" if you're looking to advance."
good,"easy working grocery store. good discount card offers higher discount incentive to improve ones health"
good,"Whole foods has great policies and benefits, but general management was lacking and majority of important maintenance tasks were left uncompleted for extended periods of time."
good,Its niece environment very friendly co worker and kind ATL's. With some snacks and special events which any can earn price. But never that I get any that includes the Lady that I like...Man I got dump .... Guess maybe Im not good enough... O well thats why I leave Wholefoods. Seems no roomA Small.Dark and forget like me
good,A place to grow and interact with all different types of team members and customers. Able to branch out and join different teams/add new responsibilities.
good,"great place and great people , some upper management and need to go , they are stuck in the old ways of business  thinking . over all great company and culture"
good,"My store has a really great vibe. Everyone is very cool so it makes the days go by smoothly. Without open availability, the hours and probability of advancement are slim."
good,"Go in and talk to my supervisors and get my work post to start the day. After 3-4 hours I receive my break. Come back from break, speak with my supervisor again and return to my work station. At the end of my shift the supervisor comes over or calls the station phone and let me know that I'm able to go home for the day."
good,"Stressful environment with little management help, but colleagues made it pleasant to work there. High intensity customer. Receiving no tips was the worst part about the job."
good,"Can be the type of environment you can grow and advance in, has taken a step back since amazon . The overall work culture is very customer focused over employee."
good,I got stuck with a team leader who doesn’t carry his weight in the department which can make it tough on anyone.  Not saying they are all like that because they aren’t.  The people are great to work with but it can get stressful with the work load at certain points
good,Lets just say they will make sure there mangers are always in the right and the can do no wrong. If you are as regular employee and you have trouble with your manager you will always be in the wrong. Other then that the work environment is nice and pretty straight forward.
good,"Overall, my experience at Whole Foods has been good. I learned how to deal with stressful situations and find solutions to the problem. Also learned about certain diets and ingredients"
good,"Good place to work. Pays well for an entry level position, and the company prefers to promote from within rather than hire outside people so there are opportunities for promotion. Culture at the stores in my area is toxic in that employees are kept on simply because they have worked there for 10+ years, despite not doing their jobs and simply collecting paychecks. Management has reached the point where they dont care too much, and depending on your level and position, expect you to give your life to the job. Overall, good pay for moderate responsibility, room for promotion, but can be a toxic work environment regarding management and older team members."
good,It was a ok place to work depending on the management. Team members are always great to work. There was always favoritisms coming from management. The company is and will always be about who you know.
good,I enjoyed the culture and festive atmosphere at Whole Foods Market. There are many opportunities within the company. Unfortunately due to my hard work ethic I was pulled into running the cash register more and more often while better positions were rewarded to individuals that received complaints so that they could be taken off the sales floor.
good,Hardest part of my job is the fast pace and paper work involved. There are days that all is well and smooth!!!! Then you have times that there is not enough staff and you have to multitask like crazy!!!!
good,"Whole Foods Market had a great store leader, but the head of customer service left something to be desired. There was drama between the younger members of the team. I learned many produce codes."
good,"Prepared foods is a fast paced, plenty to do department. There is no time to lean. Always something to do. You get your two 15 minute breaks and half hour for lunch which you are encouraged to take. Setting up the chef's case in the early morning , checking dates getting rid of all outdated product. The day goes very fast."
good,"I enjoyed working at Whole Foods, but I was disappointed in the lack of hours I was receiving weekly. The high pay does not make up for the lack of hours."
good,Wholefoods is a great place to work if you are a student and or gaining customer service experience. I do not recommend anyone to stay there and make a career out of it.
good,A fun really fun place to work. good coworkers. strict with company policies. not everyone pulls there weight.  lots of new products to try. disorganized at times. customers are very picky
good,Productive exciting place to work. In the customers like to learn about new products and you will learn a lot from the customers about the products. If you never knew nothing about me going food shopping there you will learn a lot.
good,Lots of work and a decent place to begin your career. Gratifying place to grow and enjoy working late nights and weekends. Holiday's are the best since you can work on them.
good,I enjoyed working at Whole Foods because the team was awesome and it provided an awesome place for me to grow. They were great to work for. Whole Foods is cultural and dependable. Respected.
good,"standing for 8hrs a day, lifting heavy objects can be hard on the body. Culture can be competitive but fun. Work life balance can fall to the wayside, but if you make the effort to let management know about things in a timely manner, they try to help you when they can."
good,"On a typical day, I punch in with fellow Team Members while chatting happily and walk  to my department where I am greeted warmly. I have learned many new skills while working in a professional and industrial kitchen. I love my discount on food and the flexible schedule as I am a student. The hardest part was the understaffing- I have worked in Whole Foods for over a year and the management never seems to schedule a reasonable amount of  people in a busy department, especially on weekends. I found the amount of understaffed shifts frustrating and I felt overwhelmed at times but the Team Members present were always happy to help out others. The people I worked with were definitely the most enjoyable aspect of working at Whole Foods Market."
good,"I would not return to this company as they are not what they used to be when I started there. Amazon has changed everything Some say its good ,most say its Bad . Most of my friends left the company or were let go or replaced."
good,"Whole Foods provides a decent atmosphere to work and encourages growth among Team members company wide. They offer multiple avenues to pursue a lifelong career"
good,"-The coworkers are very nice and helpful "
good,Typically working for this place was really much great. Customers were difficult at times especially when other coworkers would call out. Team became more reliable with some changes
good,All around a good company if your motivated and worth of value. Excellent to work in. But quick to be replaced . Don’t get too cozy there expectations are excessive but will take care of you if you do your part. I guess that’s fair :)
good,Nice people to work with and nice customer base. Having children they schedule me so I can do parenting responsibilities. Good communication between managers and staff. Job is very close to home.
good,"I have met, and worked with, many wonderful people at this company. My positions at this company, over the years, have provided me with many learning opportunities and have made it possible for me to move up through the company."
good,relaxed envitonment to work an be at.good pay for employe with occussenal bonus.good product to sell and buy.great custumer service to customers.good managemant of employe
good,"Fast pace."
good,I enjoyed whole foods and the culture. The people inthe store and the products they sell are all great. Its clean organized. Wholefoods is a great place to work.
good,I really enjoyed the people and the atmosphere. I made some great friends and really enjoyed learning about new things. If there’s a new product they really encourage you trying it as a sample just so you can give an honest opinion on the product. The pay is decent but advancement is the only downside. If you are not one of the favorites that suck up to leadership you get denied any advancement.
good,They give you good working ethics and a balanced lifestyle if you go to school. they are flexible with their hours and give good pay for how much work they give you.
good,The stress on customer service is the motivational backbone for the company. The personable employees make this workplace incredibly lively and friendly. Overall an impressively wonderful place to work.
good,"Enjoyed my time there, people were great. There were times when organization got in its own way to succeed. Would recommend this company as a good place to hone your craft."
good,I love working at Whole Foods but it is hard work and exhausting. Working in prepared foods burns you out. Customers can either be grateful or the worst people you have ever met.The  Amazon take over is changing the vibe of the store
good,I liked this company. they worked with me to make sure I could still be a student as well as an employee. My TL made sure none of my schedules overlapped. There is not a lot of job security though.
good,"My experience at Whole Foods was very positive. All of my co-workers had great attitudes and which made the environment relaxed and collaborative. The schedule would be unpredictable at times, but for someone with full availability and flexible hours it is not a problem."
good,It depends on your management  but a lot of room to grow just too many personalities so there’s a lot  of bosses & wanna be bosses to deal with ......
good,"Overall a great culture, particularly for a large corporation, but some huge shifts are happening (and need to happen) with seemingly not enough work done as far as change management."
good,"Over the years, Whole Foods has gone from a great company to a micromanaging, lackluster company. Mission and company culture are dying off. I see so many good people leaving the company and they are not able to hire good people that have experience and passion. It's sad to see the decline over the years."
good,"Fun workplace, but scheduling tends to be unreliable. Not recommended for anyone who needs consistency in their life. Management is fair, but raises are rare."
good,to the point work environment that is fun when time for it. we keep to a high standard of quality products for our customers to choose from. Customer service is a high priority for whole foods as we would like to provide an enjoyable experience to all our customers.
good,"It has been a learning experience, working for Whole Foods Market for the past 12 years.  For the first few years, ""ultimate customer service"" was paramount, and employees were happy to comply.  More recently,"
good,"Whole Foods Market is a fast paced, sometimes stressful environment. There is favoritism in the workplace but leadership will work with you on majority of things including schedule. You can get really invested in the work environment."
good,"When new management comes to work at Santa Fe, usually want to impress to regional and global levels and one of the most common ways is to kind of clear the house with employees that have worked for over 7 years at the store and clear some labor to meet budget goals and that is bad."
good,"It gets old somewhat quickly (within a year or so), fun place to be in the beginning. The customers are alright as with any customer service job and you get to know many. The management at both whole foods I worked at are fairly cliquey and somewhat difficult to work with."
good,"I really enjoy working at WholeFoods because the people are so accepting, and its easy to be a part of the WF family. The perks of working there is overwhelming in a good way."
good,"I worked in the hot bar area. My co-workers were fun, but a lot of gossip went around and it was very cutthroat. Cliques form, favor-ism from Management was obvious. Expectations were extremely high for a pay just a little above minimum wage. Discount was nice, and often team the store team leader was very thoughtful and generous but these decrease over the years."
good,Attendance is key and often times rewarded over work ethic. Managers often work about tasks at hand and forget employees. Discounts are helpful and staff is enjoyable.
good,"I feel that the job would have been better if the management did their role as a manager. They are the ones that are supposed to lead by an example. Managers should treat everyone equally. They need to hire reliable employees that know what they are in for when they apply and are they willing to sacrifice a lot to work for the company. Managers also need weekly meetings with their department. In every workplace, of course there are going to be people nobody likes, but they still need to have the ability to work together. I really think that is what was lacked the most. No one wants to work by themselves when it is a team effort. No one is superman or superwoman."
good,"Ho lavorato nella filiale di Londra, Piccadilly Circus, come Customer Service Team Member (2013-2015). Mi sono trovata bene, buon ambiente lavorativo."
good,"I sold cheese and wine. a long time ago...i do not remember, no one i worked with is still there.  importantly legal notice from the usniteed states district court the for the suouther district of florida"
good,"Fun, great, challenging, too much drama, nice place, team member, not much team member, all i can say it, good leadership and team member, ogranic an fresh foods"
good,"I worked for several years as a weekend/part-time employee. It was fine, but there was no real room for professional growth. It was approached by many as ""just a job"" and was not something most team members were passionate about. I left the company before the Amazon buyout, so I can't speak to how that has complicated the work dynamic."
good,"Great place to work if you're in retail. Lots of opportunities and room for growth! Most stores are fun to work in and have great leadership. Only downfall is some retail hours are a bit tough, if you're okay with that it's one of the best companies out there to work for."
good,"cashier, collecting carts, assist cux getting items and to their car. assist cashiers bag items for cux.  you can move up within the comapny with hard work and dedication."
good,they pay well.  people are easy to work with. Amazon is making culture changes that make life hard at work.  Nothing is consistent and you ought to expect changes to be coming.
good,Management was focused more on putting pressure to their hard workers rather than help train others to work at same speed. Management was friendly to some employees and based career movement based on friendships as well as salary.
good,"Most coworkers were team players.  Oftentimes, there was notable favoritism by managers.  Opportunites for overtime, lack of opportunities for advancement."
good,At times can be fun but sometimes job can be stressful. Overall its a pleasant atomosphere where you can have lunch and get work done or study. they also have foods and beauty items for each customer needs.
good,"There is day to day stress, but a great company to work for in high-end grocery retail. Management is a little bit tied down by corporate demands (see Amazon acquisition) but I'd still recommend it for hard-working, driven individuals."
good,"WFM is a nice place to work but the employees' salaries need to be increased for living. As a company, they need to realize that people need to live off what they pay."
good,good job to have as a young adult and easy to make friends of same age range in company.  everyone is friendly and gets along depending on how relaxed and confident you are as an individual
good,"Nice place to work.  Liked my co workers.  Into the community and focus on the community and the needs to the company.  Culture was very relaxed.  "
good,"What's to say? Everybody knows Whole Foods, your one-stop shopping location for Organic, non-gmo, antibiotic free food. It was a fun atmosphere filled with easy-going people and customers. There is some truth to the belief that quality costs a premium and selective shopping should be performed to round out your family's grocery needs. Otherwise, all the stores are bright, well organized,and the employees eager and helpful."
good,"Worked there while I was in school. It's your normal retail job where customer service goes a long way. They inform you to talk and engage with the customers (they are always right). Fast-paced, Hard to advance to even to only become a supervisor. But employees tend to be very nice and a helpful environment."
good,"after company restructure, WFM lost some of what made it special. my day started at 5 am and i worked until 1 or 2 pm. I learned to cut meat and make sausage."
good,"I learned a lot about being a team player and stepping up to the plate as a team member at whole foods. When you ask, there are always opportunities for you, and it is easy to move when there isn't a good fit. That being said, management teams sometimes vary store to store, and once one person expressed a grievance, it was hard to bounce back as a team."
good,A fast-paced and changing environment. Working on your feet for many hours at a time with customer interaction. Benefits such as a store discount and health insurance available.
good,"I think people need to work together, and that's something we're lacking, this creates stress,frustration, sometimes bad decisions are made, but we learn throughout all. and thats what whole foods has taught me, I am not impressed with management whatsoever."
good,"I initially really enjoyed working for this company.  They really stood on their values, appreciated their employees, and provided a comfortable but stimulating work environment."
good,"Whole Foods has been an incredible company to work for over the last 20 years of my career. The people are talented, creative and mission driven. The Team Members make the company a great place to work."
good,"new  experience  gd company shame to close store in Cheltenham mine best  job in mine live"
good,"What once was a specialized grocer has now become just a grocery store. Too many cut backs, realignments with all regional, no more art work and health benefits could be better."
good,This company has been great and still has much potential but is slowly going downhill.  Corporate acts as if they know better than retail what works for operations.
good,I loved working at Whole Foods. I would go back if I could. I was there for 7 years and wouldn’t have left if I didn’t have to stay home with my kids. For new employees it might be difficult to get by financially because they don’t offer too many hours if you’re part time.
good,"Always something to do "
good,"Small chance for advancement, most stores have boys-club culture, so your actual skills and job performance have less to do with how far youll go in the company than how much the TLs like you"
good,"Overall, I have really liked working for Whole Foods Market. Everything is great except the schedule, and that just might be a personal preference. It's not a 9-to-5 job. Great pay and even greater benefits compared to other jobs doing the same or more work."
good,"I would recommend working for Whole Foods Market to anyone!   They take care of their team members, offer good benefits and has a great culture to be a part of."
good,It was a nice place to work but managmenr was not very plesent compensation was great and advancement opportunity is also great learned a lot of useful skills.
good,"I overall enjoyed the work, I personally had a chemical allergy and after 6 months working there due to the cleaning chemicals that were necessary to clean the counters, knives, slicers and equipment constantly to every 2 - 4 hours I broke out in a very bad rash. Guess it is common in the food industry. I found a manageable point to endure through it,  But when they changed chemical companies it started getting sever again and I could not take it and had to leave."
good,Malleable work schedule with consistent approach to all employees. Culture is consistent throughout the company as I have worked in two separate locations.
good,Whole Foods Market is a great environment for shoppers and employees. It's hands-on customer friendly attitude is contagious. The time that I have worked there upper management has treated everyone and the departments as if we were a big family.
good,"My schedule was not flexible and that is ultimately why I left, I understand the black out dates around the holiday because that's the nature of the grocery store beast but I was made to feel like I was letting down my team anytime I asked off work."
good,"Great place to work for they beleive in team work, managers want to see you grow within company. The company made me feel vauled and appericated. I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,"when I worked it was to go in, do my job and get out. Employees stayed to them selves in their work station. I learned a lot about my field in florist. The people who I did work with were kind and helpful. I loved the discounts and environment of the whole store."
good,"Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers which weren't many, overall chill job culture, flexible hours, decent pay, would work here again"
good,Good place to work. Friendly atmosphere. Many friendly team members and customers. It is still a grocery store so don't expect some hippie free world do what ever you want place.
good,Easy to go atmosphere. Easy to get in harder to move up. Recommend wines and beers for customers when not making lattes for others. The shift flew by daily and was always enjoyable.
good,Learning the ins and out of the store. Meeting and greeting consumers on a daily basic. Learning customers names as well as team members. Going beyond great measure to ensure that each customer is satisfied before leaving WF.
good,"Not sure which direction the company is going in. Current focus/obsession is on customers which is good for customers, but many co-workers are struggling financially and worried about their future. Upper management is still compensated fairly well, but entry level wages are not keeping up with cultural shifts and cost of living. Morale low."
good,Having good a strategy will lead you to manage a sussesfull team. Always provide good communication between leaderships and team members in order to run business at maximum capacity.
good,"When I worked at Whole Foods, there was always a nice, youthful vibe to the place. Most people took pride in their diet, and if you are a foodie it is a great place to work. The Scheduling is pretty straight forward, you rarely work over eight hours in a day (at least in CA). The pay and benefits seemed fair, with periodic raises and a decent starting wage (at the time). They have fun health incentives, such as exercise competitions between other stores, and health insurance discounts for not smoking, etc. The discount was appreciated. "
good,"This company has become just that, a company. Whole Foods has grown, with growth comes a conventional approach to selling groceries. Long gone are the days of individual achievement and creativity. "
good,"on a daily basis i had to set up counters make all products , do all saftey paperwork meet tight deadlines serve and run department , make sure that staff were doing correct job so to manage waste and increase sales"
good,Whole Foods is a great company to work for. They care about their employees and encourage seeking opportunities for growth and advancement. Everyone is friendly and welcoming.
good,Management would let some people get away with anything and write others for smiling. They hire some of the brightest kids. The only thing is these bright kids don't like to work.
good,"I enjoyed working for company, felt supported. However, advancements were based more upon ""feelings of others"" then on your abilities. Raises are based upon ""feelings of others"" then on performance."
good,I'd work shipments that come in to the shelves and at times we'd have too much come in for the amount of people we had scheduled for the day which would put a lot of stress on myself and the rest of the team since we'd have to push ourselves to the limit while trying not to show the stress when around customers. I was able to work in another department receiving the shipments and doing the paperwork for the store that came along with that and it is a great position to do and is a lot of fun and wasn't must to learn for myself since past job experience had me doing something similar. Everyone I work with has different attitudes but all are great people to work with and can say built some friendships among some of them. The benefits you get for being fulltime are great luckily haven't had to use them but it's a good safety in mind knowing if I had to I am covered.
good,"The company has great values and treats their employees well. There is always room for growth, financial increase and advancement. The problems lie with the direct supervisory staff, i.e., TL, STL, ASTL ATLs, they are all buddies and have each other's back rather than truly investigating a situation."
good,Good job that could be great if regional would let the stores make decisions for themselves instead of forcing product and menu plans that fail more often then not. Negatives out of the way though the team members are very nice and the management is mostly available for work and personal problems and there is room to grow but it is on thier terms and they are not negotioable.
good,I was in receiving. I worked a pace form office to floor. It was hot/cold at times but not bad. I also worked with the grocery team stocking. And then later was a purchaser for Whole Body. I worked days mostly.
good,"The people I worked with were great. I learned a lot about living a healthy lifestyle and the job was flexible enough for me to go to school. There are channels to move up in the company, although the burden on management is not worth the pay."
good,"The people I worked with were great. I learned a lot about living a healthy lifestyle and the job was flexible enough for me to go to school. There are channels to move up in the company, although the burden on management is not worth the pay."
good,Management didn't ever seem to have it together. My hours were openings and closings alternating days frequently 10 days in a row. But not on one schedule so I never received offer time. I was also asked to make up reasons to writeup employees  during their shift. I did not.
good,"chill place to work.  strict attendance policy. little consequences for unproductive team mates.  demanding customers can be difficult to work with, good upper management can usually intervene."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of managing a large team, ensuring food quality, presentation and safety.  Training new team members, scheduling, conference calls and communication with department, store and regional leadership.  Preparing for sales and promotions, ensuring team members have the tools to perform their daily duties such as personal protective equipment, recipes, logs, food and cooking tools.  "
good,worked for them 11 plus years and first 5 to 6 years were great then it was'nt about the team members and became about the stock holders and ruined the whole vibe. morale went down across the company. on a daily basis i would stock and help customers.
good,"fast, friendly and productive day.at tis particular grocery store you see all kinds from different places of the world also different type of food, spices and meats. Everything about this store is amazon teamwork make the DreamWorks, everything is natural. The hardest part is schedule n timing it's enforced most of all dress code is freely under some restrictions"
good,"Overall whole foods is a good place to work. Some of the cilentile is truly awful, but the management really knows what they are doing. They really dont give you the choice to work a set schedule which can really screw things up in your personal life.  They also understaff all the time and expect you to pick up the slack since they are paying you more. It still was enjoyable however with the people you work with and the benefits you get."
good,"Great place to work, it's one of the hardest jobs you will ever work in Seafood but it teaches you lessons and hardens you. The amount of hours I had to work didnt go to well with my school schedule and the managers were very finicky about it but it was a good job."
good,"Days will vary greatly, and there will always be something to be done, you kinda do your own work, but always with the supervision, it can be fun but also stressful."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about WFM I worked there last year for seasonal and the people there are really knowledgeable and very passionate about their role in the community, it was honestly the best place I've worked but grocery just wasn't for me. Over all if I had to work in a grocery store I'd choose WFM. ony down side is they don't have a union but they do treat their employees very well."
good,"Whole Foods Market was a good job to work for, but it's definitely not a career. I loved the Team members and supervisors i worked with, however the Team Leaders (managers) likes to play the blame game to keep themselves looking good, in addition, they would take shortcuts to risk the integrity of what WFM stands for."
good,Pay is great; job security can be better with a union; very promising place to work; lead staff is very supportive of promotions especially when seniority is a factor.
good,"Days are sometimes busy and hectic. "
good,"In the meat counter specifically, there was a lot to learn and several peers and leaders there to help educate. The work was fast paced, but not overly stressful. The rest of the departments in the store often had different reviews."
good,Whole foods has changed alot over the years they still have some great culture but are slowly venturing into the whole corporate scene and it is still a great place to work at if your team has it together if not it can get very challenging alot of people want to grow at a fast pace and interviews sometimes go by who I like the most rather than who is more competent.
good,I have been with Whole Foods for around 11 years.  I have seen the explosion that has happened in the grocery business with a particular eye on organic and natural groceries. Whole Foods has not weathered the market well and continue to be leaders in their market.
good,"Its great. The scheduling is the only real downside because your schedule is randomized each week (with some parameters). It can get difficult to plan life around the work, but otherwise it is fun."
good,Open and close retail store including Bar. Learned Team work and positive attitude. Management needs to be available to workers when needed. Relaxed work place. Most difficult was split shift work. Most enjoyable part of the day was sharing experience with other employees about Whole Foods Market.
good,"My hours and days are flexible, but when I start my day I greet everyone change to my working clothes and start my day by going my the department and see what production expires, take them down, loss them and just organize the shelves. I take notes of what I need to bring up. Once I'm finished I go down to our prep room which is a giant cooler and start my day by cutting fruits, packing them, labeling them and put them on the shelves. Before I start cutting, I sanitize our sink, cut boards, knives and our prep tables, and log in the log book. We also be involved with catering orders meaning we make fruit, vegetable platters...Over all I really do enjoy working T wholefoods. Right now I am at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, across from Bryant Park, it's my 4th store since 2009, and is the best. Some of the people there are good team players and leadership are nice. Is a very good company to work in and meet interesting people. I have started from Food Preparation and now I'm at produce production. So I do have experiences preparing meals and salads."
good,"Pretty good starting out, pretty cut throat people can be really nice or totally mean, most people feel they should get a raise, ladder scale is pretty bad. alot of self oriented people using team oriented words."
good,"As the lead receiver it was my job to bring all the pallets from the parking lot into the store with a pallet jack at four o clock in the morning. Once all the pallets are dropped, you immediately start breaking them down and separate the product as fast as possible. During this time you can put on your headphones and work. You can assume that you will spend the next 3 hours breaking down the products from the pallet with your team so that once the store opens their is no product left on the floor. Once eight o clock hits the store will open and you are obligated to help the customers find their groceries. This is a fun job if you like to work in a repetitive physical environment. The management is fair but they expect alot from every team member. This was a fun working experience and I would recommend this job to any strong men who like to break a sweat."
good,"somewhat going downhill. good chance for advancement. benefits aren't as good as they used to be, but they are still better than average. depends on what department you work in if you'll be happy."
good,"WFM is a great place to work. good benefits and good salaries. "
good,Every day is different and not always in a good way. Overall a great company but they need to figure things out and get back to their roots! There needs to be more of a work-home balance for team members.
good,"Ever since the stock took a 40% hit in spring 2014, Whole Foods has been struggling and life has not been as fun for the employees. A lot of new initiatives are being implemented that many companies have been using since the 1990s such as just-in-time delivery."
good,"Its okay working at whole foods, management wasnt professional and youre only allowed to do a set amount of hours. if you can see past that you'll fit in at whole foods, the workers are pretty great."
good,"A better place than most other grocery stores in terms of benefits. "
good,Many companies in the United States and around the world require you too look a certain way and adhere to the standard professional appearance. You can be professional while also still being yourself.
good,Whole foods market is very productive and clean . Its a very good place to get a cashier experience. The staff will train you for everything. The pay is decent .you have to have a smile on your face at all times. The rules were strict.
good,"I have been at WFM for 11 years. I love it, and it has been more good than bad. If you truly have a drive for the natural and organic food industry, this is a good place to get a lot of hands on experience. You can gain a lot of knowledge if you have good leaders."
good,Working there is great. Fast paced and room for growth. You have to make sure you're meeting your career goals or else you feel stuck. Don't stay in any one position for too long.
good,"I was a very hard worker, attentive and fast learner.  people quit because they reached the top of job latter.  Promoting within company is effective.  Teams were a little bit micromanaged.  I have to say they did me wrong when I filed for unemployment, they took me to court, and took my unemployment benefits away, and made me owe the rest back. They sayd I greatly hurt the company when I missed work.  That is after they have told me what an outstanding empoyee I was and promoted me and gave me an increased salary.  They thought I would do better, but said that I had stepped down in my work ethics.  I told them it was a scheduling problem and a high employee turn around.  What do they expect, I was already a senior.  I didn't like all the heavy lifting. My hands were froen from diging up fish from ice water.  Fish was overstocked and hard to sell at fast pace they wanted.  I enjoyed the whole foods for their products and healthy habitual eating.  the boost was free vitamins from the expiratoin basket.  Some freebies, like food and damaged products. Did not like the assistant manager, she had a touch attitude. Plus I was doing most the work."
good,The culture has its good and bad moments. The pay is good but they do look to nickle and dime one out of raises. The position is only as good as the person directly above you. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the speed of work and the volume of work given.
good,Great environment to work.  Everyone is friendly and accommodating.  Management needs more of a structured way of leading.  Too many managers in place with conflicting ideals and personal policies.
good,"Typical day at work to prepare food, utilizing quality control, time temperature control, and safety and sanitation."
good,Good place to start your first job. Great team and work environment. Very cheerful place to work and build a work ethic. Great attitude of leadership and promoting new ideas.
good,job was easy and they train you good they do a review on you every year based on peformance management was decent had its days
good,"customer service supervisor, hardest part of the job was dealing with hard customers but i always took care of the hard customers, a tpical day at work would be trying to make everyones day as smooth as possible, my co workers were hard working and always looked out for one another."
good,"On any given day I would go and prepare for a lunch and dinner rush. I would learn about different techniques that some customers would enjoy at our prepared foods department. I would walk in during the breakfast part of the day and prep then. As I am preparing I would go and converse with some of my coworkers about different point of views that the company provides like health benefits and customer relations. Most of my co workers were there to make a living to provide for their responsibilities in life. In ruminating on the time I worked there that was one of the difficult part about the day because the motivation people use to get out of bed to work for what they wanted in life didn't represent the emotion they displayed for the time I was there but as far as the task at hand is concerned, I believe it was the lack of planning by the management that held the company back in accordance to my productivity in my area of expertise."
good,"As a customer service supervisor, I would go into work and setup each register till with a certain amount of money. Responsible for counting out 300 dollars in different denominations. I would give every customer immediate and undivided attention, Assist supervisors in controlling customer flow and backed up lines; help to reduce waiting time for customers. Follow all cash handling procedures; Understand, meet and exceed regional cashier variance policy (CVP)"
good,Whole Foods Market can be an enjoyable place to work. Lately the company has been doing what it can to avoid paying benefits and get it's stock price up. A lot of the enjoyable aspects of my job are no longer there.
good,"Loved the atmosphere and environment of the work place, most of the time. A bit inflexible when it came to transportation & scheduling, there was some miscommunication from the management that ultimately lead to my leaving."
good,started very early set up display case with cold food items and work the counter for the day. it was very fast paste and it seems like everyone was in a hurry. there was a standard to follow and the did it. co-workers were fun got to meet a lot of new people. hardest part of work was getting up at 4am to het to work for 6am everyday. most enjoyable thing was serving the customer
good,"Great atmosphere, fun environment, positive individuals to work around. Opportunities to learn about great products. Low stress levels. Part time benefits lacking."
good,"Very good team members, various free lunches, as well as the discount on items. Nice people everyday, easy to pick up, easy learning curve. Felt safe."
good,The culture here is amazing.  I've made lifelong friends.  but the company overcomplicates a grocery store and it makes it very difficult to work together with other teams and be successful because everyone has their own agenda
good,"A typical day would consist of putting new product out, rotating out old product. Building new displays, rearranging displays. Lifting 50+ lbs. Interacting with customers most of the day, whether educating or retrieving information for the customers. I learned more about produce, seasons of produce and when to tell how product is bad."
good,"Cashiering here is a busy job, there are usually large influxes of people at unpredictable times. Sometimes as a cashier you will have to ring up and bag large orders when your assistant is not available. Standing on your feet for long hours can be grueling and only getting 30 minute breaks, so you're on your feet 7.5 hours. As a cashier you are the last person customers encounter on their way out, so you hear all the problems and shortcomings of other departments throughout the establishment, they expect you to be the problem solver, it's your choice to enlist or not."
good,"Whole foods is a great place, but the store i worked at could really use some structure and new management. co workers are the coolest most out going poeple i've ever worked with. Typical day working there is always being short and having to cover."
good,"team members are fun to work with. it's a nice company that try to make it better. also, a lot of good thing the company is doing to the world"
good,Working for Whole Foods Market gives you another outlook on high food quality standards.  They have established themselves as one of the number one best places to shop for the highest quality organic and all natural products in the world.  Working for this company for over 6 years I have gained many leadership qualities and know what it takes to effectively run a team.  With their strong food quality and animal welfare standards it has taught me to be able to recognize the difference between low and high quality products.
good,"everything is different now, still a good place to work become more like a regular supermarket, we don't have that special  store that used to set us apart, they don't hire enough fulltime team member,half of the team is part time really hard to get your 40 hours"
good,"My job was to give great customer service in a passionate way while delegating and leading by example. I also ensured that all team members completed each task that was given their way, created schedules in a timely fashion. While being an assistant manager I set up interviews as well as conducted them to make sure the team was staffed appropriately for weekends and holidays. Being an assistant manager at WholeFoods required much multitasking because while doing schedules and interviews I was in charge of ensuring the sales floor ran properly which was something i learned to balance."
good,"Just like any other customer service work."
good,"Has issues with management by store like any other, but depending on your team's leader, you have the opportunity to be treated well and adequately compensated. If you want to advance in retail management, you can do so as quickly as you desire."
good,During job shifts work was usually always fun yet very busy. Amiable team members and lots of growing opportunities. Management and team leaders in some locations are very new and require better experience on how to build a much more efficient work place and ambient for regular team members. Overall Wholefoods Market is a great retail company to work for.
good,"The attributes of the foundation when used are amazing and i have seen it in many of the stores."
good,I was a little younger and proud they gave me a change to work and gain work experience.  Management was friendly and professional
good,A typical day was very fast paced and very productive. I learned great customer service skills and management was not to bad. The employers were not  bad but they also were not good.. most of them had negative attitudes which made the environment a little hostel. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the employees. The most enjoyable part was meeting the new customers and being able to work in a fast paced environment.
good,Love coming to work. The customers and Team Members are the reason I go to work everyday. Love my Team and know that they try their best day in and day out.
good,Great place to learn valuable retail skills. Growth is encouraged and on the job training is great. Casual fun environment that let's you be you.
good,"Core Values and Customer Satisfaction were the foremost directives given to all employees.  What the company stands for is great.  Good honest food that is made from REAL ingredients.  The store is not just about Organics, but is the leading Organic grocer in the industry as well."
good,"Overall, a fun workplace with a great environment.  There has been so much opportunity and I have learned a great deal from this company.  Having been largely inexperienced in food preparation, I was given the chance to learn and take on a great deal of responsibility in a relatively short number of years with the company.  Management tends to be a bit too relaxed, which leads to things slipping under the rug.  The best part of the job is the emphasis and reliance on teamwork in order to make sure tasks get completed and the family-like environment this creates.  Benefits have been gradually shrinking as the company has increased expansion."
good,"I worked here for just under a decade. I acquired many management skills, but on the job, and through training."
good,"Traveled, met amazing people experienced great food.  Interesting to see how the company restucturing will impact more store openings."
good,"Pretty office with fun amenities like a test kitchen and foosball table. Very unhappy energy by those that work there. Company is trimming, lots of hours and jobs are being cut/condensed. Inefficient systems are in place and no empowerment to help change them. Upper leadership is insecure and it is important to them they receive credit and do not share achievements with others. Company has a great foundation and has a lot to be proud of for their impact on the natural and organic food industry and the grocery industry and how they've helped change food in the United States. This foundation was built on the core values and this is what keeps everyone motivated but as the company grows they are losing sight of this and the culture is suffering. Many great leaders have left because of it. Nowadays it is more of a top-down leadership approach that is heavily guided by the shareholders."
good,Wholefoods is a great business I enjoy everyday I would just prefer a second job. My bosses and customers make my day i enter and leave everyday with a smile
good,"Retail is always very difficult schedule wise and they are not very flexible about scheduling, but it can be a fun environment to work.  They sometimes promote very unsuitable people, but for the most part it's a good work environment."
good,I was a good place to work for the time being I enjoyed the people.  management was more like leaders then managers.  good company and good benefits
good,"Best place in the retail world to work. Good culture overall and usually a good work environment to be in. From the outside it's a very desirable place to work...almost too desirable. The reality is you need to work your butt off and earn your keep. I liked that, but there are butt kissers within and so you have to watch your back."
good,"A nice place to work with an eclectic mix of individuals."
good,"Enjoyed the people I work with, although management can be better. They can sometimes bring you down with the schedule because of how the would place you in other departments."
good,"I enjoyed the advanced customer service training that I got here. The staff was always alive and friendly."
good,I do not wish to review my position at this time.  But my day consist of buying product and receiving and putting product away.  Watching finances.
good,"A typical day for me would be to come in, clock in and head downstairs to begin my shift. I would check the line up that was not always organized to see what I would be doing today. Then I would go greet my co workers and sign on to the register."
good,I serve customers and fill up the case for meats to make it look presentable to customers. I answer any questions or concerns they may have.
good,Cashiers get to work on money counting skills and build moral.
good,"Pay, benefits and work environment are great for the industry.  Whole Foods does suffer from some of the typical corporate retail issues, but overall it's a good place to work."
good,Very friendly customers and co workers. The management really cares about the future of company and employees. Training is detailed and helpful.
good,A very fun environment to work in.Team members are constantly being trained and retrained.
good,Fun place to work since the environment is very relaxed. can advance with proper effort. Bad work schedule typical to retail. Better  compensation than many other retail jobs
good,"It was a far more demanding job then average grocery store, much more customer interaction. Developed strong connections with some customers, overall a very friendly place to work. However within the store it was very hard to advance without going to another store in the region."
good,"I love working here, but it is time to actually pursue my career."
good,"very good experience working there, work Sunday thru Thursday, my hard part was working at 3:30 am."
good,"Picking&Packing  in large state of the art warehouse. Job is great, just watch out and remain careful."
good,"Overall, Whole Foods is a good company to work for, they take care of you. There are definitely a lot of politics. You are more likely to be promoted by being friends with the manager than being the best employee for the job."
good,"There is no typical day, as this is retail, hours vary greatly.  I learned much about financial management and ensuring customer satisfaction.  Your co-workers are what make the place great.    The hardest part of the job is balancing expectations.  The most enjoyable part is getting to see the result of your work in a tangible form."
good,"A typical day at work at Whole Foods includes food preparation, quality customer service, and multi-tasking in a fast paced working environment. I learned a great deal about how to prepare and cook food, health codes, safety precautions, and how to work well as a team. There are various departments within Whole Foods with different team leaders, which is known as management. Some departments have effective, competent, and attentive team leaders, where others may not. The Prepared Foods department is notorious for the most challenging department to work in due to stress and lack of effective management. However, co-workers are very warm and friendly both to each other and to customers. They make the whole store feel like a neighborhood grocery store with genuine attitudes and smiles. The most difficult part of the job was working with management. I take pride in my work and work hard, fast, and effectively but most times was not acknowledged by management.  Often times employees feel taken advantage of and unrecognized for their hard work and long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is being surrounded by the positive energy of co workers and most customers. Learning new things about cooking and food preparation was fun and exciting. "
good,"The company has strong and notable company values. I joined the company primarily because of their environmental values."
good,In the 9 years theat i worked at the whole foods market it was very interesting. i liked the fact that they care bout what they sell. they teach the workers bout the product.
good,The company attracts many skilled workers from amazingly varied backgrounds. It is a great place to learn how to manage a diverse pool of workers.
good,And by free i mean you are free to be expressive and be your self
good,"direct responsibility of (9) store totaling 1.3 million daily and 11.7 million weekly sales, selling unique and distinguish foods. Staff of 1,400 and a total of 60 Departments managers. Sales of 4.9 million dollars weekly. Responsible for budget, store profit, sales, forecasting and overall profitability. Reduced inventory discrepancies 45% annually by implementing a new tracking system."
good,"WFM has a great culture, however I found that a lot of it was just talk. Depending on the store management, you are nothing more than a body to fill a position."
good,My day at whole foods runs by pretty smooth and drama free except the fact of them cutting hours i am a person who like to work and enjoys it but i cant enjoy it if i work Monday off Tuesday Wednesday work Thursday Friday and off Saturday and Sunday.
good,"A typical workday was usually very busy dealing with customers and keeping the department looking good. I learned a lot about cheeses, wines, chocolates and other specialty items. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of getting the necessary things accomplished and meeting deadlines and keeping management happy. Made a lot of friends with co-workers in all the different departments."
good,I have learned that opening a store and being one out of 5 people whom already had experience was really tough. A lot of people rely on you for information and your tested on a daily basis. The job tested the maturity level that I had within myself to remain confidential plenty of situations. I love the enviorment. It's like everyone is a big family for the most part.
good,it was a great work environment. i enjoyed my brief days at this company. the environment promotes a great work atmosphere
good,"a typical day at work is being on the register ringing customers orders up all day can be very boring but also fun when you interact with customers. The management seems to know what they are doing and co-workers are fine. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers all day especially ones that are rude. the most enjoyable part of the day is talking to coworkers, sometimes nice customers, and my half hour break!"
good,"A typical day is symbolic with any other dc now, where at one time wfm was a cut above the rest.The continuous training has subsided, management is all about numbers and the team members dread coming to work. The hardest part of the job is getting there, the most enjoyable part is working with a great group of guys on a daily basis."
good,My job is to man the customer service desk and be available to customers and fellow employees to assist them with whatever they may need. I often listen to people complain about relatively innocuous things that are seemingly a matter of life and death to the customer while maintaining a concerned countenance.
good,I´ve been working for Whole Foods Market 4 years and I must say that it´s been a very good experience. I met a very nice people and all my colleagues and supervisors were very kind and helpful with me.
good,Whole foods is a good place to work and they've raised the pay rated management can be a little funny sometimes but I enjoyed working there for the most part.
good,"Fast paced environment that values team member happiness. Great place to learn and grow. Good training opportunities to acquire knowledge, and exposure to innovative products."
good,"dishonest managers i was given a position as a daytime stock worker and told all over night stock positions were filled. Two people who interviewed after me were hired for the position and let me know that they were still looking at the time at the time i needed a over night position and i let them know that it would help financially, it was disregarded and they started the business relationship with dishonesty."
good,"I enjoyed working at whole foods. They try to make it feel like a team that you are working with rather than just a job, which is nice. They take care of their employees"
good,"Whole Foods knew how to take care of its employees.  It was a great place to work with excellent people, but downsizing and centralization seem to have taken the forefront."
good,"Pay attention to insurance why do I have to write this, so I'm going to fill in the space. I have 60 more character to use,so I'm almost finished here."
good,"Not a bad place to work, and exciting things are always happening. The company does live its values, which is admirable in corporate America. It is my opinion that benefits and compensation are not competitive."
good,I really love working in a company culture that is diverse and vibrant. The people are great and have developed many friendships. Having fun is definitely a plus and engaging with our customers has given me much to appreciate.
good,Working in shipping and receiving makes my job a lot different than most at the company. my schedule is very conducive to a good lifestyle. My job is ok.
good,"The work environment is fun, fast paced, and rewarding. People are friendly, smart, and engaging."
good,My experience at Whole Foods has been one for the books. They have been a good support system and helped me provide. Most of my time was spent in customer service. They helped pass on opportunities.
good,great team members and passionate culture. terrible hours and low pay. good opportunity to learn about sustainable food and service. low customers. high turnover
good,"Collaborative work place. "
good,"Great job for someone who wants to feel good about their contribution to the environment.  However, the management schema is very clickish."
good,"Be aware that schedule flexibility and hours changes with every department. Holiday season is a mad house across the store, but the hours are great for your wallet/savings."
good,My Whole Foods experience was overall very positive. Management tends to come and go fairly frequently and unfortunately my employment ended due to misinformation and lack of communication between me and the new assistant GM of the store I was employed in.
good,Meetings often felt like more of catching up than what to do to achieve goals. Often lack of clarity on what leadership wanted from the technical aspect. But team members were intelligent and great to work with.
good,Busy and detailed work. There’s a lot of accountability and system familiarity required when the operational standards are vague and regularly changing. Requires one to be in their feet and ask questions regularly
good,"if you didn't know amazon owned whole foods, you'd find out pretty soon after working there. The management seems to make token efforts to keeping the employees happy but it never feels like enough."
good,"A typical day at whole foods consists of getting the pizza station ready, filling up the station with all the necessary ingredients. After that, I start making pizzas and discarding the older pizzas. I maintain the pizza station until its time to close. Then, I log all the pizzas I make, the temperature it came out of the oven and time. Then clean station and get the station ready for the morning crew. Whenever we are understaffed, I will switch from pizza station to making salad bowls or serving customers prepared foods."
good,"Yearly raises based on work performance, can move up within the company, willing to work with you on hours you can work.I recommend this job to people that love fast paced environments !!!"
good,"I did not care for the management. Not a lot of room for advancement. Had to work a lot of weekends and 6 day weeks. I loved my coworkers though, great bunch of people to work with!"
good,pleasant place to work  at sometimes. Rude and entitle customers most of the time. Arrangement was no good only concerned about themselves. it was ok to work at
good,"It’s like any other job really, the benefits are nice and the pay is fine, but feels stagnant and can be depressing. Would recommend for people going to school or trying to work two jobs."
good,"I've been working at Whole Foods Market for almost 6 months now and I love it. My whole family pretty much works there. The managers are super helpful and encouraging and team members are very nice. Great PTO, and full time health care benefits. Part timers are able to get benefits such a 401k and PTO, and are able to get healthcare too but it's pricey."
good,"I enjoyed working at Whole Foods, pay was on lower end but overall environment was good. As with many retail operations there were politics that played apart in advancement opportunities. Retail schedule is difficult with family, but fun place to work your way up if you lifestyle allows."
good,Whole foods is a great employer especially when considering the compensation and benefits packages you receive for being a full time team member. Management tends to vary drastically between stores and even departments and this can allow for lapses in communication and policy enforcement between Team Leaders even within the same store.
good,"Bad department manager, he was unbearable to work with made everyone quit. Due to his unprofessionalism. If it wasn't for him it would have been a great place to work."
good,"I thought working at Whole Foods was pretty enjoyable. The job was fast-paced and tiring, but the work atmosphere encouraged friendship between employees. I would say that the company advertises opportunity for advancement; however, in reality this is a very limited opportunity. I would also say that the pay is not great, although I think it is better than other grocery store competitors."
good,"I loved educating people about nutrition and healthy choices. I had a cooking business in the the Bay Area so I was more educated than most of the average employees. I also loved taking people around the store up selling many products and planning parties for my regular customers that came to see me on a regular basis. I kept the huge salad circle with 82 salads clean, organized and clean at all times. I was knowledgeable about all the salads on display and many times returned them to the kitchen when they were sent out without dressing or were in the circle too long. When a new employee came into the circle I trained them"
good,Whole Foods was a decent place to work with great co-workers.  The managers were ok. We got frequent pay raises.  Depending on how well your department did you'll receive a raise every month.
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great company to work for, but currently, the company is in transition with instilling new structure. There is a lack of support when training new employees within the company externally and internally. When it comes down to it you have to make time to train yourself within just getting tossed into your job duties. The training you will receive will only scratch the surface, but will not dig into the ""why"". Other than that majority of the team you work with are great people, and their only tends to be a handful of complacent team members."
good,I absolutely loved my coworkers but my schedule was way too inconsistent and managers way too incompetent for me to stay there. Working busy shifts were nearly panic inducing for cashier's.
good,As someone who has worked here for 6+ years it is a very easy job. Retail can be tough you just have to roll with the ups and downs of customer service
good,"a lot of unnecessary stress was due to the prepared foods (kitchen management) being pretty unorganized.  As kitchen staff, we often didn't have what we needed and worked hard to earn $15/hr.  Really awesome, genuine coworkers though"
good,I always said; It's not the company you work but the people you work with.   I experienced  a roller coaster effect by working in different location and with different people even though it was the same company
good,just your above average grocery store with people that really know there stuff on almost everything in store. but management tend to lack the drive to help most employees when the store seems to be in the most chaos
good,I enjoy the workplace and the people that i had the chance to work with. Gaining many skills that i can now use within other fields of employment. Would recommend  it to anyone who would like experience.
good,"Great work culture with good consistence scheduling. Management is great they really work with the employees. Typical opening consists of prepping area, checking stocks, bringing out foods, and visual merchandising the kitchen and hot food bar."
good,"Whole Foods has been an amazing company to work for over the years as it led the way in merchandising standards, and culture alone in the natural foods movement. As competition has grown, so has changed the focus and a loss of stand alone practices that have left Whole Foods separate from what they stood for, a muddying of the waters."
good,"Lovely place to work and team members are friendly.you have to really be hardworking to fit in.customers are friendly .in general,just a lovely place to work and grow fast."
good,it was fun with coworkers management  was bad. They where always in a bad mood. The schedule  where good the days you can't work they still schedule you .
good,"I worked in the Prepared Foods section, making pizza most of the time. It was a very rewarding job, however management was awful within the team. The Assistant Team Leader was biased toward age and aggressive about it, too, calling anyone who was under 25 lazy, simply based on age. "
good,My take away from Whole Foods was a relaxed environment that was made the better by the other employees I worked with. Some I have created lasting friendships and still visit after leaving. Mainly the issues I found where with the leadership at the store level and corporate level. Of course I left during the restructuring happening during the purchase by Amazon so there might be many things that have changed since then. All in all it is a great place to work and if you are passionate about food or health products there will always be a place for you there.
good,"you have to keep yourself busy, engage the customer and make sure all their needs were met. You will not like it if you can not handle being cold for a couple hours a day."
good,"my job consisted of early morning buyer duties. most of my schedule was fixed because of when orders need to be submitted and when inventory needed to be checked. I liked the environment and people I worked with in the supplement and body care. It was a very creative and interesting job where i learned a lot about different roles. It had a great team environment and everyone wants everyone to do well."
good,"Easy work, just be on time and be able to move quickly when the store gets packed, mostly on weekends and holidays. Customers really like to interact with you as well so be able to communicate well"
good,Relaxed and Collaborative environment. In need of expanding their business model to accommodate Amazon standards. Overall experience was good. There was some uncertainty of the vision of Whole Foods given the acquisition by Amazon.
good,It's a good job. I enjoyed working there. The pay is decent. A lot of customer interactions. Often fast-paced and stressful. Good management for the most part.
good,"Stress comes from Team Members trying to do their best performance for the company. Most team members are driven towards the same goal, and genuinely care about the quality of food produced. Management usually will follow their open door policy. Only downfall was scheduling. It tips the work-life balance in favor of work when you need to be available to start a shift anytime from 5am to 3pm."
good,I think that it's an alright place to work in for temporary time unless you're willing to commit to the company. I enjoy working there but I know that it will not lead to anywhere career wise.
good,You can get exposed to many great products. Gives skills necessary to advance in my career as a chef. Good health benefits and discounts on products for employees.
good,"The Team Members at Whole Foods are the best part of the job. It is a very welcoming environment. The culture is very focused on product quality and punctuality. I've learned how to work with an espresso machine. A typical day starts with a small breakfast rush, gradually turning into a busy lunch rush. Management is welcoming."
good,"I had the opportunity to receive lots of training while working at WFM.  My experience with WFM has allowed me to  be successful in other ventures  in my life aside from work.  I am thankful for my time working with the company."
good,A typical day at Wholefoods consist of a lot of prep work to insure the prepared foods department was fully stocked with fresh food. Management and co-worker very helpful during training. Hardest part of the job was getting all prepared food out before the store opened at 7am. The most enjoyable part was assisting the customers.
good,"I had a very bad experience working in the bakery because of a lot of nepotism and poor management in the department. Otherwise, the company was lovely to work for."
good,I really enjoy working there.   Its a Team friendly environment.  There is room for advancement if you are motivated.  There is a 20% discount card.  And paid benefits.
good,I learned a lot working at Whole Foods and while working on my customer service skills I also got to better my knife skills and my overall knowledge of the seafood world.
good,"A relaxed workload with a break every two hours into your shift. Management is nice, caring and helpful. Though some management will talk to you in a teaching moment as you are a child or uneducated."
good,"For the most part, I truly enjoy working at WF. However, I strongly feel that Management really needs to do some self evaluating and honestly determine if they're treating everyone the equally."
good,As far as retail jobs go Whole Foods Market is one of the top due to the competitive pay and benefits. There is quite a lot of possibilities for people to move up if they are so inclined.
good,this was a good working experience. For any student looking for a flexible job schedule and good pay. they also have employee discounts which is good if you shop there as well.
good,"A typical day at work involved helping customers find bakery/dessert items and telling customers about the products. Management was friendly and helpful and tried to answer all of my questions. Coworkers seemed mostly relaxed and happy with their work. The hardest part of the job may have been keeping up with the customer needs when it became busy, or trying to help a customer when the store did not carry a desired item they were looking for. I learned new bakery and pastry skills. I enjoyed the people I worked with very much."
good,"Career advancement holds a lot of potential but the work life balance is plaguing if you choose to be in leadership or regional. Luckily, the job is beneficial for the relationships and connections you will make."
good,"until you had the company looked at by a consultant to make vast changes in the culture... you lost it... growing too big and too fast, you got swept away with the competition that you forgot why you structured ""SaferWay"" at first....."
good,Good place to work. I would recommend this company to others. The quality of product is great and prices have gotten better since Amazon took over. I would go back.
good,Whole Foods Market is a wonderful place to work with a family-like atmosphere. The departments and the management consistently worked together to make store a profitable and enjoyable place to work.
good,"At 12 noon that's when the lunch rush hour start and at 5pm so you have to be ready to work in a fast pace sometime depeding how busy it is they do the power hour, the faster cashier ringing get a lunch coupon.Management is not that great.The hardest of the job is the variation in your schedule morning,closing mid-shift.The most enjoyable part is employee appreciation month we get free food for a whole month,coupon that we can combine with the discount card,prizes and also you get a lunch coupon on your birthday."
good,I am a working student and simply don’t like working very late nights because I have classes early in the morning. I am often not getting home until midnight
good,"It is a great job for someone who just wants a job, but if you want more it isn't for you,"
good,Going to work at Whole Foods was usually delightful since the whole place smells like lavender and patchouli.  Being around such colorful people was great and the fresh food is delicious.  Some coworkers complained about breaks but it’s not like we were building the pyramids there.  If you expect to get paid what a cashier should be paid and don’t act entitled to more you’ll be fine there.  The police at the door always made me feel safe.
good,Had a very good team but the management was very unorginized. We didn't have anyone watching over our department which made it very difficult when it came to communication.
good,"I gained a lot of experience, starting as a part time team member. I moved into purchasing and receiving, then quickly dove into management. I was supported throughout, though a retail environment presents many challenges."
good,A typical day at work would be learning about a new food and helping customers learn about them as well. introducing new healthy ways of eating.  Team building on non expected days a was always a plus.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Whole Foods at first.  As the years went by I found that a lot of there core values were not always represented well in the store or to the employees.  They were bought out by Amazon and I felt the company was going in a direction that I was not interested in.  "
good,"Great place to work, fun and nurturing culture. Management is always open to communication."
good,whole foods is a good job while I'm in school. I have worked for 4 and a half years there and they make it very easy to transfer stores if you are moving.
good,Whole Foods market is a great company to work for. I have been there for almost 9 years now and like every thing about my job besides working weekends.
good,Was very happy to work for WF at first but things change fast. Great company as far as pay and benefits go. The turn over is fast and not always good.
good,"I learned how to better handle stressful situations as they had been doing renovations in the kitchen the last 6 months i worked there. Overall the management was alright. I enjoyed working with the people in the prepared foods department. The hardest part of the job in my opinion would either be opening or closing the department, throughout the day its just helping customers and keeping the department clean. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the interactions with the customers, a lot of them will be trying to figure out good portion sizes for a certain number of people so they would ask for you opinion and trust that it'll be enough."
good,Left Whole Foods almost 15 years ago.  It had been a wonderful company to work for but during my 8 years things were changing and it was becoming more micro managed.
good,Company should focus more on employees. The employees really have no say in what goes on. Days are on and off some times good and bad. Management should focus on what employees lack and provide a better working experience. Lot of special treatment regarding advancement opportunities.
good,Everyone works together. You can always get management to step in and help if needed. The whole staff greats each other when seen in passing. The company shows a real desire to treat everyone equal.
good,"I loved working at Wholefoods Market. The customers are very loyal and informative. The internal environment would need some help in the rules that are force. It should always be realistic and applied to everyone. Though, I did grow in this enviorment and learned the importance of customer service."
good,My previous wine buyer position in Del Mar Ca. where I was forced out in order to make position for a friend of regional president and local management failed to intervene or take corrective action in issues that involved  other employee canceling my orders and removing my orders from shelf.
good,everyone opinion and review on things is different . so i would like for a person to judge it themselves. everyone walk in life is different. it is amazing company to work for. i did loved it and enjoyed it. it took me a long time to become Full time. i been fighting that for the longest. i did had up's and down's with maybe 2 individuals. i kept my faith and was still doing my job. i would love to work back again for the company.
good,"Since the Amazon merger, life is very different at Whole Foods. It seems that no one in leadership knows what is happening at any given time, or if they know they aren't telling. It's extremely frustrating."
good,"Coworkers are generally great, management is strict, pay is decent, very strict policies, customers are rude, good benefits, flexible hours, time off is acquired based on hours worked, good employee discount, no uniform"
good,"The place is over all fun and busy. Great place for a slice of tiramisu and espresso from the bakery.The chicken is fresh enough to slap a couple times and the boneless breasts take two Mennonite to eat. Time off like sick time and vacation is garnered from Flex Time. Like Walmart, it's earned by putting in hours and you accrue it by the more time you put in. It was tough to get a schedule over time that didn't involve evenings. Nepotism was rampant and caused friction for those looking for an apprentice position. The monthly all store meetings were a bit of a pain because after closing the night before I had to be there at 6 AM. And then go home and show up for my shift later. Unlike Walmart you could get your two days off in a row. Except for a couple people, most were great to work with. The Store Manager was referred to as plastic man and wasn't a problem unless he had a score board marked out on your backside. Yet after he fired my roomy she was hired the next day at the Palatine store. I think he was asked to quit after I left given that somebody that was working for Staples I know hung up on him as he was making a sales call. His Mother was fired by him from Whole Foods. It was fun to go down to the bookstore during lunch or listen to live music in their coffee shop after hours on weekends."
good,"Whole Foods Market of Paramus NJ, was a typical retail job. fast paced, overwhelming, and to many people trying to take control. in my time there it was hard to form community with my team members because so many people came and left"
good,You learn alot about the grocery industry working here. But sometimes they lack the training needed for work when a buyer is out sick or price tags are missing. Overall its a great starting job.
good,"A typical work day would be making sure the dish room is running efficiently. Helping out on the front line with customer service at the counter, pizzeria, panini station, and tacoria station. I learned how to clean dishes to fit company standards, make pizzas ,make panini sandwiches, make rotisserie chicken, etc."
good,"Wholefoods market is an okay place to work if your just starting out but it very time consuming even though the shifts are 8 hours it takes up majority of your day.Like a closing shift if from 2-10:30. You feel like time is passing so slowly, your tired and just want to go home. The upside is the staff is extremely friendly and some managers and supervisors are understanding of the never ending shifts."
good,I loved the job I performed at WFM.  I received much appreciation there from supervisors as well as fellow employees.  I do like like how job security there is constantly threatened.  It is too black and white.  Individual circumstances are not considered.  There was definitely poor management issues and many unhappy employees as well as favoritism.  I loved the workplace culture and truly miss the people I met through working there.  It felt very much like I had a family there.
good,Whole Foods overall is a good company to work fir. The offer great benefits and opportunity to move up in the company. There are some politics involved in the company but overall it's pretty easy going.
good,"I worked there 2008-2010 before Amazon bought them out so it might be different today then it was when i was hired. The culture for employed was awesome, the pay wasn't that great. I was in college when working there. As an adult now with a child on the way there is not way i could work there and support my family"
good,"I loved working at work foods "
good,"A typical day is doing your job no matter the management or coworker, provide the best customer service you can."
good,"Was excited to open a new store and be a part of such a well-known company. Received thorough training. However, business was incredibly slow and we did not receive adequate scheduled hours to have a sustainable living. Was not a fan of mandatory inventory which went VERY late, using past midnight."
good,unfortunately was only able to experience the company for a year before getting laid off. It wasnt performance based. Was based on seniority. Still great place to work. They take great care of their people.
good,"Wholefoods was by far the most fun place I've worked. Although I looked forward to coming to work and seeing my co workers, I felt that there was no career advancement. The only way you would move up is if your friend was in a management, it was never based off of who is really qualified for the position."
good,i love whole foods! i have veen with them for 4 years now.. and i made a mistake and left the company for a advancement in leadership but that was short lived.and i came back to the company .. it has become apparent that leadership looks the other way on a lot of issues if they like you. and you can pretty much get away with murder and you would will still have a job at the end of the day which to me isnt fair if you put in hard work and dedication you should be able to advance but that always is not the case most day
good,"I  worked at Whole Foods for a number of years, and in many different capacities. I was initially hired as a Dish Washer. Later moved into a Grocery, then Dairy Position. I learned how to run the Whole Body department, and would spend my last years with them first as a Pizza Chef, then Catering Chef. To say the least, I learned to do it all there"
good,Days are long. Bad Behavior is rewarded. Great Management team. Great team members. My time there has been filled with great learning experiences and awesome friendships.
good,I worked for the company for 10 yrs i enjoyed there benifits and insurence great place to work for a collage student and for someone who loves to play sports.
good,Constancy problem solving.Decent work and pay for a grocery store even though sometimes as employees we forget it is just a grocery store. Hardest part is like most jobs and that is doing tasks that you know are busy work. Most enjoyable part is the coworkers.
good,Got to meet great people  good product organic natural product in Fresh employee discount on product enjoyed a lot of your company sponsored events........
good,"The job was pretty much manageable, but I would NOT recommend this job if you have school or a second job because it would be stressful, time consuming, and tiring. The pay was good, but as a barista who has to run the whole coffee bar by himself, which includes making a variety of juices, smoothies, and coffees, running the cash register, cleaning up the materials after using them to provide clean and healthy drinks, and facing a long line of customers, the pay should be raised a bit higher."
good,For the most part it was a good place to work.  The overall strore manager wasn't adept at running a store but my immediate manager wall well aware of all things that were going on in the department and was really really good.  Most of the people I worked with were pretty awesome.
good,Work culture is none like I've ever experienced in any other job but in a job way. A lot of times it feels as though team members have a voice and the company is pretty transparent overall. Management is not the greatest sometimes but if your unhappy theres always ways to transfer departments if needed. Be prepared to work really hard and at a fast pace but more often than not the company appreciates the hard work and recognizes it.
good,"Was blindsided with no warning when Safety Department was eliminated."
good,"Great preparation for future jobs - promotes from within and has a culture that works well, when it's implemented well. The main drawback is that managerial skill and workplace culture varies widely store-to-store and department to department. "
good,"This is a decent place to work. The people are pretty good, management can go either way. They are good about working around school schedules and they are everywhere"
good,"Easy going job with fun, and charismatic people. Find yourself to get along with everyone, or you won't enjoy your stay.  Try to enjoy the workplace, and time there."
good,"Whole Foods is tough work and management works hard. They don't go out of their way to give you raises, but are nonetheless fair. I learned a lot about different lifestyles in diets."
good,"I quit my job at Whole Foods Market due to problems with other workers. It was a very complicated situation and I do not wish to work there again, but it was a great, efficient place to work."
good,If you'd like to work in an environment focused on the future and creating a healthier world this is a great place to start. Also provides  a diverse group of team members and opportunity for advancement.
good,the people were nice the training was thorough and the starting pay was fair they have a drug test and ability to learn other departments as well as advance through the team.
good,"Typical service industry job. Management was good, coworkers were great. Fast paced and always busy. It is an exciting job and keeps you on your toes."
good,"It was a great job, have worked at many grocery stores in a similar setting and this was by far the best. At the end of the day though it had very little or ridiculously difficult travel for a career advancement."
good,"it's a decent job really, but it can be overly stressful at times. management seems not to have your back when it comes to pleasing over demanding customers. you can eventually get burn out and begin to search for other roles with other companies. it is a fortune 500 company, great benefits, decent pay but could pay an additional $1.50 to $3.00 and hour depending on position and duties. exceptional training and excepting customer service training. the company as a whole is involved in some really good causes and charities overall some very professional, knowledgeable, and great people."
good,"Reviewed signage and pricing for produce, handled deliveries of produce trucks, cleaned and stocked new produce items, developed product demonstrations and cross selling opportunities, assembled information on product codes, promotional opportunities, brand information, and menu ideas for demos. Assisted buyers, brokers, and vendors in forecasting inventory needs, filling special orders and charting trends."
good,"WFM is not quite the warm & fuzzy place to work it once was, with investors, and now Amazon, calling the shots."
good,A typical day as a cashier at Whole Foods Market entailed plenty of customer service and also getting your foot in the door to other departments to build more skills. I enjoyed their system and the people kept the day exciting and moving. The hardest part of the job is standing for 8 hours in one place.
good,Was very fast past and rewarding to see efforts.  Culture was great and learned from my direct management which was store leadership and regional leadership.  Hardest part of job was keeping up with varying job responsibilities and making it work on limited marketing budget.
good,"It was hard work but a fun place to work at. You are part of a team and had to get voted on. Got a nice discount but no real benefits. While they didn't believe in ""clopin"" (close/open) shifts, you never had a set schedule. Was a relaxed atmosphere."
good,"A typical day involved receiving the load, stocking the load for all the areas of the grocery department, as well as placing the orders for one or more of the departments. Management was the only downside which may be hit or missed depending on where you are."
good,"I worked at two different whole foods stores.  The first store I was with had a mediocre store team leader, who was tolerable, but not inspiring.  The second store I was with had a horrible team leader, which is ultimately why I left."
good,"A normal day is greeting customers, setting up the store, and teaching new members safety rules. Sometimes, it is a requirement to go to meetings outside the store to discuss new programs."
good,"I was a cashier. The first month was difficult remembering the produce codes, but after you get those down, the job itself is easy. You get plenty of training and work with awesome people."
good,"Its a positive place where you meet incredible people. Some of the lack of understand on how they communicate issues leads to hard feelings, but they mean well."
good,"Good job, fast paced but can get boring once you understand the daily operations. After throwing the load and face the products usually you would have to build displays or fix anything the day or afternoon crew did not complete."
good,"It’s a decent place to work. It provides a nice discount for employees and rewards it’s team members when they go above and beyond. It can be competitive, however."
good,"This place is not for the weak, great place to have an awesome workout and also can learn about healthy foods. Its a very hard job and only can the strong survive"
good,typically my days are very busy with little down time. while working here over all i learned a lot about time management as well as how to deal with people and improving my management skills. leadership is very helpful and willing to support your growth within the company and provide all the tools necessary to move up within the company. the hardest part of the job is definitely that there doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day as well as a small lack of communication at times.
good,"Fast paced and competitive"
good,Management overall is fantastic. Best retail/customer service job I have had. Culture is overall positive. You get to meat very interesting people. Learn things about nutrition  that you may not have before. Great place if you have a real passion for food. Potential for growth has diminished in recent years. As well as the perks.
good,There is a lot of variety of work available at the company. Easy room for advancement or transfers. Passion in the workplace from the majority of management.
good,"WFM is, for those interested in working to forward the aim of providing the public with the best in natural and organic foods, an essential career waypoint. Times are changing, and the company has had to make some choices about the variety of products they carry in order to be logistically consistent in service to that public.  This can lead to occasional customer dissatisfaction (""you used to carry it"") as well as Team Member duress, as communication about these changes is not always fluid top down.  The company is, however, resilient and will overcome these challenges."
good,The culture here is collaborative and you are asked how you feel a lot.  If that kind of things give you the eye rolls keep walking.  Whole Foods is a great place to work and there is a lot of room for advancement as long as you are willing to do the work.
good,Great management empowering employees. Rules and polices do not seem in favor of employees regarding attendance or sick time.  Not much of a system to help employees or to challenge decisions.
good,Whole Foods is a very good company. The Annapolis location however does not have the best management. I heard of and experienced a lot of issues dealing with race and mistreatment.
good,"My time working at Whole Foods Market has been enjoyable, however due to lack of hours as well as financial responsibilities I'm in need of a higher paying job."
good,"Coworkers are fun to work with. Showed favoritism. Certain managers and supervisors were cool. Sometimes it got busy, but most of the time it was pretty relaxed. They literally think the customer is ALWAYS right."
good,"working at whole foods is a great place to start working. If you are looking to move up quickly it is pretty easy to do so, but it is very political. You must make friends with superiors in order to move up, and when you do move up you are expected to do more than your position title in order to prepare you for higher up."
good,Learned a lot about Seafood and different type of shell fish. Also the different ways to handle fish and also how to cook different type of fish. Also to meet different people.
good,"I very much enjoyed my time at Whole Foods. While there isn't much in the way of career advancement - office politics really dictate who gets promoted, I always enjoyed going to work. Sometimes, the ""customer first"" attitude that WFM espouses goes a little beyond common sense, but I think that overall, they have a good sense of customer service and that is why they had so many faithful customers (as well as employees)."
good,"A typical day would range from starting at 5 am, to 7am, to 8am, to 9am in the morning. Other wise an 11 am prep shift would be the latest cooking shift. 5am was breakfast which was easily done if the speed rack was properly prepped the day before. 7am is chicken bar which consisted of 9 hotel pans of food as well as rotisserie chickens. Then the 8am shift was for the largest hot bar which consisted of a minimum of 16 options. All of those shifts were 8 hour shifts. Other than that I would close from 2-10pm chicken bar, or 4-12pm hot bar. I personally observed a range of work ethics which made it hard to handle the larger scale work because instead of having the necessary help from our runners who were supposed to manage the bars, wipe things down, run out finished food. They would be somehow impossible to find or were lacadasical about the whole ordeal. Which meant, managing, cleaning, cooking, prepping everything through your 8 hour day. Hardest part of the job was doing a job designed for 2-3 people every day by yourself. And the most enjoyable part of the job was that it was an amazing work place. Very open, comfortable space, always sharp knives provided by Whole Foods and the kitchen was nice and open so everything could breathe."
good,"I have been with Whole Foods since April 2012, and have held many positions within the store. I addition to have been cheese buyer, I currently assist with backup cheese buying, beer and wine buying as well as execution of merchandising and organization. I am fortunate in that I have worked with some great leaders in my time at Whole Foods, and I will try to employ the best qualities of each in this opportunity."
good,"Easy for people to get along with. Management set foundation for a winning attitude and to strive to provide the best customer experience. Also, gives you the opportunity to shift around the store for more hours"
good,"Like everyplace, there are pros and cons. It depends mostly on your supervisor and associates whether you have a great or lousy experience. Mine was overall a positive time. Of course the food quality is second to none in the business."
good,This is a fun job but there’s not too many solid opportunities for growth that are worth the amount of work expected. Good benefits for the industry. Team is great but is always changing due to fast turnover rates. For a lot of people this is an extra job for bonus money or to get the discount.
good,"I loved my job! We were always kept considerably busy, but were paid well for what we did. I learned exceptional customer service skills here! Management was interesting, it all depends on the department. Head of store was very kind. Everybody created an inclusive, loving work environment, and was a lovely community to work with even when customers were hard to deal with."
good,Overall I like working for Whole Foods. The environment is friendly and decently paced and the co-workers and management are nice. However from my experience the pay isn't great and there isn't a large amount of opportunities for advancement.
good,I got hire with no cooking experience so they were willing to give me an opportunity to prove myself. The job was pretty simple an easy but i had awful team leaders during my one year at Whole Foods i went through 3 different team leaders and a dozen supervisors it was a roller coaster in my department.
good,"WFM is a nice place to work. However, the pay rate is not as good as I'd like, especially form my role and service hours given to WFM. I have learned so much about seafood in my time here as well as inventory management and ordering practices."
good,Retail store with friendly customers and workers due to being able to have one on one conversations about products to help ensure the customer gets what they want and leaves with a one of a kind experience. For the most part felt like you had a say in things when it came to talking to management. Learned a lot about product through the various training provided and also the word of mouth feedback provided by the department leaders.
good,"The benefits really keep people there and lack of accountability keeps poor workers employed. For a grocery store, it's not a bad place. Each department is run differently, so I can't speak for all of them. It can get frustrating seeing other people slack off and nothing come of it. "
good,"-Good job with good work environment"
good,"Packaging crab cakes, making sausage, preparing fish to be cut. Production style warehouse where everybody works together and puts orders out. One thing cant be done without the other.."
good,Cool place to work. Some people are fake (but that's at most jobs) For the most part it was a family like environment and the pay was fairly good. Would work here again
good,A Grocery Team Member is responsible for maintaining the Grocery floor and sells the product. The grocery team member is also responsible for receiving and preparing products for sale. He/she also should be able to provide a friendly and efficient customer service.
good,"Coming to work was fun, we great everyone with a smile and handshake. Our STL and ATL etc were all nice. The only downside of whole foods I'll have to was the pay grade. Sometimes I feel like some if the employees know more about cooking than the TL."
good,"Whole Foods is a promising place to work, if you're interested in retail. Where there were once many avenues to obtain promotions, there are now fewer opportunities and greater responsibilities for the remaining positions and stricter hours. However, hard workers are often rewarded for their adversity with faster advancement. The benefits are also above industry standard and provide a great lifeline for employees. Management style differs store to store and the workplace culture of a store is often dependent on it."
good,Like anywhere there are ups and downs. The random changes have made it hard to maintain a consistent life balance. Pay is fine for work you do but not many other benefits.
good,"A typical day started with a lot of waving hi to each other. Then would move into your assignment for the day. I liked being able to work with people to get a task finished.  I was able to build on my team work and team building skills. The Management was a good fit for the store that I worked in. The culture was amazing as it promoted everyones way of life. The hardest part of the job was realizing that you can't help everyone, but you can try your hardest to make it as pleasant of a trip or experience as possible.  The most enjoyable part of my job at Whole Foods, was the working in a team based environment, and getting to know and become friends with the many different clientele that would frequent the store."
good,Do what you have to do be friendly to customers and team members make sure you go to all team meetings and always smile always be coraptive and respectful to customers
good,Aspects of management were wonderful but there were problems with individuals and needless drama.  Employees were often seen more as numbers than people and I thought there was too much turnover rather than improving the productivity of the team already established.
good,"Schedule is written for this week, next week and the following week.  Difficult to request time off.  Getting a weekend day off is far and few in between, unless requested months in advance."
good,"This was my first job and i learned a lot. This company is great at educating their employees, or at least they were before the budget cuts in 2016. They offer incredible benefits, like the fact that because my BMI, blood pressure and cholesterol were low, i got 30% off on all WFM purchases. I met a lot of really incredible like minded people and although i ended up leaving on unreasonable terms, i still really loved and appreciated my time learning in that place."
good,"Good people, very friendly environment, good staff and a good place to learn how to handle people and build yourself up to tip top shape. Can be challenging at time's but what job cant be!"
good,"Everyone is awesome to work with. Unfortunately upper management has a tough time relating to workers, following through on implementation of practices, and is way too clicky"
good,"Set up Cafe, serve and brake down for the day. Do orders, take inventory. Greet and take care of customer needs. Lifting heavy objects. We served breakfast and lunch."
good,Great place to work even with the culture declining.  Fair pay and benefits.  Flexible scheduling. Company has opportunity to promote smarter. Poor communication skills on store management and regional purchasing level.
good,"Gained valuable experience and leadership was great. Benefits were good. But pay was not. Learned a lot of different things in terms of sales, and product knowledge."
good,"Different types of duties done throughout the day, depends what department you are in. Pay is fine benefits are good too. 15 percent discount.  Everyone is great to work with"
good,Your team members are great and very supportive but when it comes to management can be difficult. Work can be hard depending if it is a busy day or it can be really slow.
good,THis job was very challenging at first because you had to get use to the different type of product.. which is mostly organic lifestyle adjustment.. getting to know how to eat differently was a big plus...
good,"Once great, but currently in decline.  Understaffed, presumable to make numbers look good to sell company.  They have combined too many departments, leaving their manager's scrambling to get things done.  This removes them from sales floor leaving them unavailable and uninformed.  This leaves the rest of the staff overworked, under appreciated and unhappy."
good,I worked in the Regional office for three years and never worked a single week under 40 hours because I was salaried. I think its better to work in the store where you are paid for overtime and holidays.
good,"While working at whole foods, my customer service and multi tasking skills expanded. Working behind the customer service desk helped my skills on the phone and helped me become more detail oriented"
good,"Pros:"
good,I work to support my family.so when I work at a job I am humble and very appreciative. Whole Foods was a very exciting place to work at. every day I was given something different to do. I really learned alot.
good,"I highly enjoyed the culture at both these employers. They put the employees and customers on equal footing. When we felt that the company cared, we were able to pass that along to the customers. Therefore creating a family in a sense."
good,"People that worked there, from management to associates from all positions were genuinely nice and easy to get along with. Tho the work is fast-pace, it isn't always too bad. Had a pretty good time working with some of the people there."
good,I enjoyed learning about organic foods produce and sustainable seafood.  I wanted transfer to demos but found the process difficult. The management was nice.
good,"Good culture, good company nice place to work. Pay is OK for the work done. Company has gone through changes and is trying to adjust to investors wants to deliver higher share prices."
good,Being a cashier at Whole Foods market was a very a busy job. Whole Foods was a great company. There was always so many people so the job was kind of fast paced. There's a lot of direct cultures that the workers come from. There's a lot of diversity.
good,"Wholefoods is a safe place to grow and good environment to work in for the most part. There are a few things of concern, most people the quite this job including myself leave because of the management, also they keep cutting labor causing you to be overworked and no paid the proper amount of the work they put on one person. The hardest part if the job is the customers they tend to be needy, a bit more than I have experienced with other retail jobs.  The more enjoyable part of the job is definitely the saff, everyone is nice and helpful, like a big family."
good,"I enjoy working for Whole Foods! This is my third store and its in a different region so things are very different. It's not very fast paced, only at lunch time it starts to pick up. Whole Foods is very diverse and we have different types of people working with us. I enjoy working there!"
good,Staff member would get free lunches during holidays. The job culture was not the best. There were many idle and unreliable employees that management tolerated. The positive aspect about the job was if you put effort there always ways to keep you productive. I also like discounts I received
good,"Amazing place to work for. They have fantastic benefits and are super helpful when it comes to work/life balance. Typical day can be it's moments of being slow and full of busy work, but during our busy season, super fun and get to meet a lot of people. Worse part is the stagnation in positions."
good,I have been working at Whole Foods for over 10 months. I am a fan of this company. They work with my school schedule and it the perfect job for me at the moment.
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company, but my personal life needed more attention so I ended my work relationship with the company."
good,"I have a great schedule, I like who I work with, and I like what I do. I like coming to work everyday.  I walk to work which is pretty amazing.  I've learned a lot about various IT functions, and I think that has been the best part of what I"
good,"I find Whole Foods Market to be a good place to work with many opportunities to improve and advance. They provide a safe work environment and decent hours. I have found that over the past few years, management has gone down hill from where it used to be. There have been many opportunities for promotions, however, even after interviews, continuous decisions have been made to postpone the search for that particular position. This has made it difficult to move up. Though that aspect has been deemed difficult, Whole Foods Market has been a decent place to work."
good,No review Needed.  Prefer to answer any questions in interview. Nothing to really say about this job other than it was a good move for me at the time. I love all the life long friends I've made through working for this establishment.
good,"Six AM start with immediate focus on preparing breakfast items for the hot bar buffet. Items included scrambled eggs, Greek eggs, proteins( sausage, bacon, ham), pancakes, Latin home fries, fried eggs with collards, breakfast sandwiches and burritos, and holiday items."
good,Some leaders knew a lot but others knew very little. Training never seemed to be a priority for any department. Store leadership has trouble holding others accountable.
good,"I was an Associate Team Leader in Market at Whole Foods. I learned a lot about retail, leadership and merchandising while working there which was awesome. However, its retail all the same. They are currently reorganizing their store structure which meant employees losing their jobs and others being asked to take on their tasks. Also, I sometimes felt that leaders favored team members over others which meant inconsistency with accountability."
good,"I work by washing dishes , prepping food and cooking also cleaning up the store to make sure there is no spills or trash. I worked a 3 man job per shift with no help."
good,"I spent seven years working there and learned a lot over that period which helped me become the leader I am today. However, The company has changed alot and is going in a different direction. A lot of things the company provided for their team members are no longer in affect."
good,"Over all, Whole Foods isn't a terrible place to work. As a cashier in store support, the day would consist of mostly checking out customers and bagging their groceries. This would be the primary task for the day. However, I would often take on additional tasks, such as stocking supplies, cleaning, bussing tables on occasion, exclusively bagging for other cashiers, particularly when its very busy and from time to time venture out and help other departments. "
good,"Culture is very good, learning and education systems are there, company is muddling through business climate and trying to advance."
good,"Learning how to manage different personalities, dealing with the customers and presenting the product in a way that is not only appealing to the customer but inspiring to the team."
good,Work life balance is often taken advantage of.  Favorites are a factor for hiring from within. The quality of Team Member is excellent.  Whole Foods Market provides excellent training.
good,"I always have a full shift that includes buying and stocking products daily, stay aware of surplus or loss of inventory, and manage the dairy department in our store.  As a buyer we must scan spoilage/damaged products daily, keep track of our daily, weekly, and monthly purchasing budget, gross margin percentages."
good,It's just not my area. I have been working here for a while and wanted to change jobs but was not allowed. Management doesn't want to let me move but was delayed.
good,I had a great experience at Whole foods. They are a great store to work at. The hours are flexible. You work in a freezer most of the day.I learned how to be a great stocker
good,"Picking and assembling customer orders, with speed and accuracy, adhering to deadlines, dealing with customer queries, working as a team."
good,"I learned a lot at this job that I can take with me for everyday life. things such as cooking, cleaning and just general personality skills."
good,"I loved my job here, but it was time for me to leave. My coworkers were awesome and it was the perfect balance of work and free time. However, management was, most of the time, subpar. Schedule changes without letting the team members who were affected know was common, as well as disproportionate discipline and enactment of company policies. "
good,"When I started,I was excited and ever learning but recently,alot has changed in managment and alot is not for the good..so after 11plus years I need a change and always love the atmosphere of your store !!! Hope you consider a woman of experience ,thank you"
good,"I work at whole foods market in highland park , my co workers are get and the job is easy. The only problem that i have is that i dont get enough hours and they are never hiring for a full time position"
good,"Managing inventory, loads, sales and customers in a typical day. Working with a wide variety of employees and customers. Large amounts of stocking and cleaning. Quality control and product placement are huge parts of the job. Management very approachable depending on the department."
good,Really awesome and positive culture! It doesn't pay as well as you would think it would. Lately Whole Foods has been laying off people (good employee's) left and right but then opening up new stores. Job security is definitely an issue and if you make too much they would be willing to get rid of you to find someone to do the same job for less. They mainly offer only part time work.
good,The vibe is pretty nice and all the people I work with are really nice. What Whole Foods stands for is something I appreciate and respect. I wished they gave out benefits for their part-time employees but the management there is nice and I really enjoy working there.
good,"Whole Foods is a great company to work for. The hours are great, the pay is great, and the experience is incredible. Working at an organic grocery store isn't as bad as you think."
good,Whole foods has a good culture depending on the team you work with. The benefits are good and the work is easy but enriching.
good,Headline says it all. It offers many perks and bemefits for working with the company but thats only when you accumulate a certain amount of service hours and if you are extremely lucky enough to land a full time position. Other than that you are looking at a part time job with max 3 days a week..
good,They work really well around your schedule but can be very disorganized.They have some really neat things they do for the employees but it isn't easy to get fulltime
good,"Love working for this company, and the Team Members are a welcome delight each day to work there. Learning about new foods and different ways to accommodate customers with dietary concerns. Its hard at times to work really early in the morning when you've just closed down the store the previous day. Knowing your demographic is the most important understanding for your sales. Also the products we offer. The more knowledge you have the best information you can offer your customer."
good,"Whole Foods started out as a great place to work. Outstanding values and seeming to genuinely care about its employees. As I got more entrenched in the company I encountered more instances of favoritism and bias. From job promotions to everyday tasks. It became part and parcel of working there. Can't say the entire company is this way, but certainly El Segundo was. "
good,"Typical work day was a morning to open, mid or evening shift to close. I learned a lot from my manager role in just a short amount of time from learning how to create a work schedule to maintaining the department's budget. I worked with great co-workers throughout the store and we worked as a whole team. Upper management was fair to the employees for the most part."
good,"start at six  in the morning to set the working enviroment,to make sure that every body is in place.and readyto start prepare all the meat for tha day,or for at least 8 hours,tell a cuple of jokes to start the morning say hi to the boss."
good,"Fun work place with a management structure that encouraged advancement. A lot of movement in the company in terms of changing stores or departments within a store which kept things fresh. Downside was advancement was difficult to do if you wanted to remain at the same location. Learned a lot about the industry, and the company does try to take care of its employees through a number of initiatives I have no seen elsewhere."
good,"In my opinion Whole Foods is probably one of the best jobs you can have in retail. The company starts you off at a decent salary when you first get hired. As time progresses you become eligible for raises and further advancement in the company. The full-time benefits are also pretty decent including a 401(k), medical and dental plan. You also receive what is called gain sharing which is extra money you earn when your department is doing really well in sales. After being with the company 5 years you gain free stock money once a year. The hours can be crazy because you usually don't have a set schedule and  this can be real challenging at times to plan things around a varying schedule. However; your employers do recognized that you have other obligations outside of work and they will try to work with you but at the same time they still have to do what is best for business. Managers expectations can sometimes be unrealistic but of course no job is perfect no matter what this is a reputable company to work for and I really appreciate working for this employer."
good,"Working at Whole Foods, the environment is very different from a regular job. You work among very outgoing individuals, and as a cashier, you must be comfortable striking up conversations with strangers. A typical shift is around 8 hours. Won't lie, it's very draining to be on your feet all day, but they make up for it by giving you breaks every two hours.  It's also a very educational workplace because you meet a variety of people who are into the holistic lifestyle and they share (if you ask) their at-home remedies and what products and foods they consume regularly. "
good,"Overall, a positive experience working here. I worked here for a year while I was transitioning between undergrad and graduate level studies. Management was great, super accommodating with requesting time off while still managing business needs. Relaxed place to work out with basic guidelines for work ""uniform"". You are rewarded for your hard work and recognized for it as well by being allowed to take on more responsibilities within and outside of, your department. You also receive a 20% discount on all products within the store (the discount is also tacked onto sale discount prices, so you can get some pretty great prices)."
good,WFM is a great place to work.  If you care about what you eat and what goes into your body this is a good place to be.  Great environment to work at.
good,The people that you work with become your family. Along with the people you become very informed about the products that are sold  and about customers special dietary needs.
good,"The culture behind Whole Foods Market gives the team members an opportunity to express themselves through a number of ways: the dress code is liberal, there is an open-door policy with management, team members have to vote new team members on the team. There is room for growth."
good,"Going to whole foods market everyday you knew you were going to work hard and help customers. At Whole foods market you would learn something new everyday. Most of the employees were kind, helpful and happy. The company is good for the community and would provide appreciations to the employees in forms of foods and compensation. There was a ping pong table and always something good to eat."
good,"the company is going through some adjustments to labor which makes advancement seem out of reach for the time being, but I definitely appreciate the culture that has been fostered since it's inception"
good,"Typical day would be me walking into work and making sure all team members are having a good day, going from there to making sure we have production list, catering order if any, product in stock. then off to taking care of our customers."
good,"A typical day at work involves making sure that the most important projects are finished and properly communicating what else needs to be finished later. I have learned a lot about communication, ordering, multi-tasking and doing what ever I can to get the job done. I enjoy the people I work with.  The hardest part of my job is, at this point in my life, the physical demands and the inconsistent schedule the I am given."
good,"Excellent place to work with lots of room for advancment if you are motivated, show up on time and get involved. Lots of oppurtunity to advance. And most people that i worked with were wonderful people."
good,Working for whole foods was a fun experience and i learned a lot from this place. My husband used to work the receiving department and that also helped me see the back end of how things where rejected due to temperature and how they hold their standards high. most days it went by quickly due the volume of customers which was good because it felt like you walked in and right out from work.
good,"In any given day, depending on the shift, I would set up the coffee bar, stock all the tables and isles for the bakery team. I would then begin packing, pricing, and replenishing the tables as needed. Tasking throughout the day, we would also help every individual that needed assistance. Very focused on numbers, during the slow season. The team I've worked with has taught me countless lessons, not only as an employee but also as an individual."
good,"The only difficult point in WFM is to balance our personal life with the crazy schedules the stores handle."
good,"Wholefoods lacked in organization, and employee communication. Lots of room for growth, not a lot of job security. Great Benefits."
good,"Everyday I'd be assigned to a different department to help out, I learned to be cross trained to do most job functions at Whole Foods. Management and my co workers were all very nice and polite at all times. Hardest part of the job would be learning everything about each department and the thing i enjoyed the most at Whole Foods would be working in the bakery."
good,"Whole foods is a great company, the only problem is the location I am at has very little room for growth and awful customers. Seeing as how the store is small, and benefits are good, there is little to know opportunity to move up to a higher position in the store.  The customers treat the team members like second class citizens for the most part.  Management is good but small stores have favorites and the favorite team members are treated a little differently. Still the company stands for so many good things that I would probably work for the company at a different location if I could."
good,"Receiving is easy.  Work with all teams to insure correct items, orders match the items ordered.  Good co-workers.  Hard to advance with management changing and team members moving all the time.  Community outreach is a great part of the job."
good,It's always fun to work with a lot of people that's how you meet new people and respect others hardest part of the job will be dealing with angry customers. I enjoy seeing everybody happy in a regular day.
good,"i love working here, the ppl are great. the customers tend to be a little snobby but you learn to cope and deal with it as you do any job. its an amazing company to work for."
good,I worked some amazing and helpful people. Moving into management was an exciting challenge. Being apart of a marketing group with my department really helped maintain positive numbers and a sense of pride for my market.
good,"Some of my duties during a shift were, seafood sales, stock, ordering supplies, cooking soups, dishwashing, cleanup. When I was fired, it was due to short term memory loss, which the doctors believed could have been caused by my meds back then (Klonopin)."
good,good benefits. coworker turn around is fast. depending on department is how much hours u receive. management was not bad when i was there. they actually care about their employees.
good,"I would check my emails everyday, stocked receiving, face, customer service, back stock, ordered supplements several times though out the week."
good,Great place i loved working here because i love food. Every day i would be all over the place making sure the displays were filled food was prepared setup counter displays. The co-workers are great friendly and always willing to help
good,I had a lot of freedom here and had a lot of fun   I threw festivals   Best of L.A.   Special Olympics  booths at various functions around town.  I gave children's tours   and adult tours   took care of tour groups    conducted employee trainings    and was of service to customers and staff.
good,"The management sucks entirely. Very Poor, The company itself is pretty cool. The benefits for Part-Time sucks but Full Time is decent I guess. I love the 20% off each item."
good,"My experience is only based on a few months with the company. I enjoyed some of the people, but what the company stands for I liked. Some of the people I worked with and rang out seemed entitled, but other than those few experiences good work environment."
good,"This place does not force you to clock out for lunch.... Instead, you take your two breaks together as one 30 minute break. That really makes a difference in the work/life for me. The Whole Foods crew is three times bigger than HEB in terms of hours worked to sales made. With HEB labor cuts over the last four years, it might be four times more labor. The work at Whole Foods is more tedious, but there is less heavy lifting and way more customer service."
good,"Great company making positive changes in the world and probably the best customer base you can find at a retail job.  I worked there in the NW suburbs of Chicago at a new store opening, it was exciting."
good,There maybe a time or two or twelve where you have to be flexible to cover other areas because of some people not coming to work. (Not the stores fault).
good,"Always a different day other than deliveries. I learned about management responsibilities, and the organic lifestyle."
good,leadership has a wild disconnect between what is expected and what is realistic.
good,"Nice job meet a lot of great people, great health resources at your disposal good people."
good,"Provides adequate benefits, stock options, and gain sharing. Management often makes unstable, or poor decisions; often leaning towards profiting instead of product integrity. Lots of responsibilities are dumped on few people, rather than spreading responsibilities evenly. This company does not perform drug testing, allowing unsavory individuals to thrive in their positions for much longer than they should be allowed to. Incompetent individuals manage to earn higher paying positions, often creating discourse among the store."
good,"I enjoy what I do generally, but I am looking to move into a coaching position."
good,stressful environment but team members enjoy themselves.
good,"I have learned a lot in the few years at Whole Foods.  I believe I found myself as well as growing into a better leader and mentor.  Everyday I work with different people and help my team grow.  I was able to move around in departments, open stores, and be on different front end teams.  Each one helped me see what I wanted in a leader and find out what type of leader I am."
good,"- A typical day at work included decorating cakes for the pastry case and customer orders, and preparing other pastries and desserts for the day."
good,"I enjoyed working there! I had just started working there when I was 4 months pregnant, by the 8th month I was ready to take a break and unfortunately did not qualify for enough medical leave to have my job protected while I was on maternity leave."
good,Working at Whole Foods is enjoyable from the people you work with to the customers who come in to shop. I learned a lot about my own skills and abilities from working with this company. The management is very supporting and try to keep the team members best interests at heart. The hardest part of the job is saying goodbye to team members who move on to other careers. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new skills and being given more responsibility.
good,Whole Foods Market is a great place to learn about organic foods and how to be more healthy
good,Gostei muito de trabalhar la por meio de aprendizado a gerente era uma pessoa muito boa legal q sabia toda sua obrigaçao e otima em encinamento de funcionarios
good,"Great place to work. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of challenging and varying job duties that included anything from handling food to driving sales to operating company vehicles in order to make deliveries at catering events.  "
good,"Wholefoods market prides them selves on being the number one certified organic and natural supermarket. It provides team members as well as customers with a fun knowledgeable environment that makes shopping more like an experience rather than a brief stop."
good,"Whole Foods is a great company that is trying to save the world, however the Prepared foods division not the place to work.  The size of the Hot bar does not match the inventory levels. The staffing levels are fine if everyone shows up, but no systems are in place to cover absent workers.  The people are great, but the labor dollars are  not spent well.  The hot bar has the highest sales, but more money is spent on the chef case."
good,"•	Create floral designs incorporating innovative use of colors"
good,"I enjoyed my experience with them, I learned a lot . customer service I enjoyed the most."
good,"I have been with the company for over 5 years now. Its a great retail job, with some of the best starting pay rates in the city. "
good,"I feel that the original mission of Whole Foods Market is one of wanting to bring back the human race to basics through educating the public about eating whole foods, recycling, helping the ones in need, and creating community through programs who are educational and bring us closer together."
good,"Would not have found out about this neighborhood gem were it not for the very diligent hiring efforts of the Whole Foods management. I had applied to a different store in the same general vicinity of where I commute from, but they were first to accept me into their training. Outstanding place to work!"
good,good friendly job room to learn. good benifet package respectable envierment .
good,"At this job you will meet some really great coworkers that will make your thankless and stressful job bearable. However management is really touch and go. How you advance is based mostly off of how much your supervisors like you personally and how well you and duck and dodge your way through their strange attendance policy. Overall its a fun, open environment and the job is fast paced and never ending."
good,"A typical day at the meat department revolves in providing great customer service and make customers be part of our extended family.  There is always production needed to be done, be it in the poultry case, meat case, pre-marinated and sausage case.  The co-workers were generally there with a helping hand.  The environment with the co-workers was great and the only fall back that can be said is the lack of communication within team members."
good,"Company that serves its team members"
good,i delighted the customer and took care of the department appearance .
good,"A typical day at work would involve interacting with customers, setting up health programs that were best suited for that individual."
good,Great core values. Relaxed attitudes. Stressful and micromanaged at times. Pay is not the best and lower than industry levels. Repetitive projects.
good,"Fun Place to work, many of Good People and great opportunities to travel while doing what I enjoy."
good,"A typical day as Store Marketing Team Leader involved anything from copying sales flyers , bagging groceries , hanging signs , painting and building displays, answering emails and coordinating and planning weekly in-store events and coordinating national marketing promotions and contests. I learned time management, email etiquette, the importance of follow through and working under stress and tight deadlines. The hardest part of the job was the quick turn around of promotions and holidays and at any given time there could be four or more promotions and contests going on at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was planning the in-store events , guest interaction and being a valuable part of the team and working for a great company."
good,"All though I loved rolling sushi and I loved working inside Whole Foods, Genji was a very unfair company. I did learn many new ways to cook and prepare food which I am always open to. My team leader was working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day so at least 2 days a week I would stay and work the long hours so he could go relax or get something done. I also helped him train 5 new employees that the regional manager did not even care or notice. The company treated their employees very poorly. The regional manager would stand over your shoulder and tell you ""do it this way, do it that way"" as you were working with probably the sharpest knife I have ever used in a kitchen."
good,this is very good place to start working when you are young and learning the workforce. definite room to grow with this company and team efforts are praised. descent managers and very thoughtful of their associates.
good,Worked there and was able to work my way up but it took quite awhile. Store management changed very often so that wasnt too great. Hours were good and they will help you out if you miss work for injury or death in the family
good,"Great place to work at with plenty of opportunity for job advancement. The schedule for the Grocery world is challenging, but other than that it is exciting to work at this company."
good,As an overnight baker it was probably the easiest job I've ever had. Hardest part of the job was the hours which I did not get used to the whole time I worked there. The environment was relaxed but being that it is corporate protocol can be a little overbearing. But overall not bad. I chose to work overnights because the pay is an extra 1.50 an hour. Reasons I quit was because I found more satisfying and challenging work at my current job and the pay was the same without the overnight hours.
good,I first started @ WF as they were buying Fresh Fields. Corp culture was: We hire the best for the job and trust you to do it well.
good,Family orientated environment that is diverse. Usually are very busy during the holiday season. Co-workers there are very social-able and respectful. The hardest part about this job employees transferring to different stores. The most enjoyable part of this job is having team builds.
good,I like wholefoods alot good company good customer service great variety of item for all occasions ... Their goal is to help employees grow inside the company and as adults
good,"At wholefoods, I learned how to be productive and allocate my time wisely. When I wasn't helping customers I was chopping vegetables, cleaning my station and making sure everything was sanitized. Being there helped me improve my customer service skills immensely. It also helped me improve my memory being that I would be constantly remembering multiple things that I had to do at a time."
good,Was a great company before amazon owned. Instead of being family oriented became very corporate and alot of benefits and things were cut. Before amazon was an amazing place to work.
good,"You are bound to meet someone you will remain friends with outside of work. The management is inconsistent, I had 4 to 5 store managers in my 6 years."
good,I worked in the coffee bar at wfm and it was really fun. The management was good and fun to be around/talk to as long as you had your work in order they weren't overbearing or giving you a hard time. It was very independent and you knew what to do and you'd just do it.
good,honestly working hard only takes you so far. Management will move up someone they are friends with before they give you a chance. They will pretend as if it is fair even when it isn’t.
good,Great place and environment to work in. Everyone is pretty supportive and close knit. Respectful and customer service driven. Leadership opportunities available
good,"a typical day at was very busy but great but had a great work flow "
good,"Every grocery store has values which they try to maintain. They weren't always apparent at Whole Foods. The management was very kind and supportive, even picked up tasks and did maintenance around the store."
good,"I quit Wholefoods Market because I was lied on by a manager. Because of the lie i lost a day or 2 of work. When the lie came to light no further action was taken with the manager,  I just was able to return to work. To me it’s a big deal to treat all employees equally no matter the job title. If someone in a higher level is able to lie on lower level employees to where that persons job is at risk, I don’t want to be apart of that team."
good,What I like about Wholefoods is that their environment is a bit different from the other jobs I’ve work with the management and the employees are very kind .
good,"My day consist of dealing with customers, Food preparation,using slicer. I have learn how to weigh and measure food , also learned food safety temperatures and preparing international meals. The Management is Very nice and Professional. Great environment to work. Thejob is not hard all i had great training. My enjoyable moments are the Customer faces when i satisfied their request."
good,"It all depends on you, if you wanna advance or get promoted or stay as you are. Be on time, do your job, always try to take a new challenge. And follow all rules."
good,"Love the people, disliked the corporate environment. They took away benefits from staff. Schedule was constantly fluctuating due to corporate demands. Did learn many skills"
good,Whole Foods was better for employees and consumers before Amazon took over and I feel it's moved away from certain things that made customers keep brand loyalty.
good,"Great place to work for, not hard to turn it into more then just a job as theres multiple chances for promotion, however if you're not willing to turn it into a career choice, dont expect much more than an entry level job with flexible hours."
good,"Company culture and workplace atmosphere made working for WFM pleasant. However, loyal employees should be better included in healthcare benefit packages."
good,"Team members is what makes working there very enjoyable. the culture of the company is great, but can always use a little more improvement. Once a year they show appreciation for employees."
good,"Whole Foods was a fun workplace. Coworkers were all wonderful. Moved up within the company from PT to FT within 6 months, promoted to team mentor, to orderer, to assistant manager."
good,"I was happy working at Whole Foods, and staff/management was wonderful. I had some troubles balancing work and school, and was scheduled a bit more than I would have liked to be. I think this was mostly due to the specific timing of my hiring, when the amount of salad bar chefs at our store was minimal, and they really needed someone there. Overall it was a positive experience and I would recommend working there to others."
good,"Working as dishwasher in the prepared foods department was a very solid 1st job. Management was great, and even though I was often the only dishwasher working and the workload was a lot, it was never more than I could handle and other workers would often step in and help out if they were finished with their work."
good,"Very friendly and customer service based job. Whole Foods is a very fun environment to be in being that the store layout is always changing along with the seasons. Management definitely care about their staff and this is shown on a day to day basis. The hardest part of this job is learning about the many different items that this store has. From organic options to non-gmo, this store has it all!"
good,The company has many great people to work with but acquisition by Amazon has caused difficulties that challenge the core nature of  WFM's culture. It is important to bare in mind that each store is unique and some are better to work at than others.
good,"Whole Foods is a good company to work for. The hours are very flexible if you're part time, not so much for full time because you have to have open availability. I feel like I have very good job security. If you're running late make sure to call. If you're not going to make it at all, try to inform store leadership 1-2 hours before your shift starts. Whole Foods has a point system so depending on how late"
good,"I would describe this job as easy and steady, but sometimes it does get a little boring and repetitive. You have to request time off three weeks in advance which is a lot, and it's hard to get shifts covered because you have so many coworkers and no efficient way to contact them."
good,love the environment you can have some customers that are difficult to help but you do with what you got. Just felt like i might have been over looked do to others reasons. Felt like they were not able to understand my some of my veteran disabilities. but overall good place to work.
good,Whole Foods Market was a very fun and healthy environment to work in until Amazon took over.  A lot of changes happened and it quickly turned into a stressful environment to work in.
good,"Fast work place environment, definite ability to grow and move up in the company. Good management overall and good shift times.  A positive work culture in the organic and natural food industry."
good,"Whole Foods was one of the most fun jobs I've ever had. I was taught how to make several unique dishes, many of which I still cook for myself years later. There were certainly spurts of activity, so many days had rush periods as well as slow periods. The co-workers and managers were pleasant, and the general environment was enjoyable. Customer service was a top priority and the customer base was polite and eager to learn about new healthy life options."
good,"very good chances of advancement if you are will to work for it. depending on the the volume you run, it can really get stressful. customers are empowered and some of them can get abusive."
good,"Expect to give your customers excellent customer service. They come in expecting a pleasant visit and quality product. It's a must to be a team player and willing to help not just those in your department, but around the store as well."
good,whole foods is an alright company to work for if you first trying to get a job but if who have a better career option then go for that instead but they are flexible with school hours as well
good,"I’d work here again if I really had to go backwards."
good,"Whole Foods hires great people. Everyone works as a team to get the job done. Unfortunately, its a very political company. Pay was not enough for cost of living."
good,"Typical day was not demanding. The company does not require much from its employees, but there is little to no attempt to invest in them either. The management is virtually nonexistent."
good,"Great benefits, great sense of team work. "
good,I value my career at Whole Foods. I have benefited from many opportunities to grow professionally and personally. I have been allowed to show my value and to apply my skills effectively.
good,It was a learning experience for me in the job market. I learned a lot about working on teams and also working in a store. I had to learned about prioritizing what needed to be done in the store so as team we could be successful in our department.
good,I started with a good team and great manager but once she left and people started getting fired for really stupid things. Dynamic changes and morale went down. I left afterward for better opportunities.
good,"Pre amazon whole foods was a great place to work. You learned constantly, the people were fun and the core values meant something to each team member."
good,"this was a very enjoyable job overall. i would come in every day about the same time to set the seafood case before the store opens. it would be a relaxed first few hours, followed by a few hours of slow business. the day would start getting busy around 1030 or 11 and thats when the backup would show up to give you a lunch. after coming back, it would be busy for the last couple hours then you would head home. so overall you would get in at 530, have a pretty easy time till lunch aroun 10 or 11. then be busy with the load and helping customers till 2. this was my everyday as the seafood buyer. normally i would have monday and wednesday off."
good,"When I started with WholeFoods the culture was very different.  Each store was very ""local"" and reflected the city/town that they were located in.  Creativity was encouraged and the job was much more fun.  After a few years it became more corporate and stuffy and the individual store feeling left and they all feel the same now."
good,"Nice culinary culture in the specialty department at my store, helped me grow into a large interest of beer culture in my career with a growing passion"
good,"It was a grocery store. Depending on the size of store is the biggest factor in job difficulty. Benefits were good at my time of hire, however each year was a concession on some level."
good,"It  was a very nice place to work  upper management sucks if they don’t like you they find a way to get you out of the store for no reason at all ,Amazon  came in with the new policy’s that had employees to do things that they wasn’t used to doing and gave us options if we want to continue working there or if you want to be paid out."
good,"Worked at 3 different stores in a couple departments, liked most of it. Since Amazon bought Whole Foods, the culture has taken a hit but they increased the base pay which compensated for that. Good benefits and a good discount on their products."
good,"Clock In"
good,I love working 4 whole foods there benefits ate good the culture is good manament need more traing just need to get paid every week and customer need to be nicer
good,i worked for Wholefoods prior and after Bezos brought the company so i was there for the shift change. Its an overall great company that cares about their employees  for the most part. i learned alot about food safety and preparation. they are very diligent in that regards. a typical day would consist of stocking the shelves and assisting customers.
good,"i enjoyed working at whole foods, respected management, and enjoyed the culture/being part of the team. I was given plenty of training experience not only at the register but around the store so that i was familiar with the products. overall it was a fun and enjoyable place to go to work."
good,"My position gave me the leniency to move freely from department to department, creating new adventures every day. "
good,"They give you instructions and tips on your job. Its really busy, mid-day and alot of people asking where things are. Sometimes schedule can be a little annoying but you can tell them in advance if that day doesnt work for you."
good,Decent place to work overall. Had good times and Bad ones. Had good supervisors and bad ones. Just like any other job you work at. You win some you lose some...
good,"Days can be hectic, but if you have a good team behind you, it can be an enjoyable experience. Moreover, the positions you can be trained at can be leveraged to show off many transferable skills that can be used in other industries."
good,"A day at whole foods never held something that was particularly unexpected. The primary source of frustration was poor communication from management and a lack of organized ordering at all. That being said the work was stable and the pay was ok and the benefits were nice, but it wasn't anything special. An unbelievable number of logs to fill out."
good,"Goals and mission set by his company are great. They aimed to take care of the employees, customers and environment as best as they can. Unfortunately they didn’t always hit these goals more so than you should have."
good,"Only worked part time and had to leave for school. Great environment, Whole Foods really educates their employees and full time workers get great benefits."
good,"The only issue that I would find at this place is the management, not fully training and just letting employees learn on their own and when errors where committed management would blame it on other employees"
good,"Good experience overall. The hours were good, and the pay was good, as well. They recently raised minimum wage to $15/hr, but this transition is rubbing raw the old-timers."
good,Management was very male dominant and cliquey.  I loved the company as a whole but wasn’t getting credit for my hard work.  Many coworkers were also personally sabotaged by management.
good,"Workdays at WFM were very routine and structured, usually with set lists that dictated tasks to individuals.  There is a lot of room for advancement in the company; you get out of the job what you put into it."
good,"Assess the quality of stock received and escalate any discrepancies to suppliers and management."
good,"Opened the only store in my area, had a great time. Management communication could be better but not the worst. Some departments are easier than others. The shift leaders can be horrible but are given permission to be horrible if they are ""new"" or ""learning"" the role."
good,"I'm not sure how the company culture has changed since Amazon's acquirement, but when I was there I was compensated fairly and appreciated for my hard work. My manager in Portland was a pleasure to work with! However, my manager in Salt Lake City was not."
good,The hours are not flexible so you either come in at 7am or at 2pm. The workplace culture was okay until we got new managers that shook things up too much. They were not trained very well and had personality clashes with the employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with no shows and busy times when you would have to manage 3 sections at once. what iI liked most was the atmosphere and job culture. I learned that you have to commit to whole foods lifestyle and culture to truly feel comfortable and advance.
good,"The people are cool, and very helpful. The work was easy to learn. The pay was decent, they also gave discount on products which came in handy.  Overall good experience"
good,It was my kind of place as I am health conscience. It was full of respect & comfort. I learned so much about the brand and food quality. Everyone was so friendly
good,Not bad. Co workers were great. Customers are demanding and unintentionally hilarious. Upper management take there role very seriously. The pay was low but competitive for the market
good,"This is a great place that is continuously growing. "
good,"I have been with Whole Foods for a long time , I have enjoyed Every minute of it . But I feel that for my career I am ready to work in the field I’m the medical field and I am ready to take what I have learned with my customer service skills to another type of work"
good,"This was just my personal experience at one store, everyone has their own likes and dislikes. "
good,"Under Amazon, minimum pay is $15 an hr.  Benefits are decent and improve with length of service.  For a national retail grocer, it's a great company to work for with lots of opportunity for advancement based on effort and skill - non Union environment means you get promoted for your hard work, even if you are new to the Company.  The values driven company philosophy is still spoken of, mostly as marketing these days as the old school leaders are gradually being replaced by managers from Target, Walmart, and other traditional retailers.  The culture has changed as a result.  Work experience can vary greatly based on location and team/department within the store.  Lots of inexperienced managers  make some teams frustrating and stressful places while other teams enjoy consistent scheduling, clear goals, motivating and enjoyable interactions with management, and an almost effortless sense of success.  There is a lot of opportunity to get to know the people you work with and it is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the culture.  The worst part of working for WFM is even after 40 years, the Company is still not quite decided on who it is and what it is trying to offer so most locations still suffer from reactive decision making.  A VIP visit one week means labor budget is irrelevant and focus is on floor presentation and standards but the next week, with a Holiday approaching, labor has to be cut and the floor standards are not a concern.  Not unique to retail.  If you have to work retail, WFM is a great option, especially if you are OK learning on the fly, taking on responsibility"
good,"I learned to be at a fast pace, keep areas clean, have things done on time, and be collaborative. If you like being rushed, people complaining at you for the most absurd reasons, being covered with juice and smoothies, and no team member help, Juice Bar is the right department to be at. Honestly, the department manager does not schedule people based on their availability and also forgets to fill in uncovered shifts. People in the department are awesome! When there are rushes, it is hard for other team members to help with orders like juices. Sometimes there is just one juicer and 6 orders in a row, so the lack of materials ends on backing up orders. A Juice Bar position takes patience and time to get use to. I'm not trying to scare anyone, just keep in mind that you've got to be quick-minded."
good,"I was a produce receiver/opener at Whole Foods Market. I would arrive between 12am-2am. I was responsible for organizing and putting the departments produce away. I also would set the sales floor while checking for price changes. I was also responsible for assisting other Team Members with there tasks. Whole Foods is an excellent company to work for, but I felt Leadership and TM were frequently overworked due to being short staffed. My favorite part about working there was the people and the culture. Benefits are great, good pay, good management, and fun work environment."
good,I enjoyed working at Wholefoods because of the benefits that they offered. All employee gets 15% discount on all product that they purchased. I would recommend to a friend or someone to work at this place.
good,"I liked working at whole foods, whole foods was my part time job for six years and i must say as the management changed the working environment changed. However what is universal about Whole Foods is the the reinforcement of a teamwork dynamic"
good,"It was fun, I enjoyed learning what i could but I could never be hired as full time even when I was ""promoted"" to work the customer service booth they still did not let me go full time after telling me i would."
good,Good people to work with but management needed better training.Enjoyed the culture of the company until Amazon took over. Culture declined and it loss the uniqueness it once had as a company.
good,Interact with diversified customers.  Participated in/ won contests in a lot of its inhouse marketing geared towards helping other parts of the world.
good,"Very friendly staff + customers"
good,"At Whole Foods Market, it can be very fast-paced and busy on any given day. However, the work environment is meant to be positive and collaborative with each team member working together to make the workday balanced and fulfilling."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wholefoods, got to meet bunches of cool people and be encouraged to be healthy. I really enjoyed being a part of their activities program."
good,"I enjoyed the job but it would have been better without the stress that comes with trying to meet expectations/guidelines that management didn't train for. It could be possible that this just applies to my store. Whole Foods Market is continuously changing its organization practices which have positive outcomes, however, it is a stressful process."
good,A Typical day at work consists of assisting customers with whatever they needed. I learned a lot about organic items and heathy eating habits from whole foods. Management was always really nice. The hardest part was just standing for 8 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking and getting to know a lot of different customers.
good,"Whole Foods is a really good company to work for but can lack in management organization. It is a really easy job depending on what department you work in, in regards to compensation. There is also room for career advancement if you want to stay with the company long term."
good,prepared foods team member part time. Learned a lot through training and having food experience helped. management was unorganized and it made working there stressful. overall whole foods is a good company to work for.
good,"It's easy to get through a shift, it pays very well and the people that I get to work with have become my best friends. It can be stressful at times and the customers are obnoxious but it's easy and rewarding."
good,"The team members is what makes work fun and bearable, like every work place it does have its clicks. Some times upper management doesn't listen to the concerns of the people who actually work on the floor. They have a good benefit package and you have opportunity to grow if you push yourself and give up free time."
good,"I have been working at Whole Foods since August 2018.  When I was hired I was told that everyone starts out part-time, but after working there for a while I discovered this is not true.  Others were hired full-time when the store was opened a year ago. I have expressed my interest in full-time employment many times, only to be told that nothing is available.  At the same time, others are being promoted and moved to different areas of the store."
good,"Working for the Bakery Team full time, Whole Foods offer pretty good benefit package and good work/life experience. Working content is not complicated but can be repetitive at times. Working culture is awesome and very fun people to work with. Overall you learn a lot and it was a great experience."
good,"over all good job, just unfortunate they couldn't work around my school hours. worked with wonderful people and even had the chance to make great relationships with customers as well."
good,"As with any retail job you're bound to be anchored to a cash register for the majority of the day. The pace of the job is monotonous, but if you can get past that the community is great and not very stressful."
good,"Overall it was a very fun place to work with a great work culture. Of course, it's Customer Service with all that comes with that- not all customers are nice and it's demanding but for the most part, I liked my customers- be prepared for a million ""whole paycheck"" jokes. "
good,What i love most at whole foods are the coworkers who make me feel welcomed. They always compliment how hard of a worker I am and offer to buy me coffee or a snack. I also like the new $15 an hour pay.  Definitely a better job experience compared to my last one.
good,"A typical day is either super busy or a slow crawl. If you work a shift during lunch, it will go by real quick. But closing shifts after dinner is incredibly slow. I learned a lot about how to deal with difficult customers, and difficult coworkers. How to prepare food in a professional kitchen setting. How to operate dish washing equipment. It was nice enough working there, the people made it enjoyable, but the work was dull most of the time. The hardest part of the job was motivating myself to make a 90 minute commute to work every day."
good,"strong values and great learning tools for their products."
good,good place for learning how to deal with food services. friendly staff and management with clear policy guidelines. company offers incentives to boost work productivity.
good,"It was a decent job, a little politics, but most people were cool. Some people took themselves a little too seriously, but you get that anywhere (except the candy factory)."
good,Overall not a bad job as long as you are willing to work. Working for WFM you will quickly learn to have a sense of urgency. you must have good customer service skills.
good,Whole Foods was a job for those who like the customer interaction. It was also backed up with decent starting pay and gave the opportunity to advance if you worked for it.
good,"Great for those without schedule restrictions. I truly enjoyed working in a healthy workplace, it was easy to live a healthy lifestyle in that environment. I was, however, forced to find other employment when told that I had to have completely an open schedule or was not going to be held at full-time. This is a difficult thing to accomplish with childcare restrictions."
good,Not a bad place to work. Lots of growth opportunities. Some favoritism shown making it difficult to get higher in the company than the people you rub elbows with. Culture has changed tremendously in the last several years. People are still great though!
good,"My job wasn't too bad, but due to budget cuts dish washing went from being a two to a one man job right before I was hired. And with the cooks having gone from a staff of three to two, old employees began to adopt a sluggish and negative attitude towards their work, while newer employees seemed to have all responsibilities completed with time to spare after, and would look to see who else could use help. The company gave a great number of benefits and seemed a bit more morally concerned than many others out there."
good,Whole Foods Market was a great place to work! It's a mission-driven company that prioritizes team members and local non-profits. Loved being able to select quarterly non-profit recipients for the bag donation program.
good,I loved my job here and wish the circumstances were different and that my situation be thoroughly reviewed by upper management because i was treated very unfairly and unjustly upon my seperation frm this company.
good,"I've been employed with this company for almost 14 years and my overall experience has been great!"
good,"The best thing about working at Whole Foods, is the employees and the cultures it brings. I've met some of the coolest people working at Whole Foods, who come from many different backgrounds but mainly have the same goal in life. I lot of our employees are students, so hearing different interests are always fun. Management is good also, while that depends on the location but it is easy to build relationships and trust if you're a hard worker."
good,"This job, as a whole, was a satisfactory experience. I learned a lot, and gained many skills. The people I encountered along the way were amazing and supportive. The culture of the company was originally experimental, democratic, and generous, making room for employee input and voices. I believe this contributed to a successful company and customer satisfaction. Now that the company is on such a large scale and owned by Amazon, I'm not sure the current culture aligns with the original values and tenants that made the company successful in the first place."
good,"I liked working there, everyone was down to earth, liked what I was doing, management turned pretty quickly, Loved the position I had, took care of the hot bar, loved everyone I worked with, they all were great at what they were there for.  The only draw back, I got hurt on the job, had dr. notes to stay off the job because I could not lift anything, did not file workman's comp, but gave Dr. notes, when returning, had new HR management, said I had to go thru the whole hiring process again."
good,"it was great. made good friends and management is friendly. the pay is good for customer service, but i don't know about other departments. it is a relaxed job and a place for growth."
good,No thanks not unless you want to pay me for my time. I do not give marketing to former employers for free. More words to finish this up blah blah blah
good,"The work was simple and gave the opportunity to truly connect with the customers. The management was very understanding and willing to compensate with any workers who might have issues with their schedules. The management was very friendly, willing to help and fun to work with."
good,"My duty at WFM is to prepare wholesome healty dishes for our customers who ar keen on quality and presentation."
good,I liked working there. Always surrounded by great people having a good time at work. Teamwork is really important here. You can always pick up hours! Sunday & holidays are time & a half!
good,Fast paced store with room for growth. But management always side with the customers even when they wrong. You get 7 days a year for sick days to call out without it affecting your attendance.
good,"Overall, working for Whole Foods was a pleasant experience.  There are practices that may have some people perturbed, but being a corporation, it goes with the territory.  The team leaders are some of the most supportive and understanding people that one could work with.  It was definitely a place where you could have fun and get the job done."
good,"I started with this company  a cashier position that lasted for about 4 to 5 years, then i moved over to bakery where I gained so much knowledge about organic food. Overall I have been with this company for about 11 years. The hardest part about the job was dealing with rude people but I always find the best way to handle these types of situations.The most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday and the great team work from management."
good,"Each day is going to be different depending on which department you work in and what day of the week it is. Since it is a grocery store the busiest days of the week are the weekends, as well as after 5pm. The employees are very friendly with each other, but even a higher end grocery store still has the same issues that plague all retail positions."
good,"Whole Foods, helped me to advance my career as a Meat and Seafood Associate Team Leader. They gave me positive guidance and an environment to learn and grow."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of a short meeting and then doing my primary task of cashiering. "
good,You can climb the ladder at WFM but it is competitive. Management can be some what biased but that goes for any big organization. Just keep you head high and mouth shut and if you want to you can move up.
good,"Great customers, awesome concept, lots of giving back. If you were not sucking up to the management there was no room for a promotion. After trying for months I finally found out that despite my team leader telling me I could apply she was telling other hiring team leaders I was not a good candidate."
good,"Entry-Level job with great opportunities for advancement and equal starting pay for all, regardless of job description. Great benefits including health insurance, 401k and stock options. Paid time off is based on service hours worked."
good,"good pay and good co workers, problems with scheduling though. i had to skip class multiple times to go to work. also difficult to ask off in advance but i would recommend the job as a whole."
good,"Their hyper focus on customer satisfaction gets in the way of protecting employees from unruly customers. "
good,"You are expected to enjoy your work. The friendly coworkers make it possible, but pressure from regional management after Amazon bought out Whole Foods, began to show more and more. More was expected of everyone with no provided compensation in return. In fact, Team Member appreciation events dwindled more and more as that took precious work time. The pay is good for entry level, the work can be demanding, but the coworkers and management are in it together."
good,great place to work for a college student
good,"In the last 5 years I have worked there I have had the chance to participate in there leadership programs and it’s great. It’s been an adventure working in all the different areas of Wholefoods and it has made me more versatile within the company. I have learned so much from the warehouse to store level,overnights and leadership positions."
good,"my time  spent at wholefoods i learned a lot about food, teamwork, and healthy way of living. Also was pat of opening many store which always was a blast."
good,"Whole Foods is a great place to start for a part-time entry level customer service job.  Flexible for young college students  and decent benefits. Discount is reasonable. They  encourages team members to be friendly with one another. However, I found that at the several stores I worked in the young people were very cliquey and judemental. Management was ok, it really depends on the type of personality your supervisor had."
good,"A great company suitable for people of all ages and backgrounds to find a place in and start a career. A lot of good people there, very friendly and helpful, the company has a great goal that is very underappreciated."
good,I worked there during a restructuring and unfortunately did not see eye to eye with protocol surrounding the consolidation of Amazon and Whole Foods so I left.
good,"Good work environment, with a good community. Adequate training for advancement. Great discount. Health care above average with flexible health spending card."
good,"A typical day is enjoyable for the fact that you can start your day with something nutritious and talk about it with customers or coworkers. I learned that to have a good and productive day before the day begins, the team should be on the same page. The Redmond store, we would huddle up, go over sales, and what our plan of action would be for the week. Sometimes management can be a difficult situation thus can make or break your future plans, but overall there are usually great team members or other managers to help fix any problems you are having. The only difficulties you may have working here are mainly with customers. The most enjoyable part about working here is that there is so much opportunity with the company or to network through your peers."
good,I loved working here but the management was very confused and they like to blame anyone for anything. The hours are long and they wouldn't switch my hours around.
good,"During my time with this company, I had the greatest opportunity in helping people with their grocery and meal preperations. I was also able to help educate the community about better aggricultural food practices."
good,I enjoyed management. They bought out the best in me. I got to eat food i would never  had if i did not work at Whole food. I have told my friend that its a good place to work with great benefits. You have to be willing to go up and beyond
good,"Its a great company to work for you get to meet a lot of fun customers and people.  The management is really nice and flexible.  The hardest part of the job is just keeping up with the product of the supplies and orders,"
good,Great culture and great learning experience. I left because I found a better paying position elsewhere. I'd still recommend it for teens and for people trying to get some experience.
good,Not a bad place to work. The pay is better than most. Culture has changed quite a but but still better than most places. They will work you hard though.
good,"I had a lot of fun working in prepared foods and also learned a lot about cooking, food safety, grocery stores, and general culinary info. A good company to stick with and move up."
good,Great first job in graphic design. Stayed for 16 years. Learned a lot about managing my time with projects and production needs. Loved every opportunity to be creative and work with different people.
good,"Whole Foods was a fairly fun environment. Interesting Co-Workers, even more interesting Customers. A lot of management are backwards in their ways from my experience. Overall a decent part time job. Great job if you are willing to relocate and move forward."
good,"I worked at WFM for 5 years, prior to Amazon.  It was a great place to work.  Stores operated under the same rule, yet independently at the same time.  Overall, I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Solid place to work. The coworkers make the job even more enjoyable. I was able to  increase my abilities in customer service, cash handling, and working with a team."
good,"Very attractive place to work because someone can learn so many things about food, american culture and work basis."
good,The break room was always well stocked with treats for the team members. There was a tv and a ping pong table. Team members were always supplied with products from the distributors. It really encouraged the team to sell the products they tried. Team members were generally very content. I still enjoy visiting the store.
good,"It is very fast paced position. I like the company and you get discounts in the store. I think that's my favorite part."
good,"alot of cleaning "
good,The people you work with are amazing.  It's a happy and productive place to work with a lot of opportunity if you choose to look for it and want to advance. I would go back in a heartbeat if the nuts weren't there.
good,typical day was at least 8 hours in office with 1-2 hours at home depending on issues occurring. I was on call 24/7. this was hard on my family.
good,"a typical day at wholefoods consist of a very diverse demographic of people,  many customers are in a very friendly mood so it makes working a bit easier ,"
good,I had an awesome time while working at whole foods. I learned a lot about organic foods and how to give proper customer service. It was an experience I will never forget.
good,"I enjoyed most of my coworkers and the pay was good for the position. However the manager for my department was not great. She was rude with her employees and ignored availability, constantly scheduling people when they could not work and getting mad when approached about it. She was not easy to go to with workplace issues or concerns."
good,"I worked in a commissary kitchen that made all the prepared foods for 34 store locations in the midwest.  Our job was busy and hard labor, but the people were great to work with.  Refugees from Haiti and Burma were given employment in our kitchen and they were some of the kindest and hardworking people I have come to know.  It is a great company for many people, but it was just not for me in the long run."
good,A typical day at work consist of doing inventory and also putting up Items in proper coolers and placing daily orders.   The most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers with problems
good,"All in all any job is what you make it. I was able to advance from a part time customer service team member to a full time prep food team member because I was available and flexible and they needed the help. Dealing with management from my experience was easy going. The atmosphere was fast paced and relaxed. Everyone was aware of their job duties and how they assisted the team with their strengths. Depending upon where you live, salary may or may not be ideal!"
good,"I really enjoyed working here, I would walk into work and just feel a great energy upon entrance. My coworkers were always happy and we made sure we made others happy as well. The work as a cashier was easy and it made the day roll by very quickly."
good,"Except that it doesn't pay that well, there are loads of perks.  The company trains management to treat you respectfully and in all the efforts the company does make you feel appreciated.  They do have many things that show an extra effort to treat you like you are important. Hardest thing can be cart runs in weather. Most enjoyable part of the job is customer service, being around people, and also being in a brand that upholds practices to more natural and healthy living and honoring the earth.  The culture is fun."
good,"This company is a good one to work for without any college background. The pay is the best you will get for any Grocery in the Houston area, as they pay well above minimum wage. Know this, this company takes punctuality very seriously."
good,"Overall Whole Foods Market was a wonderful place to work. The environment was positive, and managers were always helpful with critical feedback and wanting to see you advance in your role. Your work was recognized by upper management."
good,It's a nice place to work but there's limited chasing for getting a full time position because of they're policy. On a good note it's a nice place to start your work history.
good,"Don't get involved with drama. Otherwise, coworkers are pretty cool. Company culture and activities are there if you want to participate. "
good,"Whole Foods is no longer a place for full time work. Perfect for a college student , or a part time job. Pay is decent compared to other places but you don’t really get the hours. Managemt sucks across the board. Try any department besides prepared foods ! Also a very strick attendance policy ."
good,"You get back what you put in to your job at Whole Foods. The culture can be relaxed- but that depends on the amount of responsibility you'll allow management to hand you. You wont receive extra compensation for your hard work- you put in the work and when the time comes you'll receive the pay offs of having your manager push for a better raise, or a promotion. The customers can be testy- you have to remember what you're there for- customer service is the highest priority over all. Remain professional and indifferent and there's no one you cannot make friends with at work!"
good,I enjoyed my time at WFM but was glad to leave after two years and figure out a bigger path for myself. Turnovers were often as the seasons changed it seemed and it was a bit stressful as times.
good,Whole foods is a diverse cultural work environment that thrives on keeping the customer happy and I learned some great things work and un work related during my time there.whole foods has some great employees that makes the work place comfortable
good,"Lack of leadership and just all around bad leadership make it not worth it. They pay well , just end up in the right store with the right boss. Great opportunity to advance as long as you are good with politics and wish to be stressed out. I wouldn’t recommend the deli. Seafood, grocery, or customer service would be much easier."
good,"Productive workplace, & Great benefits. Schedule very inconsistent, but workload is light depending on position. Great environment, & good chemistry between departments to help run the store."
good,Great atmosphere but hard to advance in company. It really helps to know the right people and it is very easy to remain in the same position unless you voice out your interest.
good,Started here at 18 and the advancement I was able to make in the 4 years I was there was acceptable. I would recommend working for this company to anyone who is at a standstill in life
good,"Overall, it's a good job.  My team was pretty good and for the most part everyone got along well enough.  The pay wasn't very much like most grocery store jobs.  If you live at home or have roommates, then it might be enough.  I loved seeing a lot of unique items throughout the store that you wouldn't typically see in your average grocery store."
good,Entry pay is fair. Team is happy and enthusiastic. Needs more incentive and bonus for entry level. Management needs to engage more to setup employees to grow.
good,The team workers were extremely diverse and the staff is so nice. I learned so much on the job not just about the different workers but customers. I learned skills like patience and assisting people efficiently. I also learned a lot about healthy eating.
good,"I loved working for WFM.  They are passionate about their team members, the community, and the world.  They held panel interviews for any job above an entry level team member, and that process was a wonderful tool for advancement."
good,"I had a great time working at whole foods."
good,"Working overnights, I learned that keeping a strict sleep schedule should be your top priority so that way you have the energy to have a productive day at work and plenty of energy to spare"
good,"Passionate coworkers who stand by what they do, very knowledgeable. Management can be clicky.  Long hours during holidays. Benefits and paid time off."
good,"I worked in the Prepared Food division and my experience there was mostly positive. It's a large group so there's lots of support and collaboration, but there's also a lot of internal quarrels; mainly bickering about other coworkers. The hourly staff can often prove unreliable, but that's usually how it goes in any grocery store (I worked for Safeway in their deli for 3 years and I would recommend Whole Foods way before I would even mention Safeway as an option). Upper management can be very approachable which is a huge plus, and you accumulate paid time off with every hour you work. There's a 30 minute lunch, which is a great luxury and once every 2 weeks they give a free meal. Overall, the Whole Foods' culture is great, but if you're trying to get a job there, I'd try to avoid the Prep Foods department; I think it's the hardest department to work in any grocery store."
good,"Biweekly pay, benefits, equal opportunity, employee discount, paid time off, dental, vision, 401k fidelity investments, paid sick leave (in seattle because of state law)"
good,"My years at WFM were very good, I took that position as a temporary while I find something that pays more money and I ended up staying for over 6 years. It didin't offer career advancements for a Graphic Designer but it was a fun environment with great benefits."
good,I enjoyed working for this company I started out as part time and within 6 months I was asked on as full time. Almost everyone I worked with was nice and I got a promotion with a raise while there. It's super fast paced and I work nearly every weekend.
good,"Wholefoods market its a very busy enviroment i learned a lot how to bake , have great customer service , greet customers , multi task ,even had a supervision position for other employees , catering as well . the hardest parts of working there is holiday catering , inventories overnight ."
good,"Depending on the location and department you work it is a fast-paced job. Many Team Leaders are whole foods career folk and have seen a lot of chance in the company. Many are fair and work with you as long as you communicate. Has core values that revolve around customers, team members, and suppliers as well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with hard-core entitled customers."
good,I loved working there! It was a fun place to work. I loved trying out all the new fun foods that used to come around. A very friendly atmosphere and healthy delicious foods everywhere.
good,"depending on what city youre in, whole foods is a pretty rad place to work. team members are most excellent across the board, management seems to be hit or miss. great benefits, morale, and pace. this review is based on my employment with the company from 2005-2012"
good,"Lack of understanding between Store Leadership and Team Leaders. Sometimes the job can be stressful, but I still enjoy the job. The company promotes from within so hard work and dedication can earn you promotions and bonuses."
good,Company is very good at solving problems between employees. Open door policy for all management even across departments. Never felt afraid or upset when talking to management about my problems.
good,"My job at wholefoods was amazing for a long time. But as the company's corporate management started to prepare to sell the company to amazon mid level management panicked and jumped ship. Many stores were understaffed, poorly maintained, and departments were being cut too heavily. I was trying to lower my hours to 20 a week to fit in my other job and they continued to refuse to reduce my hours. The hours I was given were rough due to low staff counts and responsibilities only increased with no fair pair raises for the duties."
good,"Nothing is easy and free in life and you have to work for it."
good,"Prepare department for day's business.  I learned to work with others in a professional manner.  Management was under pressure to perform and instilled in it's employees encoragement and tools to succeed.  The most difficult part of the job was working in a refrigerated environment.  Themost enjoyable part of the job was the benefits offerd by the company, especially Team Builds."
good,"Once I got the burger/sandwich station down to a science, every shift is a smooth and pleasant experience. My customers are respectful as I am respectful to them."
good,"Joined the company in September 2015 as a grocery TM. Quickly showed my ability to maintain positive company image by providing courteous, friendly and efficient customer service as well maintaining regional standards."
good,Whole foods was the best place to work for in terms of pay (for the position) and the benefits. Unfortunately there is a lot of politics going on behind the scenes. It's a company that would rather bring in a outsider than to advance someone from within.
good,"Whole Foods Market provides a variety of shifts and jobs available within the store. As a Team Member with Whole Foods, I learned much about healthy eating, as well as quality retail techniques and practices. As a member of the management team, I was part of a hard-working and enthusiastic group of professionals dedicated to the company mission."
good,"When I had started working at Whole Foods it was a fun and great learning experience, but throughout the months that I had begun working there many of the great managers had moved on up to higher positions while those who were given their previous positions did not have the best qualities for the job, but after some time had passed they began to slowly show some progress."
good,Working at Wholefoods on the maintenance team is not hard depending on your store size. I learned to pay attention to details and work in busy areas. Wholefoods has this family culture but is also good at maintaining the business side as well.
good,"A typical day at work was to clock in, meet the grocery team at our meeting spot. I would assign the aisles to my team and then when would talk about expectations for the day and any new updates such as promotional deals stuff like that. Then we would break off into our aisles to check star tag (tags that indicated if we had the product in back stock) depending on the number of stars showing meant you had to check the back stock and either filled product to shelf or pulled tag because we were out. Sometime our dairy team would behind so i would gather some grocery team members to help face the dairy department. Facing is bring the product to the lip of the shelf and also set up 2-3 more of the same product behind the first row. After was done we would go back to facing our aisles, checking star tags and providing amazing customer service. Then when it came to closing the store i had to walk around and check all our aisle to make sure it was faced and stocked for the morning shift."
good,"The team is nice and most customer are happy to come shop their. The team like to tell each other, whenever they are closing everyone help each other. team work."
good,"Relaxed environment for the most part.  Very laid back and comfortable company to work for.  Customers tended to be of a higher caliber, as far as happy, friendly human beings."
good,Had a great time at wholefoods i would do it all over again the team members there work and talk to each other about everything that goes on in the store
good,"This is a good company to work for. You get paid well, and they will offer you benefits after working 800 service hours. Paid time off is based on the hours you accumulate. Lots of opportunity to grow if you put in the work and the effort"
good,"As a cashier, my shifts were very inconsistent. One week I'll work 4 days with varying shift times, the next I would work 6 days and they would be straight closing shifts. I did learn a lot while working for the company. I learned all about organic food and how it's grown and I learned the importance of customer service. Personally, the hardest part of my job was my managers. It was incredibly disorganized the way management was setup. We had 1 team leader, 3 Associated Team Leaders, and about 5 supervisors. It was always challenge coming in because you weren't sure who to report to, and it was even worse when trying to talk to someone about shift changes, I was constantly brushed aside and was told to talk to the team leader, who told me to talk to the ATL's, and they would tell me to talk to the supervisors. The most enjoyable thing about Whole Foods was the experience I gained from it and the importance of customer service. Honestly, I feel like Whole Foods made me into a nicer person."
good,The hardest part of prepared foods was the deep cleans that took place ever 3 weeks. The most enjoyable was the interaction with the guest/customers. Management was not as professional as I expected.
good,"Wholefoods was a great job. Not only did I grow and moved up in payments but I started eating healthy. Wholefoods encourages all workers to eat good and to always have great energy. Never was a dull moment working their. I learned to have patience, multitasking and time management."
good,What I liked about working at Whole Foods is how well they work with your schedule. If you are a student this would be a very good job for you. Also the people that work there make it worthwhile.
good,Whole Foods pays their employees very well with a good starting pay and fair raises every year. Downsides of this job is a lot of people get fired for stupid policys like time and attendance or get put on finals for 6 months and can be fired for literally anything their manager deems worthy.
good,"Carefully transport grocery pallets to the sales floor using electric or regular palletjacks. Take down all items from the pallets and sort them to each assigned aisle. Essentials use of box cutters and protective gloves to take out all items from boxes and plastics wraps to start the stocking process. Each night log into the computer to verify special orders, display items and supervisors requests. Make sure the end of every aisle must be cleared of cardboxes & plastic wraps. Identify soon to be expired or expired products, and put overstock items on designated racks. Fill water coolers and face items of each aisle to look more appealing to our customers. If the compactor ""baler"" is full, if authorized, perform a compact bale change. Work with minimal or no supervision."
good,whole foods was a friendly and open job to work in who employed many different people. They help group interviews every two weeks. Management was nice and flexible with your schedule.
good,"I have enjoyed working at WF. People are nice to work with, good work atmosphere, good employee discounts. Not a lot of room for advancement. I would recommend for a part time position"
good,When I was the supervisor for Whole Food Market is a very fast pace position that I had I had a crew of seven and everybody used to call on me to do certain jobs as well as my crew being that this place was a very huge place that was a lot of customers and a lot of mistake that was going on inside of the place like the customs with drop a lot of bottles a lot of spaghetti sauce and I'll crew had to be there to pick the stuff up before somebody else had an accident and the best part of my day was getting off after all that time a running around with such a big place to work in I was pretty glad to get off especially on Friday pay day was today
good,"I enjoyed working at whole foods! The environment was nice, welcoming, and fast pace. There was always something to do or someone to ask for help if needed. I left the job because my daughter got hurt really bad or i would of still been there."
good,"This job had trained me to despise gluten-free vegans, fueled a love of artfully crafted beer, and challenged me to optimize my entire workday to avoid food shortages / managerial backlash."
good,i enjoyed my time at WFM because i learned a lot and made some good networking. I love the diversity and opportunities it offers people. WHY DO I HAVE* TO WRITE MORE???>>>
good,"whole foods was a good company to work for if you can handle to politics. there was much knowledge to gain from department to department, and they gave their employees the option to earn a lot of paid time off. the schedule was difficult, as it was constantly changing, and made it difficult to have any real work life balance."
good,I thoroughly enjoy working at Whole Foods Market.  The culture among the Team Members is dynamic and consistent and this always reflects upon the itneraction with customers.  At times it can be a bit hectic however there is always someone to help you through those times.
good,"I loved working with Whole Food Market, but it was not a Career for me. Great benefits and good workers. Life changes and your time management changes, I had to relocate, the commute became to stressful, and I needed a fresh start doing something new."
good,"I enjoyed creating floral arrangements for the cooler and being a part of increasing sales. My very first arrangement sold for $100 the very next morning! Enjoyed taking orders to the exact customers request and fulfilling their order to customer satisfaction. Processed flowers and restocked the floor every morning, made arrangements, watered plants inside of store and out, cleaned buckets, hauled boxes of flowers from back cooler to the front of the store. Filled standing orders as well as filling walkup customer orders. Also over the phone orders too. Loved the people I worked with every day. I learned that my talents exceeded my expectations. The most enjoyable part of my job was making arrangements. The hardest part of my job was clean up which included the buckets, floors, and counter work areas. I really enjoyed working there but was not provided Benefits nor a raise after working there for the time that I did. I did receive an award as ""Rising Star of The Month""! They definitely offered me my job anytime I wanted to go back."
good,"A typical day would be doing your regular job duties, but then getting jobs from others randomly. Tasks could take from 20 minutes to 4 hours depending. I was the Store Scanning Specialist in the end and I think that that type of job should be paid more than I was paid. The culture with the peers is fun and relaxed, but with certain supervisors it was very stressful and it felt like voices were not heard. The rules on missing work are pretty harsh. There is a point system and at 6 points an employee is fired."
good,Whole Foods Market has so many locations. It is a great place to gain experience and has career potential. Hours are typically flexible and coworkers are usually high spirited and supportive.
good,It was tough and only the strong survive but it was very enjoyable and you learn a lot particularly about food and different types of people. If you put the extra effort anyone can succeed.
good,"I worked here for a short time, but I had great co-workers, and my team was motivated to provide great customer service. As a part-time job, I would recommend this company for anyone looking to be a team player!"
good,While I was there is was a productive environment to engage in and it allowed me to experience live very differently daily. Depending on whet the order  that was to be filled a  night e always pratared to handle everything as a team to prevent anyone from overwork g themselves
good,"I received produce,meat, seafood, dairy.my hours were 2am to 10:30am, the people I work with are great .I have experience in using a scan gun to receive product and forklift operator"
good,Whole Foods made it greatly possible to advance and move around the company if you so chose.  They were also big on team building and did a wonderful job at bringing teams together.
good,"I have enjoyed this job the most so far, it has given me a lot of valuable experience. I like a majority of the people I work with, some have even become good friends. I am able to get a flexible schedule and time off as well as pretty good pay. Hardest thing I feel is the long hours on my feet and tends to make me fatigued by the end of the day."
good,"When starting with the company, I didn't realize that being in an Administrative Role (ie Marketing) you don't have much room to grow unless a spot opens up at the regional level. Because of this, I felt stagnant in my role and ultimately left the company to go somewhere I could grow. Unfortunately, my region cut all the marketers shortly after I left."
good,"I learn lot with whole food. I learn about organic food, How to eat healthy plus lots of product knowledge."
good,Working in the prepared foods department calls for a fast paced work day. The team members made hard days go by smoother. Unfortunately the constant change within management made work schedules and asking for time off unpredictable.
good,"I worked at Whole Foods for 5 years.  It has changed a lot since the beginning, not all bad.  Definite potential to move up if you make the right connections and work hard.  Feedback can be sporadic and pay is competitive for the field.  Management isn't always consistent from my experience but the chance to move is abundant."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work temporarily if you want to work mindlessly and make decent money. However, the turn around there is very high and it is very easy to be fired from your job."
good,"Very great work-life balance, in a casual environment. Management is average. Job advancement is not the easiest. Discount is nice. Pay is below average."
good,"It was a fun environment, and I enjoyed being around people who believed in the products they were selling. I unfortunately had to resign due to personal circumstances."
good,i worked on the meat team and it was pretty cool early morning and late nights but the money was ok and the benefits were pretty cool. whole foods as an eniter thing though is a strange and strong corporate culture.
good,"Always an incredible amount of work to be done each day, especially in the department I work in. Lots of opportunity for growth and learning each day should you want to. Management are supportive and encouraging. Workplace culture is ok, people are over worked and short staffed. Selling high quality products and having unique customer experiences are a plus. Working on ways to improve sales in the current climate is challenging but also enjoyable."
good,"Managers were never around, and clueless to how most jobs functioned. The pay was alright but there was minimal training. New hires were constantly introduced but never trained."
good,"nothing bad to say about this company. Nice company to work for, great pay. I think anyone is lucky to work for this company. It does have its flaws....."
good,"Learned about organic foods"
good,You meet great people and have the opportunity for advancement. It is hard work and customer service based. It is always a learning experience and a department for everyone.
good,I liked working for Whole Foods in their prep food department. It was an excellent work environment. I enjoyed working in the kitchen and making sure they had the clean utensils they needed. I left the company cause they had moved me out of prep foods and into produce. Which I was just not very fond of.
good,"A typical day at work includes managing up to 11 people, making sure quality standards are maintained and Team Members are aware of any changes that could be on the horizon. I learned that everyone learns in different ways and it is essential to find a way to communicate effectively so the information is as clear as possible and everyone is on the same page. The hardest part of the job and most enjoyable part of the job are one in the same. It comes down to having a passion for what you do and relaying that passion to other Team Members."
good,Great family oriented workplace. Fun and innovative people to work with. The store gives so much back to the community. Working here means caring for the customer.
good,"A typical day started with a free coffee then of to the meat department where i had the opportunity interface directly with the customer. "
good,"A typical day at whole foods could be everything from mundane to hectic depending on what day of the week it was."
good,fun workplace very understanding of personal and medical problems and very willing to work with schedules of all kinds and very easy to request time off
good,"over all a good place to work with good benefits."
good,This company provides a lot of opportunities to move up if you are willing to work for it. You get the opportunity to meet great people and every day it is something new.
good,"Whole Foods, Inc. has a great atmosphere and culture, a great work life balance, and it is a great place for people to work full and part time positions."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a good place to work. I enjoyed their culture, and standards. The pay was competitive, and the benefits where great. Sometimes management was difficult to work with, but overall, it was a good place to work."
good,The starting pay is good and the coworkers are all so helpful and the pay is good for starting off as cashier but the customers are rude and the company cares more about the customers than you even though you are right and they are too strict about attendance
good,"if you've worked retail before you've worked at whole foods. you are over worked under paid, you have tons of childish co-workers, and you never really feel appreciated"
good,"They products at Apple sell themselves but not without the job of Mac Specialists.  It was my job to show the customer how everything they do on a Windows PC, an iMac could do more easily.  But the real magic of the iMac organized music, photo albums and kept your personal information and files safe."
good,Your coworkers at whole foods will most likely be amazing people who make you want to come into work. Not paying union dues is nice but the trade off is less job security.
good,"i was a seasonal employee, you only have to work once a year to keep your status. "
good,"Whole Foods is all about helping the community and its team members. I enjoyed learning new things and being able to teach this to our customers daily. You get a sense that you are helping others become better people in how they eat. You get the chance to be an educator while interacting with your community and giving that high standards of customer service. I loved how the company wanted the team members to try new things and experience what else is out there for products. As a team member, you were able to learn the stories of where the products came from and how they turned poverty into a success. "
good,"Too many changes to sty competitive in and industry that has caught up to the likes of WFM. Too bad. They pioneered theNatural Food Industry, I hope competitors maintain the same standards."
good,it was a good place to improve my skills in baking and cake decorating. the staff was fun to work with and very knowledgeable in various aspects of baking
good,"Good company to work for if seeking advancement in grocery industry. Learned about ordering supplies,facing and stocking supplies. Flexible scheduling."
good,"Wholefoods Market is a great place to have worked for because its not only a job its a learning experience. "
good,"Good hours, good pay, good benefits. Hard on the mind. No set schedules unless specified, days are constantly changing. If you have open availability you HAVE to have open availability."
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work.  Good culture.  It's not an easy job.  A lot is expected of you and you have to make sure you are withing you targets or you have to explain why you didn't make it and then be on conference calls etc.  Whole Foods concentrates on good customer service.  trying to go above and beyond.  which is not easy to do everyday.
good,"Could have just been the store I worked at with it being much, much smaller than most, but the experience I had working here seems to differ greatly from the experience most people seem to have working at Whole Foods."
good,"Provided good care and benefits to employees.  Honored hard workers with opportunities to advance and additional job security.   Simple and clear expectations.  Overall good place to work,"
good,Was the best places I ever worked. If I hadn't had to move out of province I would still be there.  The people for the most part were great to work with and management were always open to working with any problems that might arise.
good,"I appreciated the opportunity to work om my cooking skills, I found that I was not challenging my creative skills as I wanted. They did offer great benefits and I felt that the work atmosphere was positive overall."
good,"Very fast paced and high energy work environment. Continuously moving and multi tasking. Focus, speed and organization are a must."
good,"The Store Level Management seemed like they really cared.  However, the Regional Management could care less about employees."
good,Sometimes favoritism is a factor in hiring decisions. Excellent Team Members. Great Training provided for Team members. Work Life Balance is talked about but rarely acknowledged.
good,"-Long hours on your feet"
good,"All in all, not a bad place to work. unfortunately, many ongoing changes have changed the position I filled. the tightening of labor budgets dues to a more competitive industry has led to my seeking out a new employer."
good,Recommend working for this company. Room for advancement and growth. People are amazing and the culture is relaxed and enjoyable
good,Whole Foods would stay busy depending on the weather. If it was cold or rainy then you knew that business would be really slow. They do over work you. They do also give incentives to their employees like bingo money and gift cards for different contests.
good,"Great staff"
good,A fantastic company to work for with its ethical standing and business outlook. Gave lots of chances to learn new skills and self manage. Long hours and tough manual labour but good pay. Good team spirit and co-workers. Lack of reward and promotional opportunity for hard work and dedication from with-in the company.
good,"a great place to work if u like to  work  ."
good,I just started whole foods a week or so ago. My first day was very intense I was going to quit and talked to manger. The workers and managers are very friendly and will help or without asking. The overnight food preparation is the job that I do. It's 11pm-7am. They have lots of unrealistic expectations as far as prep. They teach you here and there not as much as I'd like. Some mangers are not so professional. Some co-workers think there privileged because they've been there longer their attitude is unprofessional. The management communication is poor needs improvement. They're an awesome company needs lots of work. Other good things the let your listen to music at all times you can have all your piercings and tattoos and even crazy hair color. They're pretty laid back and you get paid for your lunchs. Not so bad but not extremely awesome and they live up to their freshness mantra.
good,"I had been warned that Whole Foods was a different company to work for.  What they believe in, how they operate, and the style of management is not like most companies that I have worked for.  They are very hands off, if you need help, go to your peers, because upper management will look at you as a weak manager if you seek them out.  It is a very ""clickish"" company, if you don't make friends with your upper management you aren't a part of the group, and cast off as an outsider."
good,Whole Foods Market IT Support team as  an MSI is a great and co workers rock. we learn a lot from each other and make each other better everyday........
good,"Again employess dont leave organizations,they leave the managers that are not properly prepared to do the job. The ortganization needs to invest more in training these new managers cause the focus is on how fast one moves ,has been distorted by these young managers"
good,"It's convenient if you're a student, they offer flexible shifts and work with your hours. They offer benefits if you're a part of the part time 20. They offer 4 different hiring options, they specify this in the application. Good starting pay. Friendly environment."
good,I had a lot of fun working for Whole Foods they took care me they show me a lot  about cooking and how to organize my time when I'm working in the kitchen the people that I work with were awesome and my manager was great
good,"punctuality is critical "
good,"Working with this company is fun but also professional. It has given me the foundation to be successful in many areas. Most of the management is great and respectful. The team I work with now is the best and most talented I have ever worked with. Recently, there have been some job reconstructions that have rattled some employees. They are still a company that cares about its employees, the environment, and its partners though."
good,"A typical day would start with reading the log book and catching up on updates. Then I would move to a register or start with small tasks like bagging or going outside to do a cart run. Through this job I have learned how capable I am of changing tasks on the move, how comfortable I am handling the cash drawer and how confident I am dealing with customers. My co workers were my favorite part of the job. I feel extremely lucky to have been able to work with such incredible people. The hardest part of the job ended up always being the customers. Sometimes they were rude and impossible to reason with. But the most enjoyable part of the job would sometimes be the customers. Interactions that would end on a positive note, or when I would help a customer find exactly what they were looking for, always made my day better."
good,Good place to work for those just getting out of high school or just looking temporary job. Has good base pay. Being a cashier can get boring.
good,"The company has a good workplace, with friendly employees.  They do not offer the highest pay, and the management could be better. I really enjoy the 20% discount because I regularly shop at whole foods, and knowing the new produce items coming in is a gray bonus."
good,"Great co-workers always willing to help. Great management, really flexible. Could have challenges dealing with difficult people."
good,"Day consists of moving and rotating products, engaging customers. "
good,Awesome place to work to learn about all kinds of foods and health supplements.  Great benefits.  Decent pay.  Fun place to work.  Cool people to work with. Nice employee discount. I work with a very unique and diverse amount of team members which makes coming to work even better. :)
good,"The customers suck to be around but the Team Member and Team Leaders are always there to support us. I honestly love the people I work with and I have made many close friends here. The benefits are great and if you can move up, the job is worth to have."
good,"I've worked for Whole Foods Market for 8 years and it's definitely been very rewarding.  I started out as a team member in the bakery department as a mixer/baker and was promoted several times until I became Team Leader.  Like most jobs, you get what you put into it and you have to be 100% committed/invested if you want to not only move up in the company, and to be able to run a team successfully. "
good,I enjoy helping others which is one of the reasons why I am great with customer service. I have about 8 years in this field alone. I like to work as a team but I also am able to work as an individual and get the job done. The hardest part of my job would have to be seeing people that I work with since the beginning leave the job. I most enjoy putting a smile on my customers faces especially my consistent favorite ones.
good,"-Positive environment with diverse culture"
good,"There is a lot of room for growth within this company, but often the expectations placed upon team members is overbearing."
good,you meet a lot of cool people working at whole foods and the employee's are also nice people to work with. the management is okay to deal with. recently they've added a whole bunch of new rules that no one likes
good,a typical day at work for whole foods market was fast paced and fun. Learning new organic foods and new healthy choices of foods was very interesting. management was ok due to lack of communication within team members. The hardest part of the job was working over night and long hours and the distance from transportation. The Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people from different departments and trying new organic foods.
good,Whole foods market is a great company to become apart of witch great benefits but you must be hard working. whole foods values your work and time and pays well. you learned plenty of new things. whole working at whole foods i learned about a whole new science of food and how organics work.
good,Everyone works together to get the job done. Great co-workers stable job and a safe and clean environment. Working at night was no fun.
good,"I want to start by saying that after 3.5 years at Whole Foods, I only ever had problems with two team members (both higher ups), and one of those was minor.  Everyone there is amazing, friendly, intelligent and multi-dimensional.  It was the second-most fun job I've ever had (Tower Records will always be #1), and after just a month away, I miss the people greatly."
good,"I enjoy working at Whole Foods, its alot of fun, and positive energy. They provide a safe and clean work environment. I learned more about Organic products, bread, and more."
good,this place becomes your home and everyone is your family. they follow the rules strictly so try your best not to break them. most people there seem to be very understanding and easy-going. they'll teach you everything you need to know and if you show potential they'll put you in programs to help you move up in the company./ stay hungry for knowledge and you will grow; if that's what you desire.
good,"Typical day at work is helping customers , organizing shelves and cleaning. I learned how to deal with customers , how to organize and work with others . My co-workers were very friendly . Hardest Part of the job is getting used to moving foods around . The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they needed."
good,"My day starts around noon, we recently improved our whole warehouse system from label picked orders to voxware technology."
good,"Sometimes its great sometimes its bad. Busy times ensure a sense of organized chaos in order to sell as much product as possible and help as many guests as you can in a day. Slow time ensure you will get your hours cut without notice, or others will leave you to deal with the work of two people throughout your shift. Management is good but constantly shifting. Miscommunication happens often so things are often left undone or unchecked. The team atmosphere is good but very political at times. In all its a hard job to work continuously so a team first me second attitude is essential to not get upset that you feel overworked or under appreciated. The company will give you a decent paycheck if you can manage a full time position. If not, its better to have a second job or other ways of earning a living to compensate for the low hours. Part time benefits will drain your paycheck, and full time benefits wont as much if you have worked there for more than a year or so. Its a great company to work for if you want to move up, but again very political and hard to work with the corporate constraints. If you manage to move up, expect to be overworked and underpaid. If you do not bring in enough money expect to get constant emails about why you and your team inst making enough, and warnings about bringing up profits or else hours and possible jobs are lost. Its a constant balance between work, having fun, and dealing with every day stress you would encounter in any work environment. The pay and benefits are worth it, but the job security is not very good, and moving up is challenging for"
good,Safe routines and procedures practiced daily. I learned a lot about the inner workings of such a large company and what it takes to keep up with high standards. Management was fair and would usually work with you and get input from employees on how to improve the workplace. Co-workers are a pleasure as all help to make the job easier for one another. The hardest part of the job may have been dealing with some of the customers.
good,"there is always something new to learn about food and health."
good,"Is a very nice place to work, everbody is super nice, the team leaders are open to new ideas and sugestion, i got to met people from all over the world, and i have fun working.  but they pay a very low salary, even if they make a big big profit"
good,"Work on a day to day basis is not too stressful, the hardest part of the job is working the holidays when it gets really busy and when they schedule you 8 to 10 days days working in a row and when they schedule you to close than open the next day. Th Store Team Leaders are really cool, the department team leaders are a hit or miss because a lot of the time they are new or younger people that are still learning to manage a team so you kind of have to work with them. The most enjoyable part of the job is that feeling of a work family and having fun helping customers. I learned a lot from working here definitely gained a lot of knowledge and experience working with coworkers and customers."
good,"Great Work Environment. Great Team members. Clean work Environment. Great Customers. Overall, I couldn't think of a better place to work in the retail industry."
good,"The store offered a pleasant atmosphere for customers probably due to the values of the owner."
good,"It never feels like work. I loved that place, but I wished they were more fair with their employees. overall, the company is excellent. They teach you well in regard to product knowledge and the best customer service is their best quality, beside the delicious food."
good,The job overall is significantly better than most retail jobs. It is however still a normal retail job with obscure and often frustrating hours.
good,"I think the biggest gain I received at whole foods would be the work ethic. Since coming out of college I have gotten a couple of contract jobs, but this position has given me a stronger real world work environment mind set, and work ethic."
good,Gained a ton on knowledge about the food industry and improved greatly with customer service skills. Limited amount of  full-time employees.
good,"great company , diverse , fun place , co workers are all helpful, the games they played during the working day , the holiday dinners,"
good,"Each store is different, and even the departments in each store can vary from how they run. It feels like the company wants to take care of you, they try to get you the time off you requested, the sick time you need, the breaks are long enough to eat. Yes things do slip between the cracks on a human-error level, but for the most part, it's great."
good,"A great place for people with some experience.  Learning the ropes here is a little more difficult.  AMAZING people.  Passionate, brilliant, fun and caring."
good,my day includes doing order for that day. Working and stocking shelves from truck. Maintain all labels and price changes. Remerchandising product when needed.
good,"While working at wholefoods, I typically worked alone. I was given my assignments and completed them in a timely manner. The management team was fair and understanding. I enjoyed working there."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work if you desire a focus on values, community engagement, and making the world a better place."
good,"I enjoyed working with such a diverse group of people, never know what your going to get on a day to day. I learned a ton about the Whole Foods culture. Its a lifestyle and my eyes have been opened up to a lot of exciting and delicious things through the Whole Foods culture. Good benefits."
good,"oversee 12 team members and assist w/daily operations of job, great customer service skills, mentor, problem/conflict solver"
good,I loved the environment. Many positive people and the workplace was great to be in. The culture was nothing like I have ever worked at before!
good,very fun place to work. got to learn a lot about the organic industry. very educational place to work. there is monthly classes where we had to learn about organic food.
good,"Whole Foods Market has an open culture that allows you to exercise some ways to be yourself while still representing the company in a positive light. Every position rely's heavily upon customer service and exceeding customer expectations."
good,Great place to work and move up in the company.Have loved working there and have learned so much from my leaders and Team Member I am looking for a new challenge. I am Looking for set hours since starting a family
good,"A typical day at work is, if we get busy which is the hardest part of my job but with the help of my co workers everything is under control. What i enjoyed much at work is everyone is open to help one another which in short team work is prevailing."
good,My experience at whole foods was nothing less then professional. The management always encourages you there positive. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team competing.
good,Many of the jobs does not require a degree while the opportunity for advancement is tremendous. If you want to create a career for your future Wholefoods is a great place to start.
good,"Very fun place to work. Learned tons about the organic food industry as well as specialty items such as cheese, beer, wine and chocolate. Very well staffed and managed. Friendly work environment where everyone is working together to solve problems."
good,"This job was not physically demanding, but one must work at a fast pace to complete the required job duties. The hours for this position were good, and the co-workers were pleasing to work with. I enjoyed food preparation over dish washing."
good,Great culture and very education based company. They train you on everything you will need to know for your job. Very good pay at management level. Very great company to work for and stay.
good,"Each day I would sign in with my special team member number, then go to checkout/customer service area and help bag, collect hand baskets, help behind the customer service booth and return items customers didn't want or need and ring on a register if necessary. I learned customer service skills and how to stay mentally resilient. Management was nice. My coworkers were great and very friendly people. The hardest part of the job was trying to help customers who seemed unwilling to be helped. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting free samples of good food and meeting and being surrounded by really great people."
good,"The Team members and Customer experience were the best part of working at WFM. We were able to educate people on how to eat healthy and make it taste good, as well. Management was very supportive and believed that what you put forth is what you will receive. The hardest part was leaving."
good,"It's a really great place to work. Fun, good opportunity, and great customers. They provide competitive pay and good benefits."
good,"Whole Foods is a fun place to work. you can be introduced to lots of new culture, food and many different people. There is lots of room for advancement if you are a hard worker but only till a certain point then you have to be willing to relocate. its just not a place you want to be stuck your whole life, there is a lot of drama between team members and management. it felt like being back in high school with how much drama goes on inside whole foods. all in all most people you work with at whole foods are great."
good,Whole Foods is a great company to work for. The people I work with care a lot about the companies values and our customers.
good,"I manage customers throughout the day, while continuously keeping the meat and seafood case full. "
good,"Whole Foods was a great  place to work. I have learn more about organic product. About commingling  that customers also are more involved with buying organics. The shelf life doesn't last as long as conventional produce. The prices are higher. But I have always taught my team if the product looks good the customer's will buy it.Produce is all impact buying for the customer .  its are job to educate them more. The first rule you ever teach your team if it looks good they will buy it.Freshness, fullness quality in produce no 1 produce not 2 or 3 when the buyer for your company purchases your product for your company. the customers will buy it. You want your customer to spread the word. I was just shopping at your store today and the produce dep't was so fresh and full and had a full variety of produce that I needed on my shopping list. And the quality was the best I have ever seen .That's were YOU BUILD YOUR BUSINESS .And you have your repeat customers shop at your store. When you build a reputation with your customers. Hey Pete what looks good today. Ill say what items are you looking for or what on your menu for tonight Then I know I can suggest different items we have on there list or show the customer what looks good and how it would go with there meal. Or give my own ideas .THE CUSTOMERS LIKE WHEN TAKE THE TIME AND INTEREST IN THEM."
good,"Whole foods market is a great place to work. The best part is the pay and benefits. For a regular job that doesn't require a college degree, or even experience, they offer amazing wages. The worst part of the job, though, is dealing with leadership. They claim to have an ""open-door"" policy, which means that you can go to any person in a leadership position and speak to them about anything you want. That sounds nice but, in my personal experience, anytime you go to them with a negative situation, they do absolutely nothing about it. I have seen fellow team members get punished for going to them about issues, like getting their hours cut for complaining about being over-worked. Most people are afraid to say anything so, if something bad is going on like a team leader picking favorites, people acting like bullies, harrassment, being understaffed, etc. We just have to deal with it."
good,It's a good place to work. The schedule is all over the place so you really don't have a social life.
good,"I got to spend everyday with my best friends, helping guests make great decisions regarding the amazing products we sell."
good,"I was a receiver for Beer/wine so my days were pretty much the all the same. I tossed cases of booze around, built displays, stocked the floor, and organized the back-stock. Very diverse work environment. Hardest part of the job was having to work with some of the most unmotivated people I have ever worked with. The most enjoyable part was having a set schedule in a retail environment. Management was fair for the most part but there were also plenty of times where lack of communication between them made extra work for everyone."
good,What I did at the beginning of my shift depended on what shift I was working.  I enjoyed worked with the co-workers to meet the customers needs.
good,Best company I have worked for full benefits nice people.Good enviroment just management do not communicate with each everybody does what they want.
good,"The amount of money and benefits I get for the job I do is incomparable.  In and of itself, this is great, but when you decide it's time to move into another business, field, or just get away from the intense demand of retail work hours; it's hard to do without coming up short on bills."
good,"Whether I am working in floral or produce, freshness is key to my daily routine. Product quality is maintained by rotation of stock and culling. I have learned about types of produce and how to prepare them, how plants are grown and the standards that Whole Foods adheres to to ensure the highest quality product. This is important to our customer base as they come to Whole Foods looking for healthy and wholesome foods. In our store, and other stores I've noticed, the co-workers tend to become a second family. Everyone is friendly and caring, which makes this a great place to work for. The greatest part of my job is creating a memorable experience for the customer. I really love making someones day with a beautiful floral arrangement. There has been a recent change in management style to a top-down, more corporate feel. As I worked for Whole Foods previously my experience was that I could take ownership of my position, whereas now most of what I do must be approved by management."
good,"Popcorn schedule. Great peers that you work with, and a good customer base. Management can be hit or miss."
good,Fun enviorment great people and staff who help when you need it around the clock...
good,A Company that's culture is unique and fun to work at! Everyday is something different in my position which is something I have really enjoyed.
good,"It is fast-paced and physically intensive, the hours vary and you must be available for weekends and holidays.  You will learn a lot about the food industry and about products available to consumers.  Co-workers are awesome.  The hardest part about the job is the schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount."
good,However most of the front end are part time and there is little chance of fulltime work even though they schedule you each week (2) hours short of full time?... so no benefits... but gainsharing is good after you are voted on.
good,"You can move up at WFM if you are smart and are very focused on the job, the culture and where you want to go. So start out really focused and stay that way. NEVER be late as 6 times late and you may be out. There are many rules, but they are generally for the good of the department. Best job for 20-35 year old set. Great diversity of team members. Great people."
good,"Always busy, great co workers, and opportunity to advance in the company."
good,"On a typical day, whole foods is very busy. You are coming into contact with hundreds of customers a day. Always have to make sure you are giving quality customer service because, with out that whole foods wouldn't be what the are today. It take dedication and hard work to maintain employment, not to mention pay close attention to time and attendance. I have learned a lot about customer service and team member happiness. If your team members are happy then so are your customers. Its great to be on a team where everyone knows what their job description is and does the work appropriately and quickly. I think that the management needs some work. Communication is a big issue. I think that the hardest part of the job is getting the communication going needed between the team leaders and the team members. I loved working for the customers.  Seeing them smile after helping them can be very rewarding."
good,"Always busy, lots of customers."
good,"great co-workers, fast pace environment, need to be real hands on to be affective. attention to detail is a must. the harder you work the better results you welcome with your employment"
good,Whole Foods Market is a great company to work for. I have learned a lot about being a team player and working together in order to satisfy any client inquiries.
good,"Overall, Whole Foods is a great company to work for. In general, they care about their employees and offer better wages than the similar positions of competitors."
good,I enjoy Whole Foods because I believe in what they are trying to do in terms of the food movement.  I have worked in different stores with all sorts of different people.  The best part of the job is talking about food.  I am an advocator of healthy eating.  The hardest part of the job is the schedule.  I don't think there is a good quality of life when you are not able to have a regular schedule or to be able to make plans.  I would employ Whole Foods to possible either hire people for certain shifts or rotate shifts quarterly to provide some sort of regularity.
good,"cashier customer service and coffee bar team member, very fast paced place."
good,"was a productive workplace, was able to meet great people in this fast pace work enviornment"
good,Everything is very organized and job security is exceptional. The only complaint is that there are days when the hours are very long.
good,Whole foods is a company where no two days is never the same. Where the atmosphere is always a ecstatic one. i have met people from all over the world even china. I'm always happy to be at work. There is never a dull moment at Whole Foods Market. In just the two years there i have learned that great customer service can make or break your business. That it is not easy for everyone to provide it.  Management is a laid back environment. As in as in there just as happy as there employees being at work is a wonderful experience an they don't need to put too much pressure on them to make things get done. I would say the hardest part of my job is to not love my job.  Even with irate customers to make them happy brightens my day. The most enjoyable part of my job is that fact its open to ideas they take every ones ideas on anything and everything into consideration.
good,"Day in & out fast pace environment"
good,I truly love(d) my job with Whole Foods. I love seeing people having a good experience with both being a guest and working on the team.
good,"I usually worked the pizza station where we had 13 different flavors of pizza on display and sold by slice. But I also helped the other stations such as the sandwich station where we sold sandwiches and burgers, and also the burrito bar where we made anything from tacos and quesadillas to omelets. I learned how to cook the different styles of eggs, also how to flip an egg without it breaking. I also learned different recipes of pizzas and other specials we offered on the Hot Bar. I enjoyed a good portion of management my only problem is while i was training for different positions, they never checked on me or any of the other employees to see how we were adapting and what we thought of the positions. Our store constantly won the competition for sales among our division and our management never thanked us or even let us know they appreciated our hard work. The most they ever did was write a note and tape it to the door. It's important to let your team know you appreciate their hard work and dedication, it keeps them motivated. They never did that at Whole Foods. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult and picky customers, but the only thing you can do is kill them kindness. The most enjoyable part of my job there were my regulars who always came in with a great attitude and put a smile on my face, I also enjoyed making people happy for providing them with quality and delicious food."
good,"Wonderful company to work for, advancement comes fast if you posses the right skills. From working the store to working support for the stores, your day is never quite typical. Love working with all the smiling faces!"
good,"I learned a lot about temperature of food and a lot about the company in general. They only sell meats that have No MSGS, additives its all organic"
good,Productive and fun place to work.  Loved co-workers and culture
good,"Arrive at work at 5am. Check the Previous day sales compared to the projections, Check to make sure we received the right and specified amount. Place your daily order per the your budget from your forecast keeping in mind of the GIG and the margin."
good,Great company for the right person fitting into the Whole Foods lifestyle.
good,"I inventoried and verified stock, stocked the store (some written manifests and knowledge of the job). I learned food codes and classifications. My co-workers were fine, most hard working men.  I also server as a bagger part-time for extra hours. At first the physical labor was a little taxing but I became accustom."
good,"Setting up all of the hot food areas throughout the day, we serve buffet style and large portion roasts, sides and burrito station. Continuously cook hot food throughout the day, food prep for all hot areas, usage of different kitchen equipment and care for them."
good,"A typical day was overall operation of the deparment. I learned more about inventory, numbers and how to deal with a wide base of different people.  I tried to find that knew that the customer comes and for most.  Hardest part was having 10 different boss.. The most enjoyable was satisfying and delighten customers."
good,"A typical day at Whole Foods consists of assisting customers not just with food choices but spreading knowledge of a healthier way of eating.  I learned a lot from this company about how to lead instead of manage, what a company can actually do to influence the way conventional grocery stores buy product, caring for the environment and not just the physical planet but the everything that inhabits it.  Management at every store is different some are great like the first store I worked in, to terrible and incompetent, to mediocre at best like the last store I worked in.  My co-workers were an eclectic mix of amazing people, hilarious, easy to work alongside all the time, to overly sensitive, never on time, complaining about having to work certain shifts.  The hardest part when you work at Whole Foods is having to deal with the aforementioned co-workers, that just don't respond to any criticism to want to do a better job and it can really weigh down on you, advancing isn't the easiest thing to do either.  It never felt like you would get the position because of what you accomplished, it was more of a popular vote, I have seen many people get promoted because of this reason and fail no more than six months later either being asked to step down or being separated.  Balancing life and work there was not the easiest task, being retail you get the odd shifts, I was no exception to that.  Always getting a 'mid' shift which never gave you a morning or an evening to accomplish other tasks or be with family and/or friends.  One more hard part then I'll move on, working with the lazy people"
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job working as a team member,managment is good,co-workers are nice"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods Market. It prepared me for the job I have today, and I appreciated the fast paced work environment. I did not see working at Whole Foods as a career considering you often spend holidays away from family. I do miss the exercise of working on my feet day to day!"
good,"Had an excellent run with this company and contributed to its growth until new leadership (management not true leaders) took over our store and started cleaning house on anyone paid well and with tenure. Then it became a living hell as those in upper management put everyone in the store in fear of losing their jobs or positions that they had worked so hard to obtain. Pushing successful leaders to either quit or step down or be terminated for write ups specifically used to target individuals. They created a high turnover in a short period of time with little regard to the lives they were affecting, and then were rewarded for it with promotions. Thought wholefoods was a culture about team member satisfaction and growth apparently only for a select few."
good,The company itself was wonderful. I just had to move away so I had to leave the area.
good,"Whole Foods offer a fantastic security package for its employees, including 401k, insurance, ""gain sharing"", easy attendance policy, relax working atmosphere, individualism and fresh quality product all the time. It seems wonderful, but for me, there is no creativity, no advancement from the normal routine, the people are not ""professional"" cooks and the culture of the kitchen is very lax, no rush, no demands, no expectations. It would be a great place for an older person to work and relax with the days. Of course, daily drama happens, but no one is trying to be the top of the ladder or to have more than they own. I feel a sense of contentment, and I'm not satisfied with a life like that. Personally, I would like more of a challenge to keep me interested. They are one of the top 100 companies to work for, and it shows in the character of the store. For me, I'm not ready to settle down just yet."
good,Whole Foods Market was a great starting out job. The pay was great and recognition for hard work was often. The company holds very high values in regards to food quality as well as providing guest with excellent customer service. They often promote within the company so if you can get your feet in the door the opportunities are there.
good,"was very intresting to open store for the first time in Vancouver, learned how t do that, team working was very important, the hardest part was to promote for new position"
good,I did my internship here while finishing culinary school. I then moved on up the career ladder. I decided to make a change and return back to school. I could not continue my education with the hours I was putting into my career.
good,It is a live company for getting your lifestyle in order to live green and work in this enviornment.
good,helping and assisting customers lets you expand your train of and achieve goals by helping out the customer
good,Great job good people. the company has a wide variety of culture.
good,"I work in a multicultural environment where I meet people of different backgrounds who are driven and business oriented where they all portray the same type of work ethic:working together as a team to provide a down to earth,informal approach to help our environmental surroundings go more green.Our mission is to not only provide optimum service to our guests that step inside our stores but to educate them about becoming environmentally consious but also instilling, healthy eating habits as well.Our Foods ingredients are free from pesticides,antibiotics & perservatives.Management believes in our capabilities to advance within the company,If we ever have a problem we need to address,We have an open door policy which gives us the freedom to communicate our internal issues with our departmental head or higher.My co-workers have a fun,loving spirit about them that makes me want to enjoy my job more.I believe in a cohesive team unit.Teamwork is important to me,If I have any questions I am not certain of,my supervisors always seem to get the job done properly.The hardest part would be tolerance & perfecting your craft.I am someone who wants to evolve as a person & learn things of my job class that I am capable of handling & utilize those teachings into a higher postion.Enjoyable part would be interracting with multiple people(Co-workers & customers alike) of different races,ethnicities,nationalities & learning something new about them everyday."
good,Would have been the perfect job if the management team worked more with the employees who were interested in moving up. Seemed to prefer hiring from outside the company instead of looking to the great workers they already have.
good,"When you work at Whole Foods Market, you're in retail. That means someone has to be there 7 days a week. So forget about your home life, you'll have to work that in somehow but the needs of the business come first. You'll learn great customer service and you'll love your team members."
good,"I have enjoyed working for this company for several reasons. They provide good training, panel interviews to hire which you can bring in all levels of staff to be able to participate with questions for a possible new hire. There is constant learning whether about going more GREEN, or new products to sample to possibly upsell and also familiarize yourself with., and on-going training classes to help with development whether leadership or food related."
good,"team environment/outlook, good pay, fun, develop leadership skills, older management styles,"
good,Whole foods market has been a fun and engaging place to work at. They listen to your needs and try to work with and around them. They are also very good at being welcoming to newcomers so you should just be able  to ease right on in.
good,"Fast paced environment from beginning of shift to end of shift. Learned a vast amount of knowledge connected to the grocery business from recording daily shrink and the importance of keeping track of products damaged/spoilage coinciding to where dollars go other than point of sales. Buying in multiple departments and maintaining quality control in back of the house and front of the house to keep inventory levels at manageable percentages. Ensure empowerment of TM's as well as TM happiness on a daily basis. Oversee daily operations of Grocery and all sub-departments that correlate (Bulk-Bins, Frozen, Dairy, and Dry grocery). Vast amounts of training's for TM's I would say would be the most challenging task to date. Working as a team and completing a deadline as a battalion is what I most enjoy about working for Whole Foods Market."
good,"The meat department taught me a lot about both front of house and back of house operations. It inspired my love for food in general. I'm a huge meat eater but cuisine is my thing. I love the customer experiance. You meet some interesting people and even learn from just having a conversation. Store leadership was always respectful, professional and helpful. During the holidays it was always rough."
good,Wholes environment is pretty friendly. But because they pay 15 they push you and stress you. They even talk about how many people they have knocking at the doors Wanting a job is you aren’t happy
good,"Good pay for starting a career and making money, nice and smiling people. "
good,"Fun place to work, good benefits and good starting wage. Advancement is possible and open for those willing. Good people good memories. Can balance work and family time well with paid vacation and wellness days"
good,Great pay for the area however the upper management are not very self aware and tend to retaliate. They also often cycle employees because they feel as if they can replace anyone because of their minimum wage.
good,"Fast pace environment which make the day seem to fly by. Flexible hours to your needs. Great staff, with an even better culture to work for. There is "
good,"This has been one of the best jobs I have had. Like most corporate grocery stores though, you work really hard, and hardly get rewarded for it. It is fun and very challenging but I like that in a job. It teaches you how to handle a lot of stress and helps you learn to be patient. Benefits are great and the pay is pretty great as well."
good,"I enjoed working with my peers and interacting with the customers."
good,I learned how to be a fast paced worked and how to perform under stress. Some days were slow at Whole Foods but it really picked up around holidays. There was a problem with callouts as the callout policy is relatively lenient. The team members at whole foods really care about one another. The hardest part of the job was keeping everything stocked even under immense pressure. The best part was learning about all the different kinds of foods and the passionate team members and customers.
good,"I have enjoyed everyday working in whole foods market, learning about new products and share with people from different cultures from all around the world."
good,"Great service & team leadership "
good,The customers/consumers are on the more entitled end of the spectrum and representing a company that has such a vast array of product is definitely a task but it pays well and the potential for advancement or growth/movement within the company does exist.
good,"I worked here before the Amazon merger. But I thought it was a good job for people going to school. Really good benefits. Good hours, but pay could have definitely been better!"
good,"They have lost some of the greatest employees bc of the point system. We are talking letters of recognition, best at what they do, phone compliments weekly, follow code, deliver 💯 satisfaction. But they only allow 6pts. If you are late, need to leave early, only 2 drs notes allowed. I was caring for my dad w/cancer and a single mom. Nix was aces. But, they lost me. Their loss. Trust me."
good,"I enjoyed working at whole foods. The pay is above minimum wage, and you have great benefits when you work full time. "
good,"Very pleasant people to work with. The days consisted of either working at a register or working along the floor. The more time you spend working there, the easier it gets."
good,"As an order writer you'll get a set schedule and a little extra pay over the entry pay for a regular team member.  You take on more responsibility than a regular team member and often do additional tasks to cover what gets missed.  Not much time is given for training yourself to advance, usually none.  You'll have to keep track of many things like orders, credits, expirations, cleaning, promos, and top sellers.  Some of it is tediuous, but it's still a better job than most retail, grocery, or restaurant jobs.  Most of the coworkers are friendly and many of the products are good."
good,Best part was your co-workers. Everyone I worked with at whole foods was super awesome and typically a lot of artists and musicians end up working there so lots of cool and unique friendships were formed because of my employment there!
good,Worked here for ten plus years. Made lots of friends both team members and customers. Learned a lot about food preparation and food safety. Acquired very good customer service skills and patience.
good,"Management really cares about the Team members. In my experience, here were great relationships between the team members, team leaders, and even the store leaders. The atmosphere was generally cheerful and light, in the produce department."
good,While working at wholefoods I learned a lot of food prep and safety the staff was encouraging and willing to teach in a friendly and compassionate way.
good,"I worked at Whole Foods for 12+ years the first 10 was really great clientele ,managers,supervisors the works,but things changed the last couple of years management lost their passion ,and I had one sorry team leader. and after I left for health reasons WFM realized it and sent him and the asst store leader(bigot) on their way . but I met some great people there"
good,Would work there again.Maybe in a  Different section. Would definitely have to speak to store leadership about scheduling.Other than that it was fine.
good,I loved working for Whole Foods Market. The only reason I left was because I was head hunted to join an exciting start up. I had great experiences with Whole Foods and found that hard work really paid off.
good,Working with different faces everyday. You get to pick your own shifts on the app they provide you. The daily duties are easy basically shopping for online customers like you shopping for yourself. Friendly environment and clean.
good,Working at WFM I felt as though I made a difference. I enjoyed the competitive pay and transparency but did not like how my store manager handled the certain aspects of the work force when the company was sold to Amazon.
good,"It was a pretty good 10 years I had mostly 30 to 40 hours a week and had great benefits. Was stressful at times but I could handle it, mainly cashier assistant from 2007 to 2015 assisting cashiers and management with bagging of groceries and cart running. Casher from 2015 to 2017. Added and extra routine of placing bags in customers cart that I struggled with.  Overall and ok job"
good,"This was back in 2013 at the NYC Upper West Side location. The training process was great! Our ATL trained me and was very thorough and patient. I was a cashier and the work was pretty repetitive/boring, but the coworker were generally great and positive, so they made it more fun. I loved discussing food with customers, which was the best part of my day, although not every employee there is as much of a food nerd so no worries if you're not. There's quite a bit of opportunity for growth and employees are prioritized when moving between departments. The bad part about my experience there was the apathy/carelessness of the new manager at the time. I was going to school at the time, and it's company policy to work around your school schedule as long as you present them with an official schedule (which I did). The first manager, which I had for the first few months, did a great job at working around my schedule. But the manager that took over afterwards was just totally clueless and not even trying to do her job. She'd constantly schedule me during class. I'd have to talk to her *every week* to fix the schedule. She would just brush it off and tell me I had no choice get someone to cover for me those days (which, surprise, nobody wanted to). I often had no choice but to skip class to go to work, which led me to fail two classed. Not alright! I wish I wasn't so young and naive and reported her to the right people. Besides that one problem, the overall experience working there was positive."
good,"I enjoyed working for Whole Foods during the time I was there, unfortunately I needed to make more money and there wasn’t a lot of room for growth in the company. They did however have a great program for benefits, full time and part time workers were eligible to enroll which was amazing. Since they had been bought out I’ve heard the pay rate has increased so it may be different since  I’ve worked there."
good,"Still a good place to work, but changes are frequent with Amazon. Lots of changes from corporate that make life less enjoyable. Still better than a lot of places, just don't trust older company reviews, it is different now"
good,"Some managment was awesome - others not so much. I enjoyed many of my co-workers but like any other place, some people are great and work hard while others get away with very little work. I approached management about certain individuals but nothing was done. That's how it goes - but overall not a bad place to work"
good,"Overall, WFM is a great place to work and is very laid back. Management can take a long time to hire people once someone leaves- in my case- they do not replace them at all and the rest of them team members have to take more of a work load."
good,"Is a high pace work were you gonna be moving all day an dealing with costumer, all types of customers that are not always happy, the management is gonna be very active and moving through the store all say"
good,Very nice place to work at but it can be a bit stressful when most ingredients for receipes...However I would suggest the products...prices are pretty reasonable...
good,"Decent work environment, co-worker and employees make this job as good as it is. They have good benefits and insurance. Overall it's a good company to work for."
good,"Allows for independent and team management opportunities."
good,"Meh, just try and find a night shift so that you can werq alone so you won't run into any abusive miserable employee haters bullies. Man they are a dime a dozen. I never understand how so many folks getting paid so good just to make salads can be so hatfull and miserable to abuse, talkabout, bullie, and even set up other worker's. Best to work alone and get paid."
good,Nice place to work. Have to move in fast pace there. Meet cool customers and people you worked with. I worked in the back so super fast pace. The front is laid back. But still have to be on your job right and you will be find.
good,"Whole Foods was a good place to work and is still, in many respects.  When Amazon bought WFM, however, the culture changed completely and became less fun.  Whole Foods Market used to be set on helping customers and making partnerships with suppliers.  Now, however, the day-to-day is more focused on earning money, selling Amazon memberships and products, and being an Amazon spokesperson."
good,I love Whole Foods for the reason that it taught me to cook and gave me the opportunities to grow that other companies would not. I love working for this company and I think it shows on my face when I spend time helping customers.
good,"A typical day is customer service, cleaning, filling out logs and some laughs. The most enjoyable part of the job was my team. Management is sales driven."
good,Was the best place to work I hate that I let this job go due to being young and family problems. Wish I can go back to my real first job and be around company again
good,this was early in my career before college but it was a great place to start working. If WFM had corporate finance positions in Colorado I would certainly work for them again!
good,"But the pay is not enough even though I admire they start higher than most other employers but it was quite stressful."
good,"Awesome employees, great pay, fast-paced. I moved up pretty quickly within the company by being hard-working and efficient. Management was sometimes a little eh."
good,"A typical day at Whole Foods includes assisting curious customers, managing a multi-line phone system, face to face interactions with customers and completing orders. I have expanded my Customer Service experience here greatly due to being promoted to Customer Service only 7 months after being hired as a Cashier. Whole Foods was once a diverse, expressive, fun place to work at until it was bought by Amazon. They are putting into place unfair rules and taking away important benefits that are mostly peoples lives. It unfortunately is not the same anymore and many, many things are changing. I am not the only employee who is hurt by Whole Food's decision, but you have to just keep moving on! I am now on the lookout for a part-time job to assist me while I head back to school."
good,It was good working there generally.  I had good managers and pay increased annually.  However after I left the company began to curtail employee benefits and pay.
good,I like working at Whole Foods. The customers were really easy to deal with and the co-workers are really nice and make working there fun. Its a fun place to work.
good,"Days go by fast and you will always stay busy. Management is different at every location, but most all have your best interest in mind.  Company generally lives up to it's promoted culture"
good,I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods Market. It was a healthy and comfortable work environment and my hours gave me the ability to have time for other things.
good,"I was always excited to work my shift a Whole Foods. I always went in with a smile and left with one. I was a Produce Team members. I would stock the fruits and vegetables from the back and pack them out neatly for the display. If you're willing to move between locations you can move up pretty quickly in the company. I wasn't willing to move locations, but I wanted to move up and it doesn't work that way. In all, relaxed, self-explanatory, enjoyable company. Would definitely recommend."
good,A typical day at Whole Foods was direct and formative. I learned how to communicate with different departments and customers. It was busy and fast paced.
good,"Working at Whole Foods was an experience. The demands are clear, the tools are top notch, the culture is great."
good,Overall a great place to start working if your barely starting your work career. hardest part was the early morning shifts. the most enjoyable was the great people.
good,"I like their core values, they also trained the employees to be respectful toward the protected categories. Loved my coworkers. Do not have any complain."
good,The culture is what makes it fun. They hire good people. Typically management is pretty cool as well. The only thing that can be a bit tiring are the people that shop there.
good,"I had the opportunity to work for two different stores while with Whole Foods Market.  Overall, it was a good group of people to work with.  Management was accommodating and fair.  The team ran a fight ship, but made it fun."
good,"WFM is the only place of it's kind that's giving employees the full package. Decent pay, benefits, PTO; it's really amazing. However; after the Amazon acquisition the dynamic changed immensely. The things that built the relationship between employees and leadership and how you feel about working there, were taken away. It's wonderful to make things better for the customers, but not if it's a t a detriment to the employees."
good,I enjoyed my experience at Whole Foods all the way up until the end when they were bought out by Amazon. The company was very caring for their employees and work was often fun. I would absolutely recommend a job at Whole Foods to even the best of friends. There's a lot of skills to be gained there.
good,"I enjoyed working at whole foods market, always something to do there. The people were great to work with and the customers really had an interest in health."
good,Dont know how much it changed but they definitely valued the employee it was great while I was there benefits and pay were very good.i hope nothing has changed but who knows...
good,"I write from experience as a former employee in the Front End Department, as such this should be taken into context with that area of Whole Foods Market. Speaking from personal experience, I can soundly say that choosing to work at Whole Foods Market for my first job was one of the best decisions I could have made as a new worker. While I had my share of issues to iron out before I could really become a great team player, my managers and team leaders constantly supported and pushed me to become a better worker. While I understand retail work may not be suited to everyone, and that it can be somewhat mentally draining, I still would recommend Whole Foods Market in a heartbeat because of the typically positive atmosphere and good team communication the environment fosters. Working at Whole Foods Market helped push me to become a better worker and a better person, and taught me great communication skills and assisted me in figuring out what I wanted to do with my educational background. Though it can be stressful, sometimes learning how to deal with stress during a workday or in interpersonal settings can be a great lesson, and it is one I've carried with me since then. As a bonus, the pay, at least in the store I worked at as a cashier, was extremely fair."
good,Great place to work for but pay wasn't high enough when i was there. Decent discount and can improve that discount based on health analysis.   Really the best manager structure I've seen.
good,"Wholefoods really taught me how to use my leadership skills in a positive and fulfilling way. Each store has their own culture and I was able to navigate through each store with the core values that Wholefoods promotes. Examples are : being candid, promoting health and environmental awareness, team member happiness and high  standards for quality products."
good,"It's was a good experience. People are helpful, bosses are patient , and the people are accepting. I had tines where i struggled but always was told and helped to succeed. Policies are hard tho"
good,"Whole Foods for me coming in as a Graphic Artist, really challenged me and prepared me for my next position I'd stepped in. It was a great experience."
good,"Overall, they respect your schedule if your a student , fair amount of professionalism. A LOT OF WORK and very fast paced! they do consider summer vacations for everyone which is nice."
good,"It was the best company I worked for, it is more organized and efficient than what I have seen at other stores. The culture is great the perks are great. The customers can range from extremely kind and neighborly to very bitter and rude. The store I worked at was not provided all of the resources that other store got so we seemed to be short staffed a lot and it seems that a small amount of Team Members were over worked to pick up the slack. There is no union so you can be fired for making a small comment to a customer if they complain hard enough, although I was fired I believe it is a good company to work for."
good,"Always something to do. Team members are fun and help each other. Management could be better, could be worse. Positive workplace culture. Awesome discount."
good,I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods. The management was respectful of my student/work life schedule. I liked my coworkers and am still friends with many of them.
good,Corporate employees have limited growth opportunities if they did not come from operations. Perhaps this has changed post Amazon acquisition? Senior leadership tends to marginalize opinions of corporate Finance.
good,"Fun place to work with friendly staff. "
good,"When you clock in, you are given an assignment by your supervisor, often either to float around (bagging, doing cart runs, restocking supplies, doing carry-outs) or to be planted on a cash register. Usually well staffed so there's not huge lines of customers. Great environment where supervisors know their responsibilities and do not demand you to take care of the situation when you need help. It feels like you are all part of the same team even if you're among shift leaders/supervisors. Watching your bosses doing menial work like bagging groceries or cleaning up spills when needed is a great morale booster. The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture that Whole Foods Market has created, which is hard to put into words, but is unique to this market. We all feel included, cared about, and valued."
good,"It's a friendly environment with a lot of opportunities to learn and grow in various different fields. Management tries to communicate and create opportunities for employees to grow in their position,"
good,"Working at whole foods is amazing only because salary is not bad, and team members are fantastic!!! Management is horrible, they will use you until they need you, then they will find excuse to get rid of you !!! You can’t trust anyone, always watch your back, terrible conditions to work i would say!! Management its a bit like MAFIA you can’t say nothing about anyone, or try to talk with any of them... Hot food is not always fresh :( not what you expect from such an expensive store!!!"
good,I worked as a bar tender and barista but could only collect tips from the juice bar side. Other baristas were not certified to serve alcohol so I had to do both without the tips.
good,"work is easy, i have learnt a lot in short period about food safety , customer care and prepare different types of meals, salads. friendly work colleagues and room to progress within the company"
good,"Store management was great, however the department manager could have been better at communication. I learned you have to work hard there, but the people area great."
good,"the provide good benefits. unfortunately, job and pay are not even. you have to retail shifts, early open and close late.  immediate management is fair."
good,There was no uniform requirements aside from wearing a hat and non-slip shoes. It was very busy and everyone was to be cross-trained with other departments. They also wasted a lot of food that I feel could've been given to the hungry or eaten by staff.
good,"Fast paced, team-oriented environment."
good,"I enjoyed working at WHOLE FOODS, Mangers & fellow employees were good to work with. I enjoyed meeting customers and found that many of them were repeat customers and gained their confidence."
good,If you're in the right store it's a good company to work for. They give competitive raises and there is plenty of room for advancement. You work hard but you have fun.
good,Opportunity for growth and bonuses if you put in the hard work. Several days of extensive training before you actually start working. Great place to learn about the better food living.
good,Culture is great but leadership needs improvement. It was challenging knowing how the vision of the company trickled down to our technology organization.
good,"Working for WFM was great. Everyone I worked with was great, the management were very accommodating to me when I had to go back to school, and it there never was a boring shift."
good,I really love that job it was good people working there. Just I think that the lack of training that they give you is very little. They could do a lot more better in training team members
good,Great place to work. There’s a lot of advancement opportunities and good management staff. Paid time off great benefits and good discounts.plus there prep foods department has a lot of ready food for lunch
good,co workers got along very well. Willingness to help each other. Clear communication between co workers. Supervisor was inappropriate with dealing with employees and customers.
good,"Whole Foods is a great company to work for. Great benefits, good rate of advancement if you're hungry for it, awesome discount. Team members start at 15 an hour."
good,Enjoy working with team members and customers. Really enjoy helping the customers find what they're looking for and providing more information. Co-workers really do work as a team.
good,"It was a fun place to work; I simply wasn't able to justify the commute. I'd work there again, but I think my beard is too long for them these days. A solid 8/10"
good,"i enjoyed my time at whole foods i I got injured after 6 years of service I showed the best customer service helping out other employee,s and trained other employee,s and helping out customers find certain things and helping them put grocery,s in there Cars and helping out in other departments of the store."
good,Good place to work. Pays well with decent benefits. Management needs work. Most co-workers are very easy to get along with. Love the products. Company is changing for good and bad.
good,The work atmosphere was great and I loved it! But i will say the management in the front end at my store had a lot of personal issues with envy and it reflected on the team.
good,I overall like my job at WFM but I was held back from a supervisory role by my teamleader. I feel heard by my store leaders and supported  and appreciated by team members and team leaders however the job is not fulfilling to me in particular because I want something that involves more challenges and pay.
good,"fast-paced work, but lots of socialization"
good,"Working at Wholefoods was a nice job to have while I was a young adult. It was fast paced, the customers were somewhat friendly. My coworkers were pretty cool to be around. I moved around a lot at that job from one department to the next. It was great learning experience. The pay was okay for what I started off doing which was cashiering. I would definitely go back to working at Wholefoods."
good,"Good place to learn new experiences."
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods, it is a fun environment to work in, some coworkers are very nice and friendly. They always giving you more hours if you need. You can always call the store and ask if they need help closing. (Even if you were hired as part time) Overtime is a little rough to get, they usually always say no. Unless it’s absolutely necessary. They pay time and a half for easter days, holidays, etc. So that’s always great. They are such a great company to work if you have the right management team. I worked under someone who had favoristism and did not want to help us when things got rough. The supervisors did not give breaks on time or completely ignored you. You often had to ask for your break. It was constant. But if you make it work for you then you’ll get a long way in the company. It’s a great place indeed. I’m sad to let go. But it was necessary. FYI, never under NO circumstances argue with another coworker. You will get fired immediately. Being there people have gotten fired over arguments, and have BEEN ESCORTED AND ARRESTED IN HANDCUFFS. For either fighting, stealing money from registers or stealing people’s belongings in the locker room. YOU WILL GET CAUGHT. So please do well! You do not want to do the walk of shame in handcuffs."
good,I would have stayed with whole foods if I hadn't moved back to Miami from Denver. There was some issues with management simply because they has just lost someone and things were kind of hectic in my department. I enjoyed learning about organic food. Getting a discount on groceries is always a plus. They offer great benefits to full time employees.
good,Fun coworkers and customers in a safe and upbeat environment. Flexible hours to work with your schedule. Optional benefits for employees based on position.
good,"I love it there ,I had a great team.While duties vary depending on the size of the deli, as well as on the products and services offered, typical tasks include preparing customer orders and packaging foods. That means making sandwiches, dishing up hot foods, slicing meats and"
good,">It is a Very good paced work day. Always something to do "
good,"A typical day working at whole foods included helping customers, returning items back to the rightful spot, unboxing and unpacking items to stock shelves."
good,Loved the people I worked with. Higher management could be a little detached from the reality of the floor. Very stressful at times. Short staffed. Hours were generally closing shifts which wasn't preferred.
good,Good place to work but last manager was not very honest. Told me that if i was to have open availability instead of a set schedule he could make me a supervisor. Instead he gave me all the loads and responsibilities of a manager with no intention on a promotion.
good,"Easy straightforward job! The WFM culture is laid back, friendly, and overall positive. Main caveats are the management who seemed overworked and took their jobs too seriously. Many employees felt exploited as they were not given the raises or the hours they were entitled to. "
good,"I left due to being treated differently for my disability. My disability was brought into the decision-making process of my promotion opportunity."
good,"I like working for hear, especially my store has the best management they really work with people, especially like those like me that required a lot of flexibility with my scheduling they were very accommodating around my needs since I ended up being a primary care taker for my father and during emergencies they were able to get my shifts cover so I didn't have call in or used PTO. I am grateful that I got to work with such caring managers it is truly a good place to work. My only gripe is I felt like we were often understaffed (due to not having enough budgeted labor) yet wanted the productivity of a fully staffed store. As a cashier I often had to check out and bag by myself customers who came with full carts."
good,"Always something to do, very fun atmosphere.  I learned a lot about the catering industry.  Learned how to make platters and prepare large orders for basketball teams, weddings.  There are a lot of interesting people who work there."
good,"All the jobs i ever had the pleasure of working for was were excellent."
good,"Really would not want to advance in this company, simply because I do not want to work in customer service. Good company, good values. I would recommend this to people who are interested in progressing if you can handle constant customer service."
good,"Good place to work, great environment. Lots of room for growth. You learn about health and food. You meet a lot of great people. Customers are very nice"
good,"Team Member for six years, I started in the Mid-Atlantic and now am in the Southern Pacific region. There is a huge difference in work environment and culture between the regions. The Mid-Atlantic was much more sales driven and team member focused. Where I am now they are just trying to spent the least amount of money on labor and our sales reflect the laissez-faire attitude of management. "
good,"Overall had a good experience working here.  Good culture, great co-workers, decent work-life balance. At the time - the company also had meaningful, interesting causes they supported - and great food perks.  Only downfall, paid below going market rate for corporate positions."
good,"Loved Whole foods culture! Love everything they stand for and loved all team members. Lots of hard work, especially during holidays, Would have loved more incentives. Changed after Amazon bought whole foods."
good,"Overall, Whole Foods is a good place to make a few friends, and get a little money while in school or otherwise. It was a very fun environment and management was understanding of students' circumstances. However, that culture is dependent on the managers. I have heard that management has turned over (whole foods has a high turnover rate) and the culture is much different now. I may have just gotten extremely lucky"
good,"It was an learning experience working there. I learned a lot and grew more because of this job. Had an pleasure to expand my horizon, knowledge for food. Met some interesting people  and some of which helped me better myself not just as an supervisor but also as a person. So much i learned, seen, experienced good and bad. But overall it is indeed a recommend an ideal place to work at."
good,Great place to work management encouraged you be yourself. Great benefits percentage of our groceries very Fair place to work. Customers and  coworkers love to shop and work at this beautiful place
good,"Working at the Boca Raton, Fl Store the hardest part of the job was dealing with the extreme demands of the clientele and the willingness of management to give them whatever they wanted even though it was obvious they should not have."
good,Most people would be pleased with working at Whole Foods given the benefits you receive and the access to healthier eating. It's ideal for people trying to save a bit of cash but also wanting to change their diet.
good,"WFM is an overall great place to work."
good,The job was get and so was the pay for just being a new hire. The work space was a bit tight to work in ( I had to share a work space with 3 people doing different task).  I got pregnant during the holiday season so I was hard for me to lift boxes of frozen products and to push the cooling racks. I stop working there before I was eligible to get maternity leave.
good,Amazing company to work for!  I felt fully supported by my manager who encouraged my growth within the company. I worked for the company for a total of 6 years and made some lifetime friends. The only disappointing change I saw over the years was the company's change from team member appreciation and support to corporate greed.
good,"Management can be a bit inconsistent but job security is great. If you're looking for a part-time or full-time job, temporary or long-term this is a good job form you."
good,Flexible just make sure you are there on time. There has been a changeover in corporate management so I am unaware of how the change has effected the culture and management.
good,"A typical day at work for me is busy and smily. The customers love to talk and make conversation,- very engaging environment. When work is slow, the staff works together to do chores that we typically wouldn’t get to do on a regular busy day. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the secxist environment that the staff themselves would uphold. Staff members would say that clothing rules are applied to everyone but, women were the only ones being held responsible for their attire. Men would never have to deal with a coworker or manager having to talk to them about their work attire. The lack of easibility to be able to switch shifts with other coworkers also complicated things at times. The overall culture and management was mostly fun and eventful. I most enjoyed “sampling” where team leaders would go around the store and get some foods for the staff to “sample”. Working at Whole Foods has helped me learn how to speak to customers and help them with their needs. It has also taught me to deal with rude or difficult customers. Working at Whole Foods has shown me (for the most part) what a respectful environment looks like from staff to staff interaction and staff to customer interaction. It is great to work in an environment that prioritizes their employees and how their employees feel."
good,The job kept me busy.  The pay is decent.  Most people were on the same page and made meeting goals low on the difficulty scale.  Many new employees came through the business.
good,"Fun place "
good,"Started off as a someone who had no experience in a grocery store and picked things up in days. Became a very important piece in our team. Was very responsible, and got promoted to Frozen Buyer. I was in charge of the frozen aisle and had to order everything in that aisle and if it ran out, i was responsible for it. The pay was where i wasn't too happy with, felt as if i did way more work than what i was being paid to do. Reason why i decided to leave."
good,"great for college kids or parents with small bills. never really have issues with guests, they're just EXTRA sometimes for no reason. management is a bit caddy and unprofessional with other employees."
good,"wholefoods great company to work for, wholefoods give u most things all company gives con was not being able to eat food that you knew that where goin to throw out"
good,Whole Foods was a good job for a little while. I learned a lot about different products. They are pretty good about letting you take time off if needed but it was hard to collect enough paid time off
good,It was a nice company to work for. Great benefits but the work hours are unpredictable and that makes the life/work balance hard. I liked my co-workers and most my supervisors. There is great opportunity for advancement.
good,"Fun work environment. Employer always gave back to staff.  Picnics, free lunch. Discounts always keep to up to date on sales. Hardest part of the job was no set hours they changed weekly. Many times you close and open if they really like you they trust you there the most."
good,"Its cool, the location I am at is pretty cool. The job is pretty cool. Not a lot to say about the place but that its pretty cool to work for them and they offer alot of benefits."
good,"Quartley meetings where you can win good prizes (Flat screens, bluetooth speakers, ect)."
good,"Whole Foods culture varies store to store, but the store that I worked at in Austin, TX was one of the best job environments I have worked in. The managers were understanding and willing to help meet your needs and the customers were so kind."
good,There are a lot of opportunities to change departments and even for advancement if this is the industry that you are interested in. The overall environment is good.
good,"Passionate about their message, really makes you happy to be part of the team. Fast paced, interesting background, fair management and happy atmosphere"
good,"All the employees and uplifting and cheerful, everyone seems to get along while at work. the manages have friendly relationships wit employees but still have a serious side. The pay and benefits is good. But the Job/Life balance is terrible there. If you work there that is your life."
good,A typical day at work always consists of warm greetings from fellow team members and sometimes a briefing from leadership on what tasks need to be completed. Customers are usually a delight to interact with. There's always room to grow and learn whether it be in your own department or transferring to another. My only gripe has been a lack of attention to raises. I am coming close to 3 years and there are newer team members who make just as much as I do now.
good,"Whole foods was an amazing experience as a working student. It paid decent, and its work atmosphere was great. Management could be a little more attentive to its employees needs, but otherwise it was a fantastic experience."
good,"Good place to work. Was stressful, but any customer service, especially food service, will get stressful. Any issues with other team members, supervisors, or management were well handled once HR and/or management was informed of the situation. Coworkers of all positions were friendly, courteous, and as helpful as possible. Management tends to be patient and understanding. The company treats its employees well."
good,"I loved the positive environment, good food, and company culture. The job itself is monotonous and not creative. You pretty much just check out groceries for the entirety of your shift. I got a better paying job, so that is why I left."
good,"love working for the company put you are more appreciated if you suck up to the team leaders, which is not something I would ever do. for that reason, I can never advance"
good,Overall I was pleased with my experience there. I wish I had started in Customer Service because I felt well suited there. Overall it was a learning experience.
good,"Whole Foods is Team Member driven. They provide support and opportunities for advancement, benefits like PTO for all team members, insurance, 401k, team member discount of 20%."
good,great benefits and incentives to become and maintain a healthy lifetstyle. The work was creative and I could market my own section of the store. Can be a happy place to be.
good,Non stop busy but our mangerment team made it fun and easy. They respect everyone there and make it possible for us to move up in the company. They keep us going😍
good,"Great benefits and they offer a lot to try to keep their ""Team Members"" happy.  Scheduling can be a pain if they don't realize you closed the previous shift and open the next morning but they work with you as much as they can.  Rotating schedules make it hard to plan your life outside the company."
good,"Fresh Pack - I had to cook, prep, and packed different production I am ordered to prepare and have each product displays at the empty store shelves. Often time, I am prompt to different production and/or catering."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Whole Foods. I met a lot of really great people working there. I would honestly have to say my favorite bosses have been working for Whole Foods; they were incredibly supportive and understood how to empower their employees.
good,WFM has taught me a lot. There is a lot of diversity whether its the team members or the customers. You are faced with different types of people and objectives daily.
good,"Had issues with management and although I was in the wrong which was behind my termination, my general work ethic and experience at Whole Foods should have provided enough evidence on my good character and willingness to support all."
good,"The culture of Whole Foods for team members was very supportive with many opportunities for personal growth, even if you flounder a bit at times. If you are there long enough, you build really amazing relationships with the people you work with. I really miss my fellow team members."
good,"Great work place, wholefoods and Amazon together are giving a different point of view full of changes and hope for a better future.  I like work for this company."
good,"One of the few places where you grow into a family that thrives on genuine camaraderie, support and team spirit. The work is demanding but the personal rewards of accomplishments mixed with customer appreciation can be well worth all effort put forth. Never a dull moment or chance to be bored."
good,"I enjoyed working there, they gave me day old sushi. "
good,"Tenure was short term but it was a pleasurable work environment.  Overall, the staff was a pleasure to work with during my stay.  The job also offered additional work benefits that are not typical for type of employment."
good,The work can be a little stressful at times coworkers are great people most employees are good people that say hi to you there are few in there that are you know miserable because they don't like the work doesn't doesn't mean you should be rude to your co-workers not hold doors open for them things like that. My manager is a great guy is good to everyone treats everybody the same which is the way it should be. I like Whole Foods Mind Set On what they're doing hopefully it continues to improve.
good,"Wonderful place to work! Talented, passionate staff. Truly inspiring leadership.  Until bought by Amazon and closed, making all 93 team members redundant."
good,"WFM is a fun place to work. Very well paid team members and if you work in retail this is the place you want to be. WFM marches to the bear of their own drum. Very little stress even during busy days, they really care most about their team members."
good,"This was a pretty good job when I started 3 years ago, but it has really gone downhill. Rules and regulations are ridiculous and way too much is expected from employees. It definitely isn't a bad job, especially for the pay, but don't expect it to be easy."
good,Whole foods was a very relaxed easy going environment. It was a judgement free zone with so many different types of people that you encounter. They are willing to train you for any department that you desire to work in and are very accommodating to your availability.
good,"The store just had opened and there was poor training, Over Production of food for the Chef's Case and Bakery. "
good,After transferring from a San Diego Whole Foods I realized how relaxed the company is and made it very enjoyable going to work everyday. Co-workers are very friendly and the managers are very likable.
good,"It was a descent experience overall. I was there when they did job cuts though. they handled that as poorly as i have ever seen. a lot of GREAT, HARDWORKING people were let go of unprofessionally. I was fortunate enough to make it through, but the company morale sort of fell from that point. BUT that was 3-4 years ago..."
good,"They promote team member wellness  and provide great care for when issues arise between employees. "
good,I worked here throughout college in Chicago and the management was great and worked with my changing class schedule every quarter. Pays above minimum wage by a couple of dollars. I left before Amazon took over but I've heard from friends that it has become more stressful.
good,"Often understaffed, very busy, but generally good management and teamwork important to company culture. Inconsistent hours for part-time, so no comment on career prospects."
good,"working here is pretty fun.  Typical day at work includes ringing up customers, dealing with customers, and working as a team with co-workers to achieve a goal."
good,The company culture is great in terms of educating about product knowledge and also standards that are associated with those products.  The management allows one to be creative and make personal decisions that could possibly drive sales.
good,people that been working there for years still workk at the same position. they been cutting hours lately. management can be better in certain stores. Not a lot of team members. the store atl (PAUL) is bad. unable to communicate with him.
good,"Having worked for Whole Foods Market for the better part of a decade, I have seen a lot of changes, mostly with the management and now corporate infrastructure. After policies and procedures are committed to memory, the day to day work cannot be beat."
good,"It was an great experience for me. Everyday I meet new people, and tried new foods. That was one of my favorite things about the job, was the food. Also is a great guy."
good,Was a decent job in the Specialty Department. What's not to love about high end cheese and Beer and Wine. I can't speak to working there after the Amazon takeover though.
good,"I've always been wary of corporate culture so stepping back into a ""retail"" environment was a cautious step but overall worthwhile in the end. I planned on staying 4-5 years in my Graphic Artist position but due to changes in Whole Foods global management the position was eliminated. Severance is a fair amount and the news was delivered with tact but it's sad to watch something as homegrown as Whole Foods turn into another mass-production, giant corporation."
good,"I worked here during college and it was a very challenging to work here. Well it depends on your Team Leader but in my case, you can work your butt work and put all your efforts into getting everything done and still not feel appreciated they always wanted more. Being a full-time student at the time plus working in the bakery there was also a lot of drama as well. However, I did have a lot of fun because its the overall culture of the company and also the people you meet whether if its a customer or coworker they help making the time go by."
good,"Great place to work if you want a low-stress, friendly environment. Management style is relaxed. Everyone is super friendly. If you want to move up in the company there are opportunities every couple of months for different leadership roles. The only con is that I feel they aren't hard enough on people that call out all the time or don't work as hard as the others. They pay well for a grocery store, more than any other in my area. I have greatly enjoyed my time working here, it just doesn't line up with my career goals. I recommend this job."
good,Great company and culture but changing slowly with the introduction of Amazon. Management is supportive but is handicapped by the expectations of global mixed with the expectations of your regional team.
good,I had fun working with my co-workers while learning about different cultures at the same time.  I think the hardest part about the job was difficult customers.  The reality is that you can't please everyone.  The best part of the job was meeting my co-workers and having great interactions with them daily.
good,"Good Job, Good benefits, Co-workers are great and there is a real sense of community. Advancement can be difficult due to competition. I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods Market."
good,I enjoy working at Whole Foods. The people that I work with are great and we get a long past the working relationship. Some of my coworkers have become my friends. My day starts early because I open and once 7 o'clock hits there is no telling how the day can go. With this job you have to be a quick thinker. Sometimes there is a customer that requires a little more attention and you have to be ready to help them to the best of your ability. The hardest part of my job would be when it is understaffed and you have to deal with customer and order alone. But when the team is present there is really nothing that I don't like about my job.
good,I enjoyed the store atmosphere at whole foods. they stressed working as a team I learned alot about health foods and health care products. They offered alot of incentives to work there.
good,Worked there during college. Great low key low stress job. Manager gave a lot of freedom and creativity. Good place to start a career in the grocery industry.
good,"excellent place to work"
good,It's a great place to work if you are going to school or if you like customer service and food. It requires a lot of physical work but little mental stress unless you are a manager.
good,"The busyness of a workday varied from day to day, on the days that were busy it was optimal that you  could adapt and adjust on the fly. "
good,"Learned a lot while working "
good,Work With customers and placing orders in the bakery. Learning how to rotating inventory and pricing merchandise. Co-workers were a wide variety of background ethnicity. It was hard to leave due to love and compassion of working my co-workers and customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer locate and purchase merchandise and enjoying downtime with co-workers.
good,"Work and hours will be a challenge for balancing work and personal life, however scheduling vacations is easy. Leadership is always actively working toward team member happiness. Benefits  and pay are really rewarding."
good,Mainly restocked the floor. I learned a lot to do with organic foods and how certain foods are processed. Management was OK at best there was a lot of repeated orders that went around.
good,"The work culture is great, which clearly communicates the core value of the company. The store manager, team lead, and other employee are very helpful."
good,Amiable employees and a healthy atmosphere. There is the expectation for you to do your job but leadership can be pretty relaxed and tries their best to work with you on your needs and goals.
good,"I typical day at work is helping the customers. I think the customers would make it the worst, as they're hard to handle. Other than that, it's a lovely experience. The company really makes a family out of the team members."
good,It pays the bills.... they always are looking for new team members the best way to find a job at wholefoods is to go on there web site under careers and see what they have available
good,Working at Whole Foods Fremont was a very fun and cultured place of employment on a typical day you are meeting new people and making very tasty food that ranges from so many healthy options.
good,"Wholefoods was a relatively good job. I applied when they were opening a new store which is probably the best time to apply there. All the staff is generally friendly. My department was arguably the hardest department in the store; prepared foods and it was a lot of work, it is not to be taken likely."
good,"Fun and relaxed place to work, can be stressful at times but overall its a pretty lax environment. I would recommend to anyone that's looking into working for Whole Foods that they should"
good,"Whole Foods was a great place to be for rapid growth. They focus on skill set rather than seniority, which makes advancement very fair. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Good co-workers, okay managers but a good work environment... just need a lot of patience. just need to work well together and have good communication with each other"
good,"Could pay employees higher... but compensate that with good benefits. Has some politics like any other job, but if you work well there are opportunities to advance"
good,"The business was going through a series of trials during my employment period. The company's ideals were favorable, but ownership and planning were par. Much of the staff was outspoken, and it came to me as a bit of a culture-shock (favorable by some means nonetheless). The company taught me of many culinary facts and methods that I've been allowed and able to share with my friends and family."
good,"Very busy Production Plan learning"
good,A typical day would be preparing foods for the display case and selling to customers. I learned proper knife handling and furthered my knowledge of kitchen equipment.
good,Great place to work. Love my co-workers. Great location. Fun atmosphere. Amazing being so near the best grocery store in the world. Laid back atmosphere but challenging as well.
good,"I thrived working for Whole Foods Market. They do a good job of building a community in each store. However, the looming fear of getting laid-off due to budget cuts was alive and well. As the company is continually passed to more revenue-minded individuals, the company loses its charm and grassroots culture as it becomes more corporate."
good,"Employees are fun and happy, customers are happy and satisfied."
good,"Good place to work, i like that you get a raise every six months while back when i worked they did, idk about now. Great benefits, face paced during holidays."
good,"Fast paced, and a lot of responsibility. Co-workers are awesome, food is great. Be prepared to be stretched thin most days. Self motivation is a plus."
good,"If you're going to work at a grocery store, Whole Foods is your best choice. Of course it's still retail, and so one still has to deal with bad customers and having to work long hours during the holidays, but as an employee I always felt like I was treated like a person by supervisors and management. Fellow workers were always friendly and made the store environment more positive, and there were ample training programs and other opportunities for moving up into supervisor and store leader positions. While I worked in customer service, the biggest down side was that I had very little control over my schedule and often had to work long and inconsistent hours. When I switched to produce department there was more leeway in the schedule. Overall I've had a good experience with working for Whole Foods. It's not easy work, but the company culture makes for a livable environment."
good,"it is a good place to get along with others, but definitely not easy as you might think about. As a team member, you will experience a lot with a bit of everything, such as customer service, packing foods, and cleaning."
good,"Flexibility in hours, strong team bonds, good benefits, but salary could be higher and it is be fast-paced & stressful, and fixing issues/effecting change can be hard to do as management is slow to react."
good,"Everyone are friendly, i felt safe to every persons around me, nothing to worry about , management is the best among the rest, you can make fun with them ."
good,"Overall a great experience, benefits are great but the pay is low for the amount of work you are asked to do. Growing a bit too fast without the proper organization but the culture is really awesome!"
good,"One of the most important core company values is Team Member Happiness."
good,It's just groceries. If you stay organized and do your job well you'll move up relatively quickly. Make sure to ask for more $$ every chance you get. They do offer competitive wages.
good,It was difficult to feel motivated when you did not see deserving individuals get opportunities for advancement. There was high turnover and it was difficult to get long lasting qualified employees.
good,"We are a team oriented which always make it more fun to work regardless how difficult is an specific day, it is a really fun place to work. all team member feel appreciated and work hard to insure the job will be done at the end of the day, we recognize and reward for those team members that go beyond of their responsibility."
good,"Whole Foods provides a good work/life balance, flexible hours, decent pay, and good benefits for retail employees. Management is typically understanding of needs and supportive to those who need it. Best of all, Whole Foods team members are largely a great bunch; diverse, interesting, and kind. Whole Foods promotes from within, so it is a good match for those who are looking to get their foot in the door at an entry level position. Promoting from within does come with a cost, as management can be old-fashioned or stuck in their ways, but this will likely change as Amazon's impact manifests throughout the company. Amazon's ownership is the big question mark at Whole Foods, as it remains to be seen what the future holds for team members and customers alike."
good,"Great place to work! Flexible schedule.  Efficient supervisors and managers.  Wonderful discount!  Third party certified organic, and human raising of beef, pork and chicken."
good,I have had over three family members that worked with Whole Foods. I was the last one to join the Whole Foods family and I do not regret my experience. I recommend others apply with the company.
good,you get what you give working for whole foods. The company is pretty set when it comes to your work. They are willing to accommodate with early notifications and as long as you go to work with a positive attitude a career in whole foods Is highly likely.
good,Very great place to work. Great atmosphere with focus on team member happiness. Great opportunities for advancement. The company is mission driven and does a good job backing its missions and values.
good,"Love my work and my team, but am chronically underpaid. Work success and happiness is 100% based on management. Make sure you get someone to advocate for you."
good,Cool people to work with and for someone looking for a job starting out at 10$ an hour is not bad if you need to get on your feet and get something with decent benefits. Nice that they also offered stock plan to hourly employees.
good,"I started with the company in 2002. In the beginning I can say that Whole Foods was a great place to work. When I was at work it truly felt as though I was working with family and friend. My customers where friendly and I felt as though my co-workers had my back and vice versa. As time has gone on I can say that the Whole Foods is slowly becoming more profit driven and main stream as opposed to having the ""family feeling"" that it once had."
good,"Whole Foods is by far the best company to work for. Management takes care of you, benefits are great and there is plenty of room for advancement. Shifts are fun and most of the customers are great"
good,WFM is one of the best retail grocery stores out there. Great culture where employee feedback is valued.  It offers a lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"Whole Foods Markets is an interesting place to work because it has workers from all cultural back grounds. It also gives a good and interesting working environment for people who enjoy being with people and ready to learn. "
good,"Great place to work, great people, free food samples and employee discounts. flexible hours, pto benefits. team building field trips. local food vendo"
good,I had previously worked at New Frontiers for 5 years before Whole Foods bought the store. They made it very easy to transition. It was a pleasant place to work. I have always loved customer service and had taken on quite a few responsibilities . I loved my work-family and enjoyed the work very much.
good,It can get very busy and demanding but it is overall a great place to work. If you need time off or someone to talk to it is very easy to find someone to help you. The people at my store are amazing.
good,"I started working at Whole Foods in 2010, because of all the great things I herd about the company. For those who want to put in the work and learn the company their is tons of room for upward management. This company will usually pick the internal candidate over an outside when applying for promotions or higher positions."
good,"dealing with customer questions, helping customers with whatever they need, management is great, whole foods brings in the local community, hardest part of the job is dealing with team members calling out. enjoy the food"
good,"-constant customer service "
good,Very good team to work with and overall very good community and culture. In my two years of working there i had very little trouble or complication with management and very much enjoyed my supervisors.
good,Allowed me to be a leader and not a manager. Have cut labor by at least a quarter over last 2 years making business very hard to run. Work life balance recently lowered.
good,I am still currently employed and I like to work there. It starts at a decent pay and is an easy job to do. The tough part is balancing your time. You never know what to do and when to do it based on how busy it is or if you are opening or closing. Most of management is pretty down to earth and is very understanding.
good,"I like working at Whole Foods Market. They are a company that treats their employees well. A typical day varies and is never the same - I like that! I've learned a lot about myself and my leadership style from insightful and invested leaders. In general, the workplace culture is open and values emotional intelligence. Some leaders/managers, of course, lead differently."
good,Over all was a great place to work at when it was Bread and Circus after the buy out all a lot of change that went against the employees making not that family own type of business
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers. Everyone was nice and made the stressful days a little better. The downside was some of the management although there were great managers, the people in charge weren't that helpful or understanding."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is helping to run a successful bakery and mentoring employees who want to learn and move up. The least favorite part of my job is employees who have no interest in working or moving up. I have almost always been in a management position, but working at Whole Foods has really got me into the financial part of running a bakery. Most days consist of buying, receiving, bakery production, merchandising, making sure all employees know expectations for the day and any other bakery related job that needs done. I love being able to help make the changes that I would like to see or that need to be done in order to be successful. Work place motto is work hard and be kind. Awesome words to live by."
good,"A standard place of work. Do what is needed to be done and everything will go well. Great atmosphere, great customers. Very well put together and professional."
good,"Although the hours varied greatly, the overall work environment was pleasant and the values of the company far surpass any other company I've worked for. The care for the product and the customers is unparalleled. This company cares just as much for its employees, offering above-minimum-wage pay and benefits to even part time team members. Great company to work for!"
good,A place where you can achieve a lot of your health goals in life. this is also a company who teaches you what is healthy and what is not which is key to its image.
good,WF was a great training company and values that they stood behind.  During my time I held several rolls from ASM to STL (store team leader) as well as special projects to support the region.  Running stores on a daily basis was my primary job.  It was great to make your store your own and watch it grow.  The only challenge was when WF started to go in a new direction from what they stood for.
good,"The people are fantastic, it's what keeps you motivated. Advancement is political but the experience gained is unmatched. Perception is reality, so make of it with what you want or believe."
good,"Overall, a decent place to work. Good pay and benefits. Low staff levels make for a sometimes stressful work day and make it hard to meet management and corporate's standards. Unwritten understanding that anyone above a Team Member will work through their scheduled breaks."
good,"The day would start with checking emails and replying to them. Then would be placing the required orders by email and phone. As mine was a food department, I would meet the Retail team members and kitchen team members and ask their requirements and feedback on sales. Later on preparing reports for Sales, wastage and forecasting the sales of next month. I have improved my communication and management skills. Most of the Managers were from Americans as it is an American Company. Everyone has to come on time and have to go on time. The hardest part of the job was to achieve margins which I have achieved every month. And the enjoyable part was that it would be so busy throughout the day that u will not realise that u have worked for 8 hours."
good,"Every day is about supporting team members and team leaders in a variety of ways.  Helping Team Members with questions about their payroll, benefits, 401k, available leave of absences, etc...Assisting Team Leaders with clarification about protocol in a myriad of job duties such as recruitment, ADA, HIPAA, LOAs, payroll corrections, labor, scheduling tools, etc...  My job was to support all members i my locations while also supporting and mentoring peers.  The culture at Whole Foods Market is very loving one and team members alike care for each other like family."
good,Great Opportunity to learn about the retail business. Just like any other job it is what you make of it. If you want to move up you can and if you just want to come in and work you can do that as well.
good,Pretty good company to work for.. Great benefits .cool people. Fun atmosphere. Worked there for ten yearsi really enjoyed working for this company. Whole foods.
good,I enjoy working at Whole Foods because I have gotten the opportunity to learn many new things about food. I enjoyed being part of a team and working as an individual during my shifts. The hardest part of the job was when there were too few people put on the schedule.
good,"very flexible scheduling"
good,"Enjoy working here as a part time job. Enjoy working with customers and fellow team members. My overall eating habits have improved tremendously, in addition to general food-knowledge."
good,I worked so hard and had very many duty's like clean the bathrooms sack the groceries get the baskets and but the groceries back if the customers did not want anything or could not pay for them
good,"This is a great and relaxed environment for the most part, but there seems to be a lot of favoritism in management. You really need to suck up to management in order to actually grow in the company. It doesn't necessarily matter how hard you work; you need to get ""connections""..."
good,"A single day at work was hectic and fast paced, and it cold be hard to keep up sometimes. But management pays attention and rewards hard work. They helped me learn how to communicate effectively with co-workers as well as how to keep an eye out for things that needed to be done around the store. My co-workers were all very friendly and the company even took us out on picnics and the like. All in all, it was a good experience and I enjoyed my time there."
good,Whole foods was a fun place to work with a lot of available opportunity and reasonable compensation considering the type of work that I did. I would consider working for the company again at a higher level in management.
good,"Typical day as the produce value-added team would be to clean your station, create a check list, and follow said check list. It was my job to fill the shelves with cut fruits in a container. It is an easy job but it is a physically tasking job. But working with the right people will help a lot. Working with a good team makes you feel like you can cut anything and get things done quickly. Makes you feel like a produce warrior"
good,"This company has sustained me for the past 15 years.  They give good raises, if you work hard, and have great benefits.  I believe in the company's core values and see it their practices, even though the company has had to make some changes.  It's often times like family.  No complaints from me."
good,"One of the better jobs I've had. "
good,"Responsibiliting: "
good,"A typical day at work was enjoyable depending on who you were working with ,most people are positive at whole foods, I work in the bankery . Since I work in the bakery I was there at 3 a.m. and left by 11 a.m. I was usually out before many people started working."
good,"A typical day at Whole Foods involved stocking shelves, checking in products from trucks, customer service; buying to replenish inventory;"
good,A typical day at work is standing 6 to 8 hours if you work full-time and 4 to 8 if you work part-time. Management listens to you but if you want to move from front end it is difficult to do. You have to ask and ask to be moved to another department.
good,"Whole Foods was an amazing place to work.  Surrounded by motivated, creative, passionate, dedicated, and core value focused people.  It's changed though, and competitors have moved in pushing the stock price lower and lower.  Today, the company is focused only on growing the stock price, not the success or happiness of it's Team Members."
good,I thoroughly  enjoyed working at Whole Foods. The pay and hours offered were great. I wish there were more of a variety of shifts available. But other than that it was fun.
good,Working at whole foods definitely helped improve my customer service as I was constantly interacting with them about our products and even sampling them. Co workers from all departments were friendly as well. I generally liked that they worked around my school schedule.
good,"Corporate office location is the best place to work at. You can learn a great deal about natural foods without chemicals and GMO's."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, and they reward loyalty and hardwork. I would say they should either pay more or give a larger discount to employees."
good,"Great entry level HR position, they allow you to take as many vacations as you want (within reason), great place to meet unique coworkers, very committed to learning and devolpment"
good,It a easy going job. You get benefits right way. They make feel like you are part of a group effort.People get to experience different variety of foods. Lots of foods I never seen before in my life.
good,"great work area, fun working with everyday customers, food was great since we get discounts! cool place overall! "
good,Overall this is a great place to work. The store I work in is under new leadership and it was very much needed. We are headed in the right direction was sales heading in a positive direction. However my personal growth within the company seems to have stalled and therefore I must continue to search for new and challenging ways to improve my skill set and my life overall
good,"I worked here as a produce clerk in one of my first full time, 40+ hours/week, jobs and the only thing negative I can say is that eight hours of stacking and sorting fruit is well...kinda boring.  However, the people I worked with were awesome."
good,Working for Whole Foods I learned a lot about food and coffee. I felt like I traveled the world without actually leaving. I learned how to roast coffee from scratch and cut cheese. The management there we very welcoming they encouraging you to get promoted. The hardest part of the job not having products that customers need. The  most enjoyable part of the job was working in the catering department where i was able to make cheese platters for customers that they enjoyed.
good,"It is a nice place to work depending on the department. The benefits and pay are great. I dealt with various tasks. Each department has different sections to it. In produce where i worked they had a floor team, cut fruit, dips, juice, and vegetables. The holidays are busy."
good,i loved working there in this dishroom but alot of days it would be myself but the job culture was fun i made alot of friends.
good,"I loved being able to work in an environment that sold awesome organic food products.  I loved being able to share my knowledge of nutritional supplements with the various customers who came into the store.  "
good,my typical day at work consist of interacting with customers teaching them about the products or helping them checkout.The co workers are very helpful and nice when it come to needing assistance and teaching new comers the in and out of the company.
good,Great place to work. Management at the time was sub par and in need of an overhaul. Friendly co workers and great benefits.
good,"The company seemed a nice place to work, I was rather separated from the culture as i was a self employed independent contractor."
good,"this market teach me the base of be in the food business!"
good,"As an associate team leader I am responsible for planning, financial success, scheduling, merchandising, hiring and accountability, team member development as well as overall impeccable execution of department."
good,"Looking back it was kind of boring working at Whole Foods. Production is fixed and the same every week therefore not producing any room for creativity or variation with each food product. Recipes are fixed from high above. "
good,"In my 6 years there I enjoyed almost every aspect of the jobs that I held, although there naturally were rough parts. A typical day behind the bar was started with me organizing everything to optimize workflow and then I would put orders in for beer. In between I would typically have to prep all the coffees, beers, and smoothie materials. The rest of my night would just be preparing the bar for the opening employee and helping customers."
good,"A fun place to work, and manage. Customer interactions are usually good, and employees have creative freedom to do projects/ job depending on the department. Left because of corporate ""restructuring"" aka lay offs."
good,Whole Foods Market was a good place to work. I was a dishwasher and my manager was an angry chef. Getting time off was close to impossible
good,"Enjoy then opening environment and create win win situations for there partnerships for other companies. Full flesh benefits 401k, medical and so much more !"
good,"Very flexible schedule, keeps you busy at all times, very friendly co workers. They are very helpful if you days off for appointments well as long s you tell them two weeks of advance. love working there"
good,"I've worked here almost 10 years and had good experiences within the company. If you're looking for a fun and happy work environment, this would be a company for you to enjoy. If you work hard, it's easy to advance in the company."
good,"During my typical work day I am responsible for ensuring the store is opened on time by providing all monies for cashiers, as well as the cash office functions are properly done by the team. Throughout the day I complete various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, reconciling and  coding invoices to various accounts for payment, identify discrepancies in data and statements, follow up with vendors on any issues. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,The home of people that take pride in providing the best of quality in all natural & organic food. enjoyed follow co workers felt comfortable enjoyed the work setting0
good,"Manage shift of about 8-10 cashiers, work service desk where many customers come to fix problem, handle muli line phone. Cash handling , training lots of computer work.And weekly knowledge classes"
good,I loved working for whole foods. I hear they are rated one of the best cooperations to work for considering medical benefits. They worked around my school schedule. They paid very well considering the pay scale of other grocery stores. I didn't stay long enough to use them but we were given paid sick days off as well as paid vacations. The staff was very friendly and very helpful during the training period.
good,I really loved the work environment here. I loved the work and the fast pace but ultimately I left because there were no offered benefits to the job position so  moved on.
good,"Whole Foods Market is the perfect place to work while in high school or college. The culture is very positive. In my opinion, Whole Foods Market is a model leader in Team Member happiness."
good,"Positive environment"
good,It's a good job when you're in college but not long term since they're going through a restructure. The moral hasn't been the same but the pay isn't bad. Benefits are somewhat ok and the managers tend to care more about you. I'd recommend this job to anyone who's wants a decent part time job
good,"A typical day at whole foods is pretty laid back, I learned to become a leader in the retail world here. The co workers are cool and the customers aren't that hard to deal with."
good,"While the advancement opportunities could be nice, restructuring, work place demands, and company changes contributed to mixed workplace feelings, and and uncertain future."
good,"Good salary, good benefits, family-friendly employers. Customers can be difficult. Very busy during holidays. Store leadership changes fairly often, so tone of store changes."
good,Great place to work. Eventually they will part of the top companies to work for.  Improvement for less genetically modified products.
good,"Working for WFM is great! Our company does a lot around the world to contribute to the benefit of so many people. In addition we are the leaders in so many areas like pushing for transparent GMO labeling, sustainable farming and fishing practices, etc."
good,It is a very diverse place to work.  There is an opportunity for growth.  It sometimes can be challenging for minorities.  I have learned a lot about organic foods and healthy eating and it has encouraged me to start changing eating habits and the purchasing of all foods.
good,"Easy to share  your love of food and organic lifestyle, liberal policy on personal expression, good learning opportunities and training, good benefits overall."
good,"It's a grocery store, you show up and help people decide what they're going to eat for the next three days. Clean up. Go home. Rinse, repeat."
good,It is a easy going job that you can move up fast in. As long as you do your job and have good attendance then there is no problem. It is hard to get fired so if you work at WFM it is a good job to have because they work with your schedule.
good,"The Company treats its team members like family. If you have a problem, be it personal or professional the management team will work with you."
good,I really enjoyed working here however with the recent changes and new management in  my department every 6 to 8 months it was very mentally stressful.
good,"Great benefits package for full time. Nice discount for you and your spouse/domestic partner. You meet great people whether customers or coworkers. Great vendor support for product knowledge. Can get busy, but it is a grocery store so that's to be expected."
good,"Whole Foods Market has taught me a lot of different customer service skills.I learned how to manage working in a fast paced environment. With Whole Foods being such a large store and the rotation of management, plus the fact that they're are over 30+ other team members in the same department; I feel that you are constantly trying to prove yourself over and over. The team members are very easy to get along with and management is fairly considerate of your needs as a worker. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers with their exhilarating personalities. Overall, it was a positive experience working here but i'm just ready for the next step."
good,"-1st, 2nd and 3rd shifts worked"
good,This company truly practices its stated core values.  You have an opportunity to do what you do best each day at work.  This company's leadership truly cares about the employees.
good,Great company fun people. PT really means FT. FT means no life. Great employee discount on quality food. Overall fun place great people.
good,"The work load at Whole Foods is best summarized by the common saying, ""little things add up."" We are given many tasks to complete that on their own are not difficult. The difficulty comes when we must learn to prioritize these tasks based upon time efficiency and necessity. These tasks include, but are not limited to, cleaning food surfaces, loading/unloading pallets, stocking the sales floor, updating logs, assisting customers, and disposing of waste in the appropriate manner. Customers can be rather dependent on workers for assistance, but that is essentially the niche of clientele we attract based upon our store culture. The team members are very easy to get along with and management is fairly considerate of your needs as a worker. The most enjoyable part of produce that applies to all locations is the encouraged sampling of our products for knowledge purposes."
good,"Great pay, great work standards, and great customer service. Could stand to advocate for employees more. Sometimes arbitrary with rules."
good,Wholefoods market is quite a pleasant work environment and pays above the average customer service job. But it really depends on the manager and team you get. Mine is great.
good,Able to serve customers with fresh and quality product. Have customers experience exotic fruit. Its a company that values Team Member Happiness which generates to more productivity and en joyful place.
good,"The company on the whole has come under fire, but the location I worked for had amazing team members and upper-level management was completely incredible to work with."
good,Great culture of inclusion. Everyone feels like they are contributing intellectually as well as time and production. Lots of freedom for individual expression. Great work/life balance.
good,A typical day is surrounded by lot's of customers which is great! If you like customer service then  this is the place for you. They strive to provide excellent customer service and pride themselves on being able to do so.
good,I have always loved this place as a Shopper ! As a Chef I thought oh this is a dream how ever the dream turned more along to be a bad dream . Wholefoods for a grocery store great as a chef not so much . Pay isn't top notch for a chef as a cook or team member cashier its great but for a chef the key is all in the ability to really create and as for the markets ? Not really easy however as a company wholefoods is amazing . They give the best beneifts hands down and they truly care for the enviorment and the employees as well as the customers
good,I would show up at 9am and meet with the dairy buyer and the rest of the dairy team members to see what needed to get done right away. I would make my rounds around the department and made notes of what needed to be restocked. i stocked the product and moved on to the next task.
good,Count my money and take care of the customers who were paying for their items. I learned business is a never ending cycle.
good,I love the foundation of this company and it's values. My career really took off here. During a restructure it became clear to me that I should move on for my own growth. This is a great company to grow in.
good,"Loved working for Whole Foods Market! Started off as a Deli Clerk, to Team Educator, Catering Specialist, Kitchen and Front of the House Supervisor and Venue Supervisor specializing in craft beer. I learned everything from efficient and safe work practices in the food industry, giving great customer service and recognizing the bad, sales, buying, margin reports, cost-outs, effective marketing practices, training Team members, taking part in hiring and firing Team Members, learning how to give Team members constructive criticism. Worked in the Pub Venue area where we served craft beer and local and international wine. Met with beer and wine vendors daily to get the new beers in. Management was awesome! My Team Leader saw a lot of potential in me,he worked and trained with me which helped me move up very quickly. Hardest part was sometimes I was left to figure things out without any sort of direction nut like anything I learned from it and began to ask a lot of questions and found ways to keep me organized, focused and motivated. Most enjoyable part was knowing that everyday I clocked in I would learn something new. The company was great and I would of stayed but unfortunately I was a victim of lay-offs."
good,"Whole Foods has been a pleasure to work for! The work culture is great and management is always willing to listen to you issues or concert. The only issue I have is that you are not able to have a steady schedule and requesting days off can be frustrating if you do not get it in early. Likewise, the harder you work the more you are rewarded! Whole Foods walks the walk!"
good,"For the short time that I worked for Whole Foods Market, I enjoyed my job and the people I did it with. As a dishwasher, I had to buckle down as soon as I clocked in, and not let up until my shift ended. My trainer told me ""let the job get the better of you, even for a moment, and your entire department will have to stay late to pick up your slack."" My team was dependable and reassuring. I worked as hard as I could because I knew they had my back. What ultimately led to my leaving the company wasn't the stress, or the pain. I chose to leave my Whole Foods because of the way management treated their employees. Bear in mind that I am only referring to my store, not the entire company. For the most part, Whole Foods is a wonderful place to work, and an ideal place to start a career; benefits and compensations abound. But with as rapidly as the company has expanded in only the last two years, newcomers are treated less like people and more like numbers. Although, I suppose the same could be said about any other new, wildly successful retail industry."
good,"WFM has great core values that most of the Team Members lived by and are proud of. The Team Leaders are all very cool and practice the ""open door"" policy. They have quarterly ""all store"" meetings to inform all team members of the profits and losses. Competition openings in our areas and how we handle any negative or positive feedback. The health benefits that they provide for the team members is a huge benefit because of the affordability."
good,I worked for Whole Foods as a project coordinator when i first started. Then came 2008 and the economy took an unexpected down turn. I was moved to a Senior Project Manager and had three direct reports. When i left to go to Chicago the dept had grown to 7 and we had successfully opened three stores.
good,A corporate entity that does not really seem like it because of the core values. Truly dynamic and in a constant level of change. At times it can be so fast paced that development and training can fall through the cracks - detriment  in producing strong leaders. The best part about the job is the culture and the passionate individuals that work there. Definitely big on benefits that it offers its employees and it does it's best to offer that to as many people as possible.
good,There's a great ability to move up in the company for young folks looking to take on responsibility. Can be a fun work environment depending on the attitudes of other team members and customers.
good,"I have worked for Whole Foods for almost 6 years expecting to only work part-time to get through college. I turned Whole Foods into a career path through dedication to my craft after graduation, when I managed to move 3000 miles to become an Associate Team Leader. It is a fantastic place to work where you learn so much about yourself as well as the people around you in an environment that supports growth and team member happiness and excellence. The job demands a lot of standing and lifting in stocking beer, wine and maintaining the cheese department. At Whole Foods, everyone is trained to be able to handle any aspect of the department. The company is characterized by its dedication to superb customer service and leading by example."
good,Great start to any career.  Learned everything from customer service to budget management to management skills.  I feel the values are changing as they continue to grow and believe the changes are what made Whole Foods different and made people want to work there.
good,"Learned many marketing strategies "
good,Wholefoods market is a great place to work and have fun. I love meeting new people on a daily basic. I learn something new everyday. I love how you learn to grow within the company to further your knowledge of products.
good,Working for WFM has empowered me to come out of my shell when it comes to customer service. I have the power to make customers happy without any guidance.
good,"Whole Foods Market delivers a reliable job opportunity for person's amenable to the corporate mindset.  They once offered recognition and appreciation for employee's unique personalities and positive contribution to the company.  The present trend is toward a cookie-cutter customer experience, thus eliminating the signature and special nature particular to each location.  The benefits package is above average, although, I witnessed it being trimmed down considerably over the years I worked with the company.  The team members employed by Whole Foods Market are most certainly the cream of the crop in personality, work ethic, customer service, creativity, and altruism.  The management was hit or miss in my experience.  There are opportunities for advancement, but the money is not on the paycheck; it is nested in the benefits package until top tier management is achieved.  Consideration for advancement is based on numbers, not ability, networking, not character."
good,"Over my tenure with the company held a variety of positions in a variety of locations.  The compensation and work environments are generally some of the best in a sometimes very unpleasant industry.  The decentralized nature of the company gives you a tremendous amount of freedom to succeed or fail roughly proportional to your contributions.  The flip-side is that decentralization creates an ever-increasing amount of inefficiencies and redundancies.  Positions become silos and some employees have a ivy-league professor-level tenure, regardless of their actual ability and contribution."
good,While the lower staff is fun to work with and works well together. The management at wholefoods market is always lackluster and plays favorites.
good,"I would recommend this job for anybody who is all about organic food and healthy living, a student, or someone who needs some extra income, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I care about."
good,"Good energy within the work environment, cool co workers, I learned a lot, they want their employees to know & love the product they sell."
good,Plenty of opportunity for advancement if you work hard. Excellent learning environment and decent work life balance. Good benefits. Sometimes a little too much politics.
good,"great benefits, great people, there's always snacks around, and the discount is pretty terrific. I negotiated my starting pay based on experience but the base pay isn't terrible anyways. If you work hard and adhere to the culture, you'll be just fine. Wholefoods wants you to be happy and healthy!"
good,"Whole Foods Market is fun place to work, and I'm so honored I had the opportunity to be part of such a good company and a wonderful team."
good,I love working with in my department and the team members at our store are amazing people!  I love when our vendor reps come in and train us as well as help with the customers.
good,"Whole Foods has a sink or swim model to training."
good,Great job to be able to work for with community and gaining experienece in marketing and community relations. Not a job or place for career advancement unless  you are willing to relocate.
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods because I eat all organic and they have the highest quality and largest variety of anything you could want."
good,"A typical day would usually mean clocking in to a series of ""fires"" from the shift before.  Those ""fires"" became the first challenges on a shift and were rarely as frustrating as they were satisfying to catch up on before moving into my more regular, job duties."
good,Whole foods market has an amazing mesh of awesome people. Most employees enjoy there job and come to work with a smile cause they are happy there.
good,"While whole foods seems like it is a small food chain, it is really a quite large company.  It has grown too fast so they are still working out management dynamics and company cohesion.  At store level it is a fun and supportive place to work, get past that and it becomes one wacky mix of goals and ideas."
good,"You have to be quick on your feet, be a quick thinker and be ready to improvise if everything goes wrong. Your hands have to work fast and to be able to manage time well to get all the things done for the way. The coworkers were very encouraging. The hardest part is that there is a lot of favoritism going on so it was very irritating to deal with on a constant basis."
good,"Management is what will shape your experience at Whole foods. I say that because they are what makes your job easier ( ordering right supplies, leading correctly, efficiency in duties distributed to team members, etc). "
good,"A typical day includes reviewing sales from previous day and entering them into our scheduling system to stay up to date on weekly sales projections."
good,"you meet a lot of interesting people from different places. I learned about organic foods and GMOs. I didn't really like the scheduling and favoritism towards the vets that worked there longer then the rookies. I like that we all work as a team, especially when the store is busy. This experience built my customer service to another level. I have learned different Technics to deal with customers so they can leave the store wanting to come back."
good,"Fun environment"
good,"Whole Foods was so diverse, i learn to associate with different lifestyles from both my coworkers /supervisors and even the customers on a day to day basis. It was a really fun environment. Work hard and have fun was the exception at this fast pace environment."
good,"Working at wholefoods changed my life. I worked for whole foods as a cashier, Customer service and the best was our daily goal. i learned so much about food and whats good for you and what can harm you, in my job description we are the last person that they see, so we have to leave the client with an experience and knowledge that they didn't have before."
good,The entire staff cares about giving quality service and products. Team Leaders are not trained well enough but the company encourages growth and opportunities for advancement.
good,Enjoyed working with everyone in the front end. Had a lot of customers with questions & concerns about everything! The best co-workers anyone can ask for!
good,"Enjoyed working at Whole Foods Market just need more hours. My co-workers were really nice, Management as well. I learned a lot about organically grown fruits and vegetables. I enjoyed being able to work in different departments."
good,"Overall good place to work.  It is up to you to make the most of your career here.  You can move up if you want to.  At the end of the day, you are still working for a grocery store."
good,"Whole foods is a great place to work, grow your skills and try lots of different roles."
good,"Worked in the kitchen cooking and preparing food along with other jobs throughout the day. Cleaning ,keeping stations full, etc..."
good,"excellent interpersonal relationships."
good,"Working at Whole Foods offers me an opportunity to meet new people all day long, work as a team, expand my knowledge of grocery and produce products and provide customer service to all that I encounter."
good,"one of the best food markets in america , very healthy and a smart place to shop"
good,"I was hired by Whole Foods Corporate Office during the huge Grand Opening hiring event. Very quickly, I was placed in a management position, working with Human Resources as an employee trainer."
good,The hardest part of the job sometimes was dealing with angry customers. I loved my co-workers.
good,A typical day at work consist of coming in and having fun with the people that you work with. I have learned how to not take myself so seriously and that talking to management about any problems is easy to do.
good,"Whole Foods is a huge multi country organasation that orders and cooks the healthiest food money can buy. They take pride in celling non processed food that any customer craves for. They have great benefeits,comfurtable dress code,and and a pretty good employee discount. Very organised and well mantained. The employees are very professional and hard working. They have employees from just about every country.They have high sanitation standards and a lot more responsibilities than other retail companies but other than that a great company to work for"
good,"I quickly grew bored or working the deli and packaging up food for customers so one of my managers let me move in to the back where the kitchen was. Which allowed me a lot more freedom pertaining to the amount of work I did, the type of work I did, how I presented myself, and how long I would work each day. Once in the kitchen, I began first prepping for the large salad bars, after a few months I got the hang of how much food and which ones to prepare for the coming days. At which point I began to cook for the hot bar in my spare time. I was one of the quickest people to be promoted to Team Educator. At which point I was also in charge of organic paperwork and audits, health inspections, and training my team on all aspects of the department. The first two months I worked there we had a department manager and then he got fired. This left the department in complete chaos. Store management began firing anyone that had worked with him out of fear that they were influenced by him which made the atmosphere and day to day working life quite stressful. Over all the company had good core beliefs."
good,excellent company to work for. very high on employee happiness and wellness
good,"A typical day at work included running the cash register and/or bagging groceries. I would have to keep a clean and organized work environment and occasionally I would also help run and maintain the café area. Running the café included keeping the water coolers full, stocking the utensils and napkins, cleaning the tables, emptying the trash and recycling containers, sweeping the floors, and returning the trays and drinking glasses to the kitchen to be washed. My management were always really friendly and nice to everyone, they made us feel really comfortable and stress free when we were at work. They were very approachable if we had any problems and would treat all of us with respect, which in turn made all of the employees respect them as well. My co-workers were all very nice and outgoing people who I was able to learn from, especially with how to start up conversations with customers and tell them about our fundraisers. I made friendships with a lot of the other employees and that just made the work day go by smoother and I knew that if I had a question about something that they could answer it for me. We all worked together as a team to help keep the front end running like clock work. There wasn't really a hard part about this job, I liked being there every day no matter what shift I had, and I found every part of it to be enjoyable, working with other employees and with the customers."
good,A great way to learn how to be a good customer service representative. Good work environment and healthy work relationships with co workers.
good,Overall not a bad company to work for. Benefits are good and you can accrue quite a bit of personal time off.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a few main procedures."
good,"I maintain the salad bar five days a week, which consists of cutting vegetables, making various salads, and keep the bar looking nice and neat.  Other duties include cooking chickens, heating and maintaining soups, and provide customer service when needed."
good,"Most of our Team Members are long term. We have a real family atmosphere."
good,"-freight throwing, order writing, financial checking, customer service"
good,"The hardest part of the job for me was that I was never publicly appreciated. I felt as though because I had a few absences, the hardwork I had put in when I was there went unnoticed. I took up shifts in other departments gladly, yet I wasn't compensated well enough. I was the hardest working person at the company for a few months, all the while going to school and doing other extracurricular activities. Co-workers are great, but turnover rate is so high that it's not worth making friends with the current employees. I started the job about 10 months ago and to this date, there are less than 10 co workers that have been with me through my whole journey at the company. A typical day at work will consist of bagging, cashiering, and doing whatever is needed since the store is so busy."
good,Whole Foods is a fast paced but fun work place which is good for teaching people how to work.
good,"Wholefoods culturally is the best Company I had ever worked for. If it wasn't for the benefits package and compensation  I would never had left.. I miss still miss the people and place but I have a family and could not make ends meet with what I was provided."
good,"Pros: Busy environment in my department (prepared foods). There is a lot to learn about food and if you work hard and pay attention you can get plenty of extra information that the average person does not know. In the bigger stores, you can advance rather quickly. Again, this all depends on your work ethic. The average person in the food industry did not work very hard so if you can keep moving and not complain you will move up if you want. Generally the environment is rather positive and the store can go above and beyond to help. For example, at one store an employee past away (outside of work) and when the team member discovered this they all left. EVERYONE left. Including the Team Leader. They called in people from my store to cover. This lead to a lot of mistakes and arguments but no matter. The medical benefits are good too. $10 every 2 weeks for full health coverage. If you NEVER get a serious issue then you likely pay very little out of pocket. If something serious happens you are responsible for the first $7,500 (at this time) until you get 80% help. These numbers may not be exact but it is close."
good,"Whole Foods is not your typical grocery store and the people it attracts are generally a cut (or three) above. There are a lot of food fanatics, and a generally positive work atmosphere. But there is also a lot of pressure to try harder and do more. Don't get me wrong--I like that. But it can be pretty smug at times. On the other hand, it is a fast-growing, highly profitable company that likes to promote from inside. "
good,It's a great company to work for and pays better than your average grocery store.  You can get bigger discounts by how healthy you are which keeps lots of people in check.  Management is usually very understanding and helpful and moving on to another department or transferring to another store is quick and easy.  I can't recommend this job any higher.
good,"i cooked beef brisket, pork shoulder,chicken wings and parts for the smoker bar in meat dept. imaintained the bbq bar and rplace and rotated product for customers. i was also a meat clerk that took customer orders and maintained meat cases as needed with product. i learned to interact with public in retail environment and work in fast paced production. management was very hands on and helpful. coworkers were of high quality and experience. the hardest part of the job was dealing with understaffing periods where 50-60 hrs/week for months at a time. the most enjoyable times were when you exceeded customers expectations and seeing their joy and surprise"
good,"I enjoyed working at Whole Foods, as an employee, learning new things about it's core values everyday, and working with my team members on a daily basis.  Management could step up a little, when it comes to hearing their team members responses."
good,"Whole foods market gives me the opportunity to inform and personalize with customers about health foods and new alternatives to living  a healthy lifestyle. I love the culture of Whole foods market, the people that I meet, and the knowledge of healthy eating makes the company worth while."
good,"Retail responsibilities absorb most of the day, Learned about organic procedures, management is top notch, co-workers on my team are the best in the business, work hours make work life balance challenging, helping customers and educating"
good,The schedule is very flexible and all the team members are very helpful and fun to work with. Good benefits too.
good,"For my position in particular it was important to manage the needs of nine teams as well as retail support. The people were some of the best; helpful, kind, compassionate, and hard working. It was very difficult to be able to do all of the work required in a 40 hour week. It was important, too, to be able to have a flexible schedule on a moment's notice."
good,a typical day started with Supervisor meeting; allocating Team Members to different deparments and assigning duties. Learning and developing motivational techniques to get the job done in an efficient and safe way in an eight hour day. Working side by side with all Management to acheive same goal. The hardest part of the job was keeping the team focused when the RIGHT thing needed to be done to acheive success.
good,great company to work for and meet a lot of good people to learn from
good,"On most days Whole Foods would be packed with customers and I would have to cash out customers and bag their groceries. Also I would have to help customers around the store with any questions they'd have about finding an item. Working there gave me the experience to be able to withstand working under pressure in a fast paced company. I enjoyed the company of my co-workers, with the majority of them being very personable and kind people, and I built relationships with some of them that have continued until today. The most difficult part of the job would have to have been working on holidays when the rush of people would be unlike any other days. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to have been simply working there and meeting all the people that I met in the store, including celebrities."
good,"A typical day at work involves a variety of self appointed tasks, where I balance managing a team of seven to ensure excellent standards on the sales floor, clear communications with outside vendors and donation recipients, as well as social media and website maintenance. I have learned to effectively manage a team, to conceive and execute marketing campaigns, building on my knowledge of graphic design and effective outreach methods. I thoroughly support the development of my team members and adore working in the natural food industry with like minded professionals. The hardest part of the job is managing many duties without a second in command and finding balance."
good,A typical day at work is really easy and not that many problems going on. The management is really nice and speak every day get to know you for who you are.
good,"great work place, great benefits, great management, they only bad thing is the work schedule"
good,As production team leader I would typically start the day with a staff meeting reviewing the previous day's tasks and laying out the objectives of the day.
good,I'll explain when I get a job opportunity. I work hard for fair pay and so do my other tram members. My management team treats people with respect and wouldn't ask anyone to do anything they wouldn't do.
good,Productive and fun place to work. Long days. Mean customers are all typical of the days at Whole Foods.
good,"You meet good people everyday, it was a well organized facility and your co- workers are good people the hardest thing as leaving and the best part was meeting new people all the time"
good,"I would always be one of the first to the store in the morning to receive product, and pay invoices. I learned a lot about working with people here, as I had to directly work with basic team members, and managers/store leaders. Hardest part of the job was getting people to understand how crucial a role it played in sales/store operations, despite the fact I did not directly generate sales."
good,"A typical day starts and ends with ""five-star customer service"". Your day starts with putting the best product available out for our customers, and ends when you leave knowing you did your very best to ensure every customers satisfaction and return!"
good,WFM is definitely a progressive environment. The TMs there are very passionate people that believe in the values of what WFM stand for. It is also a very diverse group of TMs as well with different mindset and thinking that foster creativity. One of the qualities to be successful at WFM is the ability to be able to adapt to changes. The work environment is non-formal and the regional structure is pretty flat so conversation happens between different group of TMs occurs more freely.
good,The customers are friendly for the most part. Team members are excellent in what they do. Management takes responsibility for errors or customer complaints.
good,"A day at work depended on how busy the day was. I learned a lot about time management and how to greet and talk to customers especially if they were regulars. The workplace culture felt very homey as everybody worked as a team. There was no competitiveness or drama in the workplace. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers, however, it helped me gain a fair amount of customer service skills and trained me to think quickly when problem solving for them. I feel the most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with customers and having them come back to the store."
good,Fast paced environment very dynamic with a wide range of customers.  Day to day operations were consistent and holidays were fun.  The Management was understanding and fun to work with most of the time.  I really enjoyed learning about Meat and Seafood there.
good,it was really good to work for them. The company has good benefits and they people working are very friendly and team players. typical day is just waiting on customer to purchase items and management is very helpful great atmosphere
good,Very organized store to say the least. I loved my time at the store. Sadly personal life situations prevented me from working there any further but i loved it.
good,"I enjoyed working at Whole Foods my managers and assistance manager was always great . Great co- workers."
good,"My experience at WFM was overall a good one. I had great coworkers, great benefits, and good hours. They offer many services for employees, opportunities to move up, and appreciate their staff. However multiple members of management in various departments are highly unorganized and will exploit and take advantage of your work if you let them. I let them do that to me, but looking back I would approach things differently. It is a fast paced environment and is not meant for people who can't handle that. I liked it because time went by fast."
good,"Whole Foods was a very positive goal orientated place to work with multiple opportunities to grow. Manager, team leaders made it very east to communicate with."
good,"The job was not difficult, the people were welcoming and it was not hard to get hired there. A manager was always in the store looking after things. The discount is only 20% but that’s not so bad."
good,"A lot going on, still the best retailer to work for, while changing some and becoming more about compliance it is still the best retail food job out there. And Amazon is your parent company, enough said."
good,The pay at Whole Foods Market is good and I have learned a lot about organic foods and how to take care of your body. Whole foods have a lot of benefits for their employees and customers.
good,I enjoyed working in the Specialty department.  I gained a tremendous amount of product knowledge and was able to try so many new items.  The job certainly sparked a passion for food and drink
good,The scheduling is rough and random for those wanting stability. Pay bills and things like is hard because some weeks you’ll get good hours and the next it’ll be terrible.
good,I learn about the organic seafood and the culture that whole food put out to staff and customer and I learn to eat more healthier. whole food also provide great training programs for new employee.
good,When I initially worked for Whole Foods it was during its prime as a company. I was so proud and excited to be part of a company that was so employee and culture centered as it was my first oficial job out of high school. The company had great benefits and provided a lot of excellent training in the past. After the rocky buy out phase with Amazon I feel like the company has become more about sales and numbers being produced and has adversely affected the culture of the company far away from what I initially grew to love and be proud of. It is a stable company with some employee benefits but it is a shell of its former self.
good,"At my job. I would come in set up deli and burrito station. Prep vegetables , cook rice, and fry tofu. Helping others compete set up of prepared foods for case."
good,Could be more flexible with the schedule since it is supposed to be a rotating schedule but the favoritisms there is ridiculous and unfair. Other than that WholeFoods is a decent place to work at
good,Good place to work.  Most of the people that work here are friendly.  The upper management is accommodating and supportive to me and the other supervisor.
good,Overall had a great time working for them as the managers rarely told me what to do since I had a good handling of my job duties. I was very knowledgeable in this department.
good,It have a promising future if your dedicated to strong work ethics and staff is everything that you will teach you the basics about the position with your required.
good,Good company to work for. Enjoyed my time working for Whole Foods would recommend them as a great place for employment. Lots of opportunities to advance your career.
good,"I learn a lot of things working at Whole Foods about organic food and local products. My colleagues, supervisors are helpful and nice. Working schedule is flexible to my needs."
good,great company to work with and very fun place to work with. More diverse and inclusion . Team moral is very high and team growth depend on performance
good,"This is a really great company to work for. I've worked here since high school. They have great corporate values, an emphasis on environmental sustainability and great entry-level starting pay"
good,"A typical workday is filled with stocking shelves, helping customers find what they're looking for as well as helping fellow coworkers get the salesfloor ready for customers. The work culture is the best part of working here as I haven't experienced any discrimination of any kind. "
good,Seemed to be a passing through job or stop enroute to bigger and better things for people. Worked with a good group of people and the discount was pretty sweet as well.
good,the experience I had at wholefoods was great! The environment I was in was a great place to work. Co workers and customers were very nice. It was always clean and neat!
good,"Poor benefits. I love my job and the work environment. It's unfortunate that the company is neglecting to m offer a benefit package to meet my needs.  "
good,"while my store's management was not to par and very demanding, the store experience overall was above and beyond well for me. Great team members to work with and a great place to move up."
good,"Overall great company. Would recommend to anyone. They had many programs for assistance and growth; medical, dental, insurance, and 401k. Everyone was kind."
good,"pretty nice place to work, i learned a ton working there, made a couple new friends, overall if your looking for a chill place to work that pays relatively well in the beginning, work for wholefoods."
good,"I enjoyed my two years at Whole Foods Market. I was treated well and loved my team members. Customers could be a challenge due to being spoiled to Whole Foods giving in to almost all complaints. Management lacked a spine for that and for difficult employees. Other than that, I enjoyed my day every day."
good,"Great job great people great food, health classes gym membership larger discount for healthier employees, exceptional stock investment planning, cooking classes, for handing license, full training, 401k"
good,"Its a great company to work for,  wholefoods has great opportunities. Always looking for growth and new opportunities to better me and my family. It's like a family."
good,I learned a lot about how to relate and deal with customers and how to really be someone that can connect with customers. I also learned how a typical business runs.
good,"Good place to work, Nice staff friendly good benefits....They care for the team member, always helping each other and  the team leader always supporting the team member ..."
good,Whole Foods is a decent place to work but is definitely more of a temporary stopping point for most employees. I worked there before Amazon bought Whole Foods so I can't speak for the culture now but they did an average job of identifying hard working staff and compensating them accordingly.
good,I enjoyed the training and the team members attitude towards the new hires. Whole foods team members really enjoy their work and it shows as you walk in and notice the smiles on their faces.
good,"great company to work, fantastic team worker. great benefits, take cares of every employee equally. equal employee opportunity with great 401k matching."
good,There was a lot of good people who worked for the company. The leadership at the store was a green team. they were in a learning curve so that could have used some help
good,"Negotiate with suppliers for favorable prices, terms, quality, and delivery"
good,Pretty relaxed environment. Not too much stress. Very nice coworkers. Almost all of the upper management was super friendly. You can really work at your own pace.
good,"A typical day at work is busy and productive.  I learned that it is possible to have fun working long shifts, and that work benefits like health savings account can be quite good.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a lot of very nice customers, and there are also a lot of great friendly team members."
good,I enjoyed my time working for the company. Really good part-time pay and I loved the cleanliness of the store I worked at. The other employees always helped out when I was confused on where something was. And made sure you was okay every time you came to work.
good,Room for advancement and a strong work environment.  A place where being a team player is beneficial and required. Would have liked to have more cross-training and better experience on the sales floor.
good,If you want build a career in food store than Whole Foods is the perfect choice. Whole Foods will help you move up the ladder if you are interested and show how great of worker you are. This is a great place to work and benefits are great also. So if you want to work for Whole Foods than take that step you will enjoy it.
good,They offer a lot of benefits. Management varies by store and department. The company itself cares about its employees and their well being. If I could find a part time position i would work there again.
good,"I loved the people I worked with at Whole Foods. There will always be people that you don't get along with but they were greatly outnumbered by the ones I did enjoy working with. Management was always flexible with scheduling and offered overtime or leaving-early if it were really necessary. Management also worked hard to help promote people, always scouting within their own teams which team member could become a supervisor or manager or work at the regional office."
good,"Nice place to work, staff was friendly and helpful. Be sure to ask all the questions you have if you're new. Training was not very thorough however you will be held accountable for all responsibilities and duties."
good,"I was hired to stock produce, and moved up as prep and showcase on the floor. I was given free range of the area i supported and made me feel appreciated."
good,Wholefoods is a fun learning getting to learn new things everyday meeting new people and working hard make u achieve your gold and dreams.wholefoods u get to meet customers and help them teach them about product works and making healthy meals and being healthly
good,"We're an upscale casual restaurant chain, known and loved for our extensive menu, generous portions and legendary cheesecakes and other desserts. We delight our guests with delicious, memorable, made-fresh-from-scratch dishes served with warm and gracious service and hospitality."
good,Not a bad place to work. It was a lot better when i first started compared to when i left. And since I've talked with people still there i used to work with they say its gotten worse. The quality of the food going down is something that made me want to leave.
good,A very fast-paced challenging work environment with many helpful team members to guide you. Easy to work your way up and communicate with management. Fun to come in every day and interact with different kinds of people.
good,"Great culture and people. Things got a little weird with the Amazon buy-out.  It used to be more of a co-op type atmosphere, now it's more corporate-focused."
good,you have to have some knowledge of the products there or willing to learn. depending on your department some are harder then others so although you struggle in one place doesn't mean you have to stay there. customers can be very annoying and they tell you that in orientation but cant be too rude. It was cool for money i was just money hungry at the time i quit .
good,"Learned new skill sets including conscious leadership, mentoring, culture based leadership, time management skills and ability to work in an environment that promotes from within"
good,I had a great work environment at whole foods. I had a great time working there and enjoyed the Team members. I also enjoyed learning the different dept.
good,"Whole Foods is a nice company to work for because the employees are generally happy and the ambiance is uplifting. There isn't much room for advancement, but the discounts and perks make up for that."
good,I enjoyed my time at whole foods even though getting there was tough once i was there I definitely felt at home. The team members were nice and they always helped you get better.
good,"The atmosphere is great always has a good vibe all around fresh produce and workers always there to do there job and give good customer service if you need something that store has it if it’s for a dieting plan or just to find something new and tasty, Whole Foods is the store."
good,Overnight is a no stop run to the finish! Peers are fast at what they do and are helpful. Managment is always nice and ask if you need anything. Pays more then most places in the same position.
good,It’s a great place to work at and I wish to continue but unfortunately time to do other things. Everyone is nice and help out each. Customers are great.
good,whoe foods is ok could be better but its ok i like working there i like my co workers the cool fun to be around sometimes the customers can be rude but itd cool and management could be better
good,"A great company. i love working there. Whole foods is unlike most grocery store.,The climate is different. management is great. The pay is good ,  Would recommend"
good,"Working at WF, you'll be a part of a big company culture with a simple mission but great mission. Company culture is a part of the structure and you'll be grateful for the ways which Whole Foods has made it fun to work there. Hopefully, you'll meet a bunch of cool folks there, like I was fortunate enough to do. They're very easy to work with, and everyone wants you to do well. I felt like I was truly in a place where team leaders valued work/time and also the fact that we are all unique and have our own lives outside of work. What you put in is what you'll get out."
good,Fun and different place to work donot have to much more to say.great place to work great enviorment. Great workers and a clean working environment. Good food
good,"Most of the employees are friendly. Each department has a different team leader, some are more lenient than others. Strict absence/tardy policy but forgiving for most things. Benefits are okay. Discount is decent. Allowed to transfer after 6 months of employment but do your research. If I knew then what I know now, I would not have transferred out of my original hired department. Overall, fantastic place to work. Highly recommend."
good,The store is clean and neat. All the employees are friendly and have a great attitude. Offer a great discount for the employes as well. The workplace culture is not comparable to other stores.
good,Not a lot of team communication during my positon and not a lot of help with showing me what to do before my training. I just wanted it to be more about being in a helpful positive space and not leaving the moment you have to punch out.
good,"Can seem overwhelming at times when 1or 2 people call off sick, but you you will Not find better team members to work with Anywhere.If you DON’T call off a lot you can climb go as far up the ladder you want ,they look for outstanding performance/Customer service,self motivation."
good,"My day at work consists mainly with dealing with customers. Most interactions are pleasant while some not so much. My coworkers are amazing, and so is the management. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work directly with and help solve customer problems."
good,Every team member you meet at whole foods market you build a bond. They are your work family. The leaders are very helpful and work on one on one time to build your leadership skills. Set up mock panels to prepare you to achieve your future goal.
good,It is a great place to work. They have great discounts.  Very easy job working with customers and ringing up their purchases daily.  Every one here is nice and reliable and management was very kind.  The basement where the breakroom is is a maze though
good,"I did my work and management respected that. I was reliable and honest with management and in return they were the same with me. The juice bar was probably one of the busier departments in the store besides prepared food, and because of that turnover was high."
good,Wholefoods is probably the best paying grocery store out there and has much more life to it than most. I found myself having a good time interacting with customers more often than not.
good,"Learned to manage time/schedule , work on social skill, and wonderful coworkers also manage to learn different recipes with a wide variety of items in store"
good,"Took stock of salad bar to see what needed to be filled. Checked in with coworker before me to get a grasp of what needed to be done. Checked in with my manager. Filled bar and made other recipes for what we needed throughout the night. Then at the end of the night broke down bar, discarded old product, and cleaned. I learned time management, and built upon previous skills. Work culture was great, very flexible, and great atmosphere in general. Hardest part of my job was downtown. Our store was generally slow and I always finished my work ahead of schedule. When there was downtown I kept busy by cleaning, helping coworkers close and learning different positions in my department."
good,"Great company to work for If I would have love to work with the company again.. great customer, benefit, pay and overall great place to work. Management"
good,"My day to day was managing the front end to include cashiers, customer service supervisors. I also did till audits and money pick ups and drops. I would jump in as needed with the work flow"
good,While working at whole foods I made some important strides. The overall work environment is friendly and open but just decided working with food wasn't for me.
good,It was a great experience working at Whole Foods. Everyone is very helpful and they would always have a little surprise for team members. You make friends with employees and with loyal customers.
good,"Worked in produce and floral for about six months. Pay and culture were decent, clientele can be a little strange sometimes. Things have definitely changed since the Amazon buy, as far as I can tell."
good,Little strict about certain policies but treats their employees well and makes more of an effort than most companies. I enjoyed my time at the company and would not hesitate to return and apply myself.
good,"The managers and supervisors at my location were understanding, flexible and awesome people. The training was great, I felt well prepared and had the skills to do my job well."
good,A great company to work for. It has  great benefits for your family. Also has good big healthy variety of food for all consumers. Overall its a great place to work or to shop.
good,"It was a grwat place and i love working at that place."
good,"I worked at Whole Foods almost 2 years and it still remains one of the best jobs I've ever had. Staff was cooperative, friendly and helpful. Hours were flexible and scheduling was thought out and not overwhelming. Yes it is still retail and you'll still have the same drama that comes with it, but it was never as awful as other stores. The only time I felt overworked was holidays but that's to be expected. While i was there perks were good and we got a lot of treats and free goodies, though I've heard that's changed since Amazon took over. Either way it's a good place to pick up something part time while you're in school or if you have another part time job."
good,"Team members are met with the opportunity to interact with a wide range of customers, are exposed to many great products, and are given the opportunity to learn more about where their food comes from."
good,"Company helps in developing their employees. "
good,I like it.. Alot of training.. I really dont know whay else to say about it because i wasn't there in the daytime i worked nights and the night time crew was great
good,"East to learn job with plenty of opportunities for you to move up in the company. They are flexible with availability for when you habe obligations outside of work (I.e. School, religious obligations, etc.)"
good,The only con about working for whole foods is the way managements handles how customers treat their employees. It would be nice if they had our backs and trusted us over rude customers who think they are always right and demand things at the drop of a hat.
good,"The store is always busy and you are always working on something, you get to learn many new things. Unfortunately the management is very poor and unfair."
good,This was my first job in New York and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to work in the food industry. Management was great and the wage was decent for the time that I worked there.
good,Working there was fun as long as you did your job and your coworkers were cool. Moving up in Whole Foods wasn't that difficult as long as you showed your dedication for your work.
good,"I learned a great deal about how to manage a team, how to purchase and merchandise products and how to develop a strong team."
good,"The atmosphere and people I've met at this job are some of the nicest I've ever met. It's a pleasure going into work somedays. Days are long, stressful of course, but the job offers many good benefits."
good,"I've been working as a whole body team member for over a year and my time at whole foods has been a blast! They really do treat the employees well. On fridays, they provide fresh fruit for everyone, sometimes if there is a mispick, team members are able to take stuff home. Everyone is super nice and I've made so many good friends."
good,"Most people are happy to be there. There is a great emphasis on team work. Store leaders take the time to get to know all of the team members, everyone matters. Typical retail scheduling with varying shifts for many team members."
good,"Whole foods is a good place to work. Although, the corporate feel and rigid structure has become more prominent after the Amazon takeover. I worked at a busy location so, it could get very stressful at times. Management always showed appreciation for hard work and good sales."
good,Checked emails. Wrote out daily tasks. Stocked shelves and placed orders as needed. Worked on receiving credit for customer returns. Made sure invoices were paid and submitted them to the receiver. Wrote the team work schedule. Provided customer service. Scheduled team trainings for products the department carried.
good,"A company that had to change its ways to stay competitive in the new landscape of retail.  Whole Foods Market changed the way customers shop.  Natural and organic products have been pushed into the main stream because of the success of Whole Foods Market.  Company culture tries to serve the team member and provide the best product, service possible.  The values of the company try to include many stake holders and you must take a step back and look at the whole picture to see all of the benefits of inclusion.  Staffing was in issue and at times compromised the ability to achieve standards.  The relationships with all parties, customers, team members, venders and management was the most enjoyable part of the job.  Hard working job that really relies on self driven team members that do the best they can with what they are given."
good,"This job definitely gave me the social skills I needed ,people are very friendly & very helpful! "
good,It's very flexible with how you are able to interact with customers. The management and front team are very relaxed and comfortable to work with. They work around your schedule and are very accommodating if you are working two jobs. The only thing I have to complain about is the lack of advancement and clear favoritism.
good,do not care to review company. was good job but that is all I will say at this time..blah blah blah next week is a new day to fill the body of this letter
good,On a normal day I would be in charge of making delicious coffee and smoothies ensuring customer satisfaction as my primary objective by listening to occasional customer complaints and working on the issue in order to maintain customer and brand loyalty.
good,"Pleasant mindful people and Managers that cared about you as a person. Not sure what happened when Amazon took over I left prior to that."
good,Work always kept you busy and helped improve your job performance everyday. The only con I can think of is the management the chose to hire during my time there. Although I heard it became much better after amazon bought them out.
good,Great staffing. Great people to work with. Great opportunities. Able to grow within the company. Great customers. Great products. Help you when you need help. Encourage their employees.
good,"T:he culture of Whole Foods was as a co-op. Where people would absolutely love their job, willing to give all to this wonderful, giving company. Just joyful."
good,"Fast paced place to work. Good management, hard to advance. Must keep things clean and be proactive about maintaining the work place. Great people and customers, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a first job."
good,"Lots of bureaucracy now but a great place to work.  LOTS of opportunities for advancement, benefits great, compensation is okay but they cap most positions so you have to more up.  Loyal if you are a good worker - which is great!"
good,the work is dull and repetitive and the customers can be difficult but the pay and benefits make it worthwhile. Team members are all down to earth and kind.
good,The Williamsburg Brooklyn Whole Foods Market store is very fast paced due to it being the number 1 Whole Foods market in New York. There are down times but they aren't that long. There is never a dull day at this location.
good,Great place to work. Good morale and room for advancement. Positive team members. Great hours. Flexible locations with many stores across the United States.
good,"Working at whole food market was a fast pace job, the environment was very friendly and the employees were honestly warming. I'd recommend this job to a lot of people who are looking for a fast pace job that'll keep them on their toes on a day to day bases."
good,"To me it was never a typical day at work. It was always different, pace wise and work wise. At first I was a bit nervous branching out of my comfort zone, but surely the peeps there made my stay comfortable and fun . The supervisor was always helpful in there own way and assisted what needed to be assisted, so that was always nice. I enjoyed whole foods for the 3 months I've worked there."
good,"Good staff, management, and family environment. Amazing benefits and flexible schedule if you are available. Friendly work environment, with real opportunity for growth within the company. Cares about the community and really embraces the live /work life balance."
good,"A good place to work, and friendly at the same time. "
good,Every friendly environment be always work us team sometimes others Department the sort handling I try to voluntary to helping and learning all product the we carry on.
good,Overall a good place to work. They offer benefits even for part time and the pay is higher than stores of other brands. I would recommend Whole Foods as a place to work.
good,"Had a fun time working with this company, they're a good company. nothing to complain about it, but i did only work for one year. So i didn't get much experience with them."
good,I learned a lot about quality organic products and environmentally friendly practices. There is a wealth of knowledge within the interesting and passionate staff.
good,It was probably one of the best places I have worked . I enjoyed the environment and the people. The community was fantastic for what it is worth. 10/10
good,"I worked as a cashier at the Devon Store; it was a great job when you're talking and working with other cashiers. Supervisors and front end managers are incredibly picky about who their favorites are which can be annoying. "
good,Great place to work.  However did not like the direction the company was going.  My buyer position was dissolved and left a bad taste in my mouth.  other than that not so bad.
good,"Like the principles and culture of the company. The department that I work in doesn't give me the chance to learn more or grow, which for me is demotivating."
good,"Begin my day prepping out food to be cooked for the day. "
good,"Able to learn a lot about Health and food choices, worked with a great deal of diverse people. "
good,They are a good whole hearted community based company and they had a lot to teach based on what I wanted to learn. I’d definitely recommend them to a friend.
good,the pay and environment is great. i learned a lot. management and workplace culture could be better. the hardest part of the job was inventory shifts. the most enjoyable part was the benefits.
good,"I learned a lot from this company on the team member level and all the way up to the management level. I matured and developed proper leadership methods from their programs and training which I few have made me successful in future positions of being a mentor, leader, or manager."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work with an amazing culture. Plenty of opportunities to advance if you have that goal in mind. If you ever feel stuck, the company fully supports moving up or down or even lateral moves to other job areas."
good,"Work was fun, easy and went at a good pace. There was a good amount of cooperation with the team there.  Just the manage that was working at the time was disheveled.  All in all a good experience and would work for them again."
good,"I learned a lot while working in the Bakery, I enjoyed my time working there. I meet a lot of great people and had fun while working as well. Everyone loved what they did."
good,"I loved working here, I just have to move so I can't anymore. There is so much good and upside to this company. Possibly the best job I've ever had. Love this place!"
good,"While often understaffed, the bakery department functioned well and benefited from the extra incentive of increased pay based on quality and quantity of sales"
good,"This is the second best job I've ever had: decent enough pay, great people to work with, quick paced--always something to do. Once you get the hang of everything, it's great."
good,"It's a wonder opportunity to work in a fun but serious job that requires skills and dedication."
good,Working at Whole Foods was my first real job where I was out in the public eye and expected to make sure the customers were able to get what they needed and were also happy with their experience. It was a good team environment.
good,It just takes time to work your way up because everyone is hungry and willing to overachieve. Sometimes those in leadership positions are under qualified but most times the hardest workers are right were they need to be.
good,WFM has been everything I needed to support my family. Flexible hours and competitive pay. I worked my way up to my current position in a quick amount of time and there is plenty of room for advancement.Good pay and flexible hours
good,"Coworkers are amazing. Great pay too. Advancement provided. Can be stressful at times. Make lasting relationships with the customers. Discounted products, free sample e.t.c"
good,This was my first job after college and it was wonderful. I grew so much here and it provided me with amazing opportunities to find my direction in life because they encourage cross raining in departments. You get to try and learn so many different things and meet amazing people.
good,Whole Foods Market has been a joy to work for. The job culture and work environment is great. They also value and care about your experience with company.
good,"whole foods was a great job to have while in school, they were very flexible with my schedule and i loved all my workers and managers. thing could get very busy at times but i never felt overwhelmed"
good,Excellent hours benefits and pay. Paid vacation annual sick leave. They are a mission driven company and they work closely with neighborhood and community where they operate. They focus on special diet and healthy eating.
good,"As far as retail goes it was the best company I worked for. Hours do get crazy around the holidays, and the training is not the best. But overall in store management and team members were great and fun to work with."
good,"Lots of young people, good culture, great discount. I learned a lot about food and they really empowered us to interact with customers, to try new ideas and to make the job ours."
good,"great work environment "
good,"In my experience working at Whole Foods Lynnwood, every day involved teamwork, serving customers, and communicating with departments outside of the coffee bar / bakery. I appreciated that coworkers and management were always helpful and in a good mood. Working with the coffee / bakery team involved serving customers and answering questions, completing a list of tasks, and preparing and stocking bakery products. I enjoyed making coffee and talking about / recommending products to our customers. The main thing I did not like about working here is that we would sometimes be understaffed."
good,"Can't speak for all WFM stores, but the one I was at was pretty good. Team and Store Leadership was always encouraging and made me feel welcome. Great place to start."
good,"Enjoyed working at Whole foods, anyone who has a passion for natural Foods and health products would enjoy this job. Exposed to all sorts of food, and natural health and beauty products at a discounted rate!"
good,Great team great people! You work hard but it is worth it. During the holidays it can get kind of hectic but the team really pulls together. Some customers can be a bit needy but it is easy to pull through.
good,"Fun place to shop,eat but my manager was not fair on my employment. everyone has a different outcome but overall i love Whole Foods, co-workers are great people and they know how to hire great people."
good,Well-compensated relative to similar jobs in area. Collaborative work environment with excellent coworkers. Quickly paced due to common staff shortages; but this is made up for by the quality of existing staff.
good,"A wonderful job culture, at least before the take over by Amazon. Wonderful co-workers and customers. Awesome benefits and that golden employee discount."
good,"Extremely competitive workplace "
good,Whole Food is the kind of company that should mentor ALL American companies. I work for Whole Food via an agent. I am often scheduled for demos with Whole Foods; every season.  I also shop at whole foods...sometime daily. My family purchase gifts cards for me at Whole Foods often.
good,"Good place to work. 20-30 hours a week. If you have an open schedule, it is not a bad place to work. Some customer service skills needed. Food handling skills will be taught."
good,What I enjoy about working at Whole Foods was all the new people you were able to meet in your department and get to know them more than just co-workers
good,"it was a friendly environment. people know each other. if your customer says good thing about you, you will get a cool bean and if you reach 5 of them, whole foods pays you $50.00 "
good,"Great place learned a lot. No conflicts with management. Relaxed enough, strict enough. Good people and company culture. Conducive to having an outside life and encouraging of personal passions. In New York at least."
good,"Work at Whole food is like any other company. you do what you need to do. you won't have any problem, but make sure companies culture are fallow and the most import customer services have to be 100% satisfaction.	"
good,It was a nice place of business. Would go back if offered the opportunity and would recommend to anyone that is looking for a place to start somewhere.
good,"This is a great place to work as long as you keep your head down and avoid getting involved in anything that doesnt directly concern you. Also, no promotional opportunities."
good,"Loved the culture and I found my best friends working here!  The best part of the job is when I clocked out, I did not have to think of work on my time off, and Whole Foods stands by that.  I was in leadership."
good,"Good place to work. Great benefits, good work like balance. Great coworkers and management that was supportive for personal and professional growth. All great until Amazon took over."
good,working at whole foods was great if you love working fast pace/ dealing wit customers/food and making money. it was a fun meet new people and learning about foods
good,"whole foods is a great place to shop at and to work at. its a clean, well organized store for anyone to shop at. everyone working is always happy to help."
good,"I personally like working at whole foods market. I worked at Wellesley which is in suburb of Boston, MA. I love my team members and my team leaders because they are all supportive and take good care of each other. They have very friendly atmosphere and it is very fun to work in different departments whenever they need help."
good,"This company has got it down.  They are extremely good to their employees and they also put back into the community.  Overall, best place I ever worked!"
good,Check out your local Whole Foods location. Each location is unique and depending on your experience and hours desired it is common to find a role that might suit you.
good,"Typical day at work is very good, and fast paced."
good,"My day would start off at 6AM everyday with about 3-4 pallets of Dairy goods. that I would have to break down and stock before 3 pm. I got an hour lunch( if I took it). you get to try most of the product they sell so that was cool everytime we got something new in, we would all gather together and try it out and discuss our likes or dislikes of the product. occasionally you would get stopped by a customer who would ask you where something was. It was a good place to work but fast paced. My manager would be upset if your pace was lacking."
good,pretty chill to work at these spots. management was cool there. very fast paced and lots of sales. not as much pressure as other locations in the area.
good,"Great Place to work. had a good experience until they started changing management around. overall I would work here again. I worked Overnight so my day consisted of restocking the shelves in a designated aisle, unload the truck and restock the back stock"
good,"First. God forbid you're a fat guy doing maintenance at whole foods we wouldn't want to displease the customers that complain about the smell of you doing your job even when they see you take trash out but still you can have on brand new clothes and have on Calonge and you're going to that one custom complaint about the small especially if your a hands-on guy not afraid to get wet or dirty. As if they follow you around sniff you. Because God forbid it's the food spoiling. "
good,"Gained a lot of experience, Great employee discount. Free food, Some leadership will throw you under the bus to protect themselves and some suck ups. All right job"
good,I had fun working at whole foods though it can be pretty hectic.I would work there again if it weren't for the very inconsistent hours and scheduling. I do recommend Whole foods to entry level cashiers.
good,Its a great company to work for when you barely graduate high school.You learn a lot of skills that you canuse in a daily life day to day .So its great .
good,"Lots of autonomy. Great benefits and lots of work life balance. Just work hard and stay positive. If you do these things, you will succeed. Fun job. great location."
good,"Fast pace environment , hands on things. I learned that you have to focus on your job. Very friendly place to work at. The job was enjoyable because most them were nice."
good,"Whole Foods was a great company to work for. They pay well and treat and understand work life balance. I worked at several locations and they are all different in terms of customers, management and store layout. I was able to learn a lot about different skills and terminology needed in the natural and organic food market. Every day was different and I like that about a job. There was constant change within the company which I was fine with but if you don't like change this is not the place for you."
good,Whole Foods Market is a job with very pleasant employees and consumers. The job has plenty of opportunity to grow. Great versatility in skill learning. The most difficult part of the job is having to figure out which skill set is most suitable
good,"Great culture and friendly team members."
good,"great work, lots of job opportunities and lots of ways to move up, everyone just does there own thing but has no problem helping out. the discounts great, it makes whole foods prices basically regular grocery stores"
good,kind of a hard place to work if your not used to the fast paced grocery life but if you can keep up and do a great job it can be very rewarding in different ways you move up within the company
good,Most days can be difficult but your coworkers will help you get through the day. There is a large mix of people there as a career and people there just for the money which can be frustrating. People who are there just for the money typically do not last long.
good,"Duties in the seafood department include cleaning, cooking, and sales. The most useful skill I learned was how to properly prepare and cook fish. Coworkers were extremely friendly."
good,"Good surrounding"
good,People that work in whole foods are very good to each other. Made many friends as well I learn a lot. Would recommend to friends to work at Whole Foods.
good,"It is very busy especially during rush hour. It is a great environment to work in, very friendly. It is stressful because of the fast pace to be efficient and not miscount money."
good,Customers are very prissy and feel entitled. The store manager can be really rude but other than that its a decent place to start at. Depending on your department depends on a lot.
good,"Company is constantly changing , and employees are being asked more to do with no wage increase. Very political job . Do what you have to do there. .."
good,"Great place to build skills and strong work ethics. You go in, change to uniform, when you punch in you start work. Serving customers (They are number 1 and always come first at Whole Foods) Great teamwork and get many benefits."
good,Very good place to work if looking to get into retail management and don't mind corporate environment. Great benefits especially if you stick around. Recommend.
good,I was able to build a career at WFM. There are definitely pros and cons to working for a big establishment. WFM is good for those who wish to embrace the healthy lifestyle they promote.
good,The customers and staff at Whole Foods are very nice. There is alot of room for advancement. Some managers however have favorites. But the pay is ok and room for advancement
good,"Was a great job, just had to move too far away from that location to commute, I also was getting oppurtunities to take recording and producing music more seriously, and I couldn't pull off 40 hours a week of recording with a full time job that also needed me for 30+ hours a week"
good,"A great place to work and a great company to work for. I learned  about buying, store operation, budget, and management  at Whole Foods. The culture is a big driver of the store and its customer base, and they do a excellent job maintaining it. Each day I  learned  something new and made the best of each day at Whole Foods."
good,"I enjoyed the culture at Whole Foods Market. In my experience, the most important trait in an employee was good attendance. Other than that, the company made it very easy to learn and there were not many additional expectations of team members."
good,Whole Foods is a great company to work for. They value the experience of the team members. The scheduling while I was there was not as flexible as I needed for continuing my MBA. That is why I left. The company is great and one day I may go back.
good,"I started at my store when it was a brand new store opening, and within just a few months I got my first promotion and have been presented with many other opportunities to help with my advancement."
good,"At any company, there are complications in the workforce. At Wholefoods, the conflict lies when it comes to miscommunication between management and employees. Other than that, everyone is friendly and you make friends quick. Training within departments can be rocky depending on the leaders within them, but overall, it's a nice place to work at."
good,Whole Foods market is a positive and productive place to work because it focuses on how  they can please their team members so that we can give great customer service to our customers.
good,"The company great the work envirnment kinda suck. Management was okay no commication in my expereince. Pay okay till you want to advance in work place,"
good,"easy going people"
good,"Whole Foods had a wonderful culture full of passionate and respectful, mission led folks. The working hours were not the best, neither was the compensation."
good,Company is strong. Leaders are to the point but helpful and willing to help advancement. It is up to you to succeed but the tools are there for this to happen.
good,People are very friendly and nice to work with always offering assistance to help in anyway they can.  Management is always there to listen if you have any concerns with customers.
good,"Workday went by fast.  Good customer service skill needed in the Prep Foods Department as well as time management, self motivation and cleaning up after one self. Always had something to do and staff was usually in a great mood."
good,"I would say Experience would depend on location but my time at Whole Foods has been positive.  The management for my department has been a revolving door so, that has been tough at times.  I love the diversity of the staff and the overall positive attitude. The starting pay was higher than most places and I've since received two raises in my first year. Schedule flexibility has been great. They have always worked with me and allowed for me to work around mom life."
good,"We carried in the lumber and the turkey and pieces. I placed the box spring, mattress and headboard"
good,i enjoyed working at whole foods market it was a very fast paced job with nice customers and the team was great. the hours were flexible and the pay wasnt bad.
good,"good place to work, very competitive and hard work almost every day. Good training and good colleagues to work. Flexible schedule which helps for people who study"
good,"Whole Foods , is a busy store . what I did was all of the morning pastries and also all of the cake orders  We shared a small kitcken for two department and everybody work together for the most part"
good,i learned lot of things through which i gained lot of knowledge which are useful now a days.Management is good that they help you in every situation whether its good or bad.
good,It really is a great place to work at compared to the competitors. The work environment is never stressed. They do not do under staffing or other cost cutting measures.
good,"the work environment was one that was pleasant to be around and my coworkers were a joy, however don't expect to be challenged in this job and you are at scrutiny for a very cooperate head"
good,"Everyone there is great to work with."
good,"Since most of Whole Foods employees are temporary, it was hard to find co-workers in your immediate division that you could count on.  We were also often short-staffed which made taking time off very difficult.  Nonetheless, I loved my job at Whole Foods and remain seasonal with them.  The people that stuck around long term and the regulars made it worth it.  I also love the values and standards of Whole Foods and hope they never lose that integrity."
good,"At work everyone is very friendly, there is a positive and friendly environment.. with the proper training and education program their is lots of room for growth."
good,There were always rewarding opportunities for growing in the workplace. Management was fair to their employees and with a positive and uplifting team the workplace culture can it's standards growing.
good,"Good company, its just if you are the type of person that wants everything to be running smoothly and efficiently, you will get frustrated, because everyone here is so laid back that it might even be construed as laziness. I think this company would benefit from stricter leadership, at least in the area I work."
good,One of my favorite things about my previous employment with Whole Foods was the Whole Kids Foundation and Whole Planet Foundation fundraisers. Getting to help raise money for local and global development felt good to the soul
good,"Productive. Fun and cool co-workers. Customers are generally nice and polite. The routine of the place is quick and easy to pick up. Good food, good discounts and good products."
good,"I got good hours, the coworkers were friendly, the culture conducive to building relationships between workers."
good,Typical cashier job. Learnt to deal with all sorts of customers and co-workers. Met some of my best friends there to date. Enjoyed sampling all the new goodies brought into the store.
good,"The only thing that is a con, is the fact that most of the employees will slack if there is one   hard worker."
good,"there good they are great, the management takes great pride In there work and has an open door policy where you can talk to them, let them know how are you feeling. I would work for them again and also recommend them to anyone."
good,"been awhile since i worked there. so i dont really know anymore. but when i was there, i liked it alot except for my direct manager. but the company as a whole seems to be okay."
good,"Working at Whole Foods, I felt like I was part of a team that cared about each other. We had manditory meetings several times during the year, in which management would cover a variety of subjects related to the production and growth of the company. "
good,"Whole Foods is probably the best grocery store you can work at, but at the end of the day, you're still working at a grocery store.  There are always new job opportunities, but rarely advancement.  They're not afraid to hire from outside for upper level positions."
good,"Great place to work, really cares about its team members and it’s core values. You really want to be there to stay. It’s up to the team you’re trying to join to vote you on after a few week period. If they say no, you’re out,"
good,I have worked for almost 11 years  for the most part I have enjoyed working here.the manager are great the work environment is excellent I need more challenging work at this moment.
good,"Fast Paced, Steady Flow of Customers keeps you busy."
good,"As a cashier, you're on your feet all day, interacting with customers, and you need to memorize a lot of fruit and vegetable codes. The codes can be a little tedious, but after a few days on the registers, you get the hang of it. You get two 15 min breaks and an unpaid 30 min lunch. 20% discount for employees."
good,Chill fun environment. Relaxed job. Manager is easy to get along with. As long as you do was you are asked to do or what you we're hired to do you will do just fine.
good,"The job and its culture was great but unfortunately a few bad apples had to make it seem otherwise. Mostly every job at whole foods was easy, but if you kept showing it was too easy they would pile you on with more responsibilities which aren't a problem, but when you don't get properly compensated for them or respected for the job you do, it gets frustrating."
good,Loved working for WFM! Great environment and I love all of my coworkers. Benefits are not available to part time staff but they are for full time. Overall great place
good,"My job requires me to review all of our sales data and labor on a daily basis. I learned the importance of sales and purchasing monitoring on a daily basis. Management is under pressure from company structural changes and its impact on a store level.The workplace culture is mostly positive. A bit stressful at times, but most get along well. The hardest part of the job is answering to store management's requests for data and results. The most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie among most team members and willingness to do a good job for you."
good,"The customers are all so nice. I worked with a team that got along great and loved being there. It was exhausting some days, but each day was different. I got to talk to customers and explain products and our values to them."
good,"Whole Foods is fun but can get very stressful. If you don't mind dealing with rushes of customers during peak hours, you'll be ok. They strive to make you feel part of a family. They were also very willing to work with my schedule."
good,"Typical days at work included mostly production, packing out, and performing customer service. In order to perform this correctly I acquired a significant product knowledge of what we carried. The workplace culture was very positive, almost everyone in the store is friends with everyone else. Hardest part of the job is the pace and the amount of work needed to be done. Most enjoyable for me was working with customers."
good,"Flexible staff, great culture, and good products. Locals are great to talk to and provide a good experience. You can learn much about health and apply it to your own life."
good,"They were a fairly busy store so there was never any shortage of labor to do, they were undergoing corporate changes so it was a bit chaotic at times in terms of what they expected with their inventory."
good,Pretty chill. 420 friendly. kind of corporate but honestly its more of a show than anything. some people took it way too seriously. you kinda have to kiss butt to move up.
good,"I have no complains about it, one of my favorite employer.  They provide good benefit as a team member. One of the best thing about Wholefoods is ECO FRIENDLINESS."
good,"Whole Foods Market was a good workplace in terms of coworkers and management. Most people did their part, and were kind to one another. The training for new employees is a little sub-par, because they don't show you how to do most of your daily duties, especially if you're a cashier's assistant (front runner). However, after a few days of on hand learning, your responsibilities are pretty clear-cut. A big part of the job is maintaining composure with the more... difficult customers. As far as management, they treat their employees in a respectful and professional manner. They can sometimes send out the schedules a little late, but that's their only real problem. Overall, working at Whole Foods was a good experience that gave me many skills to take to my next job."
good,"It depends on the where you work and the leadership. "
good,"I liked working at Whole Foods Market and I thought that it was a good experience. If you close, you get free pizza, bread, juice, and cookies or any baking stuff left over."
good,I've stayed with Whole Foods Market for a long time due to good benefits for the Team Member and family. A lot of growth for those who want to become a Store Leadership. Very casual place to work no need to wear uniform. Every year the company has a team member appreciation week its a fun week for the Whole companey each store celebrated in its own unique way.
good,"having bbq and drinks ones a month plus gifts if we make benefits I enjoyed working with in this nice place to work and learned from talented leaders,team work"
good,wholefoods was a nice job at the time I enjoyed the atmosphere and the customers were pretty nice the pay could have been better but overall I enjoyed my job.
good,"This was a huge learning experience for me. I earned the do's and do not's. The people I had to interview for the employee training video were diverse and interesting. Everyone seemed hap[y to work there, so i tried to match the enthusiasm. I believe i wasn't compensated fairly, but i learned from my mistake."
good,Great atmosphere but the management made it stressful and difficult to enjoy! Very provoking and picky. Store can be very stressful. Inconsiderate with scheduling.
good,"made $4 profit on every $1 in its peak, unheard of in the grocery industry. Waited too long to do national advertising. Spent too much money re branding newly acquired competing companies in local markets. flew the plane down into the ground with the split in the early 2010's. Amazon made out like a bandit by scraping it off the fusion retail sales floor. They will make millions off the name though. The ""Nike"" of health foods."
good,It is really fun to assist customers with the food selection and alternative food options for more healthy life style. I learned how to listen to the customer needs. Give them exactly or close to what they are looking for. Really friendly environment  hard working employees.The hardest part of my job long hours of standing.
good,"I enjoyed my time with WFM.  It was fast paced and I enjoyed the people. "
good,"I liked working there...People were nice, and made some friends. Not to far from were I live. Easy to get there. They have good food and drinks too. That's all........................................................................................................................There is nothing more to say."
good,Whole Foods is a work hard and have fun while doing so environment. Team members care about each other and their guests. Opportunities are available for those that would like to advance their career.
good,Great company and has great benefits and the people and customers are very friendly. Would recommend this job to someone looking for part time work. You learn a lot!
good,"While I do love the culture at Whole Foods, I've not yet had the Kool-Aid. The benefits - the reason I jumped aboard - are mediocre at best (at least for the first year of service). Health Insurance is alright and they do give an HSA after 800hrs of service, but the initial amount is barely enough to get a decent pair of glasses. "
good,The other workers are passionate about what they do and bring excitement into the workplace. There is consistent hours and the day is so busy that it goes by quickly.
good,had a very nice work involvement each team worked together when it was time to go every one made sure the store was always clean..team leads helped all the time I missed that job
good,"Piacevole giornata di lavoro, ogni giorno cose nuove da imparare ,parte difficile gestire gli audit esterni, la parte piu piacevole la collaborazione di tutto il team."
good,it was good time. learned a ot and got to work to work mith many people from many aspect of life. Since Amazon came the stores are becoming mor like warehouses.
good,Typical day breaking down diary loads w/FIFO system. Learned to order. Working in 36 degree temps was most difficult. Working fast was most enjoyable.
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods Market. At the Long Beach Store, we all felt like we were a family. I was sad to leave, but my baby came first. Now she's going to pre-school, so I would very much like to work again for this company.  Whole Foods educated me in wholesome, fresh, natural products. I loved all the customers who shopped there, I shopped there myself."
good,"365 is super busy throughout the week, especially Sundays and Mondays. Can be overwhelming, but isn't too bad after a while of working there. Team leaders are super helpful and friendly."
good,Love working at Whole Foods. Fun and exciting environment to work. Amazing team members. Fun dealing with customers from all over Boston and also tourists. Always learning new things and ready to move up.
good,"Because I am a baker with early mornings, a typical day for me includes proofing pastries and breads prepared the previous work day, taking count of product that needs to be baked for that day, and finishing out my shift by performing cleaning tasks and filling out both par and sanitation books. I have learned a great deal of responsibility for keeping organic integrity (something Whole Foods prides themselves on), the importance of taking initiative, showing leadership, managing my time, and setting short-term goals throughout the day. Management quality varies in each department. In my department (prepared foods), management is rather poor, partly due to the high stress level and production demand for that job. Workplace culture is fantastic. I love that I have the opportunity to know and collaborate with so many unique individuals of many ages. It really is like being apart of a family, as we often make time with each other outside of work as well as plan events for team members whenever we can. The hardest part of my job is the level of demand, but at the end of the day, it makes me feel accomplished. The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely the people I get to work with, and also the ample opportunities given to us to volunteer and give back to our community."
good,They treat you like a human being compared to other retail companies. Relaxed environment. Team work is a huge deal. Willing to work with you. Great shopping!
good,Company direction prior to being bought out forced out a lot of positions. In the end this was the reason I decided to leave the company. A position I held for years was eliminated in an initiative to combine teams. Store level leadership and team members were great.
good,Not sure how it is now especially after the amazon whole foods merger. I haven't heard anything.  I wish the works the best and I am excited about where they are headed.
good,"Very flexible company, works well with school sechedule, nice managers, great culture, on the spot training if desired, easy to move up in company, innovating"
good,"I had some amazing experiences working for this company and others that drove me out. I also stopped working here before Amazon took over and right as the OTS program was launching. I was able to advance in my career and see a lot of great aspects of the company when given a fair chance for a supervisory role, being on a panel to decide the next STL, and when reviewing my job dialogue. I know a lot of these standard practices have not gone well for other TMs, but I always had a great experience with my particular management."
good,Friendly and educating environment. Weekly classes to grow in your job and become more knowledgeable. Emphasis on team member wellness and happiness..
good,"Whole Foods was good to me and gave me a lot of opportunities. I would consider working for them again and would recommend giving them a try if you're looking for a career. All companies change and WF isn't what it once was culture wise, but in comparison to the current retail environment they do take care of their employees and I met some wonderful people there."
good,"I thinks this company is definitely okay to work at just needs better management, Sometimes they will work with your schedule if you communicate with them."
good,Must be team player you won't succeed without your team members. Positive attitude is a must. You get what you put into the job. Take advantage of the benefits they offer such as management classes ECT.
good,"Whole Foods was a clean store which sold quality items,  and a well managed company.  I enjoyed working with my co workers there and the management was professional."
good,"fun place to work a , enjoy doing produce. it can be stressful on some days but overall not a bad job at all. not much room to advance in the company."
good,this was a good job nice place to work had good pay and was a good starter job. I think that if there was more opportunity i would have stayed longer but for me it wasn't there.
good,My experience was a good one. It was a new store so whatever they were lacking in they were quick to fix. Everyone is friendly and helping with a mix of seasoned and new team members.
good,excellent place to work in over all co workers make this place a excellent place to work the company its an open mind company witch is good for the workers that would like to bring their own style to the work place.
good,Employees are supported to be themselves. It is mostly very busy and rewarding daily work. Store management is very supportive and jumps in when needed. The hardest part of the job is communication between HR and store management.
good,I gained a lot of experience working here and I still learn everyday at work. Best with my job is working with people and meeting new guests everyday and getting to know them.
good,"Everyone I've worked with in this company has been kind, compassionate and supportive. I enjoy my job, it's fun. But the pay isn't enough for an adult to live on, and benefits cut into your pay even further. It's a great place to visit, I don't plan to stay."
good,typical work included cutting and preparing meat and seafood for customers. I was to work 9 hour shifts . it was business casual and very cold burr! it was a fun job
good,"Very customer oriented , helps the local community , employee benifit , room for growth , offers classes , believes in animal welfare  , well balanced scheduling , open door policy"
good,"While being a cashier was never a long term goal of mine, after experiencing other jobs after Whole Foods I have come to realize that working for that company was one of the better work experiences I have had. They really care for their employees and take care of them, and worked with me through any problem I encountered. I would recommend working for them to anyone and have considered applying for them again."
good,"If you are comfortable in retail, this company offers fair starting pay, affordable benefits, and lots of opportunities for advancement. There are headaches and drama as with any job, and keep in mind there is potentially a lot of heavy lifting involved. The hours either fit your lifestyle, or they may be draining depending on your position. Expect to work most holidays unless you give ample advanced notice. PTO carries over with no limitations (benefits may have changed since I last worked there). Overall, a great retail job."
good,"I spend most of my adult life at that company ,I thought I will retired for there but at that time the upper management made poor diction that was against my moral believe and I was not going to agree"
good,"Receive the truck for the night, work the load to the floor and then prepare the store for opening operations."
good,Very relaxed environment at times but Whole Foods is a market store so there always a rush at some point of the day. Overall great experience with this company if you're looking to build onto your job experiences Whole Foods has a lot to offer.
good,"It's a fun place to work, quick paced, everyone is friendly and very nice. They are helpful.But working in Whole Foods Market is not a career. I work as a Food Prep Team Member."
good,Whole Foods Market has been great learning experience. Everyone in leadership makes sure they provide the best working environment for their team members.
good,i have worked for other grocers and Whole Foods even with all its changes is by far a much better company to work for.  It has educated its team members in so many different ways.
good,"When I first started at Whole Foods the culture was incredible.  I would spend so much time explaining to customers why the needed to shop with us.  Let me let you try this, let me show you my favorite item.  Let me explain why we sell Balsamic Vinegar that is $129.00.  "
good,Everyday is different and that's what I liked about it. I was with the company for about 7 years and moved up the ladder quick. You get a lot of product knowledge working here and it really opens your eyes on how you shop and what foods you put in your body.
good,"Knowledge of principles and methods for curriculum and training design, teaching and instruction for individuals and groups, and the measurement of training effects."
good,"This was a great place to work. The employees really live, work breath the culture of the company in everyday life.  "
good,idk what to say because i dont really care to even make a statement about this company . Its a job. Just something i would not care to make full time or try to advance in. Its not my career goal.
good,"The workplace is fun, other team members make your day. High volume of customers but did not mind because it definitely made the day go a lot faster. I would recommend family/ friends to work at Whole Foods"
good,"The job culture, and fair treatment of the employee allows for a serene environment to work.  People who work at Whole Foods tend to grow real friendships outside of the work place."
good,"Its a great place overall to work at. Lots of different roles and work to be done. management is great, they really are understanding and sympathetic."
good,I worked right before the sale to Amazon. Starting food production workers make the same as cashiers and are worked much harder. Seemed like a store on the decline.
good,"Worked as a scratch baker, but since the region I worked for chose to order product from the bake house instead, I was forced out. So rather than taking a cut in pay to work customer service, I left the company for a job that needed my skills. Spent 14 years with the company."
good,"Leads, trains and supports five staff to provide excellent customer service and in-depth understanding of natural body products and organizational operating procedures. Conducts inventory management utilizing lean principles and reducing waste. Develops and disseminates inter-departmental and corporate communications. Assists in change management with the 2017 Amazon merger. Develops and maintains relationships with vendors and external stakeholders to ensure the quality of service."
good,"A fun place to work for the most part, particularly on the registers. Flexible scheduling and dress code. Quick pace.  High standards for performance."
good,"Fun Place to work, but overall not a great place to make a career. I saw many good people get booted out and less great people get promoted or maintain their positions because money took over rather than belief in product and people. Would be willing to work there again, but LOCATION MATTERS."
good,"I enjoy my time at WholeFoods. The people are nice and the working atmosphere is fairly relaxed. However, it lacks career advancement options that interest me."
good,"I enjoyed working at Whole Foods; however many co-workers were unreliable and I often worked extra shifts daily or weekly to cover their hours. Sometimes rules were inconsistently reinforced depending on the employee or manager. Workload was heavy, but I welcomed a busy time and it helped me to create a more efficient work ethic."
good,"Your WFM experience will depend on the store, but they all typically try to support their team members as best as they could. They will work around your availability and try to provide you with the hours you need. I worked for customer service, which is usually the team most people start off at. If you find that you might want to work in another department, they are willing to cross train and possibly transfer. They are big on the points system and expect frequent evaluations. First raise is after 6 months, and after that, every year. I believe the most you can get on your first evaluation is 5%, and they will discuss room for improvement. "
good,"Everything was good until I changed my schedule. It's restricted, but no flexibility, so not a lot of hours now. Other than that, the people are nice, store is nice and small, & the job is easy."
good,"Employees are awesome! Cost of medical benefits is great; however, the medical plan itself is terrible. There is no co-pay option, so have to pay high price for doctor visit until meet very large deductible."
good,It was a great place to work at! Discounts where based on your current health status and each departments specialized in unique tailored customer service which separated Whole Foods from any other commerical grocery store.
good,Good experience with this company . Never a dull moment everyone was always so nice.  I would recommend this to a friend . I'm sure they would love the experience .
good,"Balanced workday, can be slow or fairly busy but never to the point where I felt overwhelmed. Learned a little about retail and sales practices and inventory management. The management wasn't always very good but always could talk to higher-ups about problems with store/job and personal issues. Almost everyone who works there is friendly and helpful."
good,Whole Foods is a good place to work combining high intensity work with a hint of fun. The hardest part of the job would be complying to all the customers.
good,The workplace culture is great and I enjoy working there.  Employees get a grocery discount.  Great benefits.  Good management.  PTO. Free parking downtown.
good,"One of the best cultures I've experienced. Management lacked but the people I worked with made up for it. I was taught a lot about alternative life styles and their benefits. My regular customers, were always a thrill, all the bad days I had there were minimal compared to all the great days I spent there."
good,"One of the best places I ever worked. However, around the ending of 2014 stocks started plummeting and they were laying off people with the highest pay. A few years later they sold the company to Amazon,"
good,I choose not to speak about the job and the things that came with it. my experience is different then anyone else. So I choose not to give a false piece of info about the company. overall it was a good company to work for.
good,"Great work community and family, depending on which store you land in. No complaints other than dislike of some managers. Otherwise great leadership.!"
good,"Whole Foods was an enjoyable place to work while I was studying biochemistry at ASU.  I was also able to learn more about nutrition, health, and food.  I found it to be an enjoyable place to work and I would work there again if the situation.  I support organic farming, sustainable farming, and like a lot of the programs that Whole Foods did with local organic businesses.  It was a place where every one worked as a team and got along well together."
good,Good workplace environment.  Whole Foods does a good job with customer assistance.  One thing that I really enjoyed was the freedom to place product in effective and desirable locations.
good,Full of creative and fun loving people who are effective at getting the job done. Management is very flexible and accepting of all kinds of people and situations.
good,Nice place to work overall. I've been working here for the last 1 years and it's a comfortable place to work. I would recommend this place  to anyone who is looking for a career.
good,"Good community, good place to work. A lot of opportunity to be rewarded for your work and career advancement. The company really takes care of their employees. A lot of good food."
good,"Good work place, advancement is limited, coworkers are great, work is fair. "
good,"I believe that whole foods market is a great workplace for creative, hardworking people. I have worked there for a couple of years and the management there is great. One core value that they have is team member happiness and they really hold true to that."
good,The job can be a lot of fun. The company is very employee focused. The customers can be unbearable though about sales and quality. The company will ALWAYS side with the customer which can be frustrating.
good,Whole Foods Market was a great place to learn about the building of teams and its morale. I enjoyed mentoring team members and seeing them years later in leadership positions.  The culture was one of transparency and knowledge. Team member happiness was paramount and always considered when making decisions. A great place to work !!!
good,I enjoy working for Whole Foods Market. We have been bought out so I really want to see what the future holds! They are very flexible and will work with most schedules.
good,"I was the Head Barista, and had to manage register, gelato case, guests at window, and making the beverages. It was a lot of multi-tasking, and they eventually hired a second barista after a year of working there. Management was very positive and gave praises a lot. Everyone worked together as a team and had great communication."
good,I loved working at Whole Foods Market for the most part until the Amazon merger. When they merged they laid off a bunch of people to make way for new management and changes.
good,"Very positive environment, the customers are so nice. I loved the job but had to relocate, if not I would've stayed. It's very busy so no time to sit around."
good,"fun work environment, good people, the best part of the job is meeting and interacting with new people. it can get very busy and hectic at times but overall a very cool laid back place to work."
good,"Good place to work, management can be a pain sometimes, customers can be hard to deal with also. But pay is really good and the jobs themselves are good also, always busy."
good,"As a consumer, if your not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. Working at Wholefoods is great way to feel like you are being part of the solution."
good,"Great people, it is a self-directed environment where you get out what you put in. It's a meritocracy where people get what they earn. Cons are that's it's fairly unorganized regionally with each store doing it's own thing."
good,Very diverse work community. Very accepting of all types of workers. Very challenging work. Lots of different challenges. Great coworkers and mostly great management.
good,"It is nice working there but I believe I can provide more of my personality else where. I believe I can meet people else where, I like to interact with new customers and I feel like I am limited to certain areas."
good,"Great work place to work here"
good,"I really like my fellow team members, although the job is pretty physically demanding. My department's leadership is great and really understanding, and flexible with their hours"
good,"working at Whole Foods was a great experience for me, I really felt as if I was part of a team. Management was great, and I appreciated the team buildings we would go on."
good,"A very fast pace environment. Training available to transfer to different departments. Management is very helpful and supportive."
good,"Atypical day at Wholefoods Market would me clocking in for work, doing my produce walk, and coming out to the sales floor with a great attitude. Working at Wholefoods Markets I've learn to manage my time wisely, Multi-tasking from picking up telephones, assisting customers, and making her I'm providing excellent customer service. I've learn a lot about myself. I've learn to be patient, and adapting to change."
good,"Working in a grocery store may not be your dream job and at times can be very stressful and busy but the company does a good job (via benefits, discounts, pay rate, advancement oppurtunity) to show that you are valued."
good,I loved working for wholefoods. I loved the environment and how management treated their employees. We were like a family working together. The managers at wholefoods really cared about their team members and did whatever they could to help us out.
good,"I always think the best places to work always always have great people, hard working, play hard also.  We all work together to make each other work as productive as possible."
good,The people I worked with really cared about me and in turn I treated them well.  There is a lot of physical labor and the pay is good considering they have to give you a raise the longer you work there.  No paid vacations.
good,"I loved Whole Foods, until I had to work for a new team leader. The job has it perks for sure, but all it takes is for one manager to ruin it. I had to relocate to a new store and unfortuantely, the assistant team leader and I didn't see eye to eye. Regardless of my two year with the company, I felt like I was being treated like a new hire which ultimately led to me seperating myself from the company."
good,"For the most part, a very good aura. Most people in my store had a smile and didn't mind helping customers. Most individuals didn't mind coming to work. Its a very good place to work and definitely would recommend it to others."
good,"Great place to work . "
good,I loved working here. Everyone became a family and you got to meet great and amazing people everyday. Your mind was free and your words were always heard and answered. You get to express yourseld and your voice everyday working here.
good,"Whole Foods was an excellent place to work, but like any other job had it's stressful moments. The company cares about their employees.  They always have  ""The open door policy"". They have excellent health benefits as well as Stocks and 401k."
good,I think if management paid more attention to the people that start stuff with other employees then it could be a more professional place to work. I feel that whole foods market tries to be professional but could succeed a whole lot better...
good,"Based on my skill level and culture I liked working for Whole Foods Market over the span of years that I did.  I learned a lot by them, many differenr skills.  They have a structured work environment in place and try to be fair to the employess for the most part."
good,Whole foods is a great place for people who are just starting out in the retail and culinary industry. The company is good and a great opportunity for younger people.
good,Good company with many benefits and opportunity.  The culture is unique and dress code is a bit more relaxed than other retail grocery stores. They are very involved with the local community
good,"Whole foods believes in work life balance.  They also have attributes that are in line with my lifestyle.  I left to try something new, but would like to work for them again"
good,"Everyone seems to be knowledgeable compared to most entry level jobs. I loved working here and the discounts on top of coupons can be worth it since you are eating real food. "
good,"Depending on your position, would I recommend working at Whole Foods Market? If you're a team member and looking for a good job with reasonable pay and good benefits, then yes! I would absolutely recommend working here. If you're in leadership and/or plan to move up in the company, the company does very well in helping you do this and will provide you the tools. For me, personally, my review is based on the location I worked at and not necessarily a review for ALL Whole Foods Market stores throughout the Northeast Region. "
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work and is a very happy work community. I have had a great experience working for whole foods. I've always have a love and respect for the way the company values their team members.
good,"Fun place to work. There is always something new to experience. Great benefits for part time employees, which isn't common in most places. Co-workers are fun and knowledgeable."
good,A very easy going work environment with plenty of opportunities to move up. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and the daily tasks. They are flexible with college/school schedules.
good,"A lot of friendly people, the customers are pleasant and the tm's genuinely enjoy their jobs. The benefits are amazing and so is the pto system! I would reccomw d this job to anyone."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to shop, there standard's are on point with product, and helping there communities and poverty areas across the world."
good,"Great place to work and great co workers. Good Benefits "
good,I loved my job and the company. Recent takeover by amazon.com is bringing about undesirable changes to the Whole Foods Market work culture and job security.
good,"The workplace culture and management were extremely professional. Enjoyed the team building and town hall meetings. If you wish to grow within the grocery industry, this is a great place to work. Overall, an excellent company to work for."
good,"Dishwashing position needs a lot of work, the job requires far too much from a single person. Other jobs in the kitchen seem enjoyable. Good friendly environment, dish washing position just isn't worth it and I would not recommend it to anyone"
good,"Great people and engaging work. Tons of different positions to try and always room for promotion. They have their fair share of frustrating corporate bureaucracy like almost all companies do these days, but they keep it to a minimum and it generally feels like the managment is on your side."
good,"Its a nice place to work, everyone is nice, and they all seem dedicated to working there. I felt a little uncomfortable at first just because of how much they seemed to like it, but I think it is ultimately a really good job for certain people."
good,the benefits are excellent.  the health insurance is top-notch.  most co-workers are excellent friends.  great customer/cashier relationships.  good place for advantment.
good,great place to grow learn and meet people. i felt great about what i was selling. lots of room to grow and expand horizons. it changed my lifestyle and overall health.
good,I believe it's a great environment and offers great value. I don't like that it has a point system as its disciplinary rule. It does offer great hours and pay.
good,"A typical day means not just scanning groceries but working with great people and great customers and creating life moments. Whole foods creates a balanced work culture, providing you the tools and on the job training to be successful in what you do."
good,Great company to work for. I am always excited to get to work and see what the day has in-store. The work environment is friendly and fun. Would highly recommend making it a career.
good,"good place to work as far as culture and personal growth, learning to eat healthy and take the right supplements. very disappointed that they don't match your 401k deposits tho"
good,"Great customers, coworkers, and work culture. Definitely allows you to build strong customer service skills. Teamwork is essential in the cashier role."
good,"Direct supervision to team members, I managed P&L. The great thing about it was they always had Team Leader Picnics. We had a  monthly bonus Based off of how much labor we saved in a month. "
good,"I come every day start out by tidying the department before opening."
good,one of the best jobs I had so far great team members great management. The job doesn't demand hard labor at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was interaction with customers
good,"nice environment and nice staff but so much pressure from the top, too many expectations and not much reward in salary. a lot of work but easy duties."
good,"great company to work for I learned a lot about eating healthy."
good,"this was a decent experience, I liked the company's attitude and the discount on the food was a big plus because it is delicious. most people that worked there were nice"
good,This place is a fun place the people are really cool every department is full of fun cool people from the producers to the specialty team the grocery team they have fun it starts from the top management is fun
good,"This company was good to work for. They tried to do things to make the employees happy. There was an employee appreciation week where they would give us food and such. They are very big on HIPPA. The one complaint was that when I was working, I got very sick and since I had to call out, they gave me points towards a write-up. I had a doctors note and they would not take it. It wasn't until later that I was told I needed to talk to someone that was HIPPA certified."
good,I worked in two different departments during my time at Whole Foods Market.  I found the customers to be the most challenging part of any given shift.
good,The great thing about Whole Foods is that you happen to meet fun and interesting people to work with. And you learn a lot about organic and natural food. I loved the can-do attitude. I left only because there weren't many opportunties to progess with just a few stores and no opening in the pipeline. I left as  an assistant team leader and I keep praising Whole Foods every day for giving me a chance to bounce back in my life.
good,The coworkers are the friendliest I've had yet. The education on food had lead to glowing skin. The benefits are very nice and despite the responsibility to clean after customers it's a soothing job.
good,"Get a job to show my knowledge and experience on the job. Im a team player and like to learn new things and show my habilities to others employees so they learn."
good,Whole Foods in friendly and inclusive. Your customers are usually pretty nice. The food is great! Also after work drinks are a thing. Highly consider working there.
good,"Its a okay place to work if your store management, does not have there foot up there butts.If they are talking everything out its not bad. Your team member make the whole job better."
good,Wholes is a very busy atmosphere from open to close. It provides a lot of organic food. It has many departments in the huge supermarket to satisfy any customer that steps in.
good,"My last role at whole foods was as a Shipping and Receiving Clerk."
good,A typical day at work is making some product for the fresh case. Providing the customer service when they need it. Helping them find items in the store. Sometimes even non-work conversations. I learned that your mood can set the whole tone for the conversation. If I'm happy and nice to the customer then they will be back. Management is good but some could be better. The culture is good but a little too much drama. The hardest part of the job is the nights when we have to clean the case. The most enjoyable is seeing that a customer is satisfied.
good,"Whole Foods is a company that alines with my morals as a mother and a citizen. Not only does this company provide healthy food choices, but also has programs that give back to the community."
good,"come in and start cleaning immediately. if we were understaffed that day the meat cutter would be alone and unable to start the cleaning process, it was stressful at times. very fast pace. good staff for the most part. The customers were my favorite thing about the job such interesting people came to see me"
good,It personally works with my school schedule perfectly and pays pretty well for someone my age and has not done me wrong in the little over a year I've worked at Whole Foods market.
good,"good job working 3 plus years easy to move up easy to change departments easy to move stores, management is cool. wholefoods isgreatpleaseeeeeeeeee workkk here"
good,"Whole Foods started out as a great company to work for, however they have become immensely beholden to their investors. Culture/advancement declining."
good,"My time at Whole Foods was markedly better than that at safeway, with a lot more accessible benefits, ability to negotiate pay, and visible room for advancement, though their company mottos and stances did tend to contradict their actual practices at times."
good,Awesome company to work for! Great staff and leadership core. The work life balance is important to leadership as well as team member happiness. Overall great place to work.
good,I received shipments and I also restocked the store to make sure that all items were available for the customers.  I did inventory to see what was needed.  I also loaded completed shipments and/or packages into the customer vehicles.
good,"Great company to work for I had no complaints until they changed management 3 times within a span of 6 months. New management wanted to change how everything worked even though we were the most profitable store in the state, team morale plummeted, people left, I took that as my sign that my time there as finished. Started out as a great company then turned into a completely different working environment I found no room to grow in."
good,"fun, relaxed environment. Culture of wellness and social responsibility. Low stress, casual, friendly environment. Food discounts were a huge bonus..."
good,"The grocery retail business is just that.  You get to meet a lot of customers, some bad, but mostly awesome.  And most of the coworkers are really easy going"
good,WFM is a great place to work. Management is always behind you and always opportunities to continue development and advancement in career. Team Leaders will always go the extra mile to make sure you are all set up for success.
good,As a floater I was able to work in different depts. which increased my knowledge of the business. I worked as both a buyer in grocery and wine depts. Assisted in cutting and packaging specialty cheese.
good,"In general it's nice to work for WFM, especially if you want to progress in your career in the company, they try to give opportunities and nurture the talent. The atmosphere is mostly nice, company culture is better than in most other companies in this industry, and management is understanding and friendly. They don't pay much though, especially considering the amount of knowledge you have to have about products and he way the company works in general, which can be a problem for many."
good,This position helped me in transforming into a leader and a role model for those who sought to gain knowledge and understanding  in a company that promotes community and cruelty free.
good,Whole Foods was a great place to work. Enjoyable part was the staff you can meet people from all walks of life and make life-long friends. The team builds make you feel as part of the family. hardest part of the job was as I got older I just got tired  of closing shifts.
good,"Never made pizza in my life before I worked at whole Foods Market. They gave me a lot of new skills like making pizza, and other stuff that is needed in a pizzeria. Developed my people's skills. Learned a lot of things about how to make customer happy."
good,"I was a Front End Team Member basically a cashier, who bags groceries and sometimes helps customer with their things to the car. College Job. Cool experience."
good,i have worked in several departments and learn something in each one. I feel it gave me the skills to preform in management because of my well rounded knowledge.
good,"Worked 6 years. Many opportunities to change departments or advance with additional responsibilities and expand knowledge base"
good,"Good place to work , I love to work in whole foods ..the coworker  is good , you can learn and grow up your career. punctuality is main thing can learn ."
good,"The work was physically taxing, but I had enough work to stay busy all day which made the day go by really quickly. My co-workers were for the most part nice polite people. That made for a pleasant work environment. The hardest part of the job was breaking down shipments from the supplier as there was not enough space to do the work. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers. For the most part everybody was happy and appreciated the help I gave them."
good,"As compared to other grocery stores, WFM pays higher wages and treats employees much better.  Excellent compensation from paid vacation, to health benefits."
good,"Culture, Mission and purpose, People, Innovation, Product quality"
good,"A typical day of work is pretty fun and goes by fast. I learned how to handle food and to run a kitchen, and cook some foods. Managment was great. The hardest part of the job was the hours. The most emjoyable part was socializing with customers and coworkers."
good,We work for the guest and there needs change daily. Being any independent on the fly thinker helps you evolve in the company quickly. This company is evolving and setting a stander for how you should eat and treat your employees.
good,"employees great."
good,"Whole foods is a great company to work for, it offers increasing pay, benefits and they let you make your own schedule. The people who work there are very nice and helpful, it is quiet a joy to work there."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Whole Foods, and it taught me some valuable skills like patients and how to hold a smile who despising the person im talking to. Over all, I the place is great, minus the overly exaggerated concern for health which is a lie because they carry the products of the least healthy companies in the world, but its not for me at this point in my life."
good,"great place to work at, great money, awesome place to move up. the best part is how much they care about the planet and the poor."
good,I worked for Whole Foods at all 3 Rhode Island locations. I was a Dairy Team Member and a Dairy Buyer. I felt they were a good company to work for. There was always room for advancement and always lots of work to do. I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods.
good,"A typical day at work involved physical labor while leading a team to accomplish goals set forth by the company.  I learned well how to grow myself and a team to accomplish these goals.  I also learned how to lower turnover within my team by working more with them to achieve the goals they had for themselves.  My own management pushed me to grow, learn more, try new things, and move up the corporate ladder.  The most difficult part of my job was adjusting to regular changes within the company and/or management above me.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing others, that I trained, further their own growth and positions within the company."
good,"Working at Global Support, people really care about you and you have a wonderful work life balance.  Things do move very slow and strategy can make a 180 at anytime making it hard to get things done.  Benefits are an embarrassment."
good,Excellent place to work with good benefits. The people who work their are friendly and its a very laid back atmosphere. Best grocery store I ever worked at.
good,"There is room for advancement is you look the part and are willing to forfeit a lot of time and put in extra effort."

Id create graphic designs, floor art, wall art etc. for the entire store. I was the only person on staff working as a Sign grapic  artist so i didn't have much help with my work loads. This meant I had to work long lonely hours at times but since I was creating artwork I felt right at home."
good,"In my opinion WFM is a great company to work for, they will help you move up if you are willing to do the work. Their minimum wage is very fair, they give you lunch coupon when get a compliment from customers. Working as a cashier was great, because I used to get gift cards from my customers, and cash also.

good,"There was no typical day working in the Whole Foods produce department- some days I made fruit cups, or gallons of pico de gallo. Other days I worked putting out products on the floor. Some shifts I worked in the floral department, watering plants and making flower arrangements. The most important thing that I learned from Whole Foods is the value of QUALITY- the produce and organic standards that WF adheres to are some of the strictest. I also had the opportunity to work as part of a 2-4 person team, honing my interpersonal and conflict resolution skills.  Other days, I was given total autonomy.  The hardest part of the job was trying to stock the the floor while a lot of customers and their carts were in the department.  The most enjoyable parts included working with co-workers and leadership that held similar values as my own, interacting with customers that had questions, and preparing 'value added' items (vegetable trays, guacamole, etc.)"
good,"Always a challenge at work. I learned how to deal with different customer interactions. management is always looking to promote driven and hardworking employees.

good,"Working with whole foods, a typical day there was busy and hectic but i dont crack under pressure. Working there I've acquired excellent knife skills with cutting fish, cutting beef, lamb, pork and chicken. I can fillet any meat and prepare meals. Management was excellent, they were really great at training. My co workers were great and string workers, some were lazy but thats life. The hardest part of the job was to stop working because there was always something to do. The most enjoyable on the job was having new products cooked for you because, when you have a new product you need to able to explain the taste and flavors to customers so, the management will cook it."
good,Whole Foods was ok. it really helped me while I was going through chef's school. head chef was very helpful as were my co-workers. the only thing I didn't like was cleaning bakery mixers. big and heavy

good,The typical day at wholefoods consistent of healthy customers. From working at wholefoods i have learned the difference between a corporation and non-profit organization. The management at wholefoods was historical and unprofessional at times. My team of co-workers at whole foods where very different did not really want to see you move up. To be honest there really was not a hard part of the job for me being at wholefoods customers and certain co-workers and managers liked working with me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers with there exhilarating personalities.
good,A typical day at work was to set up the Juice bar and keep it full and tidy at all times while dealing with customers. I enjoyed talking to customers!

I have learned how to effectively run a team and make sure I use my team to its highest potential. I have also learned how to solve a lot of problems on my own and not having to go to a superior for assistance. I had a lot of great co workers at wholefoods. Hardest part of my job was usually on busy days when lines were very long and we did not have an adequate amount of cashiers to handle the lines, but we always pushed thru and made it work. The best times of my job were just enjoying all the laughs and times with my co workers."
good,I'm not writing a review on the previous place that I worked; I was unwillingly separated from the company due to a personal mistake.
good,Great work atmosphere. Coworkers are very pleasant and helpful. A great place to work. Always something new. No two days are alike.
good,"it was exciting each day to interact with team members and customers. Had the opportunity to learn new skills very often.

The hardest part of the job, lately, is the hours worked, difficult to work 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. sometimes."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods Market.  I learned a lot about coffee, organics, cheese, wine and responsible meat production.  Our customers were an interesting and diverse lot who taught me a lot about various things.  WHM offered training classes in such subjects like Celiacs Disease, wine pairings, cheese production and organic farmimg."
good,You learn most of your work on the job. The hardest part of the job are the physical demands.Teamwork is the most enjoyable part of the job.

You have to apply yourself and be committed to succeed in this field."
good,"typical day at work just waiting to help a customer out make sure my work section is clean and everything in place. Also i learn a lot everyday i get better at customer service not only that also in my duties. The management at work is great they have everything how its suppose to be, and coworkers are just great they are good helpers, and teachers at work.

good,"I love doing and completing my tasks. Its never overwhelming to me even though I attend school but i don't let work affect my education. I love meeting new people every day at work, new faces and new personalities. I love learning about the products the company offers to its clients/customers. We sell the best quality, even though it is a bit pricey but i can guarantee that the customer service and quality is totally worth it. Every time i come into, the first thing i do is check the quality of the products that i am selling that day such as flowers, fruits, vegetables, etc. The management is great, very well organized.  My co-workers work as a team, we solve any problem or any difficulty with any customer, embrace their needs and make sure they have happy and come happy next time. The hardest part would have to be disappointing customers, i wish we could have their every need all the time but sometimes unfortunately we dont. Other than that i enjoy every moment at whole foods, i have fun and enjoy meeting new customers and new co-workers as well. I love talking about the products that we sell. I love Wholefoods!"

Working with whole foods I have learned how to budget, work with strict margins, staffing, peer to peer interaction and how to mentor a staff of fifty plus. Management is very reliable and supportive. Working with such a diverse group of people is one of the best experiences to attain through Whole Foods. The hardest part of my job everyday is to not eat all the food we produce. We provide nothing but the best and thats what makes my job so enjoyable."
good,"fun work place with supportive management . not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. decent amount of red tape sand politics , but this is expected of a big company. the most enoyable part of the job was working as a team . the restaurant started to get crowed it grew and it was more difficult to get to kno wthe new people . there was a lot of variety in what i did each day"

good,"A typical day at work would involve working with some great co-workers while we stock shelves and make drinks (coffee, juices and smoothies) for our customers. I have learned how to order multiple things through our multitude ordering systems ranging from product for the shelves to supplies for the bar. Management is very hands on and is willing to help out at any given point. They love to see their team members happy and willing to help them grow with the company. The co-workers are probably the best part of the job. We end up feeding off of each others positive energy making the work environment fun and healthy for everyone, including customers. The hardest part of the job is some heath crazed customers who can be a little harsh by believing they must push their beliefs and practices on you. The best part of the job is educating customers that Whole Foods is much more then Whole Paycheck! And it's a great feeling to show people that they can actually afford to shop at the store.

The way it was managed was very well everything was organized, like the spicy chicken was in one area and the non spicy regular chicken was on the other.The hardest part of the job was probably coming home smelling like chicken and taking a shower to try and get the smell off of you but it wouldn't work. The enjoyable part was when it was closing time, the chicken that was made already and that wasn't taken the we would have the first privileges to take it home."

good,Whole Foods is great company to work for; great benefits; great people to work for but there is a lot of favoritism that goes around a lot more the reason why people don't stay there too long unless you decide to suck up to your leadership to move up and step over everyone to move up. They do give out free food to the employees and  do a lot of events for the team members and customers to show their appericiation to everyone. They are a lot of people that take their job serious but way overboard with it and will make your job very hard and stressfull. Leadership alway say they will agree what the team decide on but its a bunch of bull cause they'll do what they want regardless how you feel and if you show it or tell them about it they will find a way to terminate you from your job even if its not something you did.
good,Fortune 500 best place to work for years! The culture is great and leadership allows you to reach your full potential.
good,it was a good place to work at learned about  diffrent foods and wines cheese the store as a whole staff was ok and customer were enjoyable
good,"Fun working environment, well manage but unfortunately better opportunity offered by Metro Disc."
good,Don't really have any complaints. Days and shifts can be long and busy but it's always somewhat enjoyable when you're surrounded by great people.
good,co-workers are excellent and a good management to work with.
good,"I work as a cook for wholefoods but started at the front simply selling the already made food with the experience growth i received from that  I was trusted enough to cook and manage the bars on my own. I learned how to make pizza, gyros, but most importantly prioritize what's most important and how to efficiently get the needed work to be done"
good,The management in my particular store was terrible. But the culture of the business was amazing
good,"A team-oriented setting with wonderful co-workers. I learned a lot about myself, like working well under pressure, product knowledge, my exceptional customer service potential, how to lead others and teach them what I know, etc. This was the prepared foods department, a mix between a fast food setting and a restaurant kitchen. We baked Pizza and bread, sliced deli, served food prepared by our chef, set up displays, made presentations of meals prepared by one of our workers (myself included). We met our pleasant customers with smiles and helped them pick out products that interested them. We had a lot of cleaning to do at the end of the night, with each team member assigned a different section of our department. In an environment where everyone is happy to see you and your work is appreciated and applauded, it was a job that made me want to go back everyday. And although circumstances made me leave this job, I met great people and was given great references, as well as a promise of a job in the future should I return to seek it"
good,"Their starting pay isn't as much as other store chains. However, you can earn more than those chains eventually.  It just takes a long time to get there. I was a butcher with 20 years experience and they started me at a low wage. I could get a job at a union store and instantly make $4 more per hour. So I eventually quit.  I did enjoy the culture and the work atmosphere, but at the end of the day, I needed to make more money."
good,The job was fun and fast paced and the team was great to work with
good,"A typical day of work consists of prepping food for the prepared foods area for a few hours while the restaurant is slow. Have learned a lot from culinary students and chefs in kitchen about cooking and preparing dishes. Once restaurant fills we switch to full service mode for the rest of the evening until close. Management is still learning how to run a restaurant properly in this setting and while I attempt to help as much as possible, would like to be consulted more often with my experience. Always more than happy to assist management with problems."
good,Learned better customer service skills. I enjoyed working with both management and other co-workers from both customer service and other departments through out the store. I enjoy every aspect of my job.
good,"Whole Foods is a great employer, but they do not do IT well. It is a very disorganized environment, and there is little consistency across divisions. Not a good place to learn."
good,"Always on the move a lot of"
good,Whole Foods Market is a good place to work.  They provide a clean and safe work environment and encourage team members to use their talents to share with employees and customers.  The encourage internal advancement although the opportunities are not very abundant
good,"Whole Foods Market presents many day-to-day challenges, both personally and professionally. It's an atmosphere that opens doors for connecting with people on unparalleled levels. Here, I've learned that a job isn't just a job -- it's also a second home. I enjoy coming into work with the idea that I feel wanted and needed. It's always been a pleasure connecting with people of different cultural and geographic backgrounds. One of the hardest parts of my job is knowing that someone hasn't left the store happy. Anytime that I can satisfy their needs, lets me know that I'm instilling the values that Whole Foods stands for."
good,"Keeps you on your toes! Things always change and this store embraces that change! From creating local flavors, healthy bites, changing recipes in order to help our waistline, to helping local schools and families at the same time! We do tons of things here =)! "
good,"Working at WholeFoods Market makes you feel like you have a second family. I learned that eating Organic food is good for a long healthy life. The Managment is amazing because they make sure everyone is on the same page when it comes to working expectations, My co-workers were easy to get along with and just overall enjoyable, The hardest part of the job was picking up cases of wine and building displays. The most enjoyable thing about WholeFoods Market is going home everyday and knowing you enjoyed your shift, and that you cant wait for the next day"
good,"I had awesome co-workers, managment and learned alot about being organized.  I love dealing with customers.  "
good,A lot of nice people to work with.Everyday was great day because you was always busy and productive.
good,"from customer service to production, each day brought something new"
good,Whole Foods as a company and the way that it is theoretically designed is a model that I think a lot of companies could learn from. They support the environment as well as try to cultivate an overall healthy work environment with fair benefits and gain sharing for all employees that offers further incentive to effectively sell and continue growing the Wholefoods brand. I would buy stock in this company myself as it is still not at its peak of growth.
good,I enjoy working for this company. Positive feed back is a plus from management.
good,Whole Foods Market offers a great work environment. All employees are valued and encouraged to grow through the development of new skills.
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work with excellent benefits.
good,"it was fun working there but the hours and the schedule wasn't for me, i couldn't balance going to school and working random hours of there choice it couldn't work with my school schedule."
good,"I learned a whole lot about food and what was not really food. I learned about GMOs and how they are mostly made up of cottonseed, soy, and corn. Whole foods opened the door to organic food and why beneficial super foods and antioxidants are good for us to consume. I also learned a lot about veganism, celiac's disease (gluten), and other special diets. That company helped me distinguish that eating healthy was very important and although the prices were sky high; I'd rather pay for great health rather than having doctor visits that could really burn a whole in my pocket later."
good,I really think Wholefoods in general is a very fun and work friendly
good,"There is no typical day at Whole Foods Market. Just like any other job there are daily challenges but there are also opportunities, as the company is rapidly expanding and opening new locations."
good,Lots of selections for food and spirits. I love the way that the company is managed and the cooking programs that it offers.
good,funny work environment
good,Your day can alway be good. Youwork with a lot of different people form all over the world many of the people you meet are great and its a friendly enviorment to work in. I have ben working in the company for 7 years and I have learned a lot which boost up my manger skills as well as my hard and soft skills which allows me o interact with everyone well. the hardest part of my job dealing wih people and there emotions but you get through it. Many people are so emotion and and you have to learn to deal with it and learn from it. it is all a learning experience which I am greatful to have. The most enjoyable par of my day is seeing my team members happy to see me when I come in to work. I make them smile the sad part is when it is time for me to go and they are sad and want me to stay
good,Learned about products
good,"I Enjoyed working at whole foods market. I learned little new stuff here and there, but nothing much different from the retail point of view. My co-workers were great people to work with, loving and caring people. I think the hardest part for me was doing the Inventory and the cashiering all in one day cuz i would start work at 4;30 am and get done at like 6-7 pm. The most enjoyable part at work was meeting new people everyday."
good,"my co worker were funny, hyper i loved working with them even if smelled like food"
good,"responsible for the safety of over 100 employees at any given time,manage breaks,schedule request,performance reviews,vacation request,hold daily briefings .conduct team meetings,assure food safety practices are being followed,monitor production efficiency,"
good,"a typical day of work includes punching in (on time) putting on your smock. cleaning your stations and refilling any items, or dishes that are becoming low. preparing quesadillas, burritos, or pizza all by hand. making home made tortillas in the back, lightly salting them, then properly packaging then, slicing deli meats. making announcements on the over com. refilling or cleaning salad bar, as well as taking temps off all the foods, fridges and heaters to make sure everything is in the right temperature zone. cleaning drains, machines, and cutlery. washing and drying dishes. creating a demo station with your own customized display followed by announcements. lastly doing inventory once a month, restocking, and refacing every item in the store."
good,"Whole foods was a great place to work. There was always time set up to learn more about the company. The management is generally, very accessible and helpful. Whole Foods also offered great partnership benefits, including discounts on almost everything."
good,"The managment is awesome, the people are awesome the overall workplace is awesome I went through a career change and that is why I left the establishment."
good,"Helping customers, driving forklifts and staying busy. A very fun place to work"
good,I loved the management at WFM. They were all encouraging and positive and awesome!!
good,"This was a good job. The benefits were nice and the pay was pretty good for a non-union job. The management was so-so but the leadership in the front end was good. Being a cashier was a win/lose situation, win being that I met a lot of nice people and lose being that the jerks out weighed the nice people. I really enjoyed a lot of my co-workers and learned a lot about organic and non organic foods. The company has been changing a lot in the last few years and now they don't even hire full time employees anymore. They have also cut back a lot on raises and compensation in general."
good,the team members and mangers are great to work for and they have great benfits and a good team member discount all around fun place to work at.
good,great pepole to work for good benfits and fun place all around to work at.
good,Whole foods really knows how to treat their employees and places a great emphasis on seeing them thrive. Since the company emphasizes work performance over seniority it is a great place to move up and to gain management experience
good,"Great partnership and team oriented environment. The balance and life category may vary. The pay is well, but sometimes the work can be extensive. Nonetheless, I would recommend this job."
good,"Only need to work one shift a month to stay employed, pretty fast paced but it's nice that when it's slow you can sit down in the break room without having to hear anyone's mouth and can take your break when you want without someone watching over you"
good,Whole foods is a place to build and move up at everyone ones works as a team members. The movements are real. Amazon brought the company and made it better with the Amazon prime and self shopping and delivery for the customers
good,Coming into work everyday was fun for me mainly because i loved to meet new people every single day. Co workers were very nice as well everyone was more like a family then co workers.
good,"Working in the kitchen was challenging but rewarding. They have the full benefits package, as well as profit sharing. The company is well run and profitable and the people who work there are generally interesting and fun people to work with."
good,"in all honesty I would gladly work for a company like Whole Foods , just because the warm, family-like attitude that left an immense impression on me! I would go back in a heartbeat if asked again."
good,"I was promoted after about 3 months from a cashier to a supervisor, they really acknowledge people with the drive to grow and learn. If you want a promotion they will give you one if 1. they take you seriously and 2. you take the store seriously. Do your job, show up on time and love the products. Easy-peasy"
good,"My job was eliminated after 10 weeks, but I really loved the Whole Foods culture. Everyone is welcoming, friendly, professional and fun. "
good,"Its a very fun job. As a cashier, I wish I had the freedom to move around more be prepared to stay in one position your whole shift. overall you will meet some great people."
good,"Loved working for the company, great team members, friendly and helpful.  Changing with Amazon taking over and communications could be better.  Very hectic at times and it is hard work."
good,"Great place to work, you have the opportunity to grow within the company and move to different roles.  Programs do change very often so you need to learn quick and adapt to changes."
good,I am not a Whole Foods employee per se; I work for Amazon. What I see and hear from WF employees is encouraging and positive. Whole Foods is a company I would recommend.
good,"Overall, a fine place to work given it has been bought by Amazon. Parking is an issue but it is nice to have the grocery store under the offices. Not too stuffy, everyone is pretty relaxed."
good,"This job I started and immediately started growing. I was hired part time, promoted full time within the first two weeks. After working there a year I had been promoted to ready to cook supervisor and was in charge of prepping food for our meat display case."
good,"The pay and hours weren't great, but it felt like you mattered. It was also difficult to move up in the ranks. There was a lot of competition and very few opportunities"
good,Well with any customer service job comes a lot of patience. My team leaders and supervisors care about our work environment and always praise employees when they do well.
good,"customers are the best and the most challenging part, but the managers stands behind you and work support you when there are difficult situations. "
good,"You must be on time and show up when your suppose to, or else it could hurt you and your chances staying or starting there. I think it’s best for college kids with lil to no life"
good,"Career Growth and Advancement, Benefits are great, greats teams to work with, great morale for employees, gainshairing program offered, stocks options"
good,"Good place to work. Nice team, and nice managment. But I believe every location is different. Overall I like their policily and their great benefit. Nice place to work"
good,"I've enjoyed my time at Whole Foods. The company cares a lot about employee happiness. Communication can be difficult because there are multiple levels of management and most things are dictated on a regional level. However, overall it's a very strong company moving in the right direction."
good,Whole Foods is a good company and has gone through many changes since I worked there.  They have always had a high quality standard and excellent customer service.  It was good to be a part of that at the time.
good,I worked at Whole Foods for two months in a contract position. I immediately felt comfortable with my co-workers and everyone was easy to work with. I highly recommend the company.
good,"Nice job, but got tired of it after 8 months. My coworkers were super nice and a huge benefit is 20% off grocieries and you can wear regular clothes under your apron :)"
good,"My time a Whole Foods has been an experience especially since this is my first time working in a market place as such, coming from the restaurant industry I feel pretty comfortable there since one day I will be using the products.And the environment thats associated around the store is a pleasant place to be."
good,"Teamwork is highly valued at Whole Foods Market. Team members get along well and help each other out when in need. I enjoy working here. Shifts go by quickly because there is always something to do, as long as you are willing to do it."
good,"A typical workday consisted of arriving to the store, putting on my uniform, clocking in, and then checking in with my supervisors.  From there, they'd instruct me what first to do, whether that be bagging, setting up on a register, or performing various cleaning or organizing duties."
good,was a cool and good job. but each department is different so it really all depends on where you get placed. i was in the meat department and it was rather decent
good,You can learn quiet a bit of skills here. If your have drive to cross train you may be able to expand not only your horizons but your pay as well. It helps to be a team player.
good,"Good starting pay rate, they give you the opportunity to progress. Good environment, where you can work and have fun in the meantime. Pay rise every year based on your performance."
good,"Professional and fair with all employees. I've had some bad experiences with change in leadership. But it depends on your perspective if you take it personally or not. Other than that, I really enjoy working at Whole Foods. My experience working there has been great overall."
good,I had a lot of fun with the employees I worked with. The management was pretty understanding as well. Not a bad place to work for whether you need it as a beginning job or a for long term.
good,whole foods was the best job I ever had I worked  for them almost  10 years I got hired in California for 5 years I got married and thy let me transfer to Dallas TX and let me keep my same pay that was also!! Everyone was so nice I learn a lot from that company I truly miss it.✔👍😁
good,I enjoyed working at Whole Foods they were an amazing company to work for and the only reason I left was to pursue to dream of working in the dental field. My bosses were so understanding and supported my throughout the whole process.
good,Whole foods is a great place to work with great benefits if you work the amount of hours needed. You have a 7 minute grace period when clocking in to ensure you are coming in clear minded and ready to work. You get lots of extras-like a 20% off card for whatever you want in the store. You get the items that have been decided that they are no longer being held at the store. Along with fun on the job activities and bonuses
good,Was the first real job I had out of school. I really enjoyed working there the hours were decent as a part-time job and I could always get more especially around the holidays. The work culture was great all my co-workers and customers were interesting people that wanted to work towards the same goals. At the time I worked there the benefits and paid time off was amazing but now not so sure with the buy out from Amazon I know a lot of veterans I worked with quit before trade over.
good,"If your good at following rules, and coloring between the lines you will like it here."
good,"Overall I do really enjoy the company and working for it, there are always going to be some things I dislike though. Some issues need to be taken care of, that have not been yet. My main problems are them being extremely understaffed, and not being able to afford to hire the appropriate amount of staff. I was over-scheduled a lot due to this, and if someone called off the workload gets so bad that I have had to stay two hours late before, closing. I do often tell people to apply here and it is a great job especially compared to others, so don't get me wrong. I just didn't want to leave out the little things."
good,"It was a great short term job and experience, I loved working with my peers and my managers were fantastic. "
good,"I enjoyed working for WFM and appreciated the fast-paced, demanding environment.  Opportunities to advance are available - but harder to come in (and stay) if you are an external candidate vs. work your way up through the stores."
good,In my experience with whole foods it was a very friendly and safe environment. I felt that if I did stick with them I could grow with the company and make connections with various employers.
good,"It's a retail job! Store leadership is hit or miss from store to store. It's easy to get promoted if you're a good worker with a strong personality. Nowadays, a lot of team member drama."
good,"For the amount of compensation, the job within the whole body department is easy. Moving up the ranks is fairly to do if you show initiative for almost any department. Very millennial aged workplace so realize this when applying."
good,"Whole Foods Market was a fun place to work, I just eventually didn't want to work as a dishwasher, and didn't entirely want to work in any of the other roles available to crosstrain into. They provide a lot of benefits, they have an on site HR rep, not a lot of places have that."
good,I loved working there.  The interview process was fair.  The comoany allows for parr time workers to become full time employees with benefits and such.
good,I enjoyed working there. The culture and ability to advance are there if you work and apply yourself. I would recommend this company to anyone who has an outgoing personality.
good,"For a grocery store, it's got pretty good benefits. High starting wage of 15$, health insurance if you want it, and you can also sign up to donate a little money every so often to a charity. It's a pretty good place to work, if you can manage to get in."
good,Whole Foods Market is a good place to work. The management was fair and understanding and the work wasn't super difficult. I was at WFM for 2.5 years & i would recommend it.
good,"well it was always good day with the co workers and everyone else but when it came to asking for a change shift it was a problem i asked give me a mid day and i got denied . i even use to do overtime for them , and still i had to close the next day and i would only get two days off maybe one ."
good,"Honestly I miss how well everyone got along. I met a lot of great people at this job. We all got through the days with jokes and laughter, and working hard."
good,"A typical work day is extremely busy and exciting, we ALL work as a team to make sure our customers are satisfied always. The customers are always friendly as well as demanding in a very good way."
good,"It all depends on what team you’re on and who your leadership is, no store is the same. I haven’t worked there in years so I have no idea how it is now, especially with Amazon now owning the company. I know for sure things are run differently and pay is different."
good,not bad at all to be honest. I really enjoyed the spirit of comraderie while working there. but you are treated very poorly by customers and upper management
good,Most of the staff was pretty cool but every now and then a little mess breaks out but that's expected with so many different personalities in one spot
good,"I enjoyed helping customers find what they need,"
good,"I had 2 managers and both were very professional and kind to me, I learned a lot in the two positions I had there."
good,"Wholefoods is a good place to work if you're looking for good pay and good benefits. While they do have some strict policies regarding their work environment, if you can stomach it, they do take care of their employees, even if it can be stressful working in a Grocer."
good,"It is always an adventure in Whole Foods. It is a great place to expand culturally through good eats!  The knowledge the staff gains by just working in a place that promotes health and eco systems all around, you really cant beat it."
good,I am currently working for Wholefoods and i love it. My team and team leadership is awesome! Everyone is nice and genuinely friendly. I hope to move up to a supervisor position soon!
good,"I was able to learn a lot about food and how what you eat affects your body and mind. I enjoyed my time working for Whole Foods, especially helping customers answer questions or meet their specific needs."
good,"good salary , good beneficios, good manager , sometimes is very busy , team member friendly, big company, employee has discount in products, flexible managers."
good,"Great company and great store! The enviroment was awesome, fast paced and long work hours. Unfortunately, weekends are mandatory to work at whole foods and I need weekends off due to school."
good,I really enjoyed being a part of Whole Foods. I would recommend it to just about anyone. They offer great benefits and the team is filled with amazing people.
good,Great pay... good job for college students or people seeking a part time job. Very difficult to become part time 20+ hours or full time. Scheduling can seem unfair or inconsistent if you have varied availability. Also PTO for part time members is a great benefit. very close knit family working environment!
good,Amazing talented people to work with. The company has great benefits and opportunities for growth. If you put in the work you will move up quickly in the company.
good,awesome place to work very friendly environment all guests are very friendly and have gret attitudes that help uplift spirits throughout the work day mkes you feel good
good,"A great place to work at got tons of specials an deals,its a very friendly work environment an everyone is treated with respect there  great food an great service"
good,I come in to work and start to set up the case for the start of the day. My job is to set up the sausage part of the meat case. I have learned how better communicate with my team members. I really enjoy working for my managers they are great people and are very understanding. The people that I work with are like family. I think that the hardest part of my job is getting up at three in the morning to be at work at 4 am. Woking with my friends is the best part of the day.
good,"Whole Food Market is a thriving business with customers from all walks of life. They expect employees to have a sense of professionalism and a high degree of customer service which i did my best to live up to and exceed everyday. "
good,Lots to learn if your willing. Definitely a place to work if you want to climb the ladder. Also a place to end up getting surrounded by those who are not willing to learn and skim by doing bare minimum. Management can either be really good or really poor depending on location.
good,"During my time at Whole Foods I developed and refined many life skills that I will utilize in my professional career and personal life. Whole Foods is a place that promotes health, community, and transparency.  Daily life at Whole Foods consists of numerous customer inquiries and problem solving. The most challenging part of the job was trying to help customers that were upset with a product or service. The most enjoyable part of the job was making connections and lasting friendships with co-workers and customers and learning about all of the products in the store."
good,Overall a great atmosphere. Always a pleasant place. They take care of their team members. They also offer amazing benefits to part time and full time team members.
good,Pretty fast-paced time at work. I learned to stock/manage shelves. Management was decent and considerate. Workplace culture was friendly. The hardest part of the job was showing up on time at 5 a.m. The most enjoyable part the job was not knowing what to expect on a  daily basis.
good,good pay for the younger crowd not much experience needed just show you are a go getter and you want the job and when you have the job be a people person and social for the first few months and your in
good,"A typical day at work would include dealing with mostly friendly customers and helping out other co-workers regularly.  They allow you to try out different departments by just asking so there is a lot of variety in your work life.  The best part about working there is definitely the people you work with, everyone is down to earth and management is super accommodating.  The hardest part would be that some of the customers are pretty snobby and obnoxious but there aren't too many of them."
good,I learned a lot about organic food..Many are regulars & returning customers. Our hot & cold bars have delicious foods too offer. My team members are fun to work with.
good,"must be a self starter, self developer, the ability for continuous learning on your own, network is essential, must ask a lot of questions and have a great relationship with colleagues, must be detail oriented, communication more email than in person."
good,I loved working there. Everyone is friendly at all times and very understanding. This was my first job and I was trained very well and efficiently. For a year I learned people skills and how to be extroverted.
good,Whole Foods was organized and well managed. The crew was friendly and the benefits are great. There is plenty of room for advancement within the company and they are always willing to teach you if you're willing to learn.
good,"Loved working there for many years, left before Amazon took over because when teams were being combined, the workloads on TLs, ATLs, and buyers became too much, jobs became too competitive,  stress became higher, pay remained the same."
good,"If you need a job that pays well for a certain amount of time, this is perfect. On the other hand, after a while management starts to set sights and double down on the work load."
good,"working here was a interesting, & unforgettable experience. my coworkers were cool, The establishment was refreshing & the food was very good & had a variety of healthy options."
good,"I've worked with this company for a while now and have met many great team members. Management in my department (grocery) at each store I've worked at have been great, unsure of other departments though."
good,"I mainly worked in the afternoons. I learned what it meant to be a part of a team and how you need to rely on each other throughout the entire time you're working a shift. Hardest part was shutting down because there was so much to do and there was only two of us on the floor at the time of close. Hands down the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to come in and say hello to all my co-workers and chatting with them throughout the day, they were truly the reason, I looked forward to coming to work everyday."
good,"A typical day we making sure we have all the product in stock the customer needs very productivity outstanding customer service"
good,It was a great environment to work in. Job was not difficult but there was always something to do. Schedule was flexible but they wanted you to work as close to full time as possible.
good,"Very busy on holidays, has enough work for everyone, but they cut hours of the employees sometimes, because of payroll, then it is hard to work, short handed."
good,Would recommend to others. Learned great communication skills. Mastered working with my co workers and the customers. Answering phone calls to place orders with the merchandize. Scheduling customers to come in for pick ups of floral arrangements
good,"I gave Whole Foods this score because i do have some bad days because i work in customer service and deal with demanding customers but it's because of the co-workers i work with im able to deal with the stress and it's not just one store that has this, i have visited one or 2 stores in my time and i get this good feeling in each store."
good,It’s a good place to work with great people good benefits and good discounts fast paced and busy but everyone makes it easy aside from that I’m loving it there
good,"Working at whole foods i can say was a joyful experience for me. Everyday was a challenge which i welcomed with open arms. The reason why i say a challenge, is due to the diversity of customers. You were never met with the same type of personality.So finding foods and other items to fit the customer was an interesting task. Ive learned a lot about different cultures, simply from the food they make. The employees were very close knit. The hardest part of the job ,is also the best part of the job. The customers!! You get some good and some bad. But if you remain polite and professional even bad customers turn to great ones."
good,"A typical day at work is mostly busy.i learned how to handle customers,how to give them a great customer service, how to be patient with them and always engaging in a conversation."
good,Working for Wholefoods market is a company.  Your happiness and achievement is based on what you want.  If you apply yourself with integrity it will show.
good,"Great place to work at. Improved over the last year. It can be hectic at times but I think in another year it will be a much better place to be at , especially for analyst."
good,"Whole Foods was a good company to work for. There was some stress at peak times, but overall not a bad company to work for. The hardest part of the job was the some of the attitudes of the customers. The best part of the job was the co-workers."
good,"It's a customer service industry and a big national chain, opinions and criticisms run rampant. As a full-time gig between career moves, I really enjoyed the friendly and positive culture and exceptional pay and benefits for the work. I didn't intend to stay with the company but felt as though I had ample opportunity to advance if I was interested."
good,"A typical day at work involved constant guest interaction, answering inquiries, setting up vendors for their demos, and promoting various products. As part of the marketing department, I also assisted coordinating store events and seasonal themes, as well as off-site events as a Whole Foods Market representative. The hardest part of the job was poor communication and accountability between departments and department heads. Most enjoyable was the community of people who worked there."
good,"Casual and easy for people that don't like to work too much and get plenty of benefits. Fun work environment, but difficult customers. Management is clique-y so you must be liked to be promoted"
good,whole foods is an awesome food company. they provided organics and natural products that can be used for body and house work. I recommend anyone who's looking for a great first job to start off with. You would fit right in.
good,"When I started at Whole Foods, it was the best place to work. Great team members, customers. My whole family worked there. Our store team leader was the most motivating person I've ever met."
good,"I got promoted fast due to my previous work experience. "
good,"I really enjoyed my time here. If you are looking for a job where having fun and connecting is important this one is for you. Although I do feel like we do not get paid enough for all that we do, this is a great part time job to create new relationships and have a good time. Come here with a good attitude and willingness to learn and you'll be great."
good,Great atmosphere. Great employees and good leaders. Mission driven company. New Saint Paul store looks great. Love the fresh Produce and Deli selections.
good,My position was  fulfilling in every way. The best part of the job was the view of pikes peak from the juice/java bar i managed. the second was opening this brand new store with everyone else and the holistic/natural part is why i stayed and learned a whole new culture.. HEALTH.
good,"Pros: environment that emphasized growth opportunities, hip industry information, great co-workers, free samples, 20% + discount"
good,"Worked as a dishwasher and the amount of work that had to be done was highly varied depending on the amount of customers that day. Sometimes it was highly stressful and fast paced but sometimes it was rather laid back. The company culture is good and my coworkers were always happy to help if I asked for it, including my supervisor. The higher-ups at my location were great and ran things well. Benefits were surprising good for the position I filled, but not the best in the world. Maintenance was kind of slow; it took them a while to fix the dishwasher when it had a problem. As a dishwasher at Wholefoods, I had to be prepared to take on a lot of work and had little time for breaks, but it was USUALLY manageable, though the workload could get out of hand sometimes. Decent Employee discounts on food as well, but even with the discount (20% off everything), I still find it cheaper to shop for food at other stores."
good,"It was a good starter. good for my resume. Days were included of cleaning tables, working on carts and helping customers. Customers were polite and co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was doing carts. Most enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,Some days are fast others are chill. Some managers will talk to you others will give you a crazy schedule to push you to quit. Store leaders are very active on the floor and help all departments. Friendly atmosphere but must follow companies policy at all times or you will be fired.
good,"I enjoy working at Wholefoods and also grow with the company as well. There is different departments you can work in such as seafood, meat, chef case or bakery and etc. They train you thoroughly and also are there to help you."
good,"This was one of my all time favorite places to work and was very sad to hear that my job was being eliminated, team members were very nice & helpful, I Don't know much about the Mananagment Team members,"
good,"I've only been at Whole Food for 5 months but overall great place to work, excellent pay, great management staff, and awsome environment friendly and helpfull co-workers."
good,"The people you work with quickly become your friends. It can get stressful especially during holidays or overworking (whether from working part time, school work, etc), but it is also important to have a social life."
good,The people i worked for and with were super supportive and go getters. The only thing i didn't like was it was really hard to get a day off if it wasn't scheduled. Everything else was fine.
good,"I wasn't there for long but my time there was nice. I felt welcomed and at home. Everyone was like family, working in unison and halping out customers. It was an all around great experience."
good,"Employees worked hard and were great to interact with. Learned a lot about food, wine, and beer. Became a good sales person here and learned to purchase."
good,"whole foods, was a place you could enjoy coming to work. With different areas to work and also the best ingredients to work with management could be better. But you get what you work for, so if you work hard you can be rewarded"
good,"great atmosphere, I met some great people.. Assured vehicles in a clean and safe condition. Performed cashier, bagger, and other duties. Drove safely and promptly to customers homes. Obtain cash or credit card payments"
good,Whole Foods Market enables their Team members to be able to overcome issues on their own. Team Leaders provide the skills and resources necessary to succeed but really empower the Team Member to take charge and problem solve for themselves.
good,"really nice place to work, nice team, and good learning and cultural place..... clean and safe place to work, only problem was no fix rota, and only know your rota week before."
good,"Great place to work, people are friendly and willing to help each other out. You learn a lot on the job about the products, and the people they hire are really interesting."
good,"clock in and check in with the shift prior to you. check all your inventory to make sure you have enough supply for the day. fill any missing items and refill dressings, napkins, utensils for the customers. help and apply yourself while keeping yourself available for any customers. finish the day by closing your section and cleaning up your work area. have a closing meeting and have a goodnight."
good,"Whole Foods is a strong and competitive company that is a front runner in organic foods.  They have set the standard and with Amazon, they look to get a good foot in the door in the grocery business."
good,"I had a wonderful experience working at Whole Foods. The team members were wonderful,friendly and always ready to help, even from different departments.  However,sometimes the bulk of the work could be sometimes stressful and too demanding, especially during peak holiday seasons.The managers i worked with on my team were awesome."
good,"Working at whole foods was a relatively low stress, fast paced job.  A typical day at work in the specialty department consisted of crafting espresso beverages and running the coffee bar, and in my down time I helped out the cheese department with packing up various snacks."
good,Fast paced good job.  The team members are wonderful.  Servant leadership is taught.  Upper management really cares. Order to shelf buying system is life changing.
good,Work is always fun but you must provide your very best for customers like they are guest in your house. Be on time or you will get fired if you dont have PTO.
good,If someone is in school or just want to work here til they find out what they want to do with their life this is the place to be. You can be yourself always just the customers are veryyyyyy outrageous sometime that is very stressful
good,"Started my day early working and training team members. Reviewing emails and compiling reports and department planograms. Working with construction on design and development of new stores. Planning upcoming ads and retail pricing. Implementing new and innovative ideas to incorporate into stores. "
good,great place to work overall. people are friendly and you meet interesting people everyday. The job is physically demanding and requires you to be standing and moving for 7-hours or more. I work the weekends and that is the busiest time and somewhat stressful due to the abundance of people coming in but is manageable. Management changes often and some know what they are doing and others don't. Ive been blessed with a great boss who accommodates my school schedule. Co-workers like at most job make the job either easier or complicated. in my particular case we have great team and help each other out. Wholefoods has improved by customer service skills drastically.
good,I enjoyed working at Whole Foods and it was a very easy job. Sometimes customers were difficult but that's to be expected in retail. We got free snacks often which was nice.
good,If there is a great team set up in your department it can be a fun place to work. In my experience they are flexible with hours and are understanding of your personal life. Most teams try and have a good time while at work knowing it makes the day go by faster. Leadership is supportive and helpful. Because it is a grocery store you need to be willing to work weekends and holidays. A great perk is that the company will pay 100% of your insurance after you've worked there full time for five years.
good,"Whole Foods is a lovely place to work.The people are all quite nice, especially to new recruits. Management tries their best to work with you. Each Whole Foods has a distinct personality that is completely dependent on the people who work there and the location. The hardest part of the job is the Sunday Rush when it seems like the entire population of your region unanimously decides that this is the time to shop all at once. The most enjoyable part is interacting with co-workers. The only true issue is how long it takes to change your schedule. This is a killer if you're a student and your schedule changes as you add and drop classes."
good,"Everything about this place is good from work to benefit, 401k, health insurance and other important programs. Fun place to work at and create new experiences."
good,I made a lot of friends while working at Whole Foods and the pay was excellent considering I was fresh out of high school with little to no experience in that industry
good,"So originally I had joined Whole Foods in thee hope of becoming a part of their marketing team, since I am currently a student pursuing a bachelor's degree in that field. To my dismay, the marketing team was disbanded within the first 3 months I had started working for the company. But I decided to stay with Whole Foods through the course of my studies, and I am extremely glad I did. "
good,"I love this company and while I would rather not leave it I have to due to hours I have been given that coincide with my classes. Fast-paced at times, slow at others. Good chances for advancement and no matter what team you end up with you will end up loving where your are at."
good,"A typical day on the job included memorizing a great deal of PLU numbers for checkout, interacting with many customers in a quick, friendly, and efficient manner, performing basic janitorial/courtesy clerk duties, ie; taking out trash/compost/recycling, wiping down and sweeping eat-in areas, corraling carts, and keeping the bathrooms in a clean orderly condition."
good,Whole foods market is a wonderful company to work for. They work with and the benefits are wonderful. All though some management could be better overall it is a good company to work for.
good,"My experience as an employee for Whole Foods Market was positive. There were a few drawbacks (relatively low pay, low career advancement options), but for what I was expecting/wanting at the time, this was a great place to work. My first manager's communication style did not harmonize with mine, but after he left and was replaced by a more open, friendly, and less Machiavellian manager, my experience was much better. I'd recommend an entry level job at this company if you enjoy serving people, do not care much about fast career advancement/high pay, and don't mind working hard. It's not a great sell, I know, but I really enjoyed the environment of the workspace, as well as the diversity and friendliness of most of my co-workers."
good,"I learned so much from my Specialty Team Members. They gave me the time I needed to gradually learn instead of expecting too much from me right off the bat. They were patient and kind and really fun to work with. The culture at Whole Foods is friendly and upbeat. The hardest part of the job is making sure you make sure you punch in an out at the right times, especially if you have a tendency to run late or get zoned out on a task.  Other than than I would say I loved learning about the different products we had and sharing them with customers. PLUS my favorite thing about working at Whole Foods was the 20% discount. Overall, this is a amazing establishment and a good place to earn a competitive wage."
good,"A diverse group of fun people! Whole Foods is for the most part a laid back job. It can get very busy but as long as you get your job done, there's no worries. They pay really well and benefits are great. Whole Foods has flexible scheduling and take care of their employers."
good,I loved working at Whole Foods. I was always learning new things and worked amongst extremely knowledgable and kind people. The women in the produce production line are some of the most hardworking individuals I've ever met.
good,Great starting job for people looking for temporary work. Relatively lax environment with career potential for hard workers. Pay is relatively low and making above minimum wage requires a lot more work. Great for students.
good,"A very good place to work, the pay was great and a lot of room for advancement. The culture there is very good, as they treat the team like a Family. I'd recommend Whole foods to anyone looking for a JOB"
good,a typical day at work includes helping and assisting many guests and setting up fellow team members for success as they face many tasks as well. being an example for all the new employees is always helpful.
good,I enjoy working in whole foods It was great place to work your way up easily in about 6 months.I strongly recommend this job for anybody .I have about six months
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great work environment with very friendly management that facilitates a welcoming environment for all. However, as a cashier, the workplace is consistently very fast paced and busy without the assistance of stools to sit on the work can be very physically exhausting. With limited break times it can be a bit stressful, but overall the benefits outweigh the cons."
good,"Whole Foods is an experience in good, delicious food, and fun people to work with. There is a strong sense of team work and mutual pride in accomplishments. It can be fast paced, yet enjoyable."
good,The best part of the job is the overall family feeling of the team and company. Every department helps each other in order to provide the greatest shopping experience for the customers. The culture is unlike any other.
good,unload pallets onto u-boats to the correct lane. stock the product and face when done stocking . trow trash when finished with the lanes and help where the help is needed
good,"If your team is great, you will have a blast. If it is not, there is no difference whether you work at WFM, Asda, Tesco or wherever. It's a company as any other. I worked there for 2 years, at first the salary was great and the bonuses good, then bit by bit it all got reduced and withered away, despite the fact that we were working harder and harder, the profits kept growing. Oh well."
good,"Great Benefits, Strong Core values, Energizing environment. Awesome discount of merchandise. Always exciting during the holidays always full of spirit."
good,"Being able to work under fast paced and sressful work enviroment. Great team work, great management and sysyem. Fun work enviroment, productivity, efficiency."
good,"My initial and final impressions of those who work overnight shifts changed drastically as I found just how much harder overnight staff works to keep the store looking good."
good,whole foods market is a decent job for someone who needs a flexible schedule and is in school. Workers are motivated and very friendly. There is a lot of room for growth in the company.
good,I loved working at Whole Foods and made great friends there.  Whole Foods culture places an emphasis on working together and being accepting of your co-workers no matter who they are or what they believe. Management has an open door policy and them seem to really care about their employees.
good,"Enjoy working at Wholefoods.  I am eager for advancement but this is very limited due to the type of positions available.   The culture at Wholefoods is excellent, the benefits are great!"
good,"WFM is a good place to work.  The TMs are great.  Its a pretty easy job if everyone does what is needed.  As with any retail job, there are moments of frustration."
good,"Day to day: "
good,Nice job it was great. It was fast paced work with opportunities for advancement and overall knowledge. I learned alot about food and programs that help the less fortunate.
good,Whole Foods Market is an ideal place to sharpen skills related to team work and customer service.  The hours can be difficult but team leaders tend to be accommodating to individual needs.
good,I enjoyed every part of my time at WF. My day was never the same which made time fly. The people I worked with where all committed to creating a positive and productive work place.
good,"Whole foods is a great company to work with , once you get settled in your position you wont find it difficult to do your daily task. the culture there allows you to learn fast and grow and that can be rewarding , its so structured there that you will always have a fun loving team to work with. however there can be overwhelming times on the job when it comes to meeting deadlines with task but you will get through with some pain nevertheless."
good,"For what you do, you get paid well here.  More than many other jobs out there of the same kind of work.  They have weekly gift card drawings and they give you wow bucks when you do something good that is noticed.  The only bad thing I can say is that the management needs to be a lot more clear on their rules.  They are much too lax on their ""rules"", which only seems to confuse the workers and the customers.  It also makes some customers think they can get away with whatever they like.  So, when you do tell them no... they don't take it too well, because they're used to us telling them yes all the time."
good,whole foods market on a typical day is busy and consist of a lot of fast pacing dealing with answering customer calls and being on the sales floor. get to gain product knowledge of over thousands of products. its not hard to manage unless you are someone who can deal with working in a fast pace environment and a fast learner.

good,I've really enjoyed my time in Whole Foods Market. There have been a many great people to cross my path and help me along my journey. Many of these people were lovers of life and made it a very positive energy based environment.
good,"I was fired for attendance policy breach despite being one of the ""star"" employees, because home life was too complicated to strictly follow attendance policy and they left no room for compromise -- very difficult to sign up for FMLA despite other team members having qualified with the exact same circumstances as my situation (if I had been able to sign up for FMLA, I would still be working there)."
good,"Has been a great place to work for a long time, but regional roles are centralizing in Texas quite a bit.  They are feeling the pressure of competitors and responding by bringing in a lot of outside leadership from Target and more conventional retailers, which is making the environment much more traditionally corporate."
good,"If you basic have nothing else to do or you're in school, this place is for you. Benefits are great tho I can't lie. They're bomb.  No uniform so that's cool. As long as you maintain yourself and don't make too many friends , it'll be an easy place to get your coins."

good,"That is a good company with a service philosophy oriented ."
good,"Meat departments are grisly and uncomfortable. I would leave everyday with meat ground into my safeslip sneaker covers, and meat grease layer covering me. Nice coworkers and the work is not hard by any means. A lot of bureaucracy everything from clocking in, to break timing, bathroom breaks, and rules for employee behavior."
good,Enjoyed working here while going to school full time. Job was quite flexible with my study and class hours but wish pay was a bit more in order to cover cost of living.
good,Whole Foods is an excellent company to work for. In the past I had flexibility and ability to manage the Wine Dept. as needed to increase sales and satisfy the customer. Now the company is going more main stream grocery and corporate buying.
good,"There is no typical day at WFM, they like to change your schedule around at will if you are not one of the chosen."
good,"Learning about so many different things everyday is amazing.I now have access to healthier choices because its right there in front of me, it helped me change how I eat.I get to learn things from my team leaders who have been in this business for a while and enjoy it. The , many different beautiful people that come in give the place a natural feel.I'd say the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers but beside that most customers are great,I love asking them about things they buy and how they use them."
good,I enjoyed my time with this company and only left to pursue more of a home life with my new born and to explore other options in the work fields. The company does encourage you to move around and work at different stores. While there I opened up 3 stores  but worked at 4 spending about a year or a little over at each one. It was alot of fun and really sharpened my skills.
good,Work would be consistent and the people around the store were friendly and always welcoming. I learned a lot about working with different types of people and how to really be comfortable with providing customer service.
good,"Having to consistently help customers, supply product, work with management about new programs. Active place to work in, always moving. Fun and diverse group of team members. Hardest part of the job is maintaining sufficient work hours. Management tends to schedule less hours. Some customers are extremely specific, though most are pleasant. Best part of the job would be the fun atmosphere. Became good friends with those worked with."
good,"The job itself is simple. Ringing up customers and bagging their purchases. The hardest part is managing the frustrations of people when they cannot find their special products that meet their dietary needs. It's complicated and sometimes confusing because they'll try to namedrop other companies and as a person, you just want to roll your eyes."
good,Typical day at whole foods consists working in a team and helping customers. The management and culture is very laid back and make you feel very at home.

They have great benefits and hours.A typical day included me coming into work, pulling cake case spoilage and re-filling the cake case and grab and go before store opening at 8 a.m. I worked with one other cake decorator and we got along extremely well. The hardest part of my job was creating product in the kitchen and making sure there was product to sell in the cake case at the same time. I enjoyed being able to flex my creative muscle and work one on one with great people."
good,This job is a great. You learn a lot about you food your eating and making great fit choices. Lots of perks and benefits. Everyday is different and can have great challenges.
good,Worked as a chef in the prep foods department. It was a really fun place to work with great people. It was a bit stressful but overall a nice experience.

good,"Store Leadership is nice and a great leader. He would ask you if everything is ok and he offers his help all the time."
good,"A typical day at work is never typical it's always new and exciting due to the fact that we get all kinds of customers from around the world. It's always fun to learn new cultures and the things they consume on a daily basis, interesting. Management is great, although they seem to get over-whelmed when it's busy times. Co-workers are amazing and we all get along, like brothers and sisters. Hardest part of the job is learning new products you've never eaten, while trying to learn the benefits you receive from eating healthy food. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and people I work with on a daily basis."

good,"Working at Whole Foods Market was a great working experience. While at Whole Foods, I would come in be greeted by everyone with a smile and meet customers that not only remember me but also have conversions with. My co-workers were extremely friendly and my overall experience was fun. Even thought it was fun, I still had a lot to learn when I first started working at Whole Foods. I've learnt how to work under pressure, do my task efficiently, work with other team members from various departments, and always ready to help any customer to the best of my abilities. Sometimes our management team would ask if we want to work in other department whenever they are short on people, which helps us have experience in different departments such as prepare foods, bakery, whole body, juice bar, and produce."

They ask about the different ingredients in the products and where it comes from. Some of the items are weighed and priced. I learned about different products I didn't know about and how to weigh the items when the customers ask for them. Management was okay they worked with you whenever there was an issue that any employer had. However , you have to be careful and read the rule book because some managers don't follow the rules in the book. My co-workers were very friendly they train you if you did not know how to do something like how to weigh an item  correctly. There was no hard part working in Whole Foods Market just watch, listen, and learn and once I got the hang of it I was fine. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure all the customers were satisfied with their purchases."

Learned tons of information dealing with healthy eating habits, marketing skill ales and support, being project manager,  having a leadership  role on the team. Being able to be creative in your own way without trouble or displinary action. Making long time friendships with team members and customers on a huge diverse level."

Through my experience I have been able to learn how to manage a diverse background of people on my teams.  I love to develop and work with people and see them grow.
good,"I worked seasonally, but I found it to be no problem. The management was very understanding and willing to work with me to create a scheduled that we both liked.

I learned an extensive amount about leadership during my time with Wholefoods. I had a wonderful team. My proudest moments were watching team members I mentored get promoted. The most difficult part of the job was learning what can be done in a day and delegate tasks to the team."
good,"Cashier duties / bagging groceries / retrieving shopping carts from parking lot / sweeping every hour / filling out any logs that need to be done"
good,"I feel this is a new way to enjoy shopping and have fun with the services that Whole Foods provides, they are very customer service oriented and have a great benefits package offered to all employees."
good,I've been here  for 2 years and it was better when i first started. The work environment is awesome but the customers are terribly rude. What the leadership expects of you can be overwhelming at times but it pays off. Holidays are very stressful and they want you to suck up to customers at times.
good,Fun environment to work with along with great team members all around. Although a friendly work place productivity is very important along with completing goals. The best part of this job was working with my team members that felt like family but also creating great relationships with customers.

good,"A fast paced retail atmosphere with great focus on customer service and Team Member development. Whole Foods emphasizes the importance of educating its Team Members in the variety of products and programs within the company. An ""open door policy"" ensures that Team Members and management can maintain healthy communications promoting morale."
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods, especially Bellingham, MA. What ever food that is day before sell-by date is pulled and used in prepared foods. If it is inedible, it is gathered in compost, or given to local farmers for their animals. They also promote healthy life style. "
good,"Great culture, generally a great experience. Leadership can vary greatly. Some team leaders are great and inspire more from their workers, others don't recognize the work that their team members are doing. Frequently store team leaders can get a little too comfortable with their positions and only think about money that the store is making and not the well being of team members. Especially in stores that sell alcohol."
good,"My typical day of works starts with me ordering and receiving all product for the juice/coffee bar. After that I take over the coffee bar and spend my day keeping busy making drinks and prepping for the next shift. I have started many programs at the coffee bar including French Press, Holiday Smoothies, menu changes, and more. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a great, uplifting environment with people that I truly love to be around and work with."
good,A typical day at work at W.F.M wasn't always typical. Different people from all over the world would come visit the store. Since our store was the flagship store it brought us a lot of attention. I loved  interacting with all the different types of people. It helped me learn a lot about different cultures.
good,"Co-workers are fun to work with, management listens to you,  everyday is productive and hard work, and the environment is pleasant."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at WFM.  I made some great, lasting friendships, was paid fairly and learned so much."
good,"I found this company very professional and fun to work for. Would love to work for them again if given the chance, because the job can be for life."
good,My overall review is based on my 7-8 years employed there. For anyone interested in helping to make the world a healthier place should give this company a try.
good,"Best job I have had so far. Benefits were great, co-workers were great, and Team Leaders were very helpful for your success."
good,"I Started with wholefoods I the coffee juice bar, and moved my way up to bakery production, cakes, bread and pastries. "
good,"the environment is real welcoming, good vibes and it makes it real comfortable to work at. people are great to help you learn, and assisting each other is a daily practice so teamwork was a skill you naturally adapt too."
good,There are a lot of resources to grow. Many aspects of the food and beverage industry are available to be a part of. The involvement with the community is great and the experience they provide for the customers is what makes this place special.
good,"As I said in my last review, this company truly invests in employee growth. I gained merchandising, sales and marketing skills with this company as well as the opportunity to work with creative and intelligent people."
good,"although I needed to leave whole foods early on, I highly recommend applying to customer service if you A) care about your work B) are satisfied with $11/hr (MA) and C) have an open schedule that is flexible."
good,"This is one of the jobs I wished I never left but I was a dumb kid. The pay is higher then minimum wage not by much but still good and the raises were really good. You start off through the Agency with a 3 month probabation period in which each month you get a twenty five cent raise. Once you are hired in to the company you have another 3 months to prove to your fellow co-workers that you want to be part of the team afterwards the co-workers vote you in to stay and you get a fifty cents raise. Benefits were absolutely amazing. Never had to  pay to see a doctor or dentist. You recieve a whole foods card in which if you dont need any major work done medically the money builds up on the card and you can use it on anything medical i.e. vision, dental or health. As a Sanatation team member the work was easy and the days were short. Only bad part I would say was the somewhat demanding schedule."
good,"Family oriented workplace, focusing on quality and integrity of products sold."
good,Clock in and get straight to work. I was very serious when it came to working on the floor making sure I correctly greeted customers. I learned the basic from cashier (dealing with money) to bagging and making sure customers had a great experience shopping at the store. Management was spot on and co-workers were very polite and great to work with. Hardest part of the job I'll say was bagging groceries after checking them out all by myself. The most enjoyable was definitely the customers and the meeting we had at the end of every month.
good,Everyone is very nice and very easy to get along with. It is definitely an enjoyable experience working for a successful company like Whole Foods.
good,"We had goals to reach each day, cook from about 5-12 dishes in large quantities a day, clean the kitchen, prepare ingredients for the next day and so on. "
good,"greet customers heavy customer interaction, great supervisors, front face items,"
good,"Overall wonderful company to have worked for. Fast paced environment, wonderful people, great programs. I lead a team of over 100 in the customer service department. Responsible for hiring, training and education, customer relations, team member relations, correctives, regional programs, scheduling, financials, and labor."
good,"Working for WFM was great - my coworkers were a ton of fun, and so were most clients.  However, working with the public has its draw-backs and sometimes made for a challenging day.  On the whole, this was a great job but not where I'd like to make a career."
good,"whole foods market is a great place to work. awesome benefits, awesome management! It's a great work environment and the management does what they can to help you move up the ladder if that is where you intend to go!"
good,"I would order the daily dairy supplies and balance the account for the dairy department."
good,A typical day at Whole Foods would beginning from me getting my bank to start the day. Once I started it was up hill from there. I was a supervisor and was in control of about 10 crew members per shift. Working with management was very good because they had a lot of confidence in me and what i had to offer. I was fair and equal to all my co-workers and we had had some good times. The hardest part of my job was the Whole Foods does not believe in a set schedule but the most enjoyable part was being able to climb up the ranks and management showing me that they liked what i was doing.
good,"Cashier at a high volume and quality oriented grocery store, catering mostly to customers where the majority have a strong interest in making healthier lifestyle choices with the food and environmentally friendly products. I loved learning about healthier alternatives for nutrition, and the nonprofit foundations and charities that Whole Foods is involved with."
good,"A typical day at work for me was bagging groceries, ringing groceries up, helping customers with anything they needed help with (help to their car, help finding a product or tracking a product down), the day also included me restocking supplies, taking empty milk bottles and separating them for recycling. It was my first job so i'd say I learned quite a bit, I learned to trust new people, I learned to take charge or situations if there is no one there to handle the situation. Management wasn't the best, some of the managers played favorites and it was very noticeable to everyone, when it was brought up nothing was done, and every once in a while they ignored people availability. My co-workers were the best, their were some that slacked off but for the most part my co-workers are what got me through everyday, some of the best people I've ever met and I hope to come across more co-workers like them, I would have to say they were the main reason I kept coming back. I would have to say the hardest part was just having to deal with the playing of favorites and managers and supervisors pretty much picking the people they're going to be nice to for the day, some of the supervisors attitudes towards people could change with the snap of a finger. The most enjoyable part was just the people I worked with, it wasn't just one department of the store either, everyone that worked there was just so nice, they made it easier to come into work, the store was a great place too, we would have events where we would BBQ and raise money for different causes, have live bands come play, have employees"
good,"Cook, breakfast check emails, put out lunch, mantain hot bar, prep work if needed"
good,"At whole foods market we work as a team and we get our job done. We are a work place of different background culture,but very united ,we know how to work under pressure in holidays, and the busy days. In each department everyone is trusted to work on their own and expected to get the job done. Also we multitasks and know how to used our time very well. I really don't see any part of my job hard but take it as a great knowledge and challenge if it gets to be hard."
good,"I learned a lot about organic foods, just people in general, great company to work for"
good,"It's generally a very good place to work with good salary as far as retail goes. It's very laid back, but unfortunately can be TOO laid back, with employees rarely getting disciplined and only getting fired if they violate the company's incredibly lax attendance policy."
good,was very quiet and fun at the same time I was able to get a lot of work done plus overtime
good,"The environment was extremely positive as many employees, customers, and managers were always cheerful.  My team and I worked very hard together at creating a positive experience for anyone and everyone just as everyone else seemed to do the same.  The hardest part of the job remains to be working under pressure; certain times when you have more than 3 or 4 things that need to be done in such a short amount of time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling attached to collaborating with my team and overcoming the stress of all the rushed duties."
good,"I really enjoy the people I work with. Although demanding at times, management is very understanding an works with you. There is room for moving up in the company. Gain sharing is a HUGE plus. For a retail job you cant beat staring at 10 dollars an hour. I would recommend working at Whole Foods Market  to family and friends."
good,"A day working at Whole Foods is like going to work with your family...in a good way. Everyone is really nice, friendly, and helpful. Everyone wants one another to succeed."
good,"The best part of working here has always been the people this company attracts.  The coworkers and customers know this company to have the highest standards for their products, their community, and the environment."
good,"my typical day at work consist of handling money and supervising cashiers, i learned the in and outs of my management and sales, my co-workers are fun and very productive, the hardest part is to meet the sales of the previous day, the most enjoyable part is see each customer leave with a smile on their face"
good,Working at Whole Foods was amazing. The Staff in all departments are very friendly and the management is very accommodating. The worst part in my department was having to clean up after many rude and inconsiderate customers but the most enjoyable part was the atmosphere and vibe of the team.
good,"Clean department in timely matter.  I learned how to cut certain types  of meat such as chickens, steak etc. Friendly management and the hardest part of the job was clean the saw.  Helping the customers was the most enjoyable part."
good,"Great company to work with because they give alot of benefits and their value to bring good health to human beings is good."
good,Good company to work for will work with you to help you advance with in the company.
good,Good place to work when I was there. I work in the meat as a meat clerk the group of guys I work along side were good men we all got along with eachother and look out for eachother as a crew of team members.
good,"If I was not moving, I would be very happy staying at this location for many years to come. I met some of the most intelligent people I've ever come into contact with at this job. Management is caring, fair and respectful."
good,"Un-load arriving truck, stock warfehouse, stock fron-end, assist with customer service."
good,"Just making sure tasks, and projects are completed in a timely manner, receiving shipments in a timely order. Also being safe in a warehouse enviroment"
good,"A typical day at Whole Foods Market might involve stocking groceries depending on the load of the truck from that morning.  "
good,"I loved this job, while attending classes! It was fun to learn the produce codes. The company showed lots of thanks, often providing free lunch."
good,I mostly learned my cooking skill here at wholefoods. They gave me so much hours and good benefits to this store. I gained so much friends here coz they were nice. Hardest job that ive done here is when i worked as a dishwasher. It was cruel but i get used to it. I enjoyed working here coz most of the ppl in the store was really friendly and easy to talk with.
good,good working environment if you want to learn about organic products and learning how to healthy eating that is the place to go. Employees have a great knowledge on the products.
good,Fun place to work. They have alot of things going on for the team members. The employees ae fun to work with.
good,Typically i would start by receiving the produce shipment for the prepared foods dept. I would organize and stock all walk-in coolers and freezers. I would then place orders and request any credits from vendors via email/fax. I learned a lot about time management and also improved my organizational skills. Management was very busy at times and didn't really have a close relationship with staff. My co-workers were all pretty much down to earth and we were like a family in the prepared foods dept. Nothing was hard about my job as long as I stayed organized as i worked. Everyone around me always had positive energy so it was hard to ever have a bad day.
good,"Typically a great environment, freedom to run the department as you like, as long as you make sales. Great people with years of experience to learn and grow. Can be physical."
good,"Very busy, I learned more about food and being a good leader."
good,read e-mails go to floor wait on customers put product up check fpr special orders call customer let them know threre product is in.i learned alot about alternitive medicine for which i am very greatful for.i also learned alot about the earth and world that we live in and how important it is to take caref it.and to support our local farmers.oraganics and how much more nutrient dense they are and better they are for you.how important it is to eat real food.managment most of my managers were so great such great people.co- worker were wonderful i made life long friends there will never forget them.the hardest part of my job was i would say computer they didnt really help you with that alot.most enjoyable part was customers and my co workers.
good,A typical day at WFM come with a routine. Check in with leadership for the newest sales and specials following news from the company and then checking if adequate stock is available for customers and team members. Its a pleasant environment working with people you like. It could be difficult at time when dealing with customers about their complaints. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving great customer service and ensuring that the customer is satisfied with their orders and getting them a product that they need and doing whatever is required to satisfy a customer.
good,"the culture of this organization is far beyond what you'll find at a ""normal"" chain of grocery stores...the customers were cool and very informed about their purchases...the employees were among the smartest and brightest I've ever had the pleasure of working with"
good,"Helped customers with items and purchases when necessary, supervised accounting team to ensure all duties were performed well, paid store bills, archived prior years' data, and reconciled cashier tills."
good,I enjoyed working for WholeFoods. I learned a lot about healthy eating and protecting the environment. I truly wish to work there again. The atmosphere was very enlightening with various people from employees to upper management. After working a basic set schedule it was hard balancing my personal life once my schedule begin to alter. My best experience or enjoyment working there was the interaction with the guests and community services. I truly would like to return to working for the company.
good,come look over dept have meeting with supervisor so we all b on the same page laugh joke with co-workers hardest part of job was come up with gd reciepes for customers the customers was the most enjoyable part of the job fun and outgoing
good,"Fun place to work, I learned a lot about diffrent foods and organic products, its a nice friendly environment"
good,"Great company the walk the walk, they try very hard to stay true to core values and listen to the team."
good,"highly recommended, very diverse, great customer service"
good,A very exciting place to work! They really care about their employees and always made sure that we were their first priority. Co-Workers were very fun and it was always a great time.
good,"positive review, I had those attitude that is always positive. I had frequently a smile on my face and I can say, I really enjoy my job. it was the best experience I had."
good,"Overall there weren't a lot of things to not like about Whole Foods. Good pay, great coworkers and an overall great environment. Would still be working there if not for school and scheduling conflicts."
good,"The most important thing i would say is that i worked there before they were bought by Amazon, so whether or not its is as friendly and great a place to work could have changed after the acquisition."
good,The good thing is that there is always chance to grow and promote yourself for higher levels. The bad things is that customer opinion is a priority over all other issues
good,"From day one of starting my job there, everyone was extremely friendly toward me and welcomed me on as a new member of the team. The store manager would often come around during the day and ask how everything was going and how I was enjoying working there."
good,"The way that everyone makes you feel right at home and willing to help in anyway that they can is what made the job not feel so much as a job but as if it was just something to do after school, my favorite job to have had."
good,Working on the front end and cash office. ensuring people go on their breaks and the front is running smoothly. Helping costumers and team members with any issues that arise.
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work. I have been working for 15 years as a Vitamin Consultant/Cashier/Customer Service in Whole Body Department. I am currently working but would like to expand my horizons in different areas of customer service.
good,"Great company to work for if you like working, management understanding, flexible with hours”, co workers are awesome! A company you can go up the ladder career wise if willing to learn if dedicated"
good,"The culture at Whole Foods is amazing. Great first job, great job to hold during school, and great job if you want to work your way up to retail management. I only left because I needed a higher paying corporate job, and opportunities at Whole Foods corporate were limited."
good,"Treated their employees very well. When amazon bought out Whole Foods, the dynamic changed a tad, but overall still a great company! Was easy to make friends with employees and also the customers!"
good,Very tight team to work with and they give you plenty incentives to do a good job. Management was always being changed around but all my coworkers were good hardworking people. They’re pretty nice when stuff happens in life and you fall short of the mark.
good,"Try it out there are a bunch of different jobs within Whole Foods. For example I am a Production Cook in the Prep Food department, you can go from a Baker in the Bakery to a Cashier to some one in the seafood department and so on."
good,"This was my first job I ever had at, and I really could not have asked for a better one. The staff was friendly, hard working and fair, and I quickly was encultured by the people there. The pay was more than fair and management was understanding. I highly recommend working at Whole Foods Market!"
good,"You ring up customers for 6-7.5 hours total so you have to have a smile on your face for that long and be very attenuative, talkative, friendly, and responsive. Everyone I work with is great, but sometime the customers ask for crazy, unattainable, requests, which you have to answer honestly and with a smile."
good,"Got a new store manager and she wanted her hand picked team, never mind the success of your team. we never were on the same page and she was very controlling. She created a very hostile work experience. She replaced, all but two team leaders, too bad she ruined that store."
good,"I worked for whole foods part-time while i was finishing my bachelor's degree and it was a great environment to work in. I worked in the bakery department so I was always around fresh bread and cakes which did nothing for my waistline! My immediate supervisors were great. They worked side by side with you, and were helpful if you had questions about anything in the department. The store manager would provide lunch sometimes, there were store parties, holiday parties and staff appreciation week. You made ""time and a half"" if you worked on a holiday.There was always freebies available in the break room. You come to work on time, do your job, you won't have any problems. One of the easiest jobs I worked."
good,"I would help bag customers groceries if the store was low on carts I would have to go get carts from the parking area. On a hot day, I would get worn down pretty fast, but the managers would be understanding while I was able to cool down."
good,"Lovely, dedicated employees. However, I joined the team at the time Whole Foods became a susidary of Amazon.com - and moral was on a downward slide. Everyone (except the managers) was commenting about the empty shaelves and didn't know what to tell customers about the change-over. There was a ""party line"" of course but most of us felt uncomfortable with the evasion. But, overall, this was a lovely place to work. Because I'd spent most of my life in a non-profit situation, and Whole Foods is definitely a for-profit business, I never really felt I fit in all that well. But as far as a for-profit business goes, Whole Foods has a heart and soul, definitely."
good,"A typical day of working the front end of prepared foods at whole foods is fast-paced and busy. There is so much trust between employees and there is lots of teamwork to get the jobs needed done. Your shift really flies by because there is always something to be doing, whether it be helping customers and providing excellent customer service, cleaning, or prepping. "
good,co-workers aren't the brightest or hard working.  It makes it easy to stand out if you are willing to work for it.  A clear path was shown for easy upward mobility.
good,"Great place to learn new skills or enhance existing qualifications"
good,"One of those jobs you can easily do if you're in high school or college. Teammates are super nice and management is supportive. There are opportunities for growth, and you can even try out other departments and see which one you like best! The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers, especially when it's busy, but otherwise it's a pretty cool job just to make some money. And the benefits aren't too bad either."
good,"Cultivates a lot of positive coworkers and highly encourages moving up within business. Encourages professional growth. Personally had great experience with Management within the Northern Californian team, especially Marketing teams."
good,All WFM employees got a big raise to minimum 15$ per hour! The management is always looking for ways to help you succeed. You will be treated with respect from day one.
good,"Work hard,stay away from drama."
good,"Good opportunity to work in this company, very good place, friendly people not bad but can be better in more flexibility to growing on the company, 👍"
good,"Open, mid, and closing shifts. ability to work in multiple departments and really learn a lot about the store and products if you really want to. Not too much room for growth as positions are limited and the only way to get a higher position is if someone quits, gets fired, or moves departments. Every location is different so management isn't the same, but usually no problems discussing concerns with Team Leaders. Hardest part of the job is customers themselves, usually people who can afford it shop at WF so that usually comes with entitlement which can be very annoying... but then again you can get that in an place. Also, you have to be willing to work all the different shifts. its easy to talk with managers about schedules but they want you to close at least once a week if not more. The best part of this job was also the customers and coworkers. Although you meet some rude, entitled people, you also have the opportunity to really get to know regulars. additionally, coworkers are great!"
good,"Working at whole foods was an experience Ill never forget, the people customers and culture of the store taught me so much about food and sustainability. I thoroughly enjoyed becoming part of a team and not just another employee."
good,This workplace was super fun to work at. Employees are very nice and they are caring of others. I have learned a lot being there and I enjoy showing up there everyday.
good,"A typical day working Grocery at Whole Foods Market is helping customers and making sure they are taken care of first, stocking live load or back stock, or Facing. It can get busy and stressful especially during holidays which can be considered the worst thing about working there but that’s expected. Great working culture and the discounts are clutch."
good,"My review of Whole Foods is generally positive. The people I worked with were amazing and made the experience great. Even when we would be busy, or have to deal with difficult customers, I didn’t really mind because of the people around me. We were always having fun while still doing our job and I’m glad I had the opportunity to work with them"
good,I had a good time working for WFM.  The people I worked with were the best people I have ever worked with.  The management was top notch and were incredibly approchable no matter what the problem was.
good,Overall a good company to work and grow within if that's your'e goal . The company has changed the last couple of years but still a good place to work
good,"While highly competitive to get a job here, once a Team Member you will feel very welcome and like working at your WFM.  Being a college student, it is hard to balance class and work, but the Team Leaders and Members at Boca WFM really help you out with that. The hardest part is getting difficult customers, but that happens everywhere."
good,Great place to work. Plenty of room for advancement and really worked my way up in the company. Great company values and they really focus on their customer service
good,"The store managers were great for the most part. Often times they placed unreasonable expectations on employees.But in the end that were always understanding.  I worked hard everyday to achieve as much as possible, although there is never a time when everything could be finished, which caused a lot stress."
good,it was a really cool job. the management couldve been better but the people there were great. i was happy to work there and i wouldnt mind going back!
good,"I loved working at WF but beware of their seasonal positions. Depending on the store, they will hire and/or fire you. I just got unlucky I think. Would go back. I tried to when I relocated but getting in is competitive, even if you've worked there."
good,"Pre Amazon Whole Foods Market was a true team based company, clear communication, happy customers due to excellent customer service practices, valued input from team members, opportunities for growth"
good,"I work at WFM while I go to school, they always flex my schedule to meet my school hours, even when I change my restrictions every semester. It's a great place to have fun and meet people, but also requires hard work and attention to detail. It isn't your normal ""easy"" job, they've got a higher standard of work ethic, but it is still chill and you quickly make friends with customers and team members. If you work hard there's lots of opportunity for advancement, only the higher you get the more likely they may want to move you from store to store, but they provide training too. Because anyone can move up, sometimes there's incompetent management, but not always."
good,Whole foods always kept me busy. Good company. Working as a produce team member you must continue to restock shelves on sales floor CONSISTENTLY!!!  Must be physically fit for this position and must have a friendly demeanor with good customer service.
good,"-They really cared about developing leaders"
good,Friendly staff and good management and provided excellent workplace experience. The overall experience with customers was very friendly and it was a pleasure working there.
good,I really enjoy my time working at Whole Foods. The atmosphere is energetic and friendly. The team leaders are there to help at any time and want there to be a health work/life balance.
good,"Great People. Understanding Managers. Discounts on great food. Good workplace culture. Generous pay for the type of work. Only cons - No set days, work on holidays and weekends and a short lunch break."
good,Enjoy working at Whole Foods. Wish they had set weekly schedule and was paid weekly rather than Bi-weekly. The insurance is expensive with a very high deductible.
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods Market.  They hourly pay was fair and the environment was great due to the culture and history of the company.  Management was great but the hours and schedule were not consistant.  Overall, I would highly recommend working for Whole Foods Market."
good,"This was the best job I'd ever had. Over the years many things have changed, especially due to the Amazon take over. The pay and benefits are fair for the job."
good,"A good company to work for. "
good,"A worthwhile job for any young worker who is still trying to find their career field or for any individual who is trying to make a career in the grocery field."
good,I worked pre Amazon takeover it was an awesome chill job to have with a great culture. Amazon laid me off/marketing department. You had opportunities to move up or change stores.
good,"it was all about greeting customers, selling our products, informing our customers about our products and keeping our shelves stocked."
good,"I was in college and it was the perfect part time job for me. It was very easy, and the people were easygoing. Money is GREAT for a part-time gig! I heard the benefits are also great for full-time employees."
good,"I liked working there. I think the pay is pretty good, but the people are even better. They really care about the employees. I loved the culture and how the company really cares about its products."
good,"At my store we have a small team working as a big one. Every team member knows what to do without asking or complaining. Very nice team, Love it!!! Im glad to work here."
good,I enjoyed it. Paid well. Vacation was good. Previous manager was great and hard working. Discount was good as well as the culture of Whole Foods. Good.
good,"Lots of fun people with a firm knowledge of the health food industry. Store Leadership knew most employees on a first name basis. Leadership provided mentorship, good training, and opportunities for advancement"
good,A relaxed but driven place to work at. Every day there was a specific task to be taken care of. The culture at whole foods is what made it a place where you want to work at.
good,I like working for wholefoods because other employees from other departments will help out if needed or mini conversations that’ll help get through the day. Managment do try hard to maintain a friendly yet professional relationship with their supervisors and team members
good,Worked with a great team.  Was taught what I needed at the beginning and built off that through networking with other experienced workers.  We had a great manager who was fun to be around and always fair.  Did our best to make the work day productive but easier through teamwork.
good,"Whole Foods was a fun place to work! Back in the day, they used to give merit increases every 6 months, so it was easier to increase your wage. Paid Time off is excellent with this company. Benefits were as good as they can get (medical, dental, 401k, etc). It is retail, so you will be working nights and weekends. Also, management could care less if you are struggling at work."
good,A typical workday includes handling customers and preparing food for sale. Every single person in the store was a pleasure to work with and I have made alot of friends.
good,"Management is very supportive and lets you be creative with the job. Fun work culture as well."
good,"I would love to work for Whole Foods again some time in the future and I recommend it to workers who are looking for a great, BUSY environment with awesome benefits. My location was going through some major issues between management and staff. I tried to stick it out to help where I could, but my health was more important, so I had to leave after a herniated disc left me incapable to work for  some period of time."
good,I had great time worked for Whole Foods. The company have a great employee and good benefits. I will recommend to anyone who wants to work in a retail company.
good,It was a great work environment because of extremely enthusiastic workers and management that led with empathy and patience. I would recommend Whole Foods to anyone.
good,Great place to work if you're looking for a temp job. The people are very nice and the hours are flexable for students. A forward thinking and professional work place.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Whole Foods while I finished my bachelors degree. They were flexible with scheduling and hours were reasonable. I worked in both the meat department and customer service.
good,"Whole Foods Market is an excellent company.  The processes of hiring and advancement are unlike any I have ever seen in the food industry, although I had never worked for a grocer before WFM."
good,"I've had some of the best coworkers of my life at Whole Foods. Some of the hardest days of work in my life also. The day-to-day experience was super positive, but the support from corporate was non-existent and benefits were meager."
good,"World trade"
good,"Whole foods was a job I took right out of college.  While I knew going in that this would not be my forever home, I never felt excluded by management or other workers.  it was as positive as a retail environment could be"
good,"Loved the fast paced environment, where leadership was eager to teach and train new employees. Advancement within WFM was easily attainable with hard work and dedication."
good,It was a decent job. Got paid well and worked hours that were very convenient for me. They were very understanding of my school schedule and was able to work around it.
good,WFM is for the most part a great place to work. They offer great benefits and managers are friendly and care about people.Fun environment where employees are encouraged to be themselves.
good,I loved working their everything was fun and everyone got along the only thing that I didn't like was the fact that when I needed to change my scheduled that was very stressful
good,It's a fun place to work and also a great job to move up in. It is very diverse and friendly. Everyone treats each other with respect and acknowledge one another.
good,"Whole Foods Market has really only been in the twin cities for a little over 15 years and they set the industry standard in the grocery field. The work environment is second to none, I developed many life long relationships while working for whole foods. The compensation and benefits are absolutely top notch"
good,"Brooklyn wholefoods,"
good,Good place great friends i don't know much else to say. If you have good coworkers Whole foods is a blast but if oyu don't then don't be suprised its just like every other retail establishment
good,"Whole Foods is a great place to work if you're willing to actually do your work. They pay better than other grocery stores, but they expect  you to work harder in order to earn it. Things are changing some in the company since the Amazon buy-out, but overall still an enjoyable job."
good,Overall we stay busy and the day moves quickly.  The store is clean and they promote constant positivity.  The work is tough because we constantly move but the cc's help with alleviating some of that busyness.
good,i didnt have that much expoure here because i worked remote for most of the project so i had to only deal with the meetings and conference which were always very interesting
good,Fun work place fast paced helpful staff and helpful managers flexible hours a lot of benefits and easy to transfer from store to store or department to department
good,"I am able to develop my own routine day in and day out how I like it. I also enjoy being a buyer, allowing me to use my mathematical skills. I went from part-time to full-time in 2 months and then became a supervisor after 6 months of working here."
good,Work hard dont be late. 90 day probation period where your department team mates vote you in or not.........................................................
good,Company promoted employee involvement with department decisions and empowered employees to make decisions on a daily basis. Education and cross training opportunities make the company exciting.
good,I liked working for the company. Great opportunity for knowledge of products sold in stores. Relaxed place to work. Trying new products was always a treat.
good,"Fast paced."
good,"Whole Foods is a very caring company. I worked as a cashier and when it was extremely busy they tried to keep our spirits high by giving us water bottles and little treats to snack on. On special occasion (holidays, employee appreciation week) they would provide free food from outside vendors and on an average day they would provide fruit from inside the store. Most employees start at part-time but it was fairly simple to become full time after a while. When you become full time you're able to receive many benefits such as: 401k, health insurance, paid vacation time, etc. There was also a steady stream of customers in Whole Foods but nearing the holidays is when it became extremely hectic. I would have to say during the holidays and the incoming of a storm (snow storms, mostly) would have the store extremely busy but like I said,Whole Foods takes good care of their employees. If you need to step away while it's busy, they'll find someone to take your place. They'll give you water and small snacks to make sure you're not in danger of becoming sick and they'll make sure you have your breaks."
good,"The people are great, especially leadership."
good,"Whole foods market is a great place to start you entrance into the culinary world. Does not offer full cook duties such as at a restaurant but you do learn how to use various kitchen ulequipment and duties. They are a but strict on tardiness and call outs but really, where isn't?"
good,Great experience. I was trained at the registers. Everyone super friendly. It gets very busy so just be patient. Management are very helpful for scheduling & off days.
good,"This is a very cool company to work for.  I learned so much about how they give back.  The food they have here is great, and I loved the discount.  I had an amazing boss who was very understanding."
good,"Everything depends on what department you work in, each team functions differently.  My coworkers were the best; never got along with such a diverse group of people. Overall a great place to work."
good,"Very understanding place to work at, team members are willing to work as a team and not just alone. I learned how to explain more about an product i barley had knowledge over of when i first started"
good,I won't say I never get frustrated at my job at Whole Foods but this is the best job I've ever had. The training is ridiculously good. It almost feels like a joke sometimes how good these people train you. I actually had no clue I was well trained until one day I was running my station alone and I realized I knew %90 of what I needed to know and that was my second week into the job. If you want room for advancement and benefits just look up what Whole Foods offers. They're so good to us as employees.
good,i would have to say that my biggest criticism of the position is working for a company that doesnt fully understand what you do as graphic designer. outside of that if have to say that it was positive work experience.
good,I have only held two retail jobs since getting into the workforce. Whole Foods Market was definitely my favorite of the two. The culture and people make the entire experience worth it.
good,The only reason you'll get fired here is if you're late/attendance or you treat customers wrong. The moral is very high and people take pride in their work at whole foods. The most enjoyable part is learning about your the differences in food and trying new things. The hardest part for some people might be there strictness in organization. Management are leaders not bosses and that's important.
good,Whole Foods was an excellent company to work for. I would still be there if a better opportunity didn't arise. The culture has a college type of atmosphere.The customers were great and very knowledgeble
good,"Its a hectic workday because the amount of customers Whole foods normally get, but almost everyone is friendly. I had more nice customers than bad. The latest I ever got off of work was 10:30 p.m because they close at 10. Overall I loved working there."
good,There really isn't much to say here.  I really liked working at Whole Foods.  Always enjoyed meeting and interacting with the customers and seeing what new food items are in.
good,You can easily grow within the company. Really laid back as long has you handle your job duties. All the employees are pretty much happy & Upper management usually 100% honest. Not to much bs
good,"Topical day includes preparing great healthy foods for guests and learning from them. The wholefoods culture is inspiring and hardworking. The best part of the job is satisfying the guests, that being said the worse part is when there is person who has somehow had a bad experience."
good,The give great benefits. its a great place to work and be yourself. Pay is decent and employees are friendly. Very good place to lean and grow within the company.
good,"Nice place to work with lot of growth opportunities and work benefits too."
good,"Been working for this company for many years now and although a lot has changed, they are still one of the best companies to work for. They are fair in wage and flexible with your hours."
good,Whole Foods Market takes care of their employees through pay and benefits and general respect for them.  Management has high expectations from its employees but not unreasonable expectations.
good,I would clock in and greet everyone in my department. Start with a walk through of department to have an idea of what to fill up and stock if products are low. Management was freindly and very willing to work with you. The culture was rich and people loved to make sure our products were organic and fresh as can be. The only thing i can say it was very enjoyable working with so many great employees and helping customers find and get what they were looking for.
good,"Working as a cashier, you have to be able to handle working in a fast paced environment. WFM emphasis the importance of providing the best service to our customers and educating them on sustainable organic food options. However, management at this certain location was terrible and job retention was low. Be aware."
good,"If nothing else, Whole Foods has presented itself as an interesting alternative world in terms of food quality, proper sourcing and the entire culture of farm-to-table that has become explosively popular."
good,"I have been with this company a few years, and i got to say the people who work here are amazing. They are, for the most part, hard working and very kind people. They make coming to work something you look forward to."
good,Loved working for WFM--sadly I was laid off. I would love to apply again should the right position come up. The hardest part of the job was working nights and weekends but when you have a job you love you won't mind the schedule.
good,I  love working with Whole Foods the team members are awesome and fair and the fact that there's opportunities within the company to grow is very refreshing.
good,"In wholefoods market, there are plenty of oppurtunity to grow within the store.You can even become store manager within 5 years if you are a dedicated worker. great people, great vibes. As an employee, there is never a dull moment inside of wholefoods market."
good,"Despite only working there for 3 months, it was a very welcoming environment with amazing benefits, the best I've ever received from a job. The coworkers I had were very friendly, and it's a very positive environment."
good,"Fun environment to work with, there is a lot of diversity and the pay is decent for what your duties are. There is room to grow within the company. Liked working there."
good,"it sucks the managers are not the best."
good,"It is a very positive environment. The employees are very nice, management listens to the employees. It is more like a team than just individuals. It get very busy but is not overwhelming"
good,"I have learned to be a very good multi-tasker at work . Not only how to handle customers orders ,yet how to manage that while also creating there desired drinks with a smile on my face and to keep it together under pressure. Hardest part about my Job is sometimes you cant please everyone ,yet you can dry hard to to your best to make sure each guest leaves happy. I enjoy my repeat customers who know that I have memorized there drink order and do consistently good job ."
good,"Team leaders greet us before our shifts start and wish us a good day at work, lets us know what needs to be done. Gives us our assignments."
good,"i learned a lot about leadership and how to communicate better.Hard work pays off, i made good friends with co worker after i lifted"
good,"A Good place to work with many people from around the world. it was a good experience for me ,I learned a lot of new things. i like this place"
good,"Great work place,"
good,"Prepared hoot food and maintaining hot bar."
good,"They want you to belong to them, mostly if you are full time, that is why they have such good benefits. Overall good company culture, unfortunately not everybody follows it. Best department to work: Whole Body. Worst, Prepared Foods."
good,"Whole Foods was an overall enjoyable place to work. Fun people, solid benefits, and rarely a dull moment. Unfortunately the only location is on 280 however and the commute to work can be unpredictable due to traffic."
good,"As a customer service associate, a typical day at work would include: doing a produce walk to see what produce is currently available (organic, conventional) and to see what they are priced for the day. This will help you as a cashier to know what produce we currently have and what price they should ring up for. This is followed by providing friendly and helpful customer service. Management is for the most part fair and helpful, bringing the team together to reach goals and standards."
good,"The pay is great, management is friendly and takes time to get to know you. The people are very nice in whole foods, down to earth. Cheery environment. Management seems to be overly strict on things that seem very unimportant."
good,whole foods provided a place of growth and knowledge need for building leaders for tomorrow. they prepare you with classes and mentors that will guide you into a better and stronger you
good,Great company to work for especially if you can bike to work as the parking leaves a little to be desired. You can also get a discount to save money when buying groceries.
good,Job training is great and ongoing. Advancement opportunities are always available if you so choose. Benefits are well above average standards.
good,"Fun place to work, everyone was real friendly. However it is a very competitive atmosphere. Also lack of in store security was bad, customers would steal and get a away with it."
good,"It has been a privilege working for Whole Foods Market for 8 years, their belief in their mission, compassion for their employees, and outreach to their communities have been second to none."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work while gaining lots of customer service experience. The job culture is great, encouraging team work and team member happiness. A typical day at work consists of providing customer service and handling payments. management is great and always supportive while discussing one-on-one where there is need for improvement. The most enjoyable part of the job is enjoying the experience of the laid back, fun atmosphere of whole foods."
good,Fantastic place to work. Wonderful management who are supportive in your need for advancement. Co-workers can easily become new and long time friends.
good,"suitable job environment. all necessary means prepared by the administration to make workers have satisfaction. organization of monthly meeting to assess the performance of employees and reward them for their great job offering them bonuses, gift cards..."
good,"every day working at whole foods you went in knowing you were going to be berated for something you had no control over, but it was completely worth it. customers are disrespectful, and usually overbearing, but the co-workers are AMAZING. best people work there, worst people shop there."
good,"Fast-Paced Work Environment, Good Leadership. Breeds Self-Motivation. If you are motivated and persistent in becoming a leader this company is great for that. Very Good Pay in its Field."
good,My responsibility begins with setting up the display case that showcases food that is prepared daily. Organization plays an important role when performing this duty. My co-workers all know that they can talk to me or give me constructive criticism without me getting an attitude. We all strive to be the best we can for the customers that we serve daily. I love seeing a customer happy when they sample a product then make a purchase.
good,"Interacting with guest, production, unloading pallets of product, cutting various meats, setting up case, daily safety meetings."
good,"Even though we were a small store, we were quite busy. But the people working right there beside you, were the most patient, sweet, and helpful people I've ever met. One of the only jobs I've worked where everyone I worked with were my friends that I hung out with after work, all the time. Not only that, but the advancement opportunities are wonderful. They even created a position just for me!"
good,"The people there were like a second family to me."
good,"Whole Foods is a great employer and they offer great benefits for full tie workers. All of the locations are in very chic, safe , and diverse neighborhoods and the energy in the store is always cool. Many different departments and many different people to go to and learn from. Also a great place to move up in the company and grow. The compensation is pretty good and they work well with your schedule."
good,"My day would start off by checking with my team in the department insuring we are organized and ready for business every morning. I would then check-in with whoever is in charge of the store to make them aware of my presence, followed by my daily duties. I learned that being a good leader you have to lead by example. The communication with the management team was very open and direct. My co-workers maintained fun and creative environment to work in. I think the hardest part of my job was seeing the people I promoted leave after establishing a great relationship with them. The most enjoyable part of my job was keeping a high moral with my team and helping people."
good,"Customers are friendly, always busy and I learned that smiling can always brighten someones day. My co-workers were team players who work hard and nice to work with. Most enjoyable part is interacting and engaging with different customers. Hardest part would be days where I stand for a long period of time, I like to move around and get busy."
good,"The company as whole is amazing. They share their amazing values not only with their, employees, and customers but the community as well. Management is trained to not only nurture their team members, but give them the tools to grow within the company. Everything is trail and error, but eventually through all the knowledge attained from working here, it will preapare anyone to whites ahead. Whether ones passion is grocery, natural medicines, butcher, seafood, vegan foods, organic, or culinary, whole foods has an area for all."
good,"servicing customers "
good,"Great place to work if you like your job. One of the best retail grocery jobs around. Some of the company guidelines and procedures are stupid but its worth the money."
good,Whole Foods foundation leads the workers to become more involved with a better lifestyle. I was in charge of creating a daily production list and helping other team members. The job can be challenging due to the under staff department but everyday. Customer service was a great deal and at the end of the day it was satisfying knowing that you helped someone with something so small as a smile.
good,"I enjoyed my nine plus years with this company. In addition to its commitment to providing customer service and stimulate team morals, the company is very concerned about the global community and the environment."
good,Whole Foods accepts you for who you are. If you have tattoos or look like a freak or a hippie but have a passion for nature or helping out and nice they will hire you.
good,"Everyone has specific duties and stations. It is hard to manage two jobs if this is one of them, schedules are posted Thursdays before next work week so it is hard to plan ahead for other jobs. Employees are nice and fun to be around. Management and communication needs work."
good,A typical day at work includes preparing beginning banks for 30+ team members. Reconciling cash from previous days and any paper work from cashier. Preparing bank deposits and completing internal reports used for auditing purposes.
good,Fun place to work. The day goes by really fast and the people who work along side you are some of the nicest people.
good,I have learned so much about eating healthy while working here.  I love the people I work with.
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at work.  Each day brings new challenges and opportunities to develop our skills as a leader.  I am empowered to make my own decisions and challenge my superiors. I work with some of the most interesting people that have made me a more well rounded person and leader. I have a lot of respect for the company leadership because I have their support,and I also get honest and timely feedback on my performance. The hardest part of my job is the varying shifts I work. And, the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to interact with our customers."
good,This company provides ample opportunity for anyone to succeed. Overall great company.
good,"very good benefit , discount card , pay care ,gain sharing , paid time off , holiday ."
good,"Typical day at work starts with opening duties, lots of cleaning, and lots of restocking. Learned more about nature and organic/ healthy lifestyle choices. Management, depending on the store/department, varied from understanding to dismissive. The co-workers are always fun to be around and very motivating. Hardest part of the job was trying to balance lunch breaks and meeting short deadlines. Although, crunch time quickly begins to be the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,fun and local food in a hip grocery store specializing in organic food.  There is a big team to supervise and always a lot of things going on.  We are a big and busy store and we help thousands of people every day.
good,"Working with a company that strives to not only improve its interior business model but improve every aspect of the community in which it comes into contact. Creating organizations such as Whole Planet Foundation, working towards a sustainable practice to end poverty, Whole Kids Foundation, educating students and teachers the importance of healthy eating as well as providing gardens to local schools, Green Mission, supporting recycling and composting efforts available to the community at every store, lastly the obvious organic products that support our environment through sustainable and eco-friendly farming techniques absent of harsh chemicals."
good,They offer a lot of opportunities and they start pay isn't so bad. Working on a team is what makes it all the better.
good,Whole Foods Market has been selected for one of the Best Workplaces for 17 years running.
good,make machines apart and clean its then put it on back.....I got lot of skills from this job
good,"Whole Foods Market was an amazing company to work with. From the very beginning, when the store was just opening, the staff was friendly and because 99% of us were new to the company we all jumped right in to getting to know each other. While working with the company I've learned how to properly assist customers. I have also learned to be myself with the customers and build genuine relationships with them. The company helped me grow as and individual due to having my reviews with my boss. He managed to tap into my emotions as a human being and not just an employee. This helped my job performance and confidence to sky rocket. The management was super supportive of the staff when it came to company decisions or just every day life decisions. The best part of working at this company was seeing loyal customers come in every day and leave completely satisfied with their shopping experience."
good,"It's always a different experience at Whole Foods. You will work with different people, interact with different customers, and be called on to perform various tasks out of the blue. By and large, the Team Members (we call each other ""Team Members"" instead of employees) come from all different walks of life and each one has an interesting story to tell. Some are teachers by day, some are between jobs, some are in school, some are artists, and some are foodies."
good,early mornings with great team ready and willing to work. I learned alot about how to handle customer service situations and also learned how many diffrent recipes and food prep. My managers were great and co workers were too we all came together to form a great team. The most enjoyable part of my job was the work atmosphere we had fun n did a great job while having a good time.
good,"The hardest part of the job is getting used to the fast pace of the store and the high quality of service that is expected. However, the atmosphere is generally one of team work, sincerity, positivity and encouragement of growth and life/work balance. All of the supervisors are genuine and caring. WFM encourages promotion from within. The starting pay is decent and you can expect regular opportunity for raises."
good,".Everyday I come in to prepare food,serve     customers behind the counter and do catering helping each other out ,to get things done. Before the end of my shift clean up."
good,"i have not fix schedule "
good,Great people work at whole foods market. The customers at WFM were awesome for the most part. Learned about making healthier food choices. Baked a lot of cakes bread and pastries. Made tons of gelato coffee drinks and tea. Trained others on how to supervise and maintain the coffee bar. 
good,"Working at Whole Foods is like no other job I have ever worked. The staff is so welcoming, it is a relaxed atmosphere and they enjoy bringing out the best in people. Some of the rules and policies are an inconvenience and are not consistently followed through but that becomes something to become used to. They promote healthy living to team members."
good,Daily challenges are always keeping the customer happy. Second will be keeping the team members happy. there is always work to be done and it is a great environment to be creative.
good,I enjoyed the experience of the culture of the work place! They based the customers happiness around the happiness of the team members. A happy team member makes a happy customer. WFM was about saving the environment and doing things to create profit and growth without loosing its Core Values :-)
good,"Same duties every day, fill the case and answer any customer questions. Learned something new every day about the items and how they are good for you. The Hardest part of the job was towards the end of the night when i to make sure everything was nice and net for the next shift. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers because they thought me a lot about things."
good,Every day with different challenge
good,Grerat place to work and a lot of possibilities to move up in the company. They educate you about food and the industry really well.
good,"I began working for Whole Foods right out of college, and it's been a great experience for me. The company creates a sort of flat hierarchy where there is a lot of interaction between ordinary team members and team/ store leadership. Team members are encouraged to contribute their ideas and input and the result is a fluid workplace that's constantly changing."
good,"Working with WholeFoods Market was a good experience for me. I came to work on time. I enjoyed working with other employee's, Supervisors. My biggest Challenge was pleasing the customers although it was not a very hard thing for me to do because of my personality, however their were some who were unbearable.The best part of my job was learning about new prouducts and sharing them with the customers.One thing that I learned on the job was patience."
good,Highly proficient staff trained to deal well in high profile customer relations.
good,At the beginning of a shift you clock in and go to the floor where you recieve a money till from the floor supervisor. You count your till in and sign for it. The floor supervisor gives you a register to work at and you stay at that register until break time when some one comes to releive you. I love my co-workers. It is a fun envionment to work in. The hardest part of the job is having an angry customer but the most enjoyable overall is all the favorite customers who come through my line to speak and catch up. I love it!
good,Whole foods extreme opportunity to grow within the company an to learn or create you leadrship style
good,"A typical day is lines, lines, lines with some wonderful regulars and some difficult waiting for their coffee beverages. Management always a call away to come assist with customers or if you just have an issue. Co-workers were very helpful and kind in and out of work. The hardest part of the job was leaving. I truly enjoyed that job. Most enjoyable part of the job was having regulars ask for me personally to make a specific drink for them."
good,"Typically bussy during weekends and week days normally slow,thats when i get to know my coworkers better and i would say thats the funnest part of the job"
good,"Bakery Department, preparing, baking, packaging, pricing, and merchandising cakes, pies, rolls, muffins, breads and other baked goods. They inform customers about our bakery products and services and often ask customers to try samples of bakery products as a way to increase sales. They work with equipment like ovens, proofers and frequently use store intercoms to announce promotions and weekly specials."
good,"A day of work at Whole Foods is fast paced. Being knowledgeable about products while juggling customers and keeping products stocked is hard but rewarding work. You gain not only great knowledge from the trainings and information at your disposal, but the management offer a great deal of help when trying to move up in the company."
good,This is a great place to work the benefits are great pay starts at $15 a hour and u get a 20% employee discount it really is like a family only downside is they arent very flexible with schedules when it comes to people with kids or family emergencies
good,"Out of all the jobs I've worked, this one has presented the best overall opportunity to establish a career and grow within the company. This is helped by supportive management and consistent changes to the core of the company. The diverse background of the team members allows the chance to learn from each other and establish positive work relationships. What makes working at this company stand out is the mixing of two different corporations; Amazon co-owns Whole Foods and together they collaborate to implement updates to the regulations and positions offered at the store. It can be a bit challenging bridging the gap between the two in the eyes of the customers but that just creates an opportunity for us to educate and for them to learn. At Whole Foods, you get a well rounded experience that will give you skills to carry with you through whatever career path you follow."
good,"Retail is a fast paced, stressful environment. At Whole Foods Market, you assist many guests from all walks of life with very specific needs/dietary concern. You gain knowledge of current diet and health trends, and also educate yourself on food quality."
good,"Learned a lot being at whole foods.I also grew as a person , learning teamwork and great communication skill. I also built great friendships with coworks"
good,Had a blast it was a great job. I liked the lot and got the opportunity to prove my skills. The people are great you had a nice environment and bonuses for motivation
good,"The job was stocking beer, wine, cheese, coffee, and chocolates. Learning the differences in terroir. Working with a cheesemonger. I enjoyed my staff thoroughly and would be glad to work there again. The staff were all friendly and nice. Management was fun and thorough with training."
good,"Working for Whole Foods has been pretty exciting. Everyone there is pretty content with their positions and pretty competent and helpful for the most part. Their core values and beliefs are pretty straight forward and they do a fantastic job implementing them. The workplace culture really emphasizes on safety and customer service/appreciation. Management was a bit shaky/lacking when I first arrived but with the introduction of new team leaders things are looking a lot more hopeful. My only real complaint is that at times it feels really stressful due to the lack of team members; e.g., callouts, attendance."
good,"In the future I will complete a full review of the position. The hours were flexible, the job could be physically demanding at time, and there was a lot of face-to-face customer interaction."
good,"WFM work was a great place to work in,very friendly staff, lot of fun, lot of surprises and lot of promotion to the team member, no discrimination, the starting rate is higher among the other stores with similar job. the store TL and the supervisors were very great and respectful"
good,"Working at whole foods market was a great experience , the work atmosphere was amazing . Everyone was more than happy to help in tasks and some of the best management I've ever had as an employer . It's like a big family where everyone is helping each other ."
good,"On a daily basis I worked the booth and/or register. Working the booth included giving what we called 10's and 11's to each register, which was picking up and loaning money. Processed returns, exchanges and handled spoilage. Towing lines, keeping the front end clean and organized to help the next shift team members."
good,"I really like how supportive they are with team members."
good,"A typical day at Wholefoods Market, I would come in and set up the display case before the store opens. I've learned different types of items around the store. Management was beyond exceptions, handled every situation with proper manner. Workplace culture had a uplifting vibe, everyone did what they had to do with good judgement. Hardest part of the job was to keep updating inventory to make sure not to overstock on items. The thing i mostly enjoyed about that job is learning the different types of seafood."
good,Very good company to work for. Lots of opportunity for advancement and self growth. Benifits are really good and it’s a very team oriented place to work.
good,"The job is great overall, great benefits, customers, and team members. It is flexible and gives great benefits and creates great opportunities. Anyone can speak up and everyone is an equal with the opportunity to level up and grow with the company. My only complaint is they are not flexible with switching shifts. You must have a very legitimate reason to switch shifts or they will not allow it. Even if you never switch  shifts it has to be so that there is basically no way of you possibly making it in to work that day. Very inflexible in that regard; however, great in all other aspects."
good,Working at WFM was great. I was able to learn a lot about things that weren't necessarily in my wheelhouse. I loved the mission of the company. Overall a great experience.
good,"Good company if the Dept. Management is good. It's hit or miss, when I worked at the flagship in downtown Austin, it was amazing! When I worked in Bee Cave it was after the large company wide layoff, they were running lean ie. minimal labor while hiring inexperienced people to run the Market. It was rife with disorganization in my opinion."
good,"Great customers, also a great environment with coworkers. We dealt with supervisors most of the time. Manager was never really on the floor while we worked."
good,"I worked in Southern California. Great job environment but towards the end more work with less help. The pace varied so must be willing to work. People shouldn't whine about having to pick up the pace, at times. But coverage was questionable in some areas. Leaders tried different approaches though, it didn't go unnoticed. I had a stroke so had to leave. Or I'd still be there. I fortunately was on the advancement track through recognition of my hard work and growing acquired knowledge. Was feeling more corporate when I left. Even though it does great community and global works, people should remember its a business and will act accordingly."
good,"Inclusive in decision making "
good,A typical day at work starts with a smile from your superviser in a fast-pace enviroment. The companu offers a program for growth within the company and extends it to all who are interested.
good,"I enjoyed working at Whole Foods because a majority of employees were welcoming and helpful. Working at Whole Foods has its perks (discounts, pay) but you have to remember that people who shop here expect excellent customer service and are not afraid to complain. Overall, I would recommend this job if you have worked in customer service before and enjoy being a part of an organization that promotes healthy eating."
good,It was good place to work they cared about theirs workers and really took the initiative to get to know us so we can have a better work space. I would recommend this job to someone.
good,"it's in overall a nice place to work . The leadership is on point. The team work is also valuable. It's one of the rares places where part-timers with 20 hours a week have health benefits, vision and dental."
good,"I worked there for five years. Best job experience of my life. I started from the bottom and was working my way up. Good people, great customers. I have nothing bad to say about it as a whole=)"
good,A typical day at work was having to help multiple customers in an effective way that does not wear you out. I learned a lot because I had a very helpful team.  Workplace culture was pretty relaxed. The hardest part was inventory. The most enjoyable part is the bond you create with your team. It makes the fast-pace environment  seem like nothing.
good,"As a cashier at Whole Foods I sold customers the finest quality products available, offered ice to keep cold items cold. I performed admirably in our donation drives consistently asking every customer to donate a dollar to our foundations. I without complaint retrieved cart from the parking lot in pouring rain, 18 degree days and 106 degree days. I tirelessly pushed and pushed carts sometimes for 4 hours without stop. I have boundless energy and enthusiasm."
good,"Really enjoyable place to work! Most of my co-workers were cool and it kinda starts to feel like a little family. A hard and honest days work, always came home satisfied."
good,In my department the Meat/Seafood department.  Its a well really rough days.  I did learn to help anyone that needs help.  They try to make the work culture stress-free.  The hardest part of my job was i felt like i did all the work.  The most enjoyable part was I made a lot of friends.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods, met a lot of decent people and learned a lot about cooking, stock, receiving, and customer service."
good,"This was a great work experience due to the fact that all the team members that I interacted with were focused on their own jobs, but would go out of their way to assist with any problems that I encountered."
good,"contracted during buy out"
good,"The pay is great, its a positive kitchen environment, which can be hard to find elsewhere. But I felt that I didn't have much of my own input in my work and I wished there was more room for creativity in the work place."
good,fast paced work place. you will get to know new people. There employee and stuff is friendly and fun. It is just a little difficult to work full time in this place.
good,"I loved working here. Management always went above and beyond for employees. Meetings were always conducted for any changes, complaints and concerns anyone had. Also raffles were held and prizes were handed out to keep employees engaged. They also worked around your schedule, specially if you are attending school or have other priorities in life. It does tend to get busy at peak hours, which I didn't mind because I love working in a fast paced environment."
good,"I worked at Whole Foods Market in Toronto for 6 years and had the time of my life.  My co-workers were like family to me.  The work load was heavy with labour cuts, which was eventually why I left the company.  Overall I have no regrets and would recommend this job to people who want to work hard and have a good time doing it."
good,"Over all work at Whole Foods is good, they take care of their employees.  overall fair pay and relatively steady raises as long as team member follows company standards and does receive any warnings or write ups."
good,"shifts can feel repetitive and customers can be quite rude at times, co workers treat you  like family and are very genuine. sometimes the managers have problems equally diving hours for example, wek 1. employee a; 16 hours' employee b; 16 hours, employee c; 40 hours week two, same, week three, same week four, employee a 48 hours; employee b 16, employee c only 8. all employees are part time and no explanation as to why the hours are divided this way, not performance based or availability. this is really my only complaint about this job other than that it is the best job i think i could ever ask for it doesn't even feel like work, you will regularly see employees hang out outside of work and even old employees pop into the job to say hi."
good,"low stress job. lots of opportunity for advancement, and relocation. a fun working environment if you like the people you work with. flexible hours and PTO."
good,whole food was like my second family. it was a new experience and new knowledge.  i loved seeing the new faces that came through those doors. Learning about the organic foods and none gmo it was cool.
good,"I loved it at the time! But the deeper I got the more I realized the Culture varied by team and leader. I had a really amazing one, so the mediocre ones weren't worth it."
good,"I have nothing negative to say about working at Whole Foods Market. Whether if your a foodie, health guru or just looking for extra income the work environment is like a second family away from home. everyone works hard to see each other succeed and ensuring that we give our customers and awesome shopping experience."
good,"Though the environment at Whole Foods is fast-paced, my co-workers create a fun environment to be a part of. Everyone is friendly and there is a wealth of knowledge about food and health within the store. I enjoy getting to work making pizza, as well as the responsibility and physical labor of unloading incoming shipments from trucks throughout the week. There is also a great emphasis on work/life balance, and the pay is great as well!"
good,"I enjoy working there because I am a foodie. Interacting with customers and sharing my knowledge of food while learning from the customers is most enjoyable. I am also able to work in the "
good,the hardest part was dealing with customers because they often were very rude and thought they were better than the worker. besides this whole foods is a great place
good,"I really enjoyed my 14yrs with WF, I left in the peak of my career because unfortunately my leaders would not allow me to have a flexible schedule"
good,"Great pay, benefits and an overall fun and relaxed environment... Whole Foods has suited me well with my personality and management style. i will definitely miss this wonderful place."
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work they take care of their employees I will end up with knee replacement surgery and they took care of my medical bills and welcome me back with open arms they have what they called game sharing so much of sales is put into a bank and at the end of the month everybody gets an additional check they take care of their people and the job is always fun I worked in the seafood department which could be very stressful especially during the holidays but we always had fun and enjoyed ourselves when it work

good,Everyone there is nice and you learn alot about different organic food items. It fluctuates between faced pace and slow pace environment. Benefits are great and you get a discount
good,I work as a cashier and though working with customers can be challenging it can also be a lot of fun to get to know people who come through my line on a regular basis. The team I work with is great and I really appreciate the support I receive from the supervisors and team leader.
good,"This is a great place to work. Pay is fair. Customers are self-entitled but that comes with the territory. Managers tend to have favorites and seemed stressed all the time. Over time it can have an impact. The people I worked with are great but if you're not with the IN crowd, you can feel a bit alienated. Also the scheduling was really bad. You could request off months in advance and still be denied. Plus people kept quitting leaving the store constantly short-handed. Its a very customer-service oriented job so an influx of people at one time isn't good for someone like me with social anxiety. I worked here part-time; this job gave me the funds to go after the career I really wanted."
good,a good work day is having products you need though out your work day and I have learn a lot about different fruits and veggies and there use to the body and ways that the help.  to me my manager was great and every day to earth and willing to help out in anyway and get dirty with you.  the hardest part of my job was some getting to work. I just enjoyed that job a lot
good,"i learned how to flay fish clean fish butterfly fish and how to cook saute fish and to cook fish. Whole foods was a great environment for me to grow as an employee. I even learned how to properly identify many types of fish and seafood, and even cook them properly."
good,"Great if given proper training. You must always be active because sometimes,customers will come in a groups and can get very busy. It is a very fun place if everyone works together right."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with. Workplace culture was very much about the alternative lifestyles and living healthy. Eating good food and pleasing the customer no matter what. While we believed very much in pleasing the customer management was not afraid to stand up for their employees if someone was being notoriously difficult and rude.
good,I loved my coworkers they we really were the like a small family they made the workplace very fun to work in. Sometimes customers in this store can be a lot to handle but having a good support system made difficult situations very easy.
good,The management was awesome they take the time to listen to your problems. great place to grow.  would work here again. really recommend this company to everyone
good,"Whole foods market is a great place to work for.  Whole foods market  cares about its clients  and employees. Very nice, kind and help full  staffs.  They provide the best foods."
good,"Typical day at Wild Oats Market began with early deposit preparation, and set up tills and opened store. Ran customer service desk as well as front end registers. Handled all customer concerns and staff hiring and reviews,also a go to manager for staff. A typical day at Whole Foods consisted of early morning set up of the bakery.

good,"While working here I've learned so much about different types of food, some which I had never even heard about before. Management and staff are super helpful and friendly. This is overall a great place to work !"
good,"The employees are all fantastic to work with, management included. Teams are often spread thin so as soon as your shift starts you have to keep a fast pace. Customers are overall incredibly nice, but have very high expectations of team members."
good,"Very good place to work. Very limited advancement in the maintenance sector. I very much enjoyed about learning dietary restrictions, how to feel like a chef using proper seasoning techniques, Working within a culturally diverse group,assisted my appreciation of lifestyles, and the great multitude of unique individuals on our great planet."
good,"In grocery, most days are filling stock, helping answer customer questions, walking customers to products, and maintaining the look of the store. It can be very fast paced as popular items sell out extremely fast, and you have to be ready to fill a hole. Depending on your shift, you may be more focused on throwing load which will involve a lot of lifting and carrying, or restocking shelves as they deplete during the day. There is not a lot of idle time, so the day can pass quickly."
good,"It's a great company to work for. Great leadership and wonderful coworkers. Always an opportunity to learn and grow within yourself and the company.  "
good,"My typical work day is greeting people, running the register, bagging their items and assisting them in any way that I can. I learned all the basic functions of the register and a lot of product knowledge. I work with a great people that always try to help each other when they aren't busy with a customer. The job isn't too bad as far as being hard to do. We get very busy during the holiday season and I have to help bring in carts which can be difficult during winter time which can be hard when it's freezing and there is a lot of snow on the ground. I love being able to engage with the customers because it's great meeting new people and hearing what they have to say because you never know who you will meet and what they'll have to say."
good,"This grocery store has a wide variety of organic and fair trade products. "
good,"My Days at Whole Foods Market was great, I Loved being around Healthy Food as a Produce Team Member, I Learned alot about the Growing Practices of Organic Produce, The Management was fairly Good, not the Best, My Co-workers was very friendly and was open to talk about various Topics, the Hardest Part of the Job was Closing and putting up all of the Fruit that needed to be in the Cooler overnight, the Most Enjoying part of the job was to meet new people and to see Different faces each day."
good,great job for students and people looking for a career. the job revolves around helping the customers and the community! I've learned a lot about food and healthy lifestyles. I've also learned a lot about the industry! co workers were very cool. and management was good!
good,Working for Whole Foods Market has been a great experience where I was able to develop both customer service and leadership skills in order to overcome challenges that I have yet to face.
good,"Great place to work. With any growing company, there have been moments of stress. Every single employee is willing to help and extend their expertise. Even as the company expands rapidly, the atmosphere is fun and exciting. Awesome place to work as well as great time with co-workers. Had a phenomenal company culture centered around a work hard-play hard environment."
good,"Whole Foods is an awesome environment to work in if you have the attitude and the will power to make it something special. Depending on your role, you will mostly just do your best to help customers and be an asset to your team. It will build character and teach you how to think on your feet. You will become more positive about things the more you work."
good,My experience with Whole Foods Market has been very enjoyable since I first started in 2010. There plenty of opportunities to advance and/or change departments within the company. All employees are extremely friendly and hardworking.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be checking the calendar and making sure everyone's breaks and lunches have been taken on time. I would then relieve whoever needed to be, and continue to offer customers the type of service that I would want to be offered. The management and co-workers are all incredibly friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job would be, no doubt, standing in a checkout lane for extended periods of time. I won't lie that part can get monotonous; but that also goes hand in hand with the most enjoyable part of the job, which is getting to know so many different types of people."
good,Whole foods market was like a family of great and supportive people. They got along well and were unified in their goal of delivering the highest quality to their customers.
good,"Learning WFM values, the ins and outs of the store. The values of the employees hired. Long shifts but very rewarding. Great career opportunity for advancement."
good,"Retail sucks no matter how you cut it, but at least Whole Foods does their best to dissuade from that.  The benefits are great, the teams are filled with great people, and there is tons of opportunity to move around or advance."
good,"I would love to put 5 stars down but unfortunately I had a few incidences with coworkers that were not taken care of by management, but besides that tiny detail it was honestly a really great place to work. I love demonstrations and customer service and they are big into training and teaching so you can be fully self sufficient, and also so that you can give guidance to new employees and everyone is on the same page. I respect their values and integrity on what they believe in and how important it is to the company and all of the team members and team leaders. It was hard at first learning how to do everything so perfectly because they are so particular but once you get the hang of it its nothing!"
good,"A day at work includes team work and each day you learn something new. It is a multicultural environment so it is enjoyable getting to know one another and working together. Management is great. They are always there to correct, but they're never on your tail because they trust you to complete whatever task it is you have."

good,"I clock in and face my department. I then run all U Boats and back stock I can find. Continue to face and help customers."
good,"I really love working here.The management team and coworkers of mine are all great and incredible to work with. The hardest part of the job for dish is at the end of the night, not letting all the final dishes coming back get to you."
good,"Customer service enabled me to confidently manage any customer complaint, suggestion and problem solve with ease. I was able to gain further understanding of the natural food industry, including sustainable farming, healthy eating and awareness of environmental issues. My co-workers were also mostly students. The most enjoyable part of the job was managing unforeseen problems, as I have been in the position for so long, it provides me with a more stimulating work day."
good,i learned the method to preparing foods for customers from cakes to packaging buns a typical day would consist of helping 14 to 35 customers as well as stocking the shelves with packaged products
good,"A typical day at work (in the Grocery Department) would be spent stocking products to shelves, setting up displays and promos, keeping the store clean and presentable, facing products, maintaining inventory, back stock, damages, and spoils, handling customer requests and special orders. Almost always being out on the floor, you are always in contact with customers and always providing customer service and assistance. You are also frequently taking phone calls, and frequently interacting with vendors."
good,Wholefoods Market is one of the best companies to work for and that's a true statement
good,a typical day at work I love to work hard to prove myself it makes me feel great when a manager or supervisor tells me great job. i also love to help my co workers get through their day when their having a bad day i love to brighten up peoples day and make it easier for the work and for the the day to go by smoothly. i love to listen and learn new things and pick up new ideas. it helps u communicate alot better and makes ur Customer Service skills much more perfessional.the hardest part of the job is rude Customers i just ignore it and stay perfessional.the most enjoyable part of the day is meeting quota knowing that the job is done right and completed thats a great feeling.

good,"A positive, accepting work culture is a focal point at Whole Foods. 20% discount. A lot of opportunity for moving up. A lot of learning opportunities."
good,Always something new and fun when at work but of course serious when needs to be. Team leaders in all departments are very respectful and also lovely to be around. There is team member appreciation week which is really great. Store and department meetings at least once a month.
good,Whole foods is a great company definitely a great 1st job which i was for me the company is green which i support and they pay well anf offer great benefits it was a while ago that worked there but i remember it was a great 1st job
good,Love the whole aspect of the job. Whole Foods feels like a home to its employees. Great food and body care selection. And who doesn't love the benefits

good,"Working at Whole Foods Market in Lynnwood Washington, was a great experience with so many wonder kind and gentle people, prepared foods department was fun uplifting, cooperative work environment. If your station became busy with customer the supervisors would gladly come and help you, if to were a little behind on setting up your station your co worker would gladly help you set up. the morning meeting with the lead supervisor"

good,High stress customers but managers were awesome. I was part time but just barely. They do a great job of promoting from within and if you show interest they will do what they need to make it happen
good,Whole foods is a great place to work but I dont know how it is now that Amazon bought them out. I met a lot of great people there and the job was fast paced but relaxed at the same time. Huge plus that you can wear your own clothes. Overall I enjoyed my time there.
good,I had worked her four just over four years. All of the four years were on the Front End. I was cashier for most of the time there. I also was able to become a supervisor where most of my enjoyment came from.
good,"While working at Whole Foods, I realized my potential in really assisting the customer with their shopping needs. The one thing I realized about the company is that they don't include aisle directories purposely so that I, as the grocery associate can politely guide the customer to their destination in a personable fashion."
good,"I can only speak to working with my former team (located in Hawaii). Upon being hired you are trained very thoroughly, both in the history and values of Whole Foods, and also for your position. Great medical benefits. You are not only provided but also empowered with opportunities to give back to your local community. Management from top to bottom was one of the best management teams I've had the chance to work with."
good,I love Whole Foods and practice core values in my day to day life as a whole hearted leader. Many opportunities for advancement and trading in a stable and encouraging atmosphere.
good,"Great place to work at. They make the environment friendly and make you actually love to work. They don't ask for much, but to work. Since I'm a hard worker that's no issue. Plenty of space to move up in the ladder."
good,"Great culture, great benefits, awesome coworkers. Customers can be a pain though. Great place to build a foundation of skills that are needed at every other job you can think of."
good,"A typical day at whole foods usually it would always be busy then it starts to die out then it would pick back up. Working for whole foods I've actually learned not just only how to eat healthy but I've learned about some veggies i had no clue they even existed. Management is not that bad until you run into those who let their position get to their heads. As far as workplace culture everything is pretty smooth , team members get along for the most part and we got the job done at the end of the day. Hardest part of the job was when the store would get busy and we would run out of bags. Also when foreign customers would talk to you in a different language and you had to figure out how to communicate with them understanding you. The most enjoyable part about coming to work was being around the team members. Even if certain people wasn't having a good day still the day would go by smooth and productive."
good,I really enjoy working here it was pretty cool learning about baking bread schedule was reliable to be able to go to school and getting the times i needed to go in
good,Its a really great place to work. Everyone is always happy and a joy to be around. Friendly customers with similar interest gather to make food a common interest.

good,Whole Food is a great place to work I never had any problems there the management is fun and understanding.
good,"Greet customers and provide exceptional customer service."
good,"-Depending on the department, there is always a ton to do."
good,"Working at Whole Foods is awesome! A typical day is called ""busy."""
good,"Whole Foods was probably the busiest Job I've ever had. Every day was something new. The management was great, I've learned a lot about organic products and how to deal with different types of customers. All the co-workers work as an actual team, helping each other, not only within the departments but the whole store as well. the best thing about the job was the gainsharing. The more the products we sold meant more profit, and with more profit, the bigger the gainsharing bonus. The Bonus was distributed to every single team member from every department. None of that would've been possible with handwork and the help of every team member working together. It helps and teaches co-workers how to work in teams for more success which was a pretty good lesson and experience."
good,"The personalities at Whole Foods are so different from one person to the next, and this is such a fun aspect of being on the job and enjoying your co-workers."
good,"This Was The Ideal job everything always went smooth. I learned that organic foods are the best,so when shopping choose WHOLE FOODS. The managers had heir picks and chooser but they where great leaders. Everybody worked together to make sure every customer was satisfied because the customer was always right.the hardest part of the day was keeping a smile with out hurting your jaws because the environment was always happy at all times."
good,"Arrive with positive attitude ready to work every day"

good,"Every day clean the case and check expiration day the all cakes frutas and pastry. "
good,"Working overnight was a great experience. Getting to work in a fast paced environment with little to no downtime was the most ideal situation for an 18 year old.

It was very easy to learn every aspect of the job, with everyone being so informative."
good,Very employee friendly place to work. The work culture there at Whole foods made it a pleasure to come to work every day.
good,"Whole Foods is a very fast paced, interactive workplace with many duties needing to be done all in a certain period of time. Everyone was always on top of there work including managers and overall it was a friendly work environment."
good,"So much more than a ""grocery store"". The company really does cherish their employees. Expect lots of free food, products, and an overall great atmosphere. So many awesome opportunities will be extended to you. Once you're in, you're family. It's a really fun place to work and if you're willing to put the customers first and work hard you will honestly thrive. The leadership motivates and pushes team members to move up as quickly as possible, faster than any other store, EVER. However, two things: leadership has a plan for each team member, which you'll see and learn over time. Even if you are 100% fit to move up and do an excellent job on an interview, leadership may reject your advancement because they have other unspoken plans for you. Not negative necessarily, just that your time will come when it's meant to so just keep trying. Also, they will not hesitate to kick your a** to the curb if you can't adjust to the atmosphere. Just don't take any position lightly, even just starting out. Even for an entry level, you'll be payed considerably higher than any other store, and are watched just as closely by management as any other position."
good,"Very fun place to work, employs are are fun and kind. Great place to learn team work and new skills. In the end the best part of the day is knowing you were able to help any and all customers and had them leaving with smiles on their faces."
good,"good trainning support, great benefits, great opportunites for advancements, great pay."
good,"I love working here, period. The atmosphere makes it very easy to come into work. They are laid back with dress code but strict in other aspects. The pay is great along with the bonus money. Management at my store along with some others are great and its easy to move up but very competetive."
good,"Great work environment with well run management. Day to day, since I'm a buyer, basically get to be very independent with the department. Team Leaders are very support of growth in your career and are there to help you grow with the company."
good,"Working for Whole Foods/Amazon was an overall good experience. The people that I worked with, the associates that already worked there, the customers. Everybody made this experience with them good for me."

There really werent no hard part of the job. The enjoyable part was always at the end of the night when we did our jobs successfully.
good,Management is terrible. Most TL’s spend the majority of their shift in the ATL office. TL’s never close. They will schedule TM to close all the time..
good,Good inviroment to work it’s not the company the people’s work there the higher up their  no mercy and they think they own the company . Specially Torrance location and Tempe arizona.what can I say that’s how I feel they mistreated me .i work so hard for that store I gave my 100 percent of my everything but they don’t care. Their heartless
good,The interview at Las Vegas Blvd location was very off putting. I could sense the Supervisor who was conducting the interview had zero patience for getting to know their prospectives. He was in a rush to do the interview. Sad experience since Whole Foods is suppose to be the “Good Vibes” store. Tried at a different location and got hired.
good,"You have a productive day. I've learned how to laminate. Wish management would show more support. My co-workers were a wonderful set of people. The hardest part of the job was not having support from management. The most enjoyable part of my job was to see the customers happy, it truly was."
good,I did not over all enjoy my experience at whole foods because of poor management. There were items I needed to buy for the job they should have provided.
good,"I was going through a divorce and missed a team meeting and was fired for not being present for the meeting. no warning, chances or write up. they let me work the whole day and let me go at the end of my shift."
good,Great company that cares a lot about their employees happiness. Ultimately hinders production - Whole Foods will reward you for going through the motions - hard to go above and beyond. Difficult to get fired and expectations from/for hourly employees are extremely low.
good,"this is a furniture liquidation company. you work open to close 6 days a week working all over the country. they pay for your housing food ect. job pays very well doing data entry and office work, tagging merchandise ect. best part about the job was getting to see the country. worst part about the job was never being home not being able to start a family cause i was always away."
good,"I unload trucks, make grocery orders and Specialty orders for the store. stock the shelves. The hours are good and they pay weekly although I would like to get overtime they don't allow it."
good,"I have great co-workers, fun staff, very helpful with working with my school schedule, close to home, positive atmosphere."
good,Loved working there and made longterm friendships. Face paced on Sundays and Wednesday’s but it was always great working and assisting. Sadly hours were cut and I wasn’t seeing much pay after the amazon prime situation was occurring so I had to move on and seek better employment financially
good,"Every Whole Foods location is different from one another. Generally I think Whole Foods is a great company that does its best to keep its team members happy and healthy. Depending on the location you work at, you may encounter some poor managerial communication skills, but if something like that doesn't bother you, you'll be fine."
good,The work space for the employees was often dirty. We had to store our stuff in bags because of multiple bed bug infestations. Food was often thrown out instead of given to employees. If we did get mispicks or food that we couldn't sell. It had to consumed in the store. We got an employee appreciation week. Which we would get a t-shirt and take out. Which often wasn't enough for everyone. We use to get gain sharing. Which means we would get compensated when the store sales would peek. However that was taken away once minimum wage went up.
good,"Fun place to work, but low paying and no room for advancement.  I was never given my 90-day review and I worked there 4 months.  This kept me from qualifying for a higher wage."
good,"A typical day at whole foods is helping customers find products and talking about the pizzas that I made that day. I do get to be creative when making pizzas and can do a chef special pizza. I am responsible for making prep and pulling dough so we have a fully stock pizza station. I do love the cooking that I get to do and how I can make my own pizzas. Talking to the customers is always fun because I get to learn what they want. It's a great company to work for and the people there are very passionate about Whole Foods Culture. The hardest part of my job is dealing with my manager, he runs my department. He is very dismissive of problems and issues do not get solved or are pushed aside until it reaches a breaking point."
good,"In order to get the job you must go through lots of training. I helped open the store so maybe that's why I had too but I'd expect everyone to go through it. Also they do not work or function like a normal company or business it's very odd and weird. I quit because my managers were very conflicting, and neither would be happy if you listened to the other. But the main owner of the store, is a wonderful man!"
good,"Great company to work for when working with people who actually care about their jobs. Otherwise, company can be insensible and unsympathetic to it's team members, whom they slave, and can quickly turn into an enemy."
good,A typical day at work is just being prepared to do your best to fulfill orders. Work side by side with your coworkers. Help customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people. The hardest is not having available products for the customers
good,The atmosphere is easy going with happy going people. Expect to be in the regional office two to three days per week and out in the stores the other days.
good,You get what you want and work for. Most people complain about standing on your feet for 6 or more hours but honestly it’s all in how you work just do your job go home and prepare for the next shift!
good,"Loved working there. Wish I could work there again. Management seem a bit stressed. Culture was excellent, the dishes and rush are the hardest part. The most employable part of whole foods would have to be cashier or dishwasher."
good,"I enjoyed my job being quick paced , my co workers made the work environment an easy one to work in. Work days where enjoyable I enjoyed meeting daily tasks and customers where happy."
good,"SUPER STRESSFUL ! OVER WORKED AND UNDER PAID!! i can not wait to get another job. Store leadership sucks, team members do not resepect anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,Great company to work for and a lot of other benefits.  Working there one gains a lot of knowledge on the brands they carry and their products so that the knowledge can be passed on to the customers.
good,"I love Whole Foods. Great place to work. Personal experience however was that the management knew nothing about the position I applied for and told me the wrong hours. Then upon being hired was supposed to simply find a way home at night with no real conversation as to whether I was able to do the late shift or not. The position was the ""most difficult in the store"" this was the words of many who worked there, but I was only told how strenuous it was after I was hired. They put me in a rock and a hard place. Very physical job and this particular location is some what unorganized. You must be self driven and ask questions to make it. That being said, still think it's a great place to work if you can find out what your getting into!"
good,militant grocery life.  fast-paced.  high turnover. hit the ground running.  The people are nicer than the job. Provides team with food sometimes to show appreciation.
good,"Whole foods has it's own work culture that is infectious, and really makes you feel like you are a part of something bigger than yourself. Job security is very strong here, which makes advancement very hard."
good,You get to communicate with new people everyday and actually grow a relationship with those people. You also get to know how to multitask with things that you're doing. For example talking and counting money. I didn't think I could do that.
good,"The environment at Whole Foods was great, working with different cultures was a great experience but they had poor benefits."
good,"Its an amazing place to work, full of positive people and atmosphere.  The problem is it takes time to move up and its hard to build a family on the salary they start at.  Good for someone with prior manager experience."
good,"When I first began working at metro express the work team consisted of myself and two other people,we also worked outside which made it perfect at the time for me."
good,"I am working at Whole Foods Stores in Noe Valley and Market Streets directing traffic at their parking lots but my employer is CPA Valet.  The stores are subcontracting their parking operations to CPA Valet.  "
good,"I started to work at wholefoods market since 2014 in Brighton Store. This is the American Healthy Grocery  Store. It provide the service for people in America, United Kingdom and Canada. I am proud to work in this company because of good working environment and move and grow forward in my carrier path. I have learned the American culture, as well as diverse societies."
good,If I was able to afford the transitions through leadership to a position that would facility my family's financial needs I would in a heartbeat. It is unfortunate that I cannot afford to reduce my household income from 2 jobs to just wholefoods to make the necessary transition to move into leadership.
good,Whole foods was a great company to work for and you meet great people every day. They also have some really great prices and sales on all the great products
good,"I've been with the company for 7 years. Great team members, culture of appreciation, room for promotions. Workload can be heavy at times but team members help each other out."
good,"Everything at whole foods is done collaboratively with good friendly people . I learned customer service and cash management system over there . The management is supportive, and has a good listening ear for the staff.The culture is very harmonious."
good,"Enjoyed working with the produce team, public and management during my nine-month stint as part of the launch of this new location. Excellent work environment!"
good,"Job work and life balance is very important to be successful. So, flexibility is very vital within any organization. I feel as if Whole Foods should be a little bit more understanding."
good,I was able to move around the company to several departments and constantly be learning. The company perks and benefits were also outstanding. I was also able to move locations.
good,Fast paced but the people are nice and the quality is great. Always have tools needed to work. The managers are always available and love to hang out with their employees.
good,"They're open to a lot of ideas."
good,"I loved it. No complaints ever. Such an optimistic environment. Impact on the planet. Great diversity of employees, impressive. Excelled as a company overall, the complete experience - so ideal."
good,"I enjoyed my time there.  I moved back towards family, thus making the drive too far.  If I ever moved to an area where there is a Whole Foods, I would reapply"
good,"Cashier job that requires warm attitude towards customers. Scan and bag customers' items. Occasionally maintain store appearance by gathering carts and baskets, wiping down registers, and replacing grocery bags."
good,Working here i really liked how the supervisor and managers made me feel at home..only thing is some of the employees are not a good fit for there job discription.
good,"there ok, I enjoy working there there good there great there fun there a job there supportive there demanding at times there friendly there  family oriented"

You choose your own shift with a caveat; there are no set schedules and everyone attempts to claim shifts at the same time.That being said, you only come in for your shift and then leave.The work environment is fun and energetic and no issues were had whilst working there."
good,Whole Foods was a great opportunity for me while I was goi to school. I learned how to be apart of a great team and add great customer service skills.

good,"A typical day at Whole Foods Market involves arrival at 5am. I clock in get a white coat and get to work. I start off by checking all the product in the cake case and removing those that are overdue, from there I wipe down the front and back of the case (inside) and restock it with fresh product. once i have the product to be lost removed from the case I print tags so that I can track the loss we accumulated that day. From there I take inventory of what we have and what we need for the day and create a list of production for the day. From that point forward I go about my day breaking down the pallet and putting product away, making buttercream and ganaches, and assembling and decorating baked goods. The management is great, our team is strong and we all work well together. We build each other up and lend a helping hand when possible. the hardest part of the job is how inconsistent our clientele is. We try and pull movement for products during the holiday so we have some sort of an idea of what is going to sell the best but that is just a general idea. Things that do not sell most weeks could fly within days. the inconsistency of the market makes is slightly difficult to prep ourselves so we are ahead of the game. the best part of my job is that I love what I do. My team is great and I love making desserts."

good,"I don't know what it is like now since I haven't worked for them since 2017, but prior to leaving it wasn't the worst place to work. I left for relocation reasons and because a lot of things had started to change and are continuing to change, which is the life of any retail store, so in order to cut costs they cut people. I left before I watched them gut out all the people who had worked for the company for more than a decade... I'm leaving my review as is."
good,"The company is fast paced environment with a very high consumer demand for a wide range of our goods. We as employees learn things quickly and apply them in our daily practices immediately. The moment you step into the door, you are being vetted for a leadership  position."
good,"Tough shoppers, no benefits, decent pay, nice managers, inflexible hours, good food, nice employees, no sick days, not good about emergency calling out, short breaks, long shifts"
good,"A work day at Whole Food was fast pace and fun. "
good,simple easy place to work employees I worked with were great still keep in touch with them to this day manager that I had to deal with were not the best
good,"Great place to work. Love the people."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Whole Foods.  I had fun everyday and enjoyed trying everything and learning about health on a holistic level.  It was fantastic to have health insurance.  The pay was low for Austin.  Overall, a terrific company, great guests and coworkers!  It's tough to be in a bad mood so close to so much chocolate and fancy teas!"
good,"People are constantly at eachother's throats trying to one up eachother, talking about who did what to who and when."
good,I loved the work life here and the people I worked with were just amazing. The hiring and recruiting of whole foods is a but picky in the best way and they really try to find people who fit their corporate persona.
good,Good work environment. It provides  a strong ambiance for the customers to visit my booth. I get to build my own clientele and show my initiative finding ways to help others.
good,"Whole Foods was a very fun place to work. Most of my co-workers were super cool and most of the customers were nice, but you're bound to interact with a disrespectful customer. For a part-time/ full-time job the pay was very good, but that wasn't enough for me to stay as management didn't take into consideration of the days I have school, and when i request off days."
good,"Wholefoods Market is an American Grocery store with an emphasis on organic and fair trade foodstuffs which is procured from around the globe."
good,"LOVED LOVED LOVED Whole foods until I became a part of the mgmt. team."
good,love the company they have great benefits great hourly pay great core values... but management needs improvement... loved it met a lot of celebrities and nice people
good,"Good company overall, feel like i was working in a good environment. loved the flexibility that they had as well, I would recommend for someone else to work there as well."
good,For the almost 3yrs i worked there it was a very fun multi cultural  environment and interesting place to work. I met a lot of friends and learned a lot about Organic foods while being a team member at whole foods. I was laid off in September 15' due to team restructuring and Future Technological projects.
good,"Aside from being laid off in a rather Dirty way, the store I worked for had alright management and while not being very organized, did the best they could for the limited space they had. Don't expect to move up if your bosses don't know you pre-employment"
good,My co workers the absolute best. They all helped trained me in different aspects of the store. They all showed me the utmost respect and kindness.
good,"this company was OK,unable to grow here. to many set backs.no annual rises.at this company was over worked and underpaid. other than that they had great benefits."
good,"A day at Wholefoods is dealing with the best customers in the world!The co-workers and management there are always happy and smiling.The hardest part about the job was going home because it was so fun,"
good,Everyone is friendly and very helpful. Very busy but not chaotic.
good,"Management position offer great benefits manage department with outstanding customer service,making schedules,mentoring workers,ordering for department,"
good,I loved everything about my job. A typical day at work was very busy and I love busy I feel like the day goes by faster as well as meeting so many different faces. I didn't find anything hard about my job because I adjusted to every duty as soon as it was given.
good,"fast moving ,lots of prep to make sure we are set for the day!"
good,"Customer Satisfaction, handling money. The most important part of my job to me was taking care of our customers"
good,"If your not trying to make a career out of Whole Foods then this is a great move. As you grow with the company, the trickery starts as far as ""friends"" in the business goes. There a lot of ""wash my back and I'll wash yours"" mentality that stems from management and seasoned employees that traveled from store to store. If your not in the loop its a matter of time before your out. You cant just go to work and do your job at Whole Foods. Your at the mercy of the seasoned workers and the management to make them look good for the regional bosses then to recieve your raise, its on a percentage based quota thats unfair in the least bit...that many of times is overlooked then months later, when management gets the time, they give you your raise retrograded from the time you placed your job dialog..not professional or thinking of employees lively hoods responsably"
good,Healthy place to work. Decent compensation and very responsible management. They treat their workers well and provide you with a solid foundation of knowledge about food and health.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people -- both the co-workers and customers!  A typical day at work involved being on the front end and managing the cashiers, and helping customers at the guest service desk."
good,"A typical day was, set up and get ready for the day, interact and assist with customers, make sure the store is clean.  The staff is friendly and the there is room to grow."
good,"Great place to work at nice employees love the discount learn alot being there learning about the product . It do offer advancement,  i love trying the food"
good,"Nice place to work "
good,Satisfactory place to work. Similar to a small family. I enjoyed and learned a lot of life lessons as well as made long term friendships outside of work.
good,"Great staff. Understanding management, fun and busy workplace. Never a dull day when working at Whole Foods. Great company has a lot of amazing fundraisers. Lots of career advancement opportunities."
good,A day at whole foods is busy busy busy line out the door 100+ orders people making request you assisting guest with kiosk or helping them find a item they can't find showinh them the way
good,The contractor side of the job is not fun as you never know if you're being retained and dont receive the same perks as full time employees. Lots of IT skills to learn. Great management.
good,Working at WFM was an amazing experience. Hands down my favorite job. They increase your hourly wage as a team member every review session but this was before amazon.
good,I had fun working there mangamet needs to deal with customer service more they could order trucks more so we don't run out of things but other than that it's the really okay place to work
good,"you will like it good food , and good people just do what you need to do to get a higher pay rate , the staff are transgender and they accept all walk of life"
good,"wholefoods is a very welcoming environment the store is always clean and organized, the management staff is very understanding always willing to accommodate whenever there is a situation with an employee. employee are free to express themselves there is absolutely no place for discrimination, my experience working in thus field before allows me to enjoy my job a lot more than other employees."
good,I would come in and enjoy my breakfast before start time. Change into my work outfit. Go out on the sale floor and greet my managers. Everyone is so friendly!
good,Whole Foods was a good place to work and I enjoyed it for the most part. I worked in the prepared foods and bakery department and I worked the night shift. The hardest part of the job was deep cleaning the rotisserie chicken oven. The most enjoyable part was seeing people every day who I considered my friends. I learned how to properly and consistently prep food and make sandwiches.
good,"great place to work. good pay. no benifits unless you're full time. "
good,"While the work was not necessarily hard, the customer base could be incredibly difficult, mostly due to location, however, the managers handled many difficult situations incredibly well and motivated the team on most days to press through the tough crowds. It was usually incredibly busy and the team members really made working there much more tolerable"
good,The job was okay. Whole Foods Market enabled good advancement at the time and the benefits were great for the industry. Ultimately not something one would like to spend all of their life doing.
good,"worked for 10 plus years wouldn't trade it at all, fantastic people work there. buying loving and selling cheese, fantastic boss, the hardest part was the learning curve for what soon became a passion and then was very easy, best part was making best friends you get to see everyday."
good,Whole Foods is a fair and fun place to work also a great working environment and a good place to meet good people the job is quick-paced and at times can be very busy and very demanding
good,departments with different foods different temperature a lot to learn from wholefood they international so get food from all around the world and most of everything organic too.
good,"On a typical day of work at whole foods was pretty relax, the work was not hard. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rush hour in the store and shoppers were anxious to get out so they would try to skip each other on line."
good,"Great place; though flexibility you seek will be traded for stifled advancement opportunities. It really depends on which location you work at, and WHO you work with. The vibe is different: go to the Charlestown store, and feel the vibe; look at the expressions on customers and workers faces. Now do the same at the Lynnfield store...totally different experience. Choose wisely."
good,Working at whole foods in the front end was not a bad job but it was very frustrating because of managers working there at the time. The managers were very rude when talking to employees below them as well as not taking into consideration that other people had second jobs such as myself.
good,"Whole foods is amazing to work for . I love whole foods."
good,"A professional and organized environment, every one of the ATL’s was always willing to help you with stacking if you have trouble with the product. Cares for the employees"
good,"Whole Foods is a good company with a solid culture and benefit set up; however, management always sides with team leaders, even when the situation does not warrant it."
good,excellent place to work.  Great environment with good benefits. Offer organic and all natural food.  Customer service is excellent in all departments.
good,"it was always good working there. learn a lot about customer service, good organics products. everyone was really warm at work.really great place to work."
good,"Overall, they gave me a chance to be successful at running my own business, while using someone else's money. I gained more confidence in my work ability and I learned more about leadership skills than I ever imagined. Allowed me to teach team members the meaning of a team and working together to achieve the same goal. I was able to train 4 new Assistants and help my stores become more successful. If not for Whole Foods, I would not have knowledge of leadership, team, and leadership skills I have gained. I will forever be grateful for all the opportunities Whole Foods has given me."
good,"everyday is a good day to learn something new <always new challenges, and fun work areas , management is always great when we are all doing what we are assign to"
good,Nice place to work friendly and dedicated co-workers. Job was very interesting. You get to meet a lot of new people. You get experience a workplace that very different than other grocery stores.
good,"•	Accountable for all operational processes needed for proper receiving, shipping and distribution operations in a high volume warehouse"
good,"just a supermarket, nicely liberal, too much upper management people, rules can be stingey, pay is generaly nice and hard work is rewarded, bonuses plentiful"
good,Whole Foods treated me very well and I did enjoy my time there. I just hated the commute to and from work. My team was not the best team but I do feel they gave me a fair chance.
good,"The whole concept of this company just made it inviting to work at. Even though there were many departments in the store, the company worked together as a whole. Team members had the freedom to work the way they pleased, as long as it still remained professional"
good,"setting up the wet rack, cleaning and maintain wet rack and cooler box. order writing, inventory, customer service. sampling produce items to our customers and our team members. learning about the company. and I'm also the produce team educator."
good,"Whole Foods is a relaxed place, people are nice and hardworking there. People are quick and neat about their jobs. Whole Foods gives off a good vibe! :"
good,"I worked here for several years and enjoyed every moment of it, management want you to succeed and gives you the tools to do so."
good,"Whole Foods is a wonderful place to work, but it is difficult to make a career out of it. A lot of room for advancement, but most of those jobs are taken by people who are not moving up themselves. That really depends on location."
good,"Love the job, just wish i was fulltime but after three months, i can be voted onto the team and possibly become full time."
good,"great benefits and great pay. need more moral in the company. only about money and not team members needs. bobkkhndkfojp'ijo;ijopjo'pjo"
good,i am restaurant manager  at whole sale food restaurant currently. i have learned management skills and i am good in my work and done it in best way...
good,"They had an astounding requirement for people to be in a culture of family that wasn't seen.  Really loved to equippers in the people that they were, really understood the requirements and honored and adored the people they worked for but didn't completely get the deal breaker for me to want to live and breathe there."
good,"Laid back, great benefits, very friendly... Great leaders. Easy job. Great pay, flexible scehdule....................................................."
good,team members are sometimes out of control and management doesn't like to deal with any communication issues. hard for departments to communicate with others many employees do what they want and make work hard on others
good,"Whole Foods is an amazing company to work for with good pay and benefits. The only downside is the shifts start very early (4:00am) and end very late (after midnight). If that is not a problem you will enjoy working here and learning about better foods and Humane treatment of animals, and overall helping the Earth."
good,"When working with the public I learned tolerance, patience & was given an opportunity for inward examination."
good,"On a normal day, I will take 30-40 inbounc calls that will range from pw reset to hand held scanner issues.  The majority of support for either applications or hardware are conducted via Logmein123 and I will say I absolutely love this software, it's a life saver when supporting 422 stores nations wide including Canada."
good,"Excellent coworkers, that are very supportive of your growth both within the company and outside of it s well.  They make a point to treat employees well and with respect which helps to support the overall sense of teamwork."
good,"Awesome company to work , been working here ten years , I was force to leave because my position was terminated do it to closing "
good,great environment to work . great place to grow. a lot of seasonal activities for the workers and customers .. i learned a lot about  different type of food and how it is good for u
good,"Typical day at Whole Food as Cashier is; Counting-in, Respond to any Current Assignments, Cashing-out customers, Customer Service, Returns/Exchanges, & Counting-out Cashiers."
good,"Wonderful human resources team."
good,All depends on what region you work in. Typical customer service job.
good,"On a typical work day I would hope for a busy one. I loved the times when there was no time to stop (although a stretch or two would have been helpful). I checked out products, bagged them, and handled large amounts of money. All while providing the customer with excellent service."
good,"I got this job in a time of grave need.  The pay was very low but I quickly moved up in salary.  Whole Foods recognizes their employees and if you do an excellent job you will be rewarded.  However, you take initiative and do what is needed with being told Whole Foods values you even more.  The benefit packages are excellent and you can make a career for yourself in this venue."
good,"There are always deliveries so the day flys by. Whole Foods is a very busy place, so there is constant activity. Get use to a fast pace atmosphere. Most ppl are happy to be there."
good,a typical day would be assisting customers while cleaning stocking marketing items not always on the floor
good,The customers are great and they do return as in a welcome to the store My co-workers are nice to work with and get along very well. I learned a lot about the organics and the conventional.
good,"A typical day at work, usually included a long line of semi patient people, and edgy management. Cheery but focused workers and the typical aggravated customer. The hardest part was trying to have a bathroom break. The most enjoyable part was just the message of healthy eating constantly being marketed out to everyone. "
good,A typical day working for WFM Whole Foods Market was never dull. Learning about homeopathic alternatives from co workers and experiencing and learning about health foods was fulfilling. The ability to move up was difficult and the management was not the friendliest in my experience. The most difficult part of the job was working service hours. The shift work was very inconsistent and difficult to plan a life working sporadic hours. I can appreciate the fact that I know hold life long knowledge of health foods and an alternative lifestyle that I owe from my years working at Whole Foods Market.
good,"I greatly enjoyed the time I worked there. The atmosphere was that of family and inclusion. I don't know about working conditions at other locations, mine was good. Work life balance especially for supervisors was not that great, because of the need to cover multiple shifts for various reasons. Training others could be difficult as there often were many people conducting the trainings at different times for the same task. The physical demands in our department was one of the hard things. Advancement involved a formal application and a fair bit of work to do the due-diligence required."
good,It was a fast paced environment that helped my speed and customer service. The management was bad however working with a diverse crowd definetly over shadowed that
good,great environment great employs not so great management did a lot for the company. flexible schedule. good hours. fun stuff. decent pay.great benefits
good,"Love working here. The mission of the company is the same way I choose to live my life. Healthy, Green and loving on all. Summer can take up to 6 weeks off because of off season."
good,"It was an amazing job however the workers I worked with just didn’t really care and that made it hard to work with. "
good,This is a good job to have with good benefits. I love working here everyone is friendly. I would like to go back. They also have good food and you get discounts
good,Whole Foods provides competitive pay and benefit options along with a pleasant work environment. Management is generally fair and scheduling is flexible
good,Wasn't a bad job.  I like it up until the management became nasty and more obsessed with writing people up than actually helping them get better and advance.
good,Fantastic culture and growth opportunities. Started as a dish washer and went on to run seven different departments in two different stores. Minimum pay is $15.
good,"Enjoyed working for Whole Foods! Had a great benefits package, management was fair at times. Team leaders can be lazy but everyone’s experience is different. Co workers are awesome"
good,Everyone who works there are really sweet. They give you good hours and they usually give you the time you request off. Although they pay well and everyone is nice your job is not secure. After 30 days all of your coworkers vote on whether or not you get to stay. If you don't get enough votes they give you another 30 days and if by then you have not been voted on you are terminated.
good,"Over all, the culture of Whole Foods breathes life into anyone who lets it. It’s an open minded place, with workers mindful of making lives better. It’s not just another grocery store, it’s a symbol for a healthier you."
good,Whole Foods Market is a company that on the whole knows how to take care of it's employees with it's excellent benefits and pay. The jobs themselves keep an effective employee busy. Management varies from person to person. Work life balance is chaotic as it is a retail environment.
good,"was always a challenge but never overloaded,produce always worked as a team and took pride in their work,would be interested in rehire.thing s have changed recently since i worked there but feel i have even more to offer"
good,"As a student, the hours are very flexible and accommodating to my schedule. The pay is OK for just a part-time job. As a cashier, I am always on my feet, but my fellow team members make the environment fun and interesting."
good,"Working here was a blast for a good while but after a while you start to realize that management is the only thing that is holding people back. Managers and Supervisors are all stressed out and act a little fake when the head honcho's show up. They never offered me a full time position after being there for +6 years which is not okay since they always talk about ""We want to see you grow in the company."""
good,"the most enjoyable part of this job was seeing my coworkers and being surrounded by a wholesome, relaxed atmosphere all day. If I ever needed to return to Whole Foods for work, I would."
good,"Great place to work with awesome coworkers. The work environment is fast paced, but not stressful. It is fun to interact with customers and work with such great people."
good,Great place to work love management overall got fair treatment. If you show ambition you will move up quick. Schedule is a bit of crazy they will schedule at the time they need you good thing schedule is always a month ahead
good,"Was the best benefits I have seen.  Generally good people to work with.  Although there can be an ""in crowd"" atmosphere.  Also, sometimes the work load is not evenly dispersed.  The company was beginning to undergo a lot of changes when I left.  Lazy people, or people who call off a lot do not last long."
good,"Whole Foods was my First full time job. Pretty laid back, managers sometimes cannot appreciate your work or are too “busy” to see efforts but coworkers become family even though team leaders at least at my store might have problems if they see you around other"
good,Good company with a fun teamwork environement. They are open to suggestions. They give recognition when you are successful. They seem genuinely concerned about your happiness.
good,"During my brief time within Whole Foods Market, I found each day extremely enjoyable thanks to my fellow co-workers. We all clicked immediately and were able to become quite the efficient team. They all assisted in my knowledge with various cuts of meat and fish, how they were prepared and their origins so I could properly convey it to customers in a high-stress, quick paced work-place."
good,Produce is a challenging position to begin with and I wish I was better at communicating my issues more but overall the company is very understanding of the employees needs.
good,Fun place to work at stressful sometimes at the time I was working there managers wasn't flexible with my hours because I was a full-time student at Le Cordon Bleu in Austin Texas
good,I worked at Whole Foods as a part time gig to get extra money.  The management was good.  The overall employee experience was well and I would recommend to anyone looking for an extra side job.
good,A company that is well organized and where is structure. Fun to work for and a good performance oriented culture. Team members who are easy to work with
good,"Its retail and you have to expect to deal with difficult customers. "
good,I loved working there very friendly place to work  diverse meet lots of people from all around the world learned a lot worker at Wholefoods customer service skills people skill management skill I can go on and on
good,"Overall, enjoyed working here. I was able to learn quite a bit and it was a positive, fun working environment. Big team players. Love the company as a whole."
good,"a typical a day at whole foods is non stop, especially working in produce. You start at 5 am going through the entire department for a quality. The workplace culture is very family orientated but the hardest part of the job is the work and life balance. The best part of working there  is the different people you meet"
good,"Dope place. Met some great people and am still friends with a couple. Everyone is very hipster at the front of the store, and tough in the back. Great people all around. Good customers and good security too."
good,"Whole foods in my opinion always had a well rounded work environment and was a desirable place to work.  The grocery store was like a little community that was divided into sections according to the type of grocery.  I was in the specialty department, which specialized in wine and cheeses.  The day consisted of a routine setup and breakdown of windowed products and facing of wines.  There was product preparations and cleaning that was to be done throughout the day as well for the following days.  We had sales goals and projected sales that we always strived to achieve.  The environment was a healthy and happy one, with healthy and delicious foods as the driving source.  Teams worked together for the common good of the store even though it was not a requirement of the position.  It brought me enjoyment to put a smile on a customers face when sampling a product, or just generally assisting them."
good,"You can grow here, but do not treat this as a career if you have other options. Management varies department by department. OTS standarDS ARE ANNOYING"
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work.  Team Members are friendly and helpful, as are members of the leadership team.  Not really preferring to work in grocery stores in the past, I feel fortunate to have worked at this Charleston area store for the past year and a half."
good,"It was a very quick-paced job, but sometimes there wouldn't be that much foot traffic in the store. I liked how the managers would tell us about what to do but they would allow us to think for ourselves."
good,"It was a great company to work for. It felt like working with family. If I ever needed to get a job just to have a job, I would go back to whole foods."
good,"I enjoyed working for Whole Foods but I have to relocate. They make moving very easy for Team Members and are very helpful in the entire process but, unfortunately, I have to move to a state where they are not located."
good,"I like working there nice customers n fun place to work"
good,A typical day at work would be stocking shelves and then fronted it at the end. I learn more about the products and the health factors of the items in the store.
good,I learned how to be efficient and accurate with being a buyer and how making the order deadlines is important. WFM is a fun place to work and I would recommend it to anyone.
good,I just want to know what else is out there for me to discover. I've worked here 10 plus years and want something more or different. I'm only asking for a chance
good,"I felt like I was in high school all over again. The main reason I left was an individual who had only worked there for 6 months with no prior grocery experience was promoted over myself (who had been there for 6 years and already was supporting the buyers/managers). If they don't like you, you won't get promoted and you WILL be pushed out. I'm not sure that it's that way at every store, but it was at my location."
good,working at wholefoods gives one the opportunity to to work with some good people. it also gives one the opportunity to move up very fast within the company
good,"Nice to place to work in. I learned how to buy along with management skills. Customer Service skills must be at a level 10, at all times. The customer service job does a fantastic job keeping team members happy."
good,"Great place to work! Quality training and many opportunities for team member advancement. They have an excellent health, dental, and vision benefits and 401k program."
good,It was a great experience unfortunately I decided to go back to school and the two schedules didn't last. Also I no longer want to work in retail. I have a higher education for a reason and do not wish to spend my life barely scrapping by on minimum wage.
good,good place to work if you love food. you get to learn a lot about all the different products very fast. but some of the customers are horrible. and the management is not very organized
good,Whole Foods has the best culture that I have ever experienced. The people that work there are what makes it a job worth going to everyday. Unfortunately the compensation was lacking.
good,I learned so much about production environments while working this position at Whole Foods Market. I also learned how to manage third party vendors in a effective and efficient way.
good,I've only worked season at Whole Foods and I had a great job. I worked in the Prepared Foods department so it can get stressful. Whole Foods has great benefits and they listen to their employees. There were some higher management that made the experience a little less desirable at times but that's like any other job.
good,"I have been at Whole Foods for 6 years now and I have a very unique job with the company. I started a raw vegan venue in the Venice location, which included hiring a 5 person team, creating a menu and keeping track of sales. After three years at that store I wanted to expand what I currently I was building, so I built a raw vegan program at my current location. Here I create a menu every Thursday for the local Farmers Market, create catering menus and any specail projects my store manager as me do. "
good,"I enjoyed working here a lot. I learned about different avenues of healthy eating and living. Company gives you a 20% discount off products, so makes a more affordable place to shop."
good,Wholefoods market midtown is a place to vibe with like minded people and pick up on new ideas and facts about nutrition and lifestyle. clean well kept store that's big on customer service. Management gives continuous feedback on service. I learned a plant based diet keeps many ailments at bay. my co workers are like a handful of snowflakes all so different but the same. The hardest part of this job is keeping up with the high demand of customer service.
good,"Ilike to work a lot,help others if in need,like to multitask and always like to learn new things like custermer service,also want to learn the basic in realstate.imvery dependable."
good,I am a person who is hard worker and a good problem solver. Willing to take challenges and move in my position and always follow the rules and regulation. I like to work as an individual and as a team too. I have the best customer service experience and have been the brightest of the workers in my work areas.
good,Friendly work environment. Allowed to be yourself without uniformity. Free spirited Jon with decent pay rates and advancement opportunities
good,"I really liked working here. It was a very fun environment and they always sought to educate us more about health and new products."
good,"Ejoyed working in the bulk department and stocking the grocery and helping with customer service. Learned about all different types of foods from gluten free, organic, vegan foods and all different bulk items."
good,This is a great company to work for. I worked here for a year and received a raise. I enjoy the customers and you learn a lot from them about eating healthy. I like how you can wear casual clothing under your work apron. I really miss working for this company. Time and attendance is taken serious here and job meetings.
good,"They encourage you to keep growing and the people you get to know and work with are excellent!"
good,"I enjoyed working in a diverse environment. There is a lot of room for growth and development. They encourage keeping yourself informed, and furthering your education."
good,"I enjoy working at Whole Foods very much, but only recently they have cut back on hours. But besides that its a very good job and I get along well with all my coworkers/supervisors/team leaders. I am very good at my job i have been working for the company for about seven years and I always enjoy coming to work."
good,"Whole Foods is amazing.  I love the culture and the people that work here.  I think they hire more for personality and passion and are willing to train people.  Management tries to work with team members and there is definitely room for advancement, but patience is key."
good,Great place to work.. Wish to make more money.. get higher up
good,Assisting customers with purchases in a timely professional manner. I have learned about all different types of food from organic to vegan. I had some great coworkers who helped me when I first started. The hardest part is when I first started was to learn of all different kinds of food. The most enjoyable was the store and customers and also my coworkers
good,But i would say too many crazy rules to agree to if you read all the paper work and app agreements you would know what I mean but great pay hours and benefits. Front end Team leaders not so much a fan.
good,"When you hire from bottom up, your roots are like a carrot; full of itself with very little deep roots of knowledge as an Oak tree would have. Most of the upper management have not worked outside of Whole Foods so......."
good,"I enjoyed the Whole Planet Foundation, Whole Kids foundation Drive, But everything else was over blown."
good,"-An average day as a meat department team member consisted of constant watch for customers and providing good service. Later in the day, we could move to the back rooms and start taking apart meat grinders and cleaning equipment and the facility."
good,A typical day at whole foods market was normally a pretty easy shift. I learned the importance of eating healthier and also learned fundamentals in organics.
good,"Prep for the day "
good,This fast-growing company is a great organization to learn about the industry.
good,Whole Foods Market is a great company to work for. I like the department I work in. We have a really great team and a great boos who is very down to earth.
good,"a very diverse environment with very hard working people.I learned a lot about food, organic and conventional. The management varies a every year, therefore you are constantly adapting to new leadership.I enjoyed the hoildays the most because it would be extremely busy and time would go by quickly"
good,"Whole Foods is a great place to learn new skills, I was trained as a supervisor and eventually became a trainer myself. In my time here I was given the opportunity to advance, trained to be a prep cook and a cake decorator. These are skills that are life long and will serve me well in the future."
good,"I never knew the true world of healthy eating until I worked here.The experience that I received about our health is far superior than I expected. People that shop there are so friendly, so goes to show happy people are healthy."
good,"Whole Foods is all about guest satisfaction. That being said it can be emotionally exhausting to 'delight and satisfy' the guests as some of them know this and push the limits on a daily basis. I've had guests sling their trash on the belt and get mad that I wouldn't throw it away for them, then demanding to speak to my boss. It's NEVER been Whole Foods policy for cashiers to handle trash when handling peoples food as it is a health concern...however, guests continue to offer up their trash on a daily basis to cashiers despite the fact that there are trash cans at each exit of the store. The employees, however are AWESOME to work with and I've really enjoyed working with them. They've become like a family and make working there enjoyable."
good,My time at Whole Foods had it's ups and downs. I enjoyed my time there and unfortunately could not advance as fast as I was promised. I did learn valuable skills that I will pass along to my next workplace.
good,One of my favorite jobs. Worked in the prepared foods department. Learned a lot in regards to food industry. Would recommend if they paid a little better. Very chill management but we’re certain individuals who wanted to micro manage.
good,Organic food is the best! Working at food has changed my lifestyle it made me healthier through eating the best food the world has to offer! Job opportunities are always available throughout the whole Houston Metro and advancement is possible!
good,Company is very understanding. Everyone cares about each other’s  well being.They work as a team. Sometimes the work load was heavy but everyone worked together.
good,"It was a nice job. You'll need a flexible schedule though, the people is nice and fair. You'll have to stand the whole time you are there and breaks are like a hour so that's a bonus."
good,"I liked working for Whole Foods. I'd even go back. Great earthy, ""homey"" environment. Not that easy to get through to store management, N it HR is pretty good."
good,This is a great job to learn how to deal with the public.  Fast paced and energetic they will teach you how to do your job to the best of your ability.
good,honestly it was a great place to work. management was full of great people and everyone was friendly. The only thing I have to warn you about is that you have to work seriously cause if you fool around you could get fired
good,"The overall experience and comradery between employees was amazing. The staff and management were very supportive on busy days, and always told their employees how much they appreciate their hard work. There were times when the department was understaffed, but the managers were great at training new staff quickly. The only problem I found was the lack of flexibility of the points system. I was dealing with medical issues and a loss in my family which caused me to miss a lot of work and rack up quite a few points. The managers themselves were understanding, but the point system is very binary. I am very thankful for the time I got to spend working there and will be reapplying after the 6 month waiting period!"
good,I loved working in the bakery area  I enjoyed explaining the new produced to the customer  and conversing about what I like to eat from the bakery.  I had a great manager who did mind on showing new thing and how to make sale .
good,"I have nothing but good things to say about my time at WFM. amazing experience, mission and leadership. The culture, mission and team is a proud one to work for."
good,"Surrounded by great food, great people, lots of customer service.  Must be available days, nights, weekends, holidays. Lots of opportunity if you are willing to put in the work"
good,"Overall its the people that make a difference; team members are the ones to make you feel welcome and a sense of belonging to a new company."
good,"Great atmosphere, fun people. Only cons really are hours and the fact that the food the bakery gets is already premade/frozen. All we do is frost them/finish them off. High skills not needed."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the team members, it really was just like one big family and a very enjoyable vibe. I would also say after making someone’s food or helping them with something, their appreciation and joy they would give out would really make me feel great."
good,They are a very good business with many things for people. They are very friendly and work together on helping kids school and people eat healthier. Very good
good,I really enjoyed my time at Whole Foods market. It was a team based job so you got the opportunity to really get to know your teammates. It was also a customer service based job so you got to know your customers and build a strong connection with them. Overall it was a great job.
good,"worked with some really great people and still friends with them. this was before amazon took over, so i am not sure what the environment is like today.  I would work for Whole Foods again."
good,"Working at Whole Food was a create experience. I learned allot about people ,about seafood ,about the practical contact of doing business.Whole Foods Market teaches what it means to have a considerable amount of integrity.To provide quality service and a fair quality product."
good,The age range of workers at whole foods is very diverse. It will help you grow as  a person with interacting with different cultures and energies in the store in any position.
good,"You are always on your toes. There is always something to be done."
good,Very good place to work but when u work 40 hours it’s hard for them to give u ft blah blah blah overall love this job the people and the customers excellent experience
good,"Whole Foods is a good company for those who are looking opportunities to wrong within their careers, there is so much room to growth personally and professionally."
good,"A lot of room for professional growth, a very team oriented work place, great customer service skills, a large variety in healthy foods , produce and much more"
good,"The hours were flexible, the job was very fun and fast paced. "
good,"great place to work at, the manager was great. it a family work environment for the location I worked at. They have good benefit for full time employee"
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods.Some days were better than others, but that's with any job. I met some amazing, interesting individuals. Very diverse environment."
good,"My whole body  team was so awesome and knowledgeable. Everyone was a little family and really cared about each other’s well being. Schedule was fairly flexible, everyone was understanding. The rest of the store was in dire need of help to say the least."
good,"*set food platters, maintain sanitize bars, place containers in designated areas"
good,"I enjoyed my job at Whole Foods, it was fast paced and they wanted to teach me more. They would not offer a full-time position and couldn't fit my schedule with another company in order for me to maintain two part-time positions.  I had to move on to a full-time position with another company."
good,"sundays were always busy, management rushing around and impatient customers.. it allows for one to learn quick reaction time and multitasking skills along with customer service."
good,"working there was great but it takes a long time to fully learn the company"
good,"its good to work in whole foods,good environment.enjoyable.good management .there is so much to learn and gives better ideas and gives promotions which requires"
good,Decent work . good culture. Great evironment with Good benefits with a decent opportunity for promotions. Fun team builds as well as team member appreciation week. Plenty of opportunities to learn about producta and specialty foods.
good,Overall felt that I was a valued employee at the Whole Foods Market. The team culture was excellent and management worked to make sure you knew you were doing a good job.
good,"Great place to start a career/ great place to learn about communication with customers and managers. would recommend to anyone starting out in the job market,"
good,Job culture is great but productivity is in high demand. I worked there before Amazon bought it out though in 2016. I heard the culture has changed a bit. Overall it’s a decent place to work.
good,"Whole foods is a great company. I worked there for about 11 years. Everyday brought a different challenge. As a supervisor, I was able to work closely with the  team members. As well as provide service to customers. Management is flaky, never there when you really need them. It forces you to make last minute decisions on you own.If you are blessed enough to have a well put together team, then your chances for success are great. If you have a leader who is cut throat. Then good luck with that.The benefits were great. I made more then enough to support my family. You accumulate time off the more you work. The stock options and 401 benefits have changed a lot now that amazon has stepped in. Overall, if you have a passion for food.  This might be the place for you."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to meet people from all different backgrounds/experiences and work with them toward a common goal. I worked with people who had been in the food industry their whole lives as well as people with masters degrees or in school. No matter what background you or your fellow team members come from, there is equal opportunity at WFM."
good,"The company is great to work for. Pay is great, benefits are amazing and there is a discount. The company is a good place to work. The only downside is they hire anyone that can work"
good,Whole Foods is a really great place to work. The company cares about its mission and does its best to promote excellence in and out of the store. I really have enjoyed my time with this company.
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods Market. I learned a lot about the culture of Whole Foods. Whole Foods is very accepting and encourages local businesses. We were not allowed to wear anything that was outside of our local area. For instance, I am a Pittsburgh Steelers fan and I was not allowed to wear my Pittsburgh Steelers attire in the San Mateo location."
good,Great Place all around. One of the few places that closed down but they helped relocate anyone who could actually move. The overall work was not stressful and the customers were all pretty understanding. If there was something that needed higher approval there was always some form of management willing to help.
good,I loved working for this company and was offered to relocate when our store closed down. I live in the South and they just arent there yet as far as healthy eating. My team and team leaders were awesome
good,A lot of my opinions and feedback were answered during the review process. I love the company and the people. The camaraderie will keep you coming back. The experience will make you stay.
good,It is a place that is very alive and there are new people in the store at any given time. I really like getting to know the people in the community and putting names to the faces that I pass on the street.
good,"A typical day involved chopping fruits and vegetables, we had to adhere to organic procedures and we would just make juices and coffee. We were constantly cleaning, organizing and restocking our supplies.  I think probably the only negative is that supplies was low every now and then."
good,Don’t really like working in food type of environment so it wasn’t really that interesting to me. But for the most part working there was okay but I won’t work there again.
good,"The Whole Foods family/employees are some of the nicest ive met. Everyone for the most part is polite to one another. The hours for new employees are going to always be later in the day. For the most part, they are very specific with the trianing there so you feel you know most everything you have to do in a shift. The only problem I have as someone who had to take out the parking lot trash, there is a lot of heroin use around there and needles most likely will be in the trash. Yet they never told me if i found one to report it to the security so the mall can handle it. So if they could be more specific about that, it would be great."
good,"The Best Part of my job is that I get to be apart in developing my team members and helping them on the path of success. Whether that is with Whole Foods or not, I like knowing that I've instilled a good work ethic and passion about our products in my team members. Nothing makes me happier than seeing them start to move up the ranks and get more and more excited about Whole Foods and our products."
good,"I loved my time at Whole Foods, management really cared about your career advancement, and the people I worked with became family. "
good,They certainly have their own culture and it is a very interesting and fun vibe working for Whole Foods. I certainly would not mind working for them again. I learned a lot during my time there
good,it would be way better if everything wasn't so expensive. or super far. but the food and culture were great. job opportunities were scarce and only obtained thru unnecessary methods
good,A typical day would be very busy. The work culture was safe and comfortable. It was a typical retail cashier job. Management was a little scattered. There was a high employee turnover rate. The hardest part of the job would be not having enough cashiers to be in the floor.
good,"I get behind the counter and immediately start working. I've learned to be a fast paced, multi-tasking environment.  The managers at this job are fair. Having to close the store, I'd say cleaning the slicers and taking care of the case is the hardest part of my job. I enjoy the public and have fun with them. Remember names so they feel comfortable."
good,Will always be a customer because I love the products that are offered and customer service is excellent  no one in the entire place ever says no and for that I love it
good,"I loved working here due to everyone being so open minded and friendly. I felt very accepted. I enjoyed the flexible hours, discount on fruit and such and free samples and products."
good,"Take your time with each guest. Prepare sandwiches, pizza, and prepared food case orders. Easy work environment to talk about food and help guest with meal planning. "
good,a typical day at work was relaxed because they just opened the store. Also the look for you to advance in the company which is good. i learned how to write on cakes thanks to that job.
good,I love Whole Foods for the Patience  and confidence and consistency  of the establishment great environment to work around would love to be there all the time
good,I loved working at whole foods south street. Even though I left I highly recommend this job to anyone looking for a job in the retail field. They pay you more than fairly and they have great benefits.
good,"I enjoyed working for a company that is driven by its mission, culture, values, and purpose. I felt like I as a part of something bigger than myself, and was able to make contributions both within the company and in the community."
good,"Whole foods had a great work environment. The supervisor was great and worked well with the employees. The hardest part was working overnights, it effected my daily life."
good,"The was never a dull moment working in the bakery. You can learn a lot or a little that all depends on your drive. The work was not hard but it's how much pride do you have in your work that made the difference. I enjoyed the on-going work. "
good,"Whole foods is a really good place to work. The work environment is very cool. An you get to conversate with the customers. It's a good family oriented place, and clean for the most part."
good,"Being one of the leaders in the natural and organic grocery store segment came as a result of many passionate hardworking team members.  The focus on product quality, supplier relations, quest for innovation, team member happiness and community involvement are those things that have truly made Whole Foods Market a please to work for."
good,I enjoy working for Whole Foods but need a change of pace. I would like to see what else I can do to show my true talent. Trying something new would push me to a new level.
good,Ive never seen so much product get processed per day. I loved it. I was good at keeping a fast pace throughout the day. I enjoyed the team I worked with and the willingness to teach and learn every aspect involved in my department.
good,"Whole Foods hires friendly, competent staff that aligns with their mission to bring healthier sustainable food options to the world. I always felt as though I was doing good for myself and the patrons that shopped at Whole Foods. The work environment was low drama and low stress."
good,"Whole Foods was a very, very fast pace position, which was great as it made the day seem short. I learned to work operate a cashier, to reconcile at the end of a shift. to train staff. to know about hazardous conditions that may affect sales. Whole Foods is very diverse, i love that. The hardest part is standing for long periods of time. Most enjoyable to meet all kids of people."
good,"Start the day off arranging the dish room, setting logs, and getting equipment together. Once dishes come in start washing, rinsing, then stacking in a professional manner. Document logs that require sanitation and temperature. Report to manager for any concerns."
good,Most of the employees and customers were very kind. Gained knowledge and nutritional facts and information on organic products. Great employee discounts and perks.
good,Big changes are being made within the company that are heading in a direction that makes everyone's jobs more difficult. Less labor to spend on staffing.
good,"I have been with this company for several years. I have had the opportunity to move around and work in San Antonio, Chicago, Houston and Austin. For the most part the people I have worked with and my Team Leaders are great. Some of store leadership that I have encountered have not been always been the greatest. There is a shift and a lot of things happening within the company. A downer is that with these changes it seems that there are fewer team members but more work to be done so it seems to spread teams thin."
good,This is a great place to work if you love the supermarket industry. They encourage personal growth and being part of the team.I genuinely enjoyed being with my co-workers and learning new things. Most people you work with are voted on and this makes the work situation way more comfortable as you get to pick your leadership. Gainsharing is wonderful and the perks are way better than any other grocery store I know about.
good,Working for WFM was one the best jobs I've had. I was not looking for a forever job but was delighted at the opportunities that were given to me. I loved the customers and team members and would go back one day if i needed to.
good,"Co-workers were great"
good,i thought it was run pretty well i enjoyed working there. i didnt like some of the management there tho. nice perks to the job. some of the customers bothered me
good,I was responsible to the customer service team.  I learned a lot about customer service working for them over 10 years.  The things that you learn will take you far in life.
good,"fun workplace and coworkers, i made a lot of friends."
good,Worked in a coffee bar daily. Made coffee and lattes to peoples specifications. Floated between cheese and the bar when needed.
good,"A typical day at Whole Foods Market is pretty interesting. You meet all kinds of people from all walks of life in a matter of minutes! I've been with the company since 2006 while I pursued my degree in illustration. I've learned a great deal about customer service and about working in a team setting. My co-workers are amazing as I've met many life-long friends. Management is chill, too. The hardest part is trying to not become too comfortable because I have skills and a passion for illustration so I have to keep a clear focus. The most enjoyable part are my co-workers and friends!"
good,"I loved the people at Whole Foods. I have never made so many friends in such a short time. There was also great potential to move up in the company, based on merit."
good,The work is good I spend my day talking to people about cheese while providing great customer service. Its a great work environment I love the people I work with also the company is for the most part good to us.
good,good place to work. the team members are the best part of the job and enjoy going to work. the work life balance is the toughest part because it is retail
good,"Whole Foods is a wonderful place to work, all of the people are very friendly, and the discount is not bad! I have worked here for two years and it has truly been a rewarding experience."
good,"I look forward to work everyday. Whole Foods is a great place to work. I have learned so much about health working here."
good,"Within the past two years I have worked at Whole Foods Market in the meat department as the Team Educator. This position’s tasks include; Thorough explanations of all programs that WFM audits to ensure non-gmo feed, animal welfare-rated, and of course organic vs. non-organic conventional products. While being employed by Whole Foods Market we try to integrate ourselves with the community & local programs like “farmer’s markets” and recently the Gay Pride Parade. As a Team Educator I take the responsibilities of any failures by my team whether it be ordering product for in-store sales or simply to give the customer service education they seek with the friendliness Whole Foods Market requires. The greatest part about Whole Foods was the customers and servicing them at the meat counter. The only drawback from this store was advancement further in the company. Most positions were hired from outside grocery stores instead of within the company."
good,Wonderful culture but little room for growth. I'd love to work with this company again but their monetary focus has begun to outweigh their core values.
good,"The people I work with are the reason why I enjoy my job as much as I do. If it weren't for my coworkers, I would not have stayed this long with the company."
good,Everyday involved teamwork and customer service skills. Learned about different meat cuts and got to know my coworkers because we were always together learning.
good,"I loved how corporate treats their employees on the lower levels, its a clean and fun work environment.  I was basically the maintenance, fixit and cleaning ."
good,"Working the front end at the register and customer service desk has been very rewarding.  I come to work daily and experience new health products and meet a variety of people from all backgrounds.  I have learned to communicate with different types of people and personalities that cross my register line."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service also how to deal with customers when they get out of hand. I enjoy everything about the job, i didn't have any problems doing anything the ask for."
good,A great place to work. i had an amzaing time getting to know the whole health food scene
good,Management did not work with my school schedule even though at hire they said they would.
good,their food are top shelf in my book. fast paced environment. positive energy all around. great team activities. did i mention that their food is great!
good,At Whole Foods Market the customer is the focal point of our ambitions.
good,"I liked working with others."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a fantastic company. They truly care for their employees and go above and beyond to assist their teams. The days zoom by with such wonderful people to work with, and the benefits are wonderful."
good,"Shifts were either between 6am-2 or 2-10. I would wash the previous dishes that were left over from the night before, and continue washing dishes and returning them to their proper location, occasionally helping chefs in the kitchen. I learned that everyone has their own way of doing things. Management was fantastic, they were very easy-going and understanding. Co-workers were also easy-going and super friendly. The hardest part of the job was the hours and when problems such as power-outages occurred causing dishes to pile up. The most enjoyable part of the job was working independently and sometimes in a small group or team in a fast-paced environment."
good,"It is extremely fun and relaxing to work at Whole Foods. The only problem with a retail company is the unset scheduling, you never know what you are going to work next week. Most nights, holidays, and weekends are required."
good,"I enjoy this company for there benits , pay and atmosphere. The customers are great, and the employees are strong natured"
good,"It was a culture shock coming from Wild Oats; we part of a corporate buy out. Over all I believe it was for the better, the company was run much more efficiently."
good,i really loved working at whole foods market as far as the customers was very nice and i always love the fact that the company gave out free examples of what ever it was that the customer wanted to buy for the first time
good,"I really believe that their are some employees through out the company who truly believe in the company standards. Some of those standards are organic integrity, commitment to healthy living and practicing fare trade with third world countries. These employees are extremely dedicated and keep up with the latest news in healthy life styles. However, this is not consistent throughout the company. Many of the members of management on a store level are young people in their 20's who cannot wait to leave work to go socialize at a local bar. You cannot grow within the company if your team is headed by one of these people. There is too much favoritism and rules that should apply to all employees are only applicable to team members who are not a part of the clique."
good,This company has an outstanding variety of Food Organic products The bakery and the hot bar have a variety of great food and there coffee and beer and wine bar is a comfortable place for an afternoon drink there meats and seafood very nice
good,"stable environment, with great colleagues. Management can be tough sometimes but not in the demanding way, in the way of favoritism towards certain team members."
good,"Fantastic work place and environment, they were very willing to accommodate my school schedule and seemed like they genuinely cared when I was involved in a serious car accident about a month in to working there. Though some of the management left a lot to be desired but that can be said about almost any work place."
good,"I came from some toxic work environments in my life, and starting here instantly made me feel excited and at ease. I love the coworkers I see day to day and I love learning new skills both relevant and semi-relevant to my area of specialty."
good,"Great community and management, enjoyed worked with everyone. High expectations from most customers. Large workload regardless of department assigned. However, if you do your share your team will take care of you."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work . You meet many people different backgrounds . I love working with people . Learning all the different products is amazing . This place is very high energy fast paced , very easy to lose track of time . Time flies when your working at a place you love ."
good,"Typical day involves orders for at least 20-30 items, shopping can go from 30 minutes to 2 hours."
good,"WFM was one of my favorite jobs, and I wish I was still there. However, upper management was difficult to deal with and did not care about teams and team members. The Amazon buyout made it a totally different company and vibe. Easy to move up if you just work hard and believe in the values."
good,loved it only left cause I had to go back to school. overall it was a great experience. the management team was wonderful. my boss was excellent loved him.
good,This company pushes their employees to apply for leadership opportunities and they have leadership training once every 6 months. The minimum pay here is $15 an hour and bakery management is AMAZING!!
good,At home feeling. Warm and very welcoming everyday. Holidays were amazing. Customers were very friendly as well. Staff members always showed appreciation towards each other. Whole foods taught me how to be patient and understanding when dealing with people on a day to day basis.
good,Amazing team and great hours during season. After season you can get as little as 4 hours per week sometimes not even on schedule to save labor hours.
good,The company has changed from the change in leadership. It has moved away from its past in customer service excellence to a more focus on Amazon's driven principles.
good,A typical day for me would be to go in and start working new live product to the shelves. This would usually be done with a six wheeler or a U-boat. Also maintaining and restocking the drink refrigerator with Waters and sodas for the customers. The rest of the day is usually spent restocking shelves with backstock.
good,Nice culture and good pay/ benefits. Loved the environment of Whole Foods everyone is nice and you can learn and discover a lot of healthy ways of living.
good,fun and nice working in here good people...i don't know what else to say just let me get out from your review thing......................THANK YOU....
good,"You will get good benefits, fair pay, but customer service must be excellent. Very demanding customers. Not easy to move up unless you fake it to make it. Safety and sanitation are very strict. "
good,"For my position, the department floater, you get work experience in every department that Whole Foods has to offer. Even in one day, you maybe placed in several different departments depending on where they need you the most. You're basically the fill in employee if they need extra help or someone calls out."
good,"i worked for the compagny over 7 years. i did customer service , also retail in the bakery department  as a packer, picked up clients orders and made sure i satistified them with their needs."
good,The work environment was perfect on a temporary basis for me.  It provided a structure i needed but the hours were all over the place. I was seeking advancement which they didnt have open for a while.
good,"Excellent atmosphere for working,friendly staff and management,healthy food ,close to my house,very clean store friendly,customers are very much happy with the food and service at the store"
good,"Everyone is awesome, the atmosphere is never boring, and the diversity is amazing! I loved it! The only down side was pay for me was to low. I started out with what they called the highest paid to start as a cook and then a few months later everyone was making the same amount. This is why I left."
good,"I was very nervous to start in such a big company like Whole Foods.It was a very good company to work for. There is opportunity to grow in the company, travel & transfer."
good,"I really enjoyed working there and my colleagues were very nice too . we got along pretty well and the manager was nice , he wasnt bossy . He took us through the work process and guided us anytime we needed his attention on anything . We worked together as family and it was great ."
good,"It's fun to go to work and work with so many people who love what they do.  That's what it's like to work for Whole Foods Market, Inc.  The life balance is rough on many people, but that is mostly because everyone cares and buys into the Whole Foods Market culture.  Whole Foods Market is a leader in a large corporation treating their employees well."
good,Very lucky to have had a very family feel to the store.  All departments worked together well. The culture is very team member friendly with lots of opportunity for advancement
good,"Great place to work. Never a dull moment. High Quality grocery & prepared food items."
good,"I had an overall really great experience at WF, it was a summer job while back home from college. I started off as a bagger then advanced to a cashier. I think this job was a great opportunity for me to enhance my people skills as well as overall work ethic."
good,"Good place to work. Great atmosphere. There was always something to do. Met great people, worked with positive peers. Never had any issues with customers."
good,They were a great starting point for anyone who is looking for work experience. They teach you skills you need to learn to preform in any work environment.
good,Whole Foods in my opinion is a really great place to work. the only thing that was frustrating for me was the schedule but because its a retail job I understand it would be hard to accomdate everyones schedule.
good,It's a great place to go and visit. The food is really good and all the employees are really nice and helpful. There are variety of food to choose from.
good,"I enjoyed WFM. Lots of characters, both associates and customers. Ability to work hard under stressful situations and laugh at the same time. I've heard their mission has changed fundamentally but I would work for them again."
good,Whole foods had a lot of areas where you could gain new skills and I enjoyed how flexible they could be with your schedule. I really liked the management there.
good,"WholeFoods is a great company to work for.  They give you as much training as you are willing to take on.  I learned a lot about food products, presentation, Organic products.  Management always has an open door policy to talk."
good,"It was a great place to get some work experience. But for a career choice was hard to move up. Although the pay was great, the wage raise wasn’t the best."
good,This job is a great step into the food business. I like the staff that I worked along side of and the experience was great. A lot of the information I learned was about the company itself but I did learn how to work a register and interact with customers.
good,Overall a good first job for anyone with a nice environment and fairly easy to get the hang of.Management is good and easy to get along with although it may depend on the store.
good,Whole foods was one of the best companies Ive ever worked for and given the opportunity I would work for them again! A typical day at work was filled with dealing with many different people at once but team work was always #1 with this company.
good,"A typical day at work is breaking the load that arrives and stocking merchandise. Previously, i have learn how to place orders and complete reports. The workplace culture is relax."
good,"At work no two days was ever alike everyday had its ups and downs but going to work was the best because of the people you get to meet."
good,"Working for Whole Foods Market was a great experience! The management listens and relates to their employees and relationships with customers are often built through verbal communication. The hardest part of everyday routine is the same as any other retail place--the grumpy customers that you seldom get. Other than that, the job overall is not too strenuous or difficult, but more often than not, there will be challenges that need to be dealt with!"
good,"During my seven months working at whole foods I had so much fun. On an average day you would be greeted with hugs, high fives, and words of encouragement from your managers and team leaders. I was a bakery team member so some days I was responsible for restocking cake slices, making fresh whipped cream, restocking the cookie display and of course the most important part of my shift which was taking care of the customers wants, questions, and needs. I learned so much in my short period of time spent with Whole Foods but they were lessons that were life changing. I gained some awesome buttercream  piping skills. I now know how to pipe a octopus and how to turn cake into little bee hive cakes.I thoroughly enjoyed working with my managers and team leaders. They always had positive attitudes, excited, fun loving, and full of kind encouraging words to get the team through the work day. I would have to say that the hardest part of working with Whole Foods was remembering the names and ingredients of somethings but with time that was no problem at all."
good,"Everyone here is so nice, products are great and just an overall great place to work. I am a team trainer so I train new hires on everyday tasks in the customer service department. Awesome company to work for."
good,It's a nice place to work full of friendly people the benefits are good for a single person the pay is also good recommended for college students or people just out of high school`
good,"Workplace is busy a majority of the time, but it makes the shifts go by faster. Breaks are required to be taken. Relaxed and kind workers, along with a majority of polite customers. Food samples are often in the break room, if working around holiday hours, meals are provided. Closing shift is rushed and leaves later than scheduled in bakery and prep foods"
good,I have not worked for a better team player company. I have worked for many retail shops but no place compares to Whole Foods. They really have great team members that love to help each other out.
good,The work environment is very neat and clean. People are friendly and willing to help out if help is needed. I would definitely recommended this for students. There are days when the work isn't so stressful.
good,It's a great place to work. The Customer and people are great. Management was good. My work experience was very good.  I meet a lot of people.  And also love management
good,I really loved the environment there and the people until they started to move around some management and things started to go down hill from there. its a good place to work and I really enjoyed my days working there.
good,Awesome place to work. Probably one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. The energy is great and for me at least the job isn’t hard. I get there check soups and see if I need to cook any chickens. Do that then go tend to a dish room that is most likely a mess but luckily the dishes aren’t hard to clean. Very easy job
good,I loved being at different stores. Worked in the bowery store and became supervisor only after a year...  I was the candy island/ bakery supervisor. I was young and the money was good
good,"I love working for Whole Foods Market. The atmosphere is very informative, intimate and friendly. The standards are top of the line. I have never felt more happy to go to work for a company before Whole Foods. I was hired on seasonally but if I ever was afforded the opportunity to work full time I would. I want to thank Whole Foods for the opportunity and being understanding and supportive."
good,"Good job, could be fast paced but never too bad. Great Discount, good people, Management depended on the Dept but mine was good. Good opportunity to advance."
good,"I really liked the atmosphere, it was nice working with my bosses and the crew, it could get stressful but we helped each other out. great camaraderie."
good,Its a fast pace place too work for and it was also very enjoyable too work at. I liked the whole job all the way around. Its a very nice place too work at.
good,"They treat team members well and the pay is decent. Coworkers are pretty friendly, but if you are very different or not assimilated they may treat you different. It can be chill at work or very busy, it depends on customers and how much is prepared."
good,In the time I spent at WFM I enjoyed the people that I worked with and never had any trouble with management there. They make it extremely easy to work for them and will reward you for hard work.
good,"I worked at Whole Foods Market for over 7 years, and had the opportunity to move across the country through them. Over all it was a wonderful career, I made a lot of great friends and there is a very strong culture. You meet a lot of personalities, it can be really stressful, busy, fun, amazing, good and bad management at times, no one is perfect, but I always believed in the company and the products. I loved the environment and my great co-workers the most. The benefits are fantastic, though the pay could be better for certain positions, especially living in cities where cost of living just gets higher all the time. I would recommend anyone work here, and I would have probably stayed longer had I seen myself advancing more there, however, tons of people who work there have been with the company over 10 years. It's the kind of company that has seen a lot of change and rapid growth, sometimes for good and not so good but, I learned and grew a lot and will always appreciate the company."
good,I worked as a cashier and customer service associate. I enjoyed working with team members and customers.  My time at Whole Foods was fun and I left feeling accomplished with my work.
good,I work at the Williamsburg location and I truly love it. This store is very special. Each department works so well together and its like we are one big happy family.
good,I wish i would of liked the produce dept because the workers were nice to me and helpful. I was planning to work my way to some type of department manager within that store. That is why i am reapplying to get into the department i originally wanted but was filled.
good,Whole Foods was a great place to work for the minimal time I was there. I would definitely recommend the job to friends and family. The employee discount starts at 20%!
good,Great place to work! I had a lot of fun and learned a lot about eating healthy and healthy foods. Good place to gain experience and and room to move around.
good,"I have worked in two different departments at whole foods and both of them have been a good experience. Working on the customer service team means you get to know everybody in the store fairly quickly. The most difficult part of the job (other than the occasional difficult customer) is remembering all of the codes for the fruit, but after a few short weeks it becomes almost muscle memory."
good,My time at whole foods was a culinary learning experience which allowed me the opportunity to sharpen the culinary  skill set I possess it was a great experience
good,"It was a great place to work, fast paced especially during holidays & snowstorm days. I worked for one of the top 10 stores in the company at University Heights, Providence,R.I."
good,"really believes in the mission and the products they sell good part time work, clean food clean eats, no to stress full environment and helps donate some food to local pantry"
good,"excellent company to work for, with a lot of opportunity for growth in all aspects of the company. Management is very flexible and willing to work with you to provide the best work schedule."
good,I loved working at whole foods. Everyday was different and the staff was always friendly and fun to be with. The days were very fast paced with always something to do. I loved my customers and helping them with learning new and healthy ways for changes in their life.
good,"Laid Back family originated work environment."
good,Great place to work if you like the cold and don't have a family. Great management team. Competitive wages and growth within the company. Didn't like the swing shift too much tho but other than that n the cold. It's a lovely place to work.
good,"i learned a lot about good team work and also that it was like my family, my home a way from home you could say, it was great to see the customers and have a one on one experience with them, but the one thing most of all that i miss from that place was the people i worked with. some of the best people you could ever ask to work with."
good,"I had a ton of fun in my time at Whole Foods Market.  I loved my team, they truly become a family.  Learned so much and had a lot of opportunities to grow myself and career."
good,"Performed gleasons hourly, meaning I made a complete round of the store  to check  for maintenance needs.  I leaned to supply customer needs on demand.  I learned to manage a diverse group of workers. I understand the grocery industry.  The hardest part of the job was nothing, I easily performed all duties.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing regular customers return and remember me."
good,I love working for Whole Foods great people good food amazing management team leaders and assistant team leaders they all know what they need to get done and communicate with one another which is key in any job
good,I wants go back to working as a cashier.  I got to meet so many different cultures of people who were non judgmental and that is hard to find. So being the with such great team members was awesome
good,To work this job well you must know the products well. The more you know and understand the products the better asset you will be to the company. Must be good with people and customer service.
good,"I enjoyed how organized my company was, i enjoyed our comm logs to help with cross trained team members as well as a quick update for our department. Easy to advance and learn new skills."
good,"Management was always very nice and kind. I would recommend working there. "
good,The workplace culture was relaxed yet effective. It was refreshing to actually want to go to work everyday. The business model gives employees tools to deescalate customer complaints to ensure a quality shopping experience.
good,"Depends on which department you work for, and who is on your team. Good part time job, but you can get burned out very quickly if you are a full time employee."
good,"A great place to work. Good pay, great benefits. "
good,"For me, it’s the perfect, last job! If you’re looking for something with consistency, decent benefits and surrounding yourself with a good culture then this is the place!"
good,"A typical day at whole foods revolved around making sure everything that needed to be done was completed or in the process of being completed. I learned how to make cannoli's, how to spoil and donate food, I learned how to FIFO, how to restock, and how to de-escalate a problem."
good,Awesome place to work. Learning about all natural products was the best. Being able to run the Meat and Seafood Department like a separate business unit was pretty cool also
good,"Working at Whole Foods for six years taught me a lot about healthy eating and the benefits of it. The culture at Whole food is family oriented all department knew each other, and it a significant amount of diversity among the team members"
good,Expectancy to be accurate and productive during the job. Slacking off will be seen by everyone and keep track of everything in your job proximity.  Either way nice people on the job and off it. Valuable experience.
good,"Whole Foods market does well to facilitate an environment where its team members work together to accomplish the tasks of their position. In terms of the meat department, the company and department teaches you about what separates the meat sold here from the meat sold elsewhere. There is a clear dedication to quality of product and service resulting in a solid workplace environment."
good,It was a great job but I’m looking for something a little less corporate. I left because I felt complacent  after a while and I just wanted a different opportunity.
good,"without having to relocate I would still be at Wholefoods, great people good culture, fair treatment. fast paced, high quality products. "
good,"the job is great , good employees, and managers they make you feel at home. the shift i was on everyone was cool calm and collect. its a fun job to start out as"
good,"I loved working here. They spend a lot of time on training to get better at your job. A typical day is meeting with customers/community, reading A LOT of emails. Meeting with team leaders. Meeting with team. Making sure that marketing collateral is in compliance. The culture is the best I have ever seen. The managers will hug you, if you welcome it. Hardest part of the job is that marketing doesn't have much room for growth. Enjoyable part of the job is the people. So warm and loving."
good,During my customer service role at Whole foods market I gained a great customer rapport with a very diverse group of people. Worked with a group of individuals who understood hard and team work.
good,Company cares about their employees.  Everything was about working as a team.  The store is located in a busy location so you can't easily stay busy.  This has been the one job I have had that they truly cared not only about customer safety but employee safety as well.
good,Whole Foods is a really cool company that I have enjoyed working at. I look forward to going to work and seeing all of my coworkers. Management could be a little better in my department but we make it work with what we have.
good,it was a great experience to work there. I'm happy i had the opportunity of being there and working with the company. i learned a lot of things that i can now bring to other companies.
good,"good place to work can be stressful at times but u meet new people every day you make good friends,also learn how to eat better and take car of you self better"
good,"Whole Foods is a fun, laid-back workplace. The team members are an amazing support system and they make you feel like family. The culture is fantastic and the team member discount and perks are some of the best I've seen. Health insurance is not very good and has a very high deductible."
good,"Working at whole foods I learned a lot about cake decorating. The environment was fun, and upper management seemed to care about the workers. The work hours are rough, but that's part of working in a bakery, Cakes need to be made, and the case needs to be filled before the doors open."
good,"A typical day consisted of taking phone catering orders, placing orders, charging customers and taking credit card information and  creating a catering order form.  Making sure the food was in stock to complete the production and completion of the order.  I prepared the food, all platters and stored the order in a special walk-in for catered items.  I then packed up the van and delivered the order. Returning the van to WFM.  Of course several orders could be delivered together on any given day."
good,Lovely people up and down the company. It can be stressful but this is better than a desk job. They teach you a ton about food and overall health and wellness.
good,I loved working at Pearl Street. Being a part of the Desk Team gave me the opportunity to see the store as a whole. I loved getting to see leadership work together to make sure our store was running smoothly.
good,"I worked for Whole Foods Part-Time for a year and a half. It was a wonderful experience. Great culture, co-workers, and great benefits. I would still be working there if I had the chance! would definitely consider going back part time if I ever needed to. I've made wonderful life long friends thanks to Whole Foods. If you are considering working here... I would say do it!!"
good,"Every day there always mixes to be made, when you don't know a procedure (since it is new tto you), it does not hurt to ask so you can remember again. There is a schedule that must be followed and completed before wrapping up for the day so it does enforce time management. There are many different cultures under one roof, each with their fair share of tales. The toughest part is remembering the schedule for each week because you do not fully know what you will do each week. Overall is was great experience."
good,"great place to work great employees, i start at about 10pm unload the truck restock shelves and i usually am out the door at 5am."
good,"A typical workday consisted of me engaging with the customers, ordering products, stocking incoming products, completing special orders, maintaining organized and clean area, creating ads and signs for new products, conducting sales."
good,"Whole Foods was a cutting edge company helping to bring organic foods to the forefront of the food market. They helped raise awareness about what’s in your food, from genetically modified organisms to preservatives and fillers.  Whole Foods success was due to a strong Team Member happiness based culture driven by a set of core values and a mission to change the world through good food. Whole Foods Market never has a cookie cutter approach to anything including new store build outs designing every store with a unique flare and new venues.  Whole Foods Market has been criticized as “whole paycheck” as they tried to hold on to their profit margin targets even when competitors were taking market share driving Whole Foods Market’s same store growth into single digits.  Now that Amazon bought the company some price adjustments, that have been long overdue has started happening.  Whole Foods Market is one of the best retailers on the planet, in my humble opinion."
good,"If you will do your job well and stand up for yourself/team you'll go far. Being helpful and informative got me far, especially since I was always looking for more training and work."
good,Workign with whole foods was great. I learned how to run and manage my own department with the help of their training and resources. My only regret is my desire to return to school made it difficult to work with the system in place and changes the company was making. Looking back I could have done things differently and may still be working there.
good,"whole foods was great, i learned a lot about the different types of products and meats such as the things that are bad for you in meats and about gluten. management was great when i was there"
good,while working at Whole Foods I learned a lot about seafood the grade of seafood the MSC levels and a lot more I also learned a lot about produce in the difference between organic and conventional
good,"set up the department, mange sales customer interactions and track inventory. great place to work offer great benefits wish my school schedule had never interfered"
good,"Pretty nice place to work, we employee day where we got free t-shirts, food and products. We had 20% off discount cards, and free coffee some mornings. They really care about their team members."
good,I've learned how to multitask better while being with the company and how to work better as a team. The hardest part of the job was only being short staffed and having to do a 2 person job.
good,Whole Foods is a great place to work. My coworkers are a great and helpful. My managers teach me well and they train us very well. Customers are great too.
good,It is a good and team working place. It has options to learn diversities of works and possibilities to upgrade skills. It helped to learn how to deal with customers.
good,"it was a good job pay was okay not the best, but the opportunity to move up is not there in some departments. the work environment is fast pace and professional. i did like the team members and enjoyed working with them and my assistant managers. working holidays were the hardest but the most rewarding if your able to work."
good,"Great place to work , mgt was always helpful / you knew what was expected of you on a daily basis . team work was a large function of the Bakery jobs."
good,"low stress , and its will promote just about anyone when they need to fill a position all you need to do is apply and you will most likely get the job , there are a lot of great people working hear and a supportive environment in the deli , a very hard job to loose."
good,"Typical day consist of lots of local residents of DTLA, food integrity is very transparent here, lots of options and departments to work in, & easy $!"
good,Only left after almost 14 years due to relocating my family to New York from California. Was a great company for both me and my husband. Very good to us
good,Hard to advance anywhere else once you work overnight. The benefits and pay were amazing but the culture was a bit hypocritical at times. Great for working with school hours however.
good,"People see Whole Foods as a step up from a grocery store, but once you work there you will see it is just like any other grocery store (I worked at Harmons previously.) The one difference is that the culture and the people that are hired here are amazing. I made so many friends and connect with so many like minded individuals. I think the pay and work-load is fair and balanced. I never felt stressed or like I took my work home with me. I would recommend working here to someone that wants to work part-time and make somewhat ok pay."
good,good company to work for. had a fine working relationship with the members of the team. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the extremely high standards of management.
good,great company to work for not a career. Gives great hours. benefits are pretty pricey for part timers. turn over rate is actually pretty high from my opinion.
good,i loved whole foods for the major fact its little to no work with alot of hours and great hourly pay. Some of the management need improvement though. They need to appreciate and protect their associates more.
good,"I really enjoyed working here.  Management is very open and generous with training and advancement opportunities.  Work is difficult and challenging at times, but I found it to be very interesting to be able to sample and learn about so many different types of produce.  Never had any issues with coworkers that were not immediately resolved by leadership.  Hardest part of the job would be the customer service component, but that comes with any customer facing job."
good,"Company has changed much over past two years, but still a great company to work for. Decent pay and plenty of advancement opportunities. Leadership is difficult though because expectations aren't always clear."
good,When I was working it was tough because of the time I went it at and at the time I was not driving so I really had no life had to depend on public transportation.
good,A typical day working at whiles food is have a great interaction with customers as well as your co- workers. Getting to know someone and making sure there time spent in wholes food has been  a sucess.
good,"I was working here for a few months as a seasonal associate but I was let go die to the fact that the season ended, I was told I would be kept if I did a great job but then I found out that I was supposed to reapply and they didn't let me know at all. Overall the people are nice but some of the managers just do what they please and if they don't like you , then you're pretty much screwed."
good,"Every job has it's ups and downs, but working for WholeFoods is pretty good. The people I worked with were amazing and the pay is better than a lot of the other workplaces that deal with food and the hours depend on how busy the store is. There is not a lot of room for growth, there is a lot of favoritism, it's hard to transfer from store to store...  Overall, it's a good place to work for. If you apply to WF and get hired, just do what you have to do."
good,"Great team"
good,Working at Whole Foods Market is a productive environment. The company is great in working with your availability. The enviornment works well with others.
good,"For the requirements, this is a pretty great job. If you can get full time, get it. That's when the benefits really show. But it's all around a great place to work. Friendly teammates, (usually) reasonable management, great discounts, and a very relaxed and casual environment. I just wore jeans, a non-offensive/non-competitor t-shirt with any no-slip shoe, boot, or sneaker and the provided apron."
good,"When I was at Whole Foods, it was actually very exciting. Seeing how many customer were all about their health was very motivating. I still to this day shop there and the store just keeps getting better."
good,"I like working at wholefoods, it is fun and you get to meet people all the time. A typical day is just about everything, you are not limited on anything."
good,It is a great company to work for. Learned that I am very outgoing when it comes to customers needs. The most enjoyable part of my day when working there was seeing a happy customer.
good,"This is an interesting place to work. You will have opportunities to learn about food and organics, they offer profit sharing. The management is quite very experienced. Good work and positive environment"
good,This is by far the best company to work for. They offer great opportunity for advancement. If u love working with people than this is the best company to apply with. Great compensation.
good,It has  a very good work culture.They share profits with their employees.Most enjoyable part is discount you get on all good products.Management is also good.Co workers are very supportive.
good,"Interacting with people from all walks of life."
good,I was a venue cook at the taco bar cooking recipes and serving customers. Was resoonsible for keeping our venue and kitchen clean.
good,The company is top notch.  I found the job hard but valued there worth ethics.  I learned that this was not the career path for me.
good,I am pleased with my experience with this company. I thrived in my position and was able to transition into other stores easily. I grew as a young adult working here leaving me with lessons.
good,"Loved this job. Great employees and management team. Working for the company was a great experience, learned a lot during my time with the company."
good,Whole foods is a strong believer in being a actual team instead of a bunch of employees. I enjoy working here because of all the opportunity to grow they provide.
good,"A typical day of work was always to say hello to everyone and just starting to do whatever you had to do. What I learn in Whole Foods was about the genetically modified organism aka GMO. I also learn to do excellent customer service and create many good relationship with customers. Management though was kinda good, I mean they sometimes I had to get condiments fill out however sometimes the product never came. Until I finally knew the person that orders product then I started to receive products. The hardest part of the job was actually was how popular the place was. In the apartment I worked, It was busy all the time so you will have to work really hard in a few hours. But even if it was hard to keep with the customers, there was a nice atmosphere with your co-workers and there were some customers that were really nice."
good,"Great Company to work. Very chill and your manager ALWAYS ask you how are you doing and do you need any help. They ALWAYS want you to go on two paid 15min break between if you have 6 hour shift and you also get unpaid 30min lunch break. All the workers are always happy and I never heard anyone said I don't wanna work or anything like that. In general management don't really want you to stress out so that you can provide a good and friendly customers service. The benefits of 401K and other stuff is Ok, nothing special. Even if the company is great of course there's always a bad apple anywhere you go.  You will not get along with everyone in this world."
good,"overall pretty good job and great atmosphere,  my only concern was the management at the time wasn't that great they had their favorites. the work hours are pretty good but sucks having to get stuck with mid shifts all the time."
good,"Busy, fast paced environment with lots of opportunity to advance in the company. Flexible schedules to accommodate your personal life with work. management is willing to work with you to learn new roles."
good,"Extremely collaborative and bottom-up management. The culture drives the environment and the work and rightly so. Everyone believes in the larger mission. Politics is still a factor, and cultural fit and relationships are a higher priority than specific skills."
good,I've worked for Wholefoods for over 10 years. I've had my ups and downs mostly ups though. You have to really work hard now to advance in the company but when you do it's totally worth it.
good,"A typical day at wholefoods was simple if knowing and understanding your job. "
good,"the culture is a live, friendly place to work, high labor involvement "
good,"a typical day would be a 8 hour shift with amazing customers who are curious about living a healthy life "
good,"I really believed in the product and it was a great place to work."
good,"Great culture, the company is changing but overall enjoyable to work with. Prep foods is intense lots of CIA, Lincoln Cul. and other degree holding chefs. Former Team Leader left a toxic atmosphere, but the team is bouncing back under really great new leadership. Store leadership is great in Danbury. New store, positive vibe to the culture of the store. Close team member connections."
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods Market. I got to do a bit of everything in my position and was given creative control to run my portion of the business. It was great! "
good,Working at whole foods was such an great time almost made supervisor. Had car problems that's why I didn't. But the environment was all together great. Everyone was nice and helpful. Really wish I could have stayed.
good,"Able to help customers find what they want. "
good,"i would go and take care of the dish room, help out in the dining room. the managers there were great, friendly. My coworkers were very helpful and fun to work with. the hardest part of my job was trying to finish on time. i enjoyed everything about this job"
good,"concern of for the community and environment"
good,good food and nice people. very fun and comfortable workplace. lots of good organic things to choose from and fresh food.
good,"1.Employees MUST be at work on time no matter what."
good,"Fun place to work, a lot of growth within the company. Management team is always there to support you in any needs. Benefits are great, bonus, field trips."
good,I have absolutely loved my time at Whole Foods Market but I would love to do something else. Overall it has a great culture and the benefits are great. Recently the management has not been what it should and thats caused alot of people to either leave or change teams.
good,A typical day on the job is providing the excellent customer service from you start working. Making sure the food looks presentable for the customers and keeping area clean.
good,"Whole Foods is one of the best places I've ever worked.  I can't complain about the quality of my team and the job culture, as well as, the food culture.  Team Leaders and Store Leaders, alike, do their best to educate and keep all team members informed and growing.  The Gain Sharing and health benefits are also bonuses as well as the atmosphere and the friendships cultivated."
good,The company offers great pay and amazing benefits. How much you like the job depends on who you work with.
good,"I did work for the sea food department preparing ready to eat foods, I did learn a lot about fish and sustainability. It was a great place to work! The hardest part was the schedule with a lot of nights and weekends."
good,Great Company with great team members and endless opportunities to grow within the company!
good,"Come in with a smile on my face to greet fellow co-workers rocking the same perma-smile. Customers were friendly and curious. And the people working there shared so much knowledge with excellent training, both video and hands on."
good,"great customer service "
good,Working at Whole Foods taught me great customer service skills. I had an amazing relationship with my management team and co workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I made customers happy just by being a joyful employee.
good,"I was able to advance, had a flexibel schedule, and bring my expertise about food to the forefront. Met amazing Team Members and customers. Fantastic management staff."
good,Great work environment. I worked with great people and the company's quality standards are superb.
good,"Took care of guest at every turn"
good,"a day at work in wholefoods market would be greeting the customers ,make they're coffee drinks during the morning rush. Roast coffee with the coffee roaster that's my favorite part .pack out items for display and to keep everything in tip top shape for our customers to shop.  everyday you learn something new at wholefoods they offer classes to learn about their core values the importance of our planet earth . my co-workers are the best to work with we all work together as a team.  the hardest part of the job is when it gets busy . but we  can manage it. the most enjoyable part of the job is our customers. "
good,I meet all walks of life. learn about products all over the world. experience health and taste of products.
good,A typical day at wholefoods is relaxing all the staff are outstanding i have leaned a lot its like a big team...The management is outstanding and very understanding. the hardest part of the job for me was nothing i can think of  I'm a people person.. the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers...
good,A typical work day starts at 5:00 a.m.  I have become a very reliable and competent Manager.  Mangement is sometimes not equal with upward mobility.  I really get along with my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is the distance from my residence.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the quality of food and services we delivrer.
good,The store I worked was one of the most pleasant environment that I have ever experience. All the employees were great individuals that took pride an joy being there. Department managers were always understanding and flexible with their crew. Overall a wonderful place to work.  
good,"cashier, all basic cashier duty."
good,a joy to see your co-workers every day . I learned core values management is pretty good .my co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was understanding the different languges. And the most happiest would be you would never stop learning .
good,Hands down great place to work at especially while attending college and the flexibility of the work week.
good,I started there as my first job at 18 right after graduating high school. the coworkers were very friendly it was fast pace but i caught on quickly.
good,"I was happy working at Whole Foods - they gave me a raise while there and put me in charge of Graphic Design for signage, while I also collected overtime in Grocery overnight stocking shelves and in the Produce department."
good,"Great people, great products, great values. They treat their employees like no where else I've ever worked."
good,"The relaxed dress code kind of signals what working there is going to be like. When they refer to the departments as ""teams"" they really mean it. Team leaders aren't pointy-haired bosses but leaders of a team effort who are not offended by feedback. You can honestly walk into any leaders office and chat with them, from the CEO on down. Pay is fair and the benefits are very good. You get to vote on which benefits you want every few years. Great place to work!"
good,I work very hard at whole food i like to stock the shelve so the guest can shop for there item and the thing that need.
good,I liked working there. I learned how to work as a team. The management was excellent and the co-workers. It was not hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting everything right.
good,I worked for Whole Foods Market for two and a half years. Life was great until the construction in the surrounding area killed the customer traffic we had coming into the store.Because of this the store began to downsize and I was one of the ones choosen to be let go. The managers were easy to work with and very respectful and showed compassion if you were sick or hurt. The pay was great and the benifits were one of the most competitve packages I have ever had. Would definately work here again.
good,in this company i learn so many things that i never know and the most important part its excellent customer service
good,"a typical day at work was constantly on my feet most of the day, being able to lift heavy stuff. Learned to prioritize work related tasks and increased my ability to communicate with customers. Management was great, very friendly and down to earth."
good,"High morale, incredible benefits, modern business model, relaxed environment, flexible hours and generous schedule accomodations, most all employees become friends, too!"
good,"I worked part time here while going to graduate school and they were very accommodating to my schedule needs. I worked in the Whole Body Department and it was a great place to talk to people about their health and nutritional needs. Management seemed to be overworked in my opinion, which I guess is pretty normal in retail. It was an overall good experience."
good,Team that you work with will make you fell welcome and part of the group. It takes a little while to advance to a higher position but if you work hard and be patient it's worth it.
good,"Fast pace job , different from any other grocery store you work with people that care about the products and the guest . You learn something new there everyday from eating healthy to cooking ."
good,"The hardest part of the job is flexibility."
good,"Pay rate is good, management is really good.The scheduling is very flexible especially if your in school. You get good benefits. This is a good place to work"
good,"Good atmosphere, repetitive job. "
good,Lots of fun with the time i spent there. met lots of good people and the management was really professional and could help make your schedule. was terrible during the summertime getting carts.
good,"Working at Whole Foods Market, I learned so much about new up and coming beer companies while staying well informed with already popular breweries. It was a learning experience I will never forget. Aside from the work aspect of it all, the regular customers and peers made the work environment that much better. Everyone was friendly and resourceful."
good,"Before Amazon merged, Whole Foods was an excellent place to work. It seems that it went slightly down hill after that. I remember when the founders of the company would always say that they would not sell or merge."
good,I enjoyed working for Whole Foods Market. Great overall teamwork and fun work environment. They do expect a lot from their Team Members; but the benefits out weigh what is expected.
good,"full summary working at Whole Foods is that it’s potentially succeeds to its reputation. Treats you like family, and feel accepted. The kind people and hard working people are amazing. Makes you feel better about going to work."
good,"Good place if you want to have a career I would highly recommend it right paid vacation days"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have the freedom to just walk around the store and help out customers. Hopefully brightening their day with assistance. It was a great atmosphere.
good,"Working at wholefoods is was never a none busy day. So you was always productive, moving around doing something. If your having a bad day before work just know you'll leave wit a smile. The team members and customers make you feel better , like thieve knew you for years."
good,Streeterville mary beth is the worst management overall the store is messy snd unprofessional the company is great to work for just not that location so apply but make sure its not for streetervill they are racist there all women management they play favoritism and all
good,"Out of all of my previous jobs, Whole Foods by far was my favorite work place. I am currently trying to get back into Whole Foods. Do your work and your work will reward you."
good,"In the beginning management was very caring, nurturing and hands on while at the same time allowing me room to explore and grow.  The hardest part of the job was that 90% of it was done on my own. The most satisfying part of the job was helping people with their dietary challenges, watching people transform to a healthy lifestyle, helping people manage heart disease, diabetes and other health issues.  Watching people grow and progress."
good,"Day-to-day work is good, not as flexible for contractors as full-time. I've been able to learn a lot and put skills I learned on paper into valuable real experience. There are times where I have time on my hands, but I am able to use that time to practice relevant technical skills."
good,"allways a chance to move up in the company,than whole foods getting from the street,can learn a lot from store manager.the team leaders are also great to learn from"
good,"In my experience with Wholefoods, "
good,I have worked in many different roles and Whole Foods has been the most enjoyable culture I have ever been involved.  I have been there almost two years and have not met an unhappy employee.  The management is great.
good,"Positive working environment, they teach you a-lot about whole foods and why it is special compared to other companies. The management was good, they treat their employees well. They were very lenient with attendance."
good,"I love my job here!  It's a relaxed and laid back place.  Some team members can be a bit fragile, but we conquer our problems through love and understanding."
good,"Yes Whole Foods always provided the necessary tools and training to put their employees in the best possible situation to succeed. Management was always attentive to any needs, concerns or suggestions that an employee may have had.There was always room for advancement and was encouraged."
good,"This is a great company to work for, although my manager was difficult with me about my school hours and that’s why I left, the company as a whole was great and gave lots of benefits!"
good,Pretty fast paced but doable for most people.  Interaction with customers throughout the day. No overtime allowed most weeks. As long as you are doing your work you wont have much trouble.
good,A great company to work for.Its just some of the leaderships are very disrespectful at times.They talk to you any kind of way and also just walk around giving out orders.
good,"The environment in Whole Foods is awesome. The products are top of the line and it is just a positive place to be. "
good,amazing work place. worked there for over 4 years. learned and lot. achieved some things  along the way. There was always room for growth and promotion from within.
good,"Nice place to work, and job security. You will always have something to do. The job is not stressful. Pretty good benefits, the pay was average. Try it out"
good,"The experience was awesome to have worked in a city where I'm born and raised. There work ethics are good, needs more understanding of team members lack of communication."
good,"If you enjoy a fast placed environment, work here. Nice and friendly people work here and generally help with most of the work load. Some customers can be super obnoxious to be around."
good,"Working at Whole Foods was an exciting and wonderful experience. The employees were awesome and opened minded. I enjoyed working with the people and customers. Management were supportive and flexible to work with.  If you plan to work there expect to work a lot  because it gets extremely busy. There's lots of perks if you work there. However, the pay rate and benefits are not good."
good,I would come in before the store opened and cut fruit then juice.  I worked in the freezer because the juicing machine was in there.  It was cold but if you wore the right clothes it was comfortable.
good,"We are required to help customers within 5 feet. We are expected to provide excellent customer service and walk customers to products and hand the products to the customer. We are expected to satisfy, delight and nourish our customers. We are also supposed to provide a customer-centered experience."
good,Very nice people all around a great place to work. The environment The Culture The Different Things You Can Learn! Some Foods Have a story To Tell. The staff is always friendly an ready to help
good,the work culture is great they really care about making team members welcome in there first week. the only thing is hard is the rude customers. but fun place to work at
good,"I would still be working there if I did not relocate to a place where there is no Whole Foods. I really felt a part of the team and believed my managers were excellent, which was surprising."
good,"I enjoyed working at Whole Foods because of the team atmosphere. All of my coworkers and managers were very personable and made the long shifts worth while. The job and tasks became a little mundane after awhile, but every day presented a new challenge and, like I said, the team made it worth it."
good,"Great energy with Team Members and customers.  Management was out of touch with culture and always seemed to have a hidden heavy hand.  "
good,I enjoyed my brief time at the job. The team members were very friendly and eager to assist if needed. The environment was pleasant to be apart of. Overall good place to start your work history if needed.
good,I liked working there and enjoyed the experience overall. Could have paid slightly better but the job was very easy so it is understandable. Would work there again
good,Whole Foods is great company with high standards. I truly enjoyed my time working with them. When I started with them I had a great skill set for the position and WFM helped me grow as a meat cutter and and manager.
good,"While it was an insane amount of manual labor, the number we were quoted was 7,000 calories per 8 hours. There would be days where we would be done by lunch, and days where we would go past 10pm; both rarities to be sure. I've never had a work culture where I loved every single person I worked with, what I was doing, and my bosses. If not for the developing of asthma, I would still be there today."
good,"Whole Foods has a one team one dream ideal, which helps all employees work together and successfully complete tasks. The atmosphere is nice and stores always easy to navigate."
good,"The best part of working for Whole Foods Market was the absolutly great work culture that mission that was part of everyone. "
good,I feel like the kitchen crew can get some more help. They should always have someone helping everybody do something. It’s a very busy place to work but you can make it easy if you had that extra help
good,"Wholefoods is a great place to work and shop. As a team member, you are given a 20% discount card for shopping in the store. The health insurance could be better. Management is very understanding when it comes to family and life. Very flexible."
good,I enjoyed my time at Wholefoods. I loved the environment I enjoyed the ability to progress had I stayed there longer. The management was great and I would recommend it to college students.
good,Of my years at this company I have met some amazing people who have had a great (positive) impact in my life and overall work ethic! I have learned a ton about what good customer service really means. Everyone i have met was always enthusiastic and helpful along my employment.
good,Whole Foods Market is a great company to work for. The culture and core values that the company withholds is unlike any other company I’ve worked for or with. The needs of the team as a whole is a priority and the focus of the company is always on the well being of both the customers and employees. Here you’ll find a team that is passionate about food and health as well as customer service and providing the best service possible to new and old customers alike.
good,"I worked in the bakery at whole foods. It was very demanding and fast paced but my team members made it fun and worth it. Scheduling always changing so no consistent schedule, which was annoying."
good,Working for whole foods gives the opportunity to move up through out the company as long as you stay up to date on exams and speak to management on a regular bases.
good,Works with my school schedule. Offers paid time off and raises every 6months to 1 year. Many very approachable managers and fun events within the store.
good,This company seemed to good to be true and it proved me wrong. Management was great always willing to listen and showed respect for everyone. The pay is $15 which is great for the area I live in. The benefits were good but there’s room for improvement in a few areas. I’ve never said this about a job but I wish I was still there.
good,I worked a small store so we had plenty of friendly reoccurring customers. the staff was all amazing. plenty of chance to move up within the company along with diverse selection of different jobs.
good,Company treated team members well. Chances for advancement. quality products and service. Learned a lot about products and service. Lots of changes due to amazon acquisition.

good,"Loved working there, management is hit or miss. Loved helping customers find the products they needed by utilizing my skills and nutritional background. Overall great place to work, awesome perks, and great co-workers that become friends!"
good,Whole Foods Market is a great place to work for college students. The flexibility of hours and management understanding makes you want to stay until you graduate college.
good,"empresa aberta a receber novos integrantes, respeita diferenças e é intolerante a preconceito, fofocas e comportamento nao profissional."
good,"I was a independent consultant therefore this does not apply to me."
good,"Whole Foods exemplified the value of a team and collaboration. Management was open to ideas from all team members, and the workplace culture was very positive."
good,"I loved working at WF because of the culture; whether the customers or teammates, WF has interesting people coming through the doors who are open to converse. I also liked the amount of color and diversity in the store, and how things were always changing"
good,Whole foods has hands down the best work culture for a basic grocery store job. I enjoyed all of the benefits offered by the company and the wonderful environment. All of the employees are very supportive and the worst complaints I ever heard while working there were that employees stayed to long.
good,Fast paced environment with highest quality of customer service expected.  Position advancement possible and wage is reasonable.  Fun place to work and meet a variety of customers.
good,"Loved my time at whole foods. Great teammates, fun work and understanding management. Corporate enough to have good rules set in place, but warm enough for people to understand when you have problems."
good,"Casual and busy, not boring with lots of challenges. job culture is strong and a good balance with life. there is always someone to cover your shifts and people is always nice."
good,"Job was fine. Costumers were the worst part. Rude entitled people who would literally cry over a 5 cent bag refund. Saw multiple people go through checkout with loads of produce and then immediately go to costumer service and complain saying they were overcharged and things were rang in incorrectly. (They were not) Management was really good and friendly. Would give the costumers whatever they wanted, but had the employees backs as well."
good,"I have no Terrible words for this job i didnt work there long, but the staff and managers were so nice to me, i just had a tough time managing my schedule at the time but if i was to ever work there again i know for sure id do better, they gave me a shot when i didnt even have all of my identification they took me with what i had and i will forever be grateful."
good,"i loved working at whole foods. the management team was amazing and would do anything to make your job more pleasant. if not for the costly commute, i would still be working there"
good,"Great place to work. A typical day included managing aisles, stocking shelves, working backstock, and customer service. Management is good for the most part. The workplace culture is great."
good,The day would begin with a meeting and you grabbing your eletric pallet jack. From than on you are just picking orders and stacking pallets with music playing.Its an very nice place to work if you can handle the physical labor.
good,I've grown exponentially as a person and professional in the four years that I have worked for Whole Foods Market. They care very much about the growth and success of their team members and take every situation as a teaching moment.
good,Amazon bought them and changed the core. The departments merged and or split after sales drops. The company was not ready for the change and it was hard to comply
good,"Though busy and overwhelming because of many customers that leech onto the deals and organic or conventional healthy lifestyle, it’s worth the stress!"
good,"This company is amazing, the management is very caring to those that actually do their job. The location that I work at has some of the best staff around."
good,I loved working for whole foods. but with the new increase and merge with amazon my position got cut. I would still work there if i had the option. the pay was nice and most customers are great.
good,"I started working at whole foods when I was a freshman in college. I am a junior now and I worked there for 3 years. I think it is a great and fun place to work! The customers can be entitled and snobby, but there are people like that everywhere. You just have to know how to solve problems appropriately and have patience! It can be face paced when it gets busy, but when you are young, you do not think of it as being a hard job! The employees are amazing and everyone treats each other like family. We all help each other out and care for one another. The employees were my favorite part about working at whole foods, and also the holidays! Another thing I enjoyed was team member appreciation week and how they go all out for employees! There are so many employees from different departments and we all get shown appreciation from team leaders and other co workers. We get proper training and all of the team leaders are flexible with schedules."
good,"Great working environment, fun  and the people there are great to work with. You will learn a lot about organic and non organic,GMO and etc. Honestly i don't think i've had a bad day there"
good,I very much enjoyed my time at Whole Foods - they have an incredible culture that feels like being a part of a team and family. I did notice a shift occurring when my time with the company came to an end (less focus on the graphics and marketing team with some layoffs of positions) but during my time there it was an INCREDIBLE experience I wish that I could have again. They also greatly cared and made an effort to make me a well-rounded professional and my manager was a mentor.
good,Loved working here and employment opportunities were fair. I witnessed some favoritism with some managers but that is to be expected in every job. Otherwise I would still be working there if I didn't have to move.
good,"When I was employed there, the environment was great and the people very helpful. The starting pay was good for the time I worked there. Management friendly and helpful when needed."
good,Whole Foods Market is a great place to work and learn the retail game. They provided the tools needed to move up in the company within the store level.
good,Whole Foods is a very good company to work with and is a place where anybody can grow and become whatever they want to be in there. As long as your work ethics’s are there you can move up to as far as the store team leader in the company.
good,"You can become part of a team that can feel like family, expand your Foodie knowledge while furthering a possible career in the food and supermarket industry including a path of management."

good,"great  company to work for, pay could be better and positions got cut once amazon took over. but still great place to work. very laid back managers as long as your are doing your job you will be fine."
good,My experience with whole foods was a good experience from the managers to the customers. I learn many new ideas and learn to collaborate with my co workers and managers to ensure the best shopping experience to the customers. Leaving work everyday I had the sense of accomplishment for the role I was in.
good,"Be prepared to cry and get up set, nice pay. They don’t let you relocate to a store near your home if it’s closer to you to travel to. They don’t offer medical leave unless your one year in , it’s bad . I broke my leg and they didn’t even care"
good,A typical morning would consist of stocking the cases back from the night before. I learned how to be a great leader. Management was so so.Workplace culture was amazing everybody gets along.The hardest part of the job was so of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the vibe of the company.
good,"I loved my experience working at wholefoods. It was one of the most enjoyable jobs ive had. The regions are very different, the northern states are more strict when it comes to alot, but no complaints still! overall great company to work for especially in a transition or if you want to work your way up. Awesome benefits too!!"
good,"Worked here during grand opening and over all this company is very quality based on their organic products. What i loved most is that they provided knowledge on their products and merchandise for employees to learn about when engaging in product related conversations so one is familiar with what they buy before we sell it to them and that is 100% golden Customer service!!! Great team to be apart of!"
good,"Not much of a 401K match - having said this, it was voted on by all team members. They wanted other benefits."
good,it is a great please for young adult to work. best thing was Whole foods discount card and the team members are friendly. It is like being around a fmaily.

good,"I like the culture and integrity of standards represented in the company. It offered me alot of opportunities along with advancement, and excellent pay increases based on performance"
good,"Had a wonderful time there and learned a lot about people, food, and cultures. The environment was pleasant and productive. The management did an excellent job of trying to fulfill team member requests."
good,"Not too bad, lots of work but the pace of working there kept me entertained and focused. Lots of friendly faces and everyone was mostly helpful. I enjoyed working on the front end and helped improve my own understanding of natural foods and health products. My management team was pretty amazing, and I enjoyed their guidance throughout my time there."
good,Whole Foods was really good to me. They cared and made work feel great to come to. They care for their employees and get to know them individually. Every job comes with rules and consequence so I cant say if I did something out of company policy or the employee handbook I didn't deserve the consequence.
good,Cool place  to work. And  really relaxing  I really missed working their but the manager at the warehouse are not fare and try to or work  you. But I love the store food it’s really good
good,"Whole Foods Market has been the best place I have worked at so far. I have not had any issues with any of my fellow employees, I feel respected there, and love working there each day."
good,"I was a member of the grocery team in the dairy department. Management was great, the team and people were great. Some days were harder only because of the amount of work needed done but it was enough to keep you occupied for the entire shift. Worst part like in any job in retail is that the customers can be very rude."
good,Fun place to work at. Unless you are planning to move up it can get boring. After a while regardless it can get repetitive but I mean what job doesn't.
good,I like working for Whole Foods. It’s a friendly environment. Always opportunity’s to love and grow. I recommend the job to anyone. Very nice bosses and mangers.
good,"I liked it. The Brighton Branch was a wonderful place to spend your time behind the counter. Good people. "
good,"The management was incredibly knowledgeable and taught in a fun, informative way. Additionally, the amount of management classes offered were very beneficial for my retail career."
good,"great food practices a great culture!"
good,"My coworkers went to the same school, so we always had a great time. Management was very approachable and friendly! Amazing job when in school, managers always worked with you for your schedule. I learned a lot about food regulations and stuff, very eye opening. Wasn't very hard at all."
good,I believe that working at Whole Foods Market has been a very great experience. I have learned a lot from the head chef and would recommend working there to anyone who would be interested.
good,i would highly recommend working at Whole Foods Market the environment of that establishment is fun but never forget its still all about work. One of best working experiences i've ever had in life.
good,I worked in the prep food section so I would work the case and make sandwiches and pizza. I had a great team and although it was a fast pace job I had fun.
good,I worked at Whole Foods for a number of years and enjoyed almost all of it.  Until the upper management was changed and things fell apart.  This led to many good employees to leave.
good,"My experience with the company was great. I started nov 10, 2010 and shortly after i was promoted to supervisor. Their training process was very effective and faced paced. My duty as a produce supervisor was challenging but i enjoyed it."
good,It was relaxed thanks to the management team and fellow coworkers. When it did get busy everyone was in sync and we were able to handle the rush of customers.
good,Very nice place to work and the food is great and healthy and great pay and friendly environment there was a lot of opportunity to grow within company I learned a lot of different ways to create good entrees and sandwiches
good,This is my part-time job and I truly love it! I got it because I want to travel more and I needed extra money. Very pleasantly surprised by the discounts and benefits for employees.
good,I always ran into such nice people we didn’t everything to keep the environment clean. We used paper instead of plastic and we made sure we always put customers first
good,The store that I now work at isn't intimidating in the slightest. It's a smaller location with only a few registers. This leads to a job that's basically like working with family. Everyone knows each other really well and we all do our best to help out other departments when we can. Some of the customers are regulars and have their favorite employees they go to see.
good,"WFM had a workplace culture that was friendly and accepting. Management allows you to be flexible in regards to efficiency. For example, if you figure out a better way to get something done, they'll be open to your suggestion."
good,A day at whole foods can leave you wanting to take better care of yourself. Everyone is very willing to help and take there time to make sure you are satisfied.
good,"I learned to bag groceries and to be helpful and polite to customers.  The staff taught me how to do a good job and were very patient with me.  Also, I had a job coach to help me."
good,Whenever I'm at work I feel welcomed by all the positive energy from the workers. Attending to every persons needs in every department. My coworkers and I always treated our job not as fun but as a learning experience on how to handle every situation handed to us.
good,Everyday was always a new learning experience working in the produce department. I worked with a very great team and had a very strong team leader who would always check in and answer any questions we had.
good,Whole Foods pays very well and takes care of their employees. The work is definitely worth the pay. They are understanding and they work with your schedule.
good,For most of my work experience at whole foods we enjoyed the pleasure of having successful and excellent management. However before I left we had a new manager come in and replace the previous one. She was in charge of the customer service section and was a nightmare. Turnover increased 200% during her time there. I was one of those who saw the writing on the wall. I returned this year during a shopping trip and saw that all of those I had worked with had either changed departments or jobs. Too bad.
good,"It gets busy and when you work full time it feels like you live there. They treat you well and there is a certain positive atmosphere that is nice. The people are great, customers are very rich but most are nice and humble."
good,The only reason I left is I got held-up by gunpoint pulling in to my driveway @ 2:30 am. I said anough. I have nothing ellse to say you're making me say something that I'm not comfortable with.
good,"Great place to work in, employees are always willing to give a hand."
good,Typical is good. Work can be physically demanding however I feel proud of my work. The hardest part of my job is that sometimes there are problems between crew members.
good,"A typical day at Whole Foods involved clocking in at the back and heading to the customer service desk. I would check in with my supervisor and they would send me to my checkout lane. I would work on the register until my break, ringing up customers quickly and efficiently. Breaks and lunches were on time and my coworkers and managers were extremely supportive and helpful. I learned how to work a register more efficiently and improved my social skills. The hardest part of the job was that it was much more fast paced than my previous jobs because the store had just opened. I found the job to be extremely rewarding because of the friendly environment and how understanding my supervisors and managers were. I would highly recommend working here, it's a wonderful place and the pay is great!"
good,Great place to work. I have been there for 19 years and could not ask for a better place to work. It's a great place to jump start your career if you have passion for food and great customer service.  You can move up quickly if you have the passion of learning about the buisness
good,Working for Whole Foods as a cashier was and is always fun. Whole foods was  always busy which makes time goes by fast. Whole Foods has some great benefits and I really enjoy the pay for what I get to do at Whole foods. I would recommend this job to someone who is looking for a good reasonable pay for part time or full time.
good,"god company to work for, good managers who actually care. a typical day is usually laid out on what you need to do. workplace culture is great. hardest part of the job is trying to get over 20 hours a week consistently so that you can qualify for health benefits."
good,"It's great company to work for "
good,The best atmosphere and teamwork I have ever experienced. A team member well being is always considered first and it is easy to book your holidays whenever you want.
good,"I love to work at places where I can learn, and this is one of them. I really enjoy my job, and co workers where very nice, the only stress was for the Holidays long hours, but normal in this field."
good,"One of the best jobs I ever had, and ever held to for a while. I walked in as a fish in a shark tank , to coming out as one of the great whites! Whole Foods Market was so beneficial to me in every aspect possible, from work to my personal growth in life. Everyone was family to me especially my seafood team!"
good,Whole foods is the only grocery store i would go back to work at. They treat theyre employees very well. The company has great values and they work to enforce those values
good,Ambiente positivo oportunidad para aprender hice desarrollar nuevas actitudes o experiencias en el trabajo.
good,Everyone who works at Whole Foods is extremely nice and caring. There was never a bad or dull day working. I would recommend working here to anyone who wanted to work in a fun and relaxed environment.
good,"Whole Foods is a great place to work.  You work hard, but its one of the few retail companies that care about their employees.  I wish the promotion process were quicker."
good,"It was an extremely great place to work and I was able to meet so many great new people, co-workers and customers.  The company paid appropriately.  They always worked with your hours and made sure you were okay."
good,Great company to work for and grow. Many opportunities for those interested in growing. Fun place to start a career if your passion is retail. Company has changed a lot in the past few years but it still is a great company to work for.
good,"I love Whole Foods, I have spent so much time there and have found that Whole Foods has made sure I was always capable of moving forward.  The entire  store has been something that was a safe place to be."
good,My typical day at Whole Foods would be to check in with a supervisor or manager & be assigned to a register. Get to my assigned register and review it. Check to see if the money is organized and work space is clean and safe for others. Proceed to ring cunstomers up and provide them with an excellent shopping experience. Make the customer comfortable to want to come back and shop with us. Help answer customers any questions or concerns the customers may have about any products or its whereabouts. Have respect for my fellow peers. Keep a smile and a welcoming personality when dealing with any persons.
good,Whole Foods is a great company that embraces its many employees with love and compassion. My time there is invaluable to my current state of professionalism and dynamic capabilities in many types of situations. The people that work there are all brilliant and friendly.
good,They treat their employees right . Not good if you had a mental disability though as when I worked there they had no mental health insurance. I owe a lot of debt by missing out on mental health insurance.
good,"Having already studied Natural Health for 5+ years the culture in Whole Body was very welcoming and in my wheelhouse. I learned constantly by customer questions, dinner trainings, team involvement, and product trial. I am so grateful for this experience. I think the hardest part of the job was scheduling but that's only because I would prefer to make my own hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and being team educator, having the opportunity to teach even the seasoned employees new things. Very fulfilling learning position and growth with the company is very doable. Just don't stop asking questions and keep growing with the team!"
good,"Work with great people.  Full time position very difficult to get along with full time benefits.  Energentic, fast pace atmosphere,  Good discount.  Flexible hours."
good,Coming to work is easy when you work with amazing people! The company's culture is like any other I've ever experienced. Working here taught me a lot about quality standards in the grocery industry as well as what it means to have strong values to stand by.
good,I would work there again i really enjoyed my years there. I worked with some very motivated Team Members that really effected how i worked in a positive manner on a daily basis.
good,"My best part of my life was in Whole Foods Market since I joined as a team member and get promoted as a supervisor within a year time. I learned so many things from that job. Specially wide range of organic food varieties. Prepared foods and food processing and many more."
good,"typical day was easy and smooth, I learned to 'up-sale' and encourage customer to buy more and more, the harder part was to not talk with co-workers and customers because it was a blast to catch up especially with the 'regulars' at Whole Foods. Again, i really enjoyed talking to everyone at all times, which got me in trouble at times."
good,"Always willing to work with us with the schedule process, and leadership makes working fun amongst team members. Hard work, along with the emphasis of having fun is always something that whole foods has been known for, as well as teaching team members organic integrity amongst various different foods."
good,The place is am inviting atmosphere and it becomes like a family after a while. Some coworkers arent easy to get along with but besides that its pretty laid back.
good,This job consisted of fast pace heavy lifting. Be it that we had so many items to get on the shelves once you start your work the time flies.
good,"Great store, Awesome team, some maybe not very compassionate. You have to deal with some customers  a lot, but most are very pleasant. You even make friends with some."
good,"Whole Foods culture is one of inclusivity and acceptance and one of the most fun places I have ever worked. Unfortunately it is extremely difficult to move up, even with an advanced degree, which they do not seem to value."
good,"Whole Foods has integrity because of the people who work there and the leadership structure is supportive of this core value of the company. I miss working here now that I am trying different employers. Hourly rates can always be better but the benefits (medical/dental/vision, breaks, discounts, culture, 401k, and stock options) make up for it."
good,"Through this company, I gained a plethora of experience within 2 years that has equipped me for a higher caliber of work. I believe this is due to the opportunity for me to work independently and hone creative solution-finding skills"
good,"Loved it there. Wish I had more time and could have continued."
good,great place to work full time or part time and great benefits. i had worked in the bakery with alot of talented individuals and got along with management
good,"The day would be good, and I would be learning the ways on maintaining the organization of the store. It would be great to be around a bunch of positive people. The hard part be the time frame, although the best part is knowing that the customer is satisfied."
good,Daily customer service and cashiering has helped me develop my communication skills. Team members work well together and help each other out. The open door policy we have makes it easy to communicate with supervisors and team leaders. Its a very casual atmosphere and self expression is encouraged.
good,"Volunteering with the company was actually really fun! We got to see the whole process of how the food is collected, gets to their factory, how they sort everything out and ship it to other places to be distributed to the less fortunate."
good,I honestly enjoyed my time working at whole foods. The management was overall very understanding. They also rewarded us a lot of times during work.
good,"Every day was a blast. Whole Foods was such a great place to be. Everyone who worked there was so friendly and fun, it made it easier to get through any shift. The average day for myself consisted of clocking in and immediately getting on a register. Throughout the day I would complete some housekeeping tasks that needed to get done."
good,"Whole Foods was introduction into working a grocery store ,and it was a great learning experience  as far as honing my customer service skills."
good,"A typical day a Whole Foods in Michigan was come in and put all the bread, cookies and pastries in our self serve case. After the pastry case is set, put signs out for customers. Bag baguettes and make sure to have at least 2 samples out of product for customers. After the bread came out of the ovens, that were freshly baked every day, put them in the self serve case. The next thing was to help customers and set displays of product out on the sales floor. I learned how to multi task, which is very important, where ever you go. I really liked my manager and co workers. I felt very comfortable talking to them, if I had an issue or a problem. My manager was very open minded and didn't put me down, if I had an idea or suggestion.I think the hardest part of the job was making sure vendors were following Whole Foods rules, by having all natural ingredients in their product. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people, that I worked with. The Whole Foods in Jacksonville, Florida was a little slower pace. I didn't feel or have the same experience in Jacksonville, Florida as I did in Michigan. I felt a little disconnected with my co workers, even when I tried to engage with them. When I transferred to Florida from Michigan, I was told I'd be part time and would be able to get full time. My manager rarely ever scheduled me 30 hours, even when I asked for 40 hours. My manager was not clear on what was asked of me. When I needed to ask a question or make sure what they wanted of me on tasks, my manager was rarely ever around. If I had an idea or suggestion, it was dismissed."
good,"My store was phenomenal when I started - incredible culture of learning, communication, and work/life balance. When the management switched over after the opening of another store, our new managers clearly didn't meld with the standard company culture, creating the culture you see every where else of fear, lack of communication, absentee management, and shoddy teambuilding."
good,one of the best jobs I've had. wholesome community. very diverse and accepting of all. fun work environment with interaction between you and coworkers as well as with customers
good,"Great place to work, amazing team members and exceptional, quality products.  Would recommend this company to begin a career and learn exceptional customer service skills."
good,"Hard work, but accomplishments were recognized and rewarded. management could be better. lots of job cuts recently. fun work environment. great team members"
good,Working at whole Foods was very different from every other job. Basically employees were expected to share in decisions that effected their work place.
good,"my typical day at work is making care of customers needs, ringing and bagging their groceries.My co workers are the ones who make my job much easier because we all get along. It is very busy at whole foods so the hardest part of the day is continuously ringing out customers for hours at a time."
good,"Whole foods is a wonderful place to work.  yoou meet all kinds of interesting people that you work with as well as a very interesting customer base. Excellent benefits for Team Members and a fun work environment.  over time the company has lost its roots and is becoming more corporate which is unfortunate, but to be expected of a rapidly growing leader in the organic food world"
good,"Working here part time in college was great, only problem I ever ran into were managers not liking to give time off, even when it was for school."
good,"People focused, good work/life balance.  Pay isn't the highest in the industry, but benefits do get increasingly better the longer you stay."
good,"Supportive work environment with good management, and environmentally conscious corporate culture. Easy to learn new things as anyone who you ask will be happy and willing to teach you a new skill."
good,Very organized work space. A good way to meet people and talk about experiences and learn new things from the variety of customers that come strolling in and always ready to strike up a conversation.
good,"The job itself was fun, people were awesome, management sucks and don't know what they're doing.. employee benifits like discount, how they treated us, medical benifits, working with school schedule, emergencies, and paid time off is very good."
good,Just providing great customer service is awesome to the customers made this job fun for me and the employees.  The job is a great place to work.
good,"It was very easy to get comfortable with everyone you were working with. Management was very fair and generally caring. The benefits are generally very good. There is plenty of opportunities to move up in the company. The hardest is when it is really busy. But, generally there are incentives to push you forward."
good,"A unique thing about working at Whole Foods was the variety of people who work there. From high school students to older Mom's looking for a side job, this place is for everyone! I had a blast and loved all my coworkers."
good,"I have worked a good number of jobs in retail and I would say that Whole Foods is definitely one of the best environments I have worked in as far as retail/grocers go. Good benefits, managers are typically very fair and respectful people, definitely a 'friendly' feel. "
good,loved working here just had to move.  great coworkers and great mangers.  lots of room for advancement if you stick with the company
good,"From the year and half I worked at the Medford location, I had a lot of fun overall. I learned a great deal about health and foods in that time, met many people who I still keep tabs with. Along with that the staff was great, flexibility was good to a degree. "
good,"This is an excellent company to work for with a very employee geared culture. It has been a great place for a creative individual with lots of drive and talent however the company is becoming more 'corporate ' and is losing some of the flavor that made each store and the company unique as it tries to align all it's locations. "
good,"quite possibly only of the most friendly and down to earth work places i have ever had the privilege  of working at, mostly young energetic people."
good,"typical day at work is fast paste "
good,"Work hard, do what you are trained to do and you can advance if you are willing to accept the responsibilities that come with that advancement."
good,A typical day at work would consist of receiving product from truck on pallets .going over invoice and counting the shipment one at a time in to the computer system.i learned good organization skills with paper work shipping policy. co workers very helpful and and informative. the hardest part of my job was lifting items sometimes with assistance of up to 3 people to carry product. the most enjoyable part was the people i worked with and and the eviroment
good,"Honestly the most difficult part of the day is typically annoying customers that are demanding, spoiled, lazy and occasionally  very shady."
good,"Good pay, it really is a fun place to work. There is a lot of work that is expected from you but there is no reason it should not be. This is not a first job kind of place. They expect a lot out of you and let you know that. The family feeling there between all of the workers is pretty awesome though."
good,"Whole Foods was an awesome place to work. Great company culture and there was a lot of room to advance. I learned tons about all aspects of the grocery industry through day to day work and also helping open numerous stores."
good,Great company to grow within. you can advance quickly with the right attitude and commitment level.
good,"Good Pay, Nice environment, the patrons of whole foods were Great Never Had a problem with anyone."
good,"One of my most favorite jobs, team members, team leaders all were great. You learn daily, Im naturally a big man but I lost 60 pounds working a year with the company, I enjoyed every second being they're"
good,"Whole foods market is an Awesome place to work!!! Great environment, great culture, good people!"
good,a typical work day is normally very fast paced. we have so many customers enter this business so many times throughout a day. we get them in and out in a timely manner. i have learned so many things as far as what i need to posses in a leadership role and how to deal with different personalities. as far as management goes the instill so much information into their employees because they wanna see you succeed. my coworkers are from all over the world. and they all are sweet and very helpful. the hardest thing about my job is balancing personal and work life. there hours can be very demanding but it was worth it. what i enjoy the most at whole foods market is the different people that i come across be it customers or team members i love it.
good,A typical night at wholefoods market starts off with e doing spoilage and going over  my production list with the head chef......they teach you how to cook on a healthier  level  and you learn to expand your pallet  by cooking and tasting different thing you might not think to cook at home .... the hardest part of the job was the limited space we had in the kitchen.....most enjoyable part of the job were the people  always willing to help and was always ready to learn from one another
good,"I have worked at Whole foods since 2007. The culture at Whole Foods is one of the biggest reason I have enjoyed by time there. There is always opportunity, they treat everyone with respect, and they bend over backwards to help their team members be successful ."
good,"I had very good time with my co workers and Management in general.  "
good,"The summary says it all. Whole Foods is a great place to work with great benefits and structure. The downside is weekends, nights and 5am shifts. Co-workers are generally young and fun to work with. An awesome job if it weren't for the hours."
good,"Great opportunity, work with young adults starting, management knowledgeable and productive."
good,I would arrive at work about 10min early and get the equipment needed for the morning/ day. I would then make the sandwiches and wraps for the day with Steve. Once the sandwiches are done we start prep on the pizzas. During prep of the pizzas i decide what pizza i want to make for the day with the supplies we have. We have to make sure pizzas are out and the board is full by 11am. the rest of the day is keeping pizzas stocked and serving the customers and selling our products. we also need to problem solve when a customer is unhappy. its not the managers responsibility but the employees.
good,every day is an experience all its own. never boring always interesting
good,very fun job the employees are easy to get along with an the hours are there for who need them
good,Great company to work for and rapid advancement for immigrants and minorities. If Caucasian that's another matter.
good,I would like a full or part time job in or around the New York or Philadelphia.
good,A typical day at work was very easy and simple. I would grab my till and open up my assigned register for the day. I would ring up groceries and bag items. I would help customers bring bags to the car when there were many bags. The cashiers also had to maintain the food court nice and neat and all eating utensils filled up when they were low.
good,Whole Foods Market was a great place to work; it taught me a tremendous amount about retail operations.
good,I must say I've never wrote a review before about a job i've worked but I must say (and my wife agrees) that Wholefoods was the BEST job I have ever worked. It was a great atmosphere and they were very understanding if i ever needed to take off and they worked around my religious schedule as well. The people I worked with were very nice and fun and funny and even though we were all there to do a job and keep the store functioning at a satisfactory level we still had fun while doing it.
good,"fun place to work for very productive team! Working in a healthy environment, plus chances to earn gainshare! Paid time off"
good,tools given to complete task by impowering team members thru hands on development in a visionary process
good,Whole Foods is a wonderful company and really makes u feel at home. They take care of their employees and guest. As a company they go out of their way to make everyone's experience special. I'm just thankful to say that i am apart of that experience. The only negative thing a could say about Whole Foods is that there isn't much room for advancement. Because of the loyalty of the employees no one really ever leaves unless they relocate.
good,Awsome place to work I learned a lot about healthy eating right exercising your strength your weakness your energy you put out in the universe how to follow receipts and cook them
good,It was a good company overall to be employed for great benefits and wonderful atmosphere to engage with customers and other employees of a very diverse background
good,It's a good company and fun but their thinking about replacing Amazon shoppers with regular Whole Foods employees and the last I heard and saw they had 2 Whole Foods employees helping out already.
good,The work experience was actually exciting I was upset I had to leave the job due to the fact that I was working through another company but overall its fun.
good,Loved the pace of WFM!  Loved working with team members from all over the world.  There was room for growth and professional development. Management invested in team members advancement.
good,"I would still be working there had a not moved to another stat and city that had no available positions for cashiers, good customers and co-workers, fun time"
good,Great culture and Pay. Sometimes bad co-workers/ regulations. Depends on the stoee and team you work with as well. Good to interact with customers and would reccommend.
good,You're treated with proper respect and it's shown by how they interact with you. They refer to you as a Team Member and the higher-ups as Team 'Leaders' as a way to show that regardless of the position we're all in this together as a Whole Foods family.
good,Whole Foods always encouraged everyone to choose healthier food choices. Making things affordable and with better quality foods. The work environment was very welcoming.
good,"Management was understanding and good to work with; They ensured  that I was familiar with all duties of the the store.  Fun, family like cultural."
good,"Full time over night job with excellent perks.  A 30% employee discount on anything in the store plus with management approval, employees can sample anything in the store for personal and to improve customer service."
good,"Whole foods is the best company to work for in the grocery industry, hands down. Even with the amazon buy out,  you still can't beat the starting pay, benefits, and discount! Great job to build resume."
good,"I love Whole Foods "
good,"I will always remember the many people I worked with at the Boca Raton location as kind, caring, hard working people who welcomed me. Along the way we taught each other in the continuous journey of culinary. Thank you! You know who you are!"
good,"During my time at Whole Foods Market, I became familiar with most of the products as my role with the enterprise mainly was working in Grocery. Due to the late hours involving labor, employment was short but best for the future of opportunity!"
good,"I left because I had a life incident followed by a better offer. But it could have worked out there. Good people, good training and lots of advancement I’m told."
good,"I feel empowered to make decisions based on Customer happiness and Team member happiness. I feel supported and encouraged from management, as well as, mentored and developed in my own leadership principles on a daily basis."
good,"Every store is different,"
good,"Every day I would come in, I would already clean up my station in preparation for closing. I would flip the containers and sweep the floors. After this, I'd wash my hands and make 7 new pizzas to fill up the hot case for customers. I'd then juggle the two through out my shift, cleanliness and keeping the board filled. When I was sure that my pizza station was clean and full with pizzas, I would juggle customers to help my co- workers out. I would repeat juggling customers, making pizzas, and cleaning my station until the shift was over; then I'd sanitize my station and deep clean through out the Prepared Foods area."
good,Retail is not the most exciting work place. But Whole Foods is one of the best Retail environments I've worked for. They work with the employees to strengthen their skills and move up in the company.
good,I loved my job at whole foods. Great company. Felt like I had a family there. It was a great experience. I got to help lots of customers and stay busy. Loved it!
good,"I love my job. The pay is great. As with many jobs, corporate is a bit disconnected with what's happening in stores, so that causes frustration sometimes. In-store leadership is really cool though. If you're willing to show up on time and work hard, you will have the opportunity to learn other positions around the store, get more hours, and get promoted."
good,Whole foods had the best culture out of any place that I have worked. The management was hands-on and collaborative. I would love to work here again given the circumstances.
good,Loved working there. Great company. Great people. Great benefits. I am actually gonna try to find another Whole Foods in my new area to work at. I have no complaints.
good,"The workplace is one-of-a-kind. With people centered around culture, its a great place to work. The management cares about the workers and the company is centered around charities and betterment for the planet and its people."
good,"Great place to work. Great management and awesome people all around. Cold storage but they provide beenies and jackets. Used electric pallet jacks, standup forklift and sit down"
good,was a great place to work. it was a great team and very understanding with schedules. was a great place to work and be . i enjoyed coming to work everyday .
good,"The amount of educational opportunities and training provided by the company are limitless, as well as the assistance offered by management. Great benefits."
good,Overall it's a great company to work for really nice people great place to meet new friends and people 😊 and you can try different things that's cool
good,Me gusta mi trabajo de chef por eso estoy muy bien en whole foods market
good,Overall it was a good experience. I only left because of bad department management. The culture and store experience was very appreciated though and I don’t regret working there.
good,"The team structure lends itself to great cooperation and teamwork within the store. Team members/employees are eager to help each other out and cover shifts and duties when needed. Store leadership/management is super friendly and involves the employees in daily duties, and consistently checks in on each team and employee throughout store. You feel recognized and appreciated, the team member appreciation week has great prizes and food, and store sales. Whole Foods is always ensuring we are operating efficiently and within our values and ethics with locally sourced meat and produce and creating a welcoming non-judegemental environment."
good,They were amazing to work for and very understanding to personal needs. They took into consideration everybody's backgrounds and level of experience and they had a whole team ready to support your growth and advancement in the store.
good,"Whole Foods was probably the best place/team I have ever work for. I loved almost EVERYBODY I worked with. It's a very laid-back, chill environment.  I worked in customer service for a very long time so I know the problems that occur when dealing with customers. The customers that came into that location were seriously awesome. I met so many cool people. I began forming bonds with the regulars. Having an awesome team and enjoyable customers made coming into work so much better. I recommend anyone to work here. FYI this was before Amazon."
good,"Working at Whole Foods, I gained alot of information that I was happy to gain. I am really appreciative of all that i learned because it helped me in my day to day life."
good,"I love working at Whole Foods.  None of the jobs there are easy jobs.  They all require some dedication, interest, and a get er done philosophy.   Go getter types are appreciated."
good,It was great working here great people to work with and descent benefits in the company. Very understanding for time off and the higher ups were very supportive
good,"WFM is satisfying the utmost organic needs of America. I exposed to this idea in my 2 years service in WFM, and me and my family enjoy the benefits of this knowledge and live a healthier life."
good,Whole Foods is one of the best companies I've ever worked for! They really care about their employees and the company culture is very diverse and inclusive. Would definitely recommend it!
good,"Excellent pay, great benefits, company discount, and paid time off (pto) based on service hours. Whole Foods Market is always listed in Forbes best place to work for. Come find out why."
good,"This environment was great to work in, it was a very fun and uplifting environment. However, the hours can be brutal if working part-time, balancing maybe school or another job with this would not be recommended, or be very strict about your scheduling."
good,"Fellow teams mates are great and ready to help you with any question you might have. Management is the same, if you have a question or are unsure they want you to come to them. Customers are super friendly and you get to know the regulars."
good,"I would like recognition for hard work"
good,Very safe welcoming environment have to be willing to learn something new everyday be on time and miss no days must have patience with costumers and want to help.
good,"I worked at the Fresno, CA location for almost two years. It was a very good job and paid very well. I was a Full-time Cashier. It's a very team-oriented workplace. Plenty of options to move around and move up! If you can get in I highly recommend it!"
good,Cool place to work at part-time i actually enjoyed working in my department for the time i was there learned a lot I could adapt to the real world. I would recommend it as place to work as a college student.
good,"The workplace culture at WFM is one of a kind, because the company as a whole really knows and respects its roots. As an employee you learn about all the great initiatives that the company has and how you as a team member help further the impact of the company."
good,Whole Foods allows growth in the company. I had to leave because of low income but other then that it is a great place to start at. They try to teach you every position that way you can move up.
good,fun place to work with a great work life balance. there was n exceptional legal team and product development team with passionate dedicated and really smart people. Excellent executive team. lots of opportunity to grow and learn but the bu -out by Whole Foods led to extensive lay offs
good,It's a fairly good job with good hours in the time I've been working there. There was good and bad experiences but the whole out come of the job is overall good
good,"Rewards consistency and adherence to policy, reasonable pay, good benefits, excellent work culture. A company you can stand behind with good morals and goodnpeople."
good,Whole Foods is exactly what they advertise. They truly treat you like a team member and want you to succeed. Great work environment and they are flexible to your schedule.
good,"Working at whole foods was very enjoyable. The people, the customers, the products, the culture, everything about the company made it enjoyable for me. No 2 days are the same and you never know who you'r going to meet. For such a large company, for them to offer what they do to their employees is great to see. Whole Foods is the best company I have ever worked for."
good,"I had a great experience working with Whole Foods. Great management, great team memebers. Busy days but they go by fast. I would strongly recommend applying to Whole Foods. The only reason I left was because we moved cities and there isn't a Whole Foods where we are now."
good,"Great coworkers, great customers, awesome products! 20-30% discount. Always learning something either from coworkers or customers. If you like food and/or healthy lifestyles this is the place for you. 30 minute lunch break and awesome food to choose from on the salad/hot bar. Super relaxed, super flexible, I even got to pick my days off. No uniforms. Can be either fast or slow paced, depending on position and the day of the week (holidays are busy). Every position is pretty easy. Training is good. Competitive pay. Only weird thing is that they make the cashiers go get carts even if it's a super busy day or storming really hard. Not a fan of trying to look professional then coming back in with wet or windblown hair or sweat pouring down my face, then having to get right back into helping customers. On nice days it can be a welcome break from being inside at a register. Over all, it's a great, thoughtful company with lots of like-minded people and you'll never want to shop anywhere else again."
good,Working for Whole Foods was a great experience. It is Highly motivating and heavy on team work. I loved working their because I gave me the ability to better my customer service skills.
good,"I like my job the people at the jobs we work together. A typical day at work is fast paced and always busy.The management are easy to work with.The workplace culture is laid back, everyone gets along well in every department, there is good communication at the workplace."
good,The work environment was nice and the workers were also really caring and compassionate about their jobs. I had good managers and supervisors and also good support from my fellow co workers.
good,"Sometimes I clean, work at the tills, guide customers  through the day. the management was good i would have still stayed there if it wasn't for the moving of houses, overall it's a good and suitable job for everyone"
good,"Whole Foods has been an enjoyable company to work for.  I think their benefits package could use a splash of diversity, it’s very limited and is some of the worse medical insurance I’ve seen but I manage. "
good,"I love whole foods market, great pay, discounts and they set goals and listen to employees, sometimes the managers do have favoritisms but that’s at every job. Overall I will reapply when I am done with school"
good,"I really enjoyed working here. The job was easy and the customers were a joy to see...that was the highlight of my shift. The management on the other hand sets you up to fail and even lose your job if things aren't going the way they want them to, and it has nothing to do with the job it's a personal issue with certain managers."
good,"lots of chill young people to work with and great for a part time gig. "
good,"I started working there in 2010 and my last year was 2016.It was the best job i ever had, i really enjoyed my time working there. The work culture and the environment was awesome, i learned a lot about food and how to cook. Everything changed when amazon came. great company for people wanting to work part time."
good,"Whole Foods Market is an ideal place to work. It was first every job when I was 19 and i am still there (5 years later) and intend to stay there until I graduate from college. They are flexible with my school schedule and there is opportunity to grow within the company. There is a stress to always do and be your best, as there are core values that we as a company must uphold. Overall, it is a fun work environment and I would recommend anybody to work here."
good,"What I Learned/Management:"
good,"All the store team members were extremely friendly and always ready to help customers out. The management team was very flexible with working around with your availability. After Amazon bought more, many more customers started to shop at the stores."
good,"The starting pay is pretty high compared to most retail jobs. the atmosphere is fun, fast, happy, and everyone is willing to help. Just like all jobs there are things that you won like but for the most part its a cool job."
good,"Best 6 years of my life, met some great people, love company and their products/mission, positive work environment, lots of team work, relatively low stress."
good,"The role covered most aspects of general HR from Payroll, training, file management, basic ER management and culture focus"
good,The environment at Whole Foods cultivated a culture of hard work and success throughout the different departments in the store. The importance of every employee is highlighted to ensure morale is high in every team member.
good,"You have free reign on what juices you'd like to create. "
good,"Easy job, nice person, team work, safety, good communications, share knowledge. Healthy environment. Stay cleaning. Deliver on time. Good Customer services"
good,"The culture of Wholefoods is like any other I have worked before. People are very inclusive, open minded and they make you feel comfortable extremely quickly . It was a pleasure to work with that company"
good,Whole Foods Market is a great workplace and I hope to return in the future. They really focus on keeping team work a priority and have a great open-door policy.
good,"I had a great time working at WHole Foods, from my time in Bakery to my brief stint In the seafood Department. The culture is what you make of it but everyon there is generally happy and has no problem working together."
good,"Great place to work, with an awesome attitude towards it employees and its customers."
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"I enjoyed being a team member at wholefoods, learning about the process and products, and working closely with my team. I had the opportunity interact with the customers while providing them assistance in finding their product need. Our managers were really passionate about customer service and we worked hard to achieve excellence in all the service we provided."
good,"My teamleaders and coworkers were always friendly, and the culture of the work environment there was to work together. Whole Foods hosted numerous events for the employees and offered benefits to the full-time staff. They were flexible with my school schedule at the time."
good,"Great place to work part-time as a student.Excellent place if you are looking to move up in the company.Management is very kind, helpful and considerate"
good,Whole foods is an awesome place to work. Values-driven and excellent earning potential if you stick around long enough. I would've never left if I didn't find a bette job.
good,"Day to day work was typically fast paced and it kept you busy for the majority of your shift. I learned a lot about company standards since it was really important for many of our customers. The management was hard working and typically reliable. Whole Foods Market promotes from within so there is a lot of room for advancement. I wouldn't say there was anything hard about working at Whole Foods but they tried to challenge you to improve and move up within the company, working at WFM I never felt stagnant because I knew there would be many possibilities to move up. The thing that I most enjoyed about the company were the people I worked alongside of, you definitely become a little family and I knew I could rely on my coworkers to work hard and help each other."
good,Working there was fine and straightforward. normally just go straight to the registrar once I get there and stand there all day. Sometimes I would do deliveries both on foot and in the truck.
good,It was a great place to work. Same fun and hard working faces every single day giving their best and giving great customer service. Tons of great choices for lunch and a nice discount to use on anything in the store.
good,Whole foods has been one of the best jobs ive had. Only because i was about to have a child and needed to have a higher income did i leave the company.

good,"No matter how stressful your day was before you got to work, or how stressful it got during the day, you could always count on at least one or two team members to make you smile.  Your coworkers become like your saving grace at work, and I have never worked for a company with such close knit relationships among team members"
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work. It has a great work environment. People are really helpful and friendly. Only thing I don`t really like is that the career is not dynamic there. Some people are sitting at the same post forever. They never move up or down. So, the other people can move there career upward."

good,"I worked at Whole Foods for 23 years in the production bakery.  The job can be very challenging and stressfull at times especially when we got short staffed.  Having said that, I found the work very enjoyable and most team members very pleasent and reliable.  There is lots of support from leader ship and many oppertunities for advancement.  Whole Foods is a great place for new team members to start their work career in a workplace culture that is very respectful."

good,"I enjoyed my time working at Whole Foods Market - Arden in Sacramento, CA. I worked in the Prepared Foods Department and everyone treated me like family. I learned how to properly operate the deli/prepared foods department and met a lot of interesting people. Over time I got to know the customers by name and knew what they wanted before they asked. I learned more about prioritizing my work than ever before and that the customer is always right. I educated our customers on new items offered as well as current items. I became a jack of all trades by being able to hop on the pizza station, work the Back of the House, Make Sandwiches and Burritos, Slice/weigh/package deli meats, portion and package items in the cold case and work the salad bar. I was even given a chance to cook and put food menu items together from scratch using the binder with instructions on how to make the food. All in all, it was a great experience working there and since I left on good terms, I can always go back if need be. I highly recommend working for Whole Foods Market!"

good,"The team you work with can be awesome (for the most part). You will occasionally find the few who are intolerable to subordinates. Got only one raise in 2.5 years with the company, but it was right before minimum wage was raised, so new hires would be making the same rate. They did not adjust my pay, even after bringing it to their attention."
good,WF is definitely a great company to work. Fun and face paced environment and so many great programs to take advantage of if you're looking for world wide sustainability and development programs.
good,Pay attention. Memorize food aisles and always double check. Working alone is great and it gives you pure satisfaction knowing youre helping out the customers.
good,The coworkers are wonderful! The customers are great. I loved going to work knowing I believed in the company. They do great things around the world and offer employees opportunities to help.
good,"Tasks set up at start of the day and we take the next 8 hours to complete them to the best of our ability. I have learned how lead a floor, delegate task, prioritize, deescalate confrontations. management is insightful and always there for support. whole foods culture is sharing, caring, supporting coworkers through the harsh customer interactions, always being a team player, laughing through the rough days. the hardest part of my job is that it is cyclical, you are never ever really done, there will always be something tomorrow. the most enjoyable part of my job is being surrounded by great people."
good,The company was in a period of ownership change as well as management changes.So I found that there was a period of uncertainty.Overall the experience was exciting and rewarding.

good,"It’s already been a few years but I look back on my time at Whole Paycheck fondly. I learned a lot, and everyone at my store seemed to genuinely enjoy their job (most days at least). The culture really emphasizes job-education. You really learn all aspects of your role and it’s larger implications very well, which really sets it apart from most other grocery store chains that I’ve seen."
good,"I took this job as a starter job for college to get myself some money. They were very flexible and never made me stay longer than what I was scheduled. Fantastic environment, the work is just tedious and mentally exhausting. The only reason why I quit was to advance my college career."
good,"I enjoy working there, just want to gain experience. Want to use my degree and also would just like to be out of a food environment. I really enjoy it and have made a lot of friends."
good,its a great company but it's always short staffed. would be working overtime or working by yourself when someone calls in sick. the pay per hour isn't an issue though.

Whole Foods Market culture is unlike any other work place culture I've experienced. It is friendly and inclusive. We seem to be a tight-knit group. I never felt intimidated to ask for help from any of my team members. "
good,Friendly workers and a great atmosphere for people living in Austin.  Pay is good and benefits are too as well.  Wish there was a Whole Foods where I live now.
good,"to of interaction with customers, great group of co workers and awesome managers. always stuff to do, at times customers can be annoying but that goes with any service job"
good,The bureaucratic disciplinary system is a bit haywire and managers do not make their expectations clear. I believe they are purposely vague in an attempt to keep lower employees complacent.
good,"a typcal day at work was arrive on time start your day by a short briefing from management. then continue on with your day. I learned team work and being goal oriented by finishing a project on time. "
good,"A typical day as a market team member involves stocking shelves and unloading the truck (if you work the morning shift that is). It's enjoyable to work in a relatively fast-paced environment with people and managers who care about your well-being and work with you to make sure you're well taken care of. You get a 20% discount on everything in the store, which comes in handy most days."
good,"Working in the Whole Body Department, I deal with body care, vitamins & supplements, proteins & superfoods, lifestyle, clothes & toys.  I enjoy building displays, rearranging the products and servicing the customers.  The company really cares about the customer, the environment and the world and it shows in the organizations they've developed.  They go above and beyond to delight the consumer/  I love working there."
good,The culture of Whole Foods is very diverse and welcoming. Management is always understanding and strives to do their best for their employees. Benefits are even provided to part time employees.
good,"Loved working here.  Great set of people make up the staff.  Fun, laid-back environment.  Tend to sweat the smaller details, which don't typically make a huge difference.  So that's a drag.  But it's a really enjoyable place to work."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a pleasant place to work. It is welcoming towards its team members and gives a great deal of education to their incoming staff. The overall culture and atmosphere of the store is calming and diverse, with various different services offered to both its customers and team members."
good,"I had an excellent time working at Whole Foods Market in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It's a smaller market than New York City so it was wonderful getting to know your customer."
good,Great work environment . Nice store with great products my favorite thing to promote was free sampling and it wood drive sales because the product sold it self . Nice break room with TVs and cable and internet and couch's for employees to relax and communicate .
good,"The people you work with tend to become a part of your family, making your work life much more enjoyable. The only negative about working for this company is the lack of career advancement."
good,"30% off makes shopping there equivalent or cheaper than your local grocer. WFM is dedicated to its workers just like they are dedicated to their customers. It's always a safe place to work, they accept whoever you are, and provide a lot of services when life gets tough or you need something. "
good,"From the time of clocking in I actually enjoyed what I did and looked forward to going in to work each day."
good,"I had worked in the grocery industry for 8 years before joining Whole Foods Market and had never worked for anyone as great as them. I was blown away by the experience. The company as a whole has great core values, cares about animals and the environment and above all cares about their employees. They pay fair wages, offer great benefits and care about their employees development. Great work/life balance, fun place to work. They really provide a team environment and the Leadership in the store is really engaged and helpful. Definitely the best grocery retailer to work for."
good,"Excellent workplace culture, providing all chances of progressing careers and support individual learning."
good,"A typical day at Whole Foods involved a lot of customer service and making sure that each and every person who stepped foot into the store left satisfied. I learned a great deal about proper management, customer service, how to treat your employees fairly, and also about the organic foods industry/ holistic living. The workplace culture involved feeling like you were a part of something great, and there were a lot of meetings and training sessions to ensure your effectiveness in representing the company. The most difficult part of the job was the rotating schedule and sometimes having to work odd hours and weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you were able to go above and beyond for a customer's needs and they expressed their appreciation for your dedication."
good,"At first I just wanted to keep to myself but at the end, I was part of a community both in and out of the workplace. Great discount and food. I still go back today."
good,"* Excellent place to get an great feel of food service."
good,WFM is a great place to learn about natural and organic products.  Management wants to help you succeed.I felt like WFM was like a home away from home
good,"love the environment, learned a lot about customer wellness, the hardest part of the job are people that don't take the job serious or not serious enough. i do like that whole foods re hire people that had gotten fired most jobs do not do that. overall this company loves to promote team member happiness."

good,Everyday is different when going to work. The customers make the job more interesting. Co-workers make going to work pleasurable and it is a great company
good,Whole Foods teaches you daily and gives you wonderful opportunities to grow as a person and in your career. Store leadership is always willing to listen and work with you to help make your job better. We work very hard and it is a fast paced place to work but the people make it worth while.
good,"I worked at Whole Foods Market for almost four years. Most of my team member there are highly concern about current American diet, some have so much passionate about healthy eating, eating organic, locally, seasonal food which I never aware of before I join there. I must admit working there really expand my knowledge on food as whole. Thank you Whole Foods Market."
good,"The company truly cares about its employees, customers, and suppliers. It continues to evolve and learns from mistakes. I recommend them if you care about food quality, social impact, and want to make the world a little bit better."

good,"The experience varies wildly from store to store and person to person, but overall the company provides great benefits, fair compensation and a healthy environment to work in.  They incentivize the team members to have a healthy lifestyle by offering a bigger store discount.  Emphasis on being honest, fair and generally being nice to people... the company has several charitable foundations which do wonderful things. It is a decent and civilized culture."
good,"Very great place to work at any age, starting at sixteen. Very flexible work schedule and very good at holiday season hours. Store meeting every three months at six in the morning."

good,"-A typical day was pretty fast paced and busy. There were only a handful of times that it was dead and I loved that."
good,a typical day at work is helping customers with any of their needs and provide them with the best of quality produce. working here have thought me how to handle business with customers in a respectable and friendly manner where i can help the customer and ever customer from that.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company.  My co workers were great and the pay was fair. I had a very open and flexible schedule and I was able to learn a lot in my time there.
good,"I will be sad to leave here because the job gives you a good workout and the discount on products is great. I loved the people I work with. The customers can be a pain at times, but there are some good customers that will say hi to you and get to know you."
good,"The midtown Tulsa store has some of the best managers in the business. The store is consistently cared for by its employees, and it feels very much like a tight-knit family system (esp. at the department level). This store was a pleasure to work in, and it should be a shining example of the WFM values upon which other locations across the nation should base their development."
good,Friendly management and great co-workers. Shifts went by fast. Cool events that team members were encouraged to attend and participate in. Great vibe and non-hostile environment to work in.

good,amazing people work here i have found that everyone actually loves they're jobs. and are very relaxed but are willing to take that extra step for the customer

good,"Whole foods is a great place to work. I really learned how to take charge of my job and become a self-driven employee. They foster and promote strong work ethics and create an environment that sets employees up for success. Management is understanding and professional.

good,I like to work there but since my daughter start school I am not as flexible in work hours as much they want me to be. People are friendly. I work at department where we interact a lot with customers.
good,Typical 8 hours shifts in a high volume store dedicated to the highest standards of customer service. A place where you were only limited by your own desires to move up and advance within the company.
good,"Very productive and fun workplace.  Management, team leaders co-workers always ready to lend a hand.

The management and fellow coworkers are positive, delightful, and pleasant. A great attitude and ambition will take you further within WFM."
good,"Loved working here. Expectations are high from management and customers but for good reason. Great place to start from the bottom and find your way into a position that fits you and your future. Learned so much from other team members, management, and vendors. This company really looks out for you and your future."
good,I loved everything about Whole Foods. From orientation they got me. I have nothing bad to say about this company. They treat their workers with tons of respect. With Whole Foods being such a big company you would think that it would be hard to be noticed but they honestly make you feel comfortable as possible.
good,Working at Whole Foods Market has helped me learn to multitask as well as learn a couple of new tricks on pastry and cake work. I have learned to help customers as well as pack out products to make our showcases look amazing. I also have helped in managing team members if a supervisor or manager isn't present. I have shown many of my leadership skills when needed.
good,"Whole Foods Market is an excellent company. It is a pleasure to work for them and be part of an amazing team in Downtown, LA. "

good,"Working at Whole Foods Market helped me set the type of work experience I needed. I was able to learn with the help of the receiving supervisor, forklift operations and was able to get my Forklift certificate after a day of training. The whole food market receiving team worked very well together to make sure everything was done properly and on time. During a day of work we was able to unload many trucks, count inventories and place product in the departments where the rest of the Whole Foods team would stock."
good,"My days at whole foods market were amazing, i worked in prepared foods and i learned how to cook amazing food and also how a great business is run and the people there are hard working and they always put the job first."

There are always regulars who come and demand the best service and you must meet their satisfaction if you wish to grow with the company. Good performance is always needed and a great attitude is your best tool."
good,The store is fun to work for with great food. The hardest part of the job is after the customers leave when we close the store. It's very fast pace and keeps you busy.
good,"We work as a team not individually. What the company needs for the day must be done. Make sure customers are satisfied each day. There is nothing like ""NO"". There must be something to replace what we do not have at that particular time."
good,I really enjoyed working for Whole foods. They had a great atmosphere and I got to meet so many different people from all walks of life. This is where I started learning about healthier living for myself.

good,"My experience at Whole Foods Market has been great.  This company has really invested in me.  They paid for my level 1 Cicerone Certification.  They sent me to Wisconsin for a week to study at the Center for Dairy Research.  They paid for my Certified Cheese Professional exam.  I have learned a ton about beer, wine, and cheese.  This company has given me leadership experience and retail/buying experience.  I love the people I work with.  My leadership has been great!"
good,I work in the front end as a cashier and I work with some of the nicest coworkers. The team leaders are very nice and approachable. Time flies when its busy but when its slow it can drag a little but having great workers makes it fun. They do an annual team build which is when the Team leaders take your department on a trip for a day so you can bond with your team and of course you get paid. They have awesome benefits and start at $11 an hour. There are very few nasty customers since this is a high class supermarket (this is no walmart) but you will get those few rich snobs but just kill them with kindness and you'll be ok. Best place I ever worked for.
good,"I love Whole Foods its a great company and they treat their team members very well."
good,"overall Great Company! I love what whole foods stand for, but of course things change when unprofessional managers hire friends and family!"
good,"A typical day at work is productive.  With many responsibilities and duties, I must cater and be available for all team members and team leaders and act as an unbiased party.   "
good,"best company i ever work for, amazing co workers, this is a company which not only have great benefits and amazing co workers, but they actually care about their workers."

good,"Great values"
good,If you want to work in a place where you can be yourself - where you're uniqueness and talents can SHINE - this is the company for you!
good,"Enjoy helping customers,i get to smile all day"
good,"Management always looking to improve"
good,Great company to  work for. I was with Whole Foods for 2 years and learned new techniques for cooking and furthered my customer service skills.
good,"A great Culture of attitude and personalities. People that work there don't just treat the work like it's their job, but more along the lines of its a lifestyle of being."
good,"The typical day at wholefoods is working with my fellow team members in the kitchen and helping and delighting customers with a beautiful platters and with a nice customer service. When I start working at Whole foods, I had no idea about American foods. After working with them now I feel like I know everything about their foods and how to cook. The hardest part of the job is that to work n the kitchen when it is very hot outside. Also working with more than 80 people in the kitchen by itself is hard however I love to work  and interact with others, so that makes it a fun place to work"
good,"I am a Graphic Designer for Whole Foods Market Upper Arlington. It is fast paced, and I get to work with great people. The company itself is community oriented and always looking for new ways to educate the public about healthy eating, conservation, etc."
good,"Working for WFM while going to school was the best experience I could ask for. I worked full-time and went to school full-time for the entirety of my employment with them. There always understanding of my scheduling requirements and happy to comply. I loved my job, the team members, the environment and it was simple to walk into my shift and leave everything at the door. s a customer service supervisor there were several difficult situations, but I was always empowered and encouraged by my superiors to make decisions and offer guidance along the way. I am currently employed part-time while I look for a full time career and do not look forward to the day when I have to leave the company, its been the best work family."
good,"At the retail end, go in and work hard, eat many samples, learn alot of new things.  Get in then move to advance!"
good,greet place and co worker. benfits greet team fun place to work . i learn alot and learning to work as a team. easy to move up and rises.
good,"One of the best companies out there, providing outstanding culture and values with great benefits.  More demanding than most and very hard on employees.  Not family friendly.  Not flexible with lifestyles.  Top rate pay if you can do it though."
good,"A typical day as a cashier consists of ringing out patrons. This means checking kindly greeting the customer, making sure all needs were met to the best ability, and engaging the customer with small conversation creating a friendly environment. Here I learned the value of customer satisfaction and more about the food service business. My co-workers and I are very close. Everyone gets along very well and morale is always high. The hardest part of the job is staying busy when business is slow. There is only so much to do when customers are not filling lanes. We clean and organize but after that is done, there is not much to do other than wait for customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team that encourages one another. We see potential in each other and do our best to help each other succeed."
good,"Everyone is friendly, polite. "
good,"I would come into work, sometimes get on a register, or bag.  Other times I would go outside and collect carts or put returns back and clean up the front end, basically whatever they needed from me.  I learned a lot of things about how to make the customer feel like you are actually listening to them and what they feel at the end of their trip and how to make sure they leave happy if something went wrong."
good,"Whole Foods Market is not your typical store. You've meet all kinds of people. You hear all kinds of things. Everyday is unique to say the least. I have to say that I am completely blessed to work with the people that I work with. It's a family. How could it not be? You spend most of your life there. If you're comfortable going to work then you will enjoy going to work. That's always important. Creating a good relationship with a person you work with is so very important. Something I will always try to do."
good,"A typical day at work would be interacting with customers. Some days are better than others just like any other job. You meet rude people, you meet nice people, you even meet people that have an impact on your life. The management I have is great. My Team Leader is awesome. He makes everyone feel comfortable and appreciated. He is there at all times. Very open. My co-workers are my co-workers. I wish I can pick my own but you work with them for a reason. You learn things not to do from one another or you'll meet that co-worker that is great. It works both ways at any job. The hardest part of the job would be standing on your feet 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. Especially when work is slow. The most enjoyable part of work for me would have to be meeting new customers that you have great conversations with and you can relate too. People that you remember next time their around. Having a good relationship with your customers is always a plus. Whole Foods Market is a great company. They treat their employees the right way."
good,"The Company from the top down is amazing.  Positive Enforcement of views, education opportunities, sampling programs, each team member is empowered to do what is needed to assist the Customer."
good,"great place to work people are great, and so is  atmosphere. great knowledgeable staff."
good,"I loved working here. Wonderful team, pretty good pay, and understanding managers. The hours were very good for school at the time. I learned a lot more about how to give great customer service and gain pretty good experience in cashiering. The hardest part of the job is cashiering during the Holidays. The lines would be long and packed with groceries. The most enjoyable part was being able to converse with the customers and still feel a sense of realness at work instead of feeling trapped and limited."
good,"What I liked best about my job at WF was that every day was different. While I had assigned tasks to accomplish every day/week, there was always a new wrinkle or issue that came up which forced adjustment--but that was ok, because it was all interesting. Overall, both management and co-workers were excellent, and once one managed the culture (WF has a distinct business ""culture""), it was possible to really experience being a unique individual contributing to a team effort.  Most of the difficulties of the job were related to the generally consuming nature of grocery retail---it's very physical, can be high stress, and never ending (tasks always repeat themselves in another form). But the enjoyable parts far outweighed the negativity--decent pay, flexible hours and good benefits as well as the very real possibility of job advancement. At least that was the WF I inhabited."
good,"By far the best place I've ever worked. Only downfall is some management, But that differs at every store. Inspiring place to work, Everyone cares about what they're doing and what affect they have on the environment. I learned how to appreciate people with different dietary needs, Both Medical and ethical. The hardest part is occasionally getting scolded for eating meat :P It's really just a great place to work."
good,"Working at wholefood very different then other places i worked in. A typical day i would come in around 6am fill cases with ice then working threw the case with fish cuting fileting and smokeing fish. Then once it up and running selling, cooking for customers."
good,I have enjoyed being a team member at Whole Foods Market. Management has allowed me to have a flexible schedule throughout school and my dietetic internship. I have gained extensive knowledge about supplements and health that I will use throughout my career as a Registered Dietitian.
good,"- started out part-time & worked up to full time. "
good,"To begin with, this job is retail, if that isn't your thing you may be put off by it.  The culture of Whole Foods is nice, with many of the customers that come in being of the type that would come to a high end organic grocery store.  They either know their stuff and are happy to share information and recipes with you, or are just starting out with healthy eating and need some tips from you.  The training at Whole Foods is very good, it may vary from department but there are seminars and other meetings to keep you appraised of what is going on and helpful information to assist the customers better.  The starting wage is a bit low, but after a few months you start receiving what is called Gain Sharing, or Profit Sharing which depending on your department can be quite a nice boost to your paycheck, so I would recommend sticking in there if you like your job but the pay is a little low, it will get better.  The health benefits themselves are adequate, good, but nothing super special, except that after so many service hours it becomes ridiculously cheap to have it, which is a nice plus.  Throw in a nice discount incentive to the mix and Whole Foods is probably the best of the grocery world if that is the field that you want to find yourself in."
good,Great Culture and the company takes care of its employees. Great company to grow with.
good,It is all about the core values. If you have strong customer service skills you will excel. Long days and even longer nights but it is all worth it in the long run. There is somewhat of a disconnect between regional and store leadership when it comes to day to day operations that can be a drag under the wrong store leadership getting others to see your strengths and ability will be hard. Under the right store leadership nothing but net. The NE President is the best.
good,"It was a great place to work for.  My coworkers and management worked very well together.  The office was very small, so team work was a must."
good,"My main position at Whole Foods was as Floral Buyer. I loved this position, it allowed me to be creative in merchandising and floral arrangements. It also allowed me to bargain/negotiate my own purchases and pricing, which empowered me to be aggressive with sales. Whole Foods culture is very educational, and very interested in our environment. I loved the extra training I received as well as learning to work with executives for the first time in my work experience. Management was very supportive, and motivating. The most challenging part of the position was keeping sales up during slow seasons."
good,I believe that Whole Foods is a place where they give lots of opportunities. In my opinion I believe that there should be more Jobs like Whole Foods because you learn how to interact with other people. You learn from them and you also can help them if they need help with anything.
good,"-Answered customer's questions about certain grocery items."
good,"Whole Foods Market is an excellent place to work. It's a great, fun, professional environment to be around. The pay and the benefits were awesome. Hardest part of the job was dealing with crazy costumers but that happens anywhere you go. The most enjoyable part were the fun activities the work provided."
good,"I worked almost 14 years at Whole Foods Market in Sebastopol.  The fellow team members make it great. I love customer service and they have very high standards,which i was very proud of. I wore many hats in this store and in the end i just wanted to be responsible for myself. I feel grateful for all the opportunities I was given. I'm very proud of my time there and my accomplishments. I was team member of the year in 2009. Regional all star 2011 and a Global Honorable mention 2011. I also racked up 30 outstanding customer service and outstanding team member awards. I'm ready to move on and spread my good service to another company."
good,"One of my best work experiences was at Whole Foods Market! ALL of the Team members (including Mgmnt) are extremely professional and ALWAYS Positive and willing to help each other move in a forward direction. I would HIGHLY recommend if you are looking for work. Opportunities are always arising within the company, locally and Nationwide."
good,"The discount card, food, fellow team members, constant changing to improve the store."
good,"The Whole Foods company is one of the leading businesses to work for. They are one of the few companies that actually care about their employees and want to make a difference in the lives of others. They have many fundamental programs and networks that allow people all over the world to increase their knowledge and provide them with the tools they need to live a healthier life style. I had a great time working for this company. I met a lot of amazing individuals who encouraged me to grow and suceed. While working at Whole Foods, I learned a lot about myself and became a stronger individual over all. I learned how to drive others to succeed and to provide the best customer service possible. I was able to grow in the company which gave me a sense of accomplishment. I think the hardest part of the job is the unreliable work hours that are given. Throughout a given week, an individual can work 5 different type of shifts which can make it very difficutl to balance work and life. However, these type of schedules are required in a retail environment. I will always love Whole Foods. I started the company in 2008 and am blessed that I was able to work for such a great company. I will miss many people there but it is time for me to grow and follow my dreams."
good,"•	Greeting every customer and potential customers in a pleasant and professional manner"
good,Each day goes fast as time and attention is demanding in everything you do.
good,"It was always a good day at work in wholefoods."
good,"Whole foods taught me alot of responsibility. I was fortunate to work there for a year and learn how to engage a customer. A work day would mostly consist of constant contact with your customers and co-workers.Management kept us up to date on everything and we were well prepared to execute our job to the best of our ability. the pro was being around enjoyable people , customers and co workers . the only con was i didn't take full advantage of my experience."
good,"My experience at Whole Foods was a good one. There were a couple of management choices made that had a negative impact on the team members, and my schedule was at times overwhelming, often leaving me feeling unbalanced. Overall, it was a positive experience, in which I had great work colleagues and a 20% discount on amazing food."
good,"I've worked for Whole Foods for over 6 years, five of which I worked as a supervisor. The hardest part for me working at the Whole Foods was the super fast paced environment. I am a hard worker but get overwhelmed sometimes in big crowds. The most enjoyable part about working for Whole Foods was the coworkers, and learning so much about healthy eating, and how to give great customer service."
good,"Great job for advancement, flexible scheduling. You learn alot about customer service and how to become a team member."
good,This company was great to work for. The upper management really cares about their Team Members. This is a hands on company that takes a true interest in what their employees think and want. I learned so much about the different kinds of food offered as well as special restricted diets.
good,great company really cared about core values and happiness of customers and employees
good,"appreciates customers, advertise and merchandise supplies well and gives gain share checks"
good,"Productive, busy workplace."
good,Everyone is great to work with.
good,"loved to work there, always busy, great food. not so great management, lazy co-workers. good food"
good,"i like working at Whole Food Market because there is a place of interaction. The company doesn't only serve their customer, but they also care about them and provide the best products to the customers. The management team is really approchable, and treats everybody the right way. One thing that i learned working at WFM is how to eat right. i learned what benefits you can get from organic foods."
good,A typical day at this job would be doing a produce walk and learning about the new produce in stock. Also helping the customers as well as providing new information about the coupons received. The managers were great and compliant with my schedule. The co-workers were fun and enjoyable being around. The hardest part of the job was memorizing the new codes the same day the produce came in. The most enjoyable part of the job was pay day because it meant that all the hard work and effort was brought forth in a rewarding way.
good,"Loved everything about Whole Foods Market. Great teammates, understanding management. Knowledgeable and truly practices what they preech, green healthy food. Would still be there if I hadn't had full time school."
good,"I loved working with the people here, and the great amount of feedback that I got in terms of how to improve myself. I was always asking supervisors and bosses for something more challenging to do so I could learn more about the company and help out in any way that I could during my shift."
good,One would not even need any outside of be yourself and pleasent. It is a good job as long as you keep busy and stay excited and happy to face any tasks.
good,Prepared foods was a pretty easy department especially if you're on morning shift because you come in and can take your time for the first 4 or 5 hours but then it gets really busy at lunch time.
good,Great Company to work for. I enjoyed my time there and was always very respectful to other co workers and supervisors. I learned ho to package meat. Greeting new customers and and employees
good,"The people that work there are fun and they allow you to use your creative skills and allow a fun enjoyable work environment. I miss working there, i only left because of family emergency in another state. If i could go back there I would in a heartbeat."
good,"It was a great place to work, i loved everyone there, i loved the environment. I think it was one of the best jobs i ever has, truthfully. The staff was helpful, my co workers were fun to work with and we had a great flow, a lot of things changed after it was bought by amazon, but we kept it a nice place to work."
good,I really like the amount of opportunities that they give you within the company. It has always been a place where if you have any questions or need advise the company will be there and the team leads will help you in any way that they can.
good,"Best job ever, flexible schedule, Good pay. No place to keep your stuff, very independent, just keep your numbers up."
good,"Working for WFM has been a pleasure, from the team members to the leaders I've always felt included, listened to and understood! I'm so happy to be apart of something great!"
good,Whole Foods is great to work for because they are a progressive company.  They are very up to date with what is happening in the world we live in. They really do care about their employees.
good,"I actually enjoyed working for WFM."
good,"I worked at WF as a contractor and would love to work there as a full time employee. I was accepted as an equal as a contractor, not like other corporate environments I have worked in. I was also able to work part time remotely."
good,"Whole foods is very lenient when it comes to their employees. 9/10 employees get fired for attendance, not how poorly they do there job. If youre doing poor in your area they usually move you to another department before firing you."
good,Everyone was extremely kind and helpful during my time at Whole Foods.  I can't think of a single complaint except for one or two incidents of an employee displaying toxic behavior such as speaking poorly of another employee's personal life.  I have never worked somewhere where this hasn't been the case though.
good,"whole food market is very peace full and good working environment, in addition I have good communicated wilt whole food team member. I have good benefit from the company."
good,All food is a great place to work I suggest anybody work there. Just be careful who you talk to and what you say. Everything counts there. Just like any other job show up on time and they will love you. My work ethic is way higher than most so I'm not going to get into that but if you have at least a minimum work ethic you will do good.
good,Nicest coworkers. Great place to work. They did a good job at recognizing hard work from employees. I was often rewarded for my customer service. Would work at whole foods again part time.
good,"Whole Foods is a great company. They seem to really take care of their employees. Although i haven't officially started my first day, the whole interview process was very professional. Whole Foods was hosting their yearly job fair, and I was fortunate to land a job. Very excited to start with this great company! Wish me luck!!!"
good,"Fun place to work very fun. You learn a lot about different things, foods and a lot more. They offer flexible schedules and ways to grow and move up in the company."
good,I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods.   The atmosphere was very awesome.  I left to have a baby and stay at home with my children it have nothing to so with the company.
good,"healthy foods i learned to properly build displays and how to merchandise"
good,"Operated lift and hand trucks to transfer materials to and from target areas. Prepared and processed shipping documents, including work and shipping orders, route materials and bills of lading."
good,Working with a bigger team to respectfully  act out the core values of the company. Giving customers great customer services.Being able to locate and identify customer specific items in the store. Leadership skills. Room to grow within the company.
good,"Benefits were great before Amazon takeover."
good,Great place to work and make fun work friends that genuinely care about your health and wellness. Also a fun place to learn basic work skills and advance into other positions. Very fun environment after you get past the snobby customers.
good,I loved every minute of working for wholefoods.I started off part time and 5 months later i became full time.I started off making 11.50 but once amazon bought wholefoods I started making 15.00. I won best customer service twice each time i was giving a 25.00 gift card.
good,"Busy work environment where there is always something to do.  You learn to interact with a lot of different people with different backgrounds.  "
good,"I work overnights receiving for Whole Foods and enjoy it. My current ATL/acting TL has helped me anytime i needed assistance, although my shift is usually just me. I would absolutely recomend working at Arbor Trails to anyone."
good,Stocking and rotating of products assuring high quality products. Guest interaction offering service and advice on seasonal fruits and vegetables. I learned a lot from my superiors such as organizational skills.The hardest part of the job was the holidays we were understaffed so we all had extra work to do but managed to get it done. most enjoyable part was the people and seeing them enjoy the work i did to make everything look fresh and full
good,I really enjoyed working for Whole Foods Market as a part of the produce team. I often times got to work with team members from other departments and the job never felt mundane in the least. The ebb and flow of the work day is decently stimulating and my team leaders made me feel motivated enough that things got done quickly and efficiently under their guidance and encouragement.
good,"There aren’t many aspects that I can say is mediocre about working at Whole Foods except that there are blackout dates around the holiday season, requiring employees to work during thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve. I’d rather spend time with my family on those dates. But other than that, the company has great employee discounts on store products, my managers and fellow team members were nice and smart, the pay was competetive, overall this was a great work experience."
good,"Be prepared to produce. We have fun but get the job done. have good communication skills. Be prepared to offer excellent customer service. More than a job, a community."
good,"THe benefits are wonderful and it’s a perfect place to keep busy. "
good,"Whole foods is a great company to work for. Working at whole foods provides great exposure to the wonderful community it serves. The thing to be aware of is detail to policies and procedures, whole foods is a by the book company."
good,"A typical day at work goes by very fast, with everyone being welcoming and the managers more than competent and responsible. As a floater, I get to learn the ins and outs of every department, making me feel more valued and required by the store. I would say the hardest part of the job is when you're new because even though all the staff are competent and want to train you in everything, there isn't much time to do so for there is always something to do. This leaves more than a few unanswered questions that constantly come in friction with your work, but everyone tries their best to clear up anything you are unaware of. The most enjoyable part about the job can also be the most daunting and even most frustrating, but for me, it is interacting with the customers. Some real genuine gems come through with nothing but smiles and goodheartedness that light up your already great day. Other customers with lesser intentions are overshadowed by those that truly mean good, and being able to make both sets of customers' days go by more smoothly means all the difference."
good,"Pretty Laid Back, $15/hr regular pay but raised to $16-$18 on Sundays.. that’s when it got busy. But there are nice co-workers who will assist on orders & Whole Food Associates locate whatever you ask them to."
good,"A typical day at the job would include conversing with customers and co-workers in a mutual environment, moving carts between levels in the , and assisting fellow coworkers at the registers. Management was relaxed and you were able to converse with them as if they were your peers yet well respected. What I learned from the job is how to effectively work the register within a business and build relationships with your peers while doing so and this is what made me enjoy the job and hold it in such high regards."
good,"Good review, great work environment, great people, great trainers Please working conditions great products. Encouraging team leaders and management. Enjoyed"
good,"Working at WFM, there was always something to help with. People worked as One team, regardless of different departments. Team work goes a long way. The culture to WFM is clear and warm. They help you succeed/thrive as much as you're willing to put into it."
good,"Get your money n go home! Time will go by."
good,Nicest company I have ever worked for. Some of the nicest people I have ever worked for and with. Some very unique people you will meet and gain perspective from them.
good,I really can say that they care about you at the store I got hired at and I hope every whole foods is like that. They treated me with respect and love.
good,Good company to move up in. Very fast paced and busy environment. Good benefits. Management is good for the most part. I learned a lot of product knowledge and things I wouldn't normally get out of a barista job.
good,working for Whole Foods was great! Good people fun mini events often always something to do! simple work if you have a question people are happy to help out and pass on knowledge. job advancement opportunities are all over the place if you want and work for them!!!
good,i work there for 5 years  it was a nice place to work.I help a lot of customer during their shopping time.I have to help them out with their grocery  when they done shopping.
good,Wholefoods is a great company to work for. The hours are flexible and management is accommodating to outside obligations. I would definitely recommend Whole Foods to any student looking for a steady part-time job that pays relatively well.
good,"Great company to work for with high ethical values regarding their products, company policies, employees."
good,"It was cool,learning the products this company has,learning about GMOs and none GMO products, organic foods and products. Overall whole foods has Good energy, good team work,and a great work environment"
good,Great place to work. Enjoyed the culture of the business. Allowed for opportunities to grow within the company. Very flexible with scheduling as long as you communicated what your needs are.
good,Everyday I went to work I knew i was going to have fun. A responsible team with great management really made me feel welcomed and helped to encourage a productive attitude in the workplace.
good,"I worked with a great team. No job is perfect, but I did enjoy working with our customers. I felt a sense of pride working for Whole Foods. Working towards saving the environment is another plus!"
good,Would love younger management to be involved in decision making at Whole Foods Market. We deserve those opportunities and are capable of creating and establishing a conducive environment for all team members and customers.
good,"I stated with no experience, they trained me in every aspect of the job, they gave me opportunity to grow within, after 8 years working seafood for WFM i became a most experienced and knowledgable seafood team member for WFM Midwest region, I would recommend this company to anyone to work for."
good,I enjoyed working for Whole Foods. It was a great environment and culture is awesome. Managers are extremely flexible and supportive. It is a fast pace job and they do track attendace and policy of attendance is flexible. Customers were pretty awesome! My only complaint is that Whole Foods doesn't pay good enough to live in the area.
good,The way we were treated at whole foods was better than anything i have experienced. the community they built in that store was fantastic. It was actually a job that i wanted to come back every day.
good,Very productive / competitive environment . Management has a tendency to hang in cliques. Have to know someone to advance your role at least at the store I worked. Not flexible with Employees life outside of work. Non - cooperative and mid communication was huge. If that gets fixed. It has great potential. Overall besides this it’s a great job to do until you find what you want to do a career in.
good,"Sometimes, customers will get you down. Any struggles that come from working there come not from the work environment but from the people who shop there."
good,"Whole Foods thrives on its workplace culture. Employees, more often than not, will go out of their way to help one another. There is a collective understanding that despite there being multiple departments there is ultimately one team. It is critical those applying/seeking to be brought into a store's family share in this idea. The day's work is shared among all, not pulling one's weight of the collective load becomes the problem of one's coworkers. Be open to helping others even if you are busy, open to learning new things, be mindful of your surroundings, and seek to be proactive with what tasks need doing. When in doubt ask what you can be doing that would be most helpful at the current time and within the next few hours. Moreover, if you aim to go above and beyond you will build love, appreciation, and job satisfaction."
good,Amazing workplace where everyday is a great day to better yourself as a person in discovering new ways to create a quality place of shopping for customers and build up team skills as a worker.
good,Fabulous work environment. Treated with respect. Fellow employees and management collaborate to encourage a healthy living lifestyle. Great opportunities for advancement.
good,Very standard customer service job. High emphasis on customer service. Management was always professional and also respectful. I enjoyed going into work to see my coworkers and my management team. You learn a lot about product knowledge too which is a plus.
good,"I work in the florist and it depends on which store you work at but I worked really well with my supervisor. I'm a full time student and she is really understanding and flexible with my schedule when I need time off. I would recommend this company to students who need a part time, higher paying job."
good,"Relaxed but faced paced customer service oriented job, lots of room for advancement and many different positions to work. I had a great time working for the company."
good,"a great place to start a career, with amazing benefits and amazing people. a place where a schedule that helps you succeed at work and outside of work is given."
good,It gave me more experience working with registers along with customers. It also allowed me to become more punctual with my time and better at time management.
good,Worked in various departments. The cliente at Whole foods is very nice. Most customers shop more than twice a week so you really get to know them well.
good,"I think the company I worked for doesn't exist anymore. I left before Amazon bought them and it was a fabulous place to work. I have heard different opinions since the company was bought out. I loved working at WFM. I loved my fellow team members, my dept leadership, and certain store leadership. Our regional manager is the most incredibly supportive man. The benefits were great, but the hours were terrible. I was part of the opening team at my store and we were excited and passionate and the culture of the company and what it stood for. I enjoyed talking to customers about their dietary concerns and encouraging people to nourish their bodies."
good,I love working for Whole Foods Market.  Overall and I have had a wonderful experience in my time spent there.  I have developed healthy personal and professional relationships with people  from all walks of life.  I have had the luxury of cross training with multiple departments and learning many different aspects of the food retail business.  I am looking to take my knowledge and experience learned from whole foods and apply it moving forward in my professional career.
good,Whole Foods was a great experience! One of my favorite aspects of the company is raises are given based on performance NOT length of time the company!
good,"Great job for college students, and promotes healthy living. I really appreciate all of the training that was given beforehand. As i was really really prepared beforehand."
good,How food is a great place to work from the celebrity customer to the neighborhood customer I enjoy DeWalt customer service I enjoy preppy gourmet meals for customers to take home
good,"Great culture, nice people, good pay for part time job, good bonuses, great discount, good & safe environment, hardest part was standing all day long."
good,"Whole Foods market è un ambiente stimolante, ove si premia la meritorcrazia"
good,Great people to work with and it’s a great job to have financial wise and for the benefits. You can wear what you want and the discount card is 25%. You build forever friendships and that hire back for points I guess I’m the exception to though lol.
good,"It was a flexible place, fun to work and friendly with everyone"
good,Fun place to work with great people and management that wants you to succeed and push you to grow into a roll that you want to do. Employee input is requested in many decisions made by the store.
good,"8/10 "
good,"Worked here for over a year. Great pay with great benefits. Management is very supportive and there is plenty of room to move up. I only worked for the company 2 weeks before I applied for, and got, my first promotion. 3 months later I applied for, and got, another one."
good,"I love working at Whole Foods! They are super friendly and flexible. Day to day I cut fruit, make guacamole, etc. and enjoy being there. I recommend working there with great management."
good,A conscientious company and fair employer. Communication is excellent. Fast pace and busy environment. Myself and co workers are happy. Pay is good and benefits are affordable.
good,a good opportunity for advancement and chance for obtaining new skills.  Food on menu are healthy and organic. Friendly and professional work environment
good,"It was a very good experience but the it was a bit of challenging role. But I think I needed to use my initiative a bit more than I did to be honest. I had a job coach a long side me because the work experience was organised by a company called Remploy. "
good,I worked as a front end team member (cashier) at a Whole Foods in Tulsa for about 2 years. I loved working there! The team dynamic was great and the management was as well. Not to mention the decent pay for a relativity easy position. Whole Foods has been my favorite part-time job I've had!
good,My experience at Whole Foods Market was great. The people were great and the atmosphere was great. I have no problems or complaints. I loved every bit of it. It’s all good!
good,"Worked in the Meat Department nights and weekends.  My manager was excellent, taught me new things whenever he could, and understood my working there as secondary to my 9-5 job."
good,Has a great learning environment with many avenues to advance. You feel a since of purpose helping customers on there way to better health choices. A typical day at work would be 75% of my time helping customers with the rest in the office.
good,Was a good place to work for the most part.  Working overnight hours was difficult but a great experience working in the bakery world and doing something that made the job worthwhile.
good,"They expect alot from you, but I found the customers and co-workers to be great.  You need to be on top of your scheduling, and able to learn new things quickly.  It's fast paced, but also rewarding.  It is a very well run business, and their customer service policies make it very easy to help people, unlike many other corporations I have worked for.  The customers, especially the regulars, seem to care a lot about how the employees are treated, so it's a positive work environment.  Every other week or so, they put out an amazing spread for the employees.  Full time positions are hard to get, you may have to wait 6 months to a year, but from what I hear the benefits are outstanding.  I relocated so I had to leave, but I would highly recommend working there."
good,"I worked at a whole foods in Chicago. The staff was as inclusive as it was diverse. Management and team were not only helpful, kind and supportive to each other, but were impressively patient and caring toward the customers. And this was in a new, large and very busy store."
good,"When I was hired, WFM had a huge emphasis on local food and employee happiness. I'm afraid amazon is changing that. The culture has changed and it feels more like a large corporate store than the unique regional store that hired me. Employees are passionate and wonderful people to work with. Overall it was a great place to work but the changing atmosphere and the growing pains associated with the Amazon takeover prompted me to leave."
good,This company was so fun at first but it became kind of stressful. It seemed no matter how hard you worked it was not enough. I liked the customers that came in and that you get to learn a lot about differ foods.

The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot for hours on end, but it is worth it working here. The pay is pretty good for a cashiering job.

good,I met wonderful people not just coworkers but customers also. They have great benefits and the hours were reasonable. I looked forward to coming to work and my friends and family can tell that I truly miss working there.
good,"I really appreciated and enjoyed the daily meetings. Every shift, you would meet with your department and go over sales, team work ethic, goals, and appreciations of one another. Often, the store staff meets up as well. In the Prepared Foods area, you learn how to properly handle and prep food, how to properly cook. It is a lot of work. You must always maintain a beautiful and clean display of the food and finish a lot of temperature logging. Working in the bakery consisted of inventory of old and new items, packaging, handling and slicing bread. For coffee bar, you are responsible for having fresh coffee available, prepping and cleaning fruits and vegetables, serving juices and smoothies, and cash handling. This job is a lot, and under pressure, can be quite stressful. The encouragement of open communication makes you feel wanted.  The management was really understanding and made efforts to work with you, communicate with you. There are people who slack, who don't make the conscious effort to communicate, there was useless drama. It is inevitable and should be expected at any job."

As one of the only teenagers working people were very friendly and welcoming. It is a fast-paced job that requires a lot of energy, but it made my shifts fly by."
good,"Needs to listen to their supervisor more and correct the issue right away. If they tell you so and so is not working seriously get on them, otherwise other team members will not want to work with people that doesnt like to work and thats when their attendance get affected and they start falling out, and then whole foods can lose a great worker!"
good,"I loved my time at Whole Foods, the cutlure was unlike anything else and the information given to you about why they exist and what their desires are in invaluabvle. "

good,I've been at Whole Foods Market for 23 years. But they eliminated my position. Need to look for another job as a Graphic Designer because that is my passion.
good,"Good benefits, VERY friendly environment.  Lots of hard work.  If I had to do it again, I would.  The upper management is distant, and Amazon did made some visible changes, but the core is the same."
good,It's a great place to work. Wonderful people and leadership. Great benefits. I really like that they treat their employees like family. It is a really happy environment.
good,It can get busy and fast pace but there its a good environment with a team orieted culture. Pleanty of oppertunity for growth within the company of you wish to move up.
good,"It's all in the culture, and Whole Foods has gigantic posters over-hanging the front end of their store celebrating theirs.  A company can appreciate its workers and thrive, even in this economy.  After working elsewhere for more than a decade, the kind of respect and appreciation I can feel working in a similar business, was and still is mind-blowing."
good,"The managers were nice and helpful, pay and benefits are good. A great place to work, very busy during holidays, so it would be a good choice for someone who enjoys a fast paced work environment."

good,A work day at Whole Foods was consisted of checking out customers and helping them with their purchases. I learned how to efficiently make sure customers are properly taken care of and learned about how to handle theft and how to handle big amounts of money. The workplace was extremely friendly and loving. The hardest part of the job was memorizing codes for products. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers.
good,"The management and people are excellent, with many opportunities to advance. The company does the vast majority of their hiring through promotions, so it is common for people to remain with the company for many years."
good,I enjoy working here but weekends are very necessary in the grocery business. Its a stressful place at times and customers can be hard to deal with but all in all it is a great place to work for.
good,They gave me a chance to enter in the world of Grocery Market only that but a Market that focuses on shopping healthy and I took on the task of being the best customer service team member.
good,"Great place to work if you're on the regional side of things. Part of what makes the place great also makes it difficult to get things done, very decentralized at a ""global"" level."
good,Whole foods market is not just a grocery store or work place to me it's a peaceful community where people just meet up and nothing but great laughter and fun
good,Work was always fun. It was a judgement free environment that pushed toy to be a better in your work life and personal life. The company really prides itself on making sure that the associates are happy in order to have a positive work environment. Always fun and friendly activities for workers and customers.

good,I loved working for whole foods....everyone there was very helpful and friendly..the products they sell are very healthy and the customers are very friendly
good,"Although many days at Whole Foods Market fall into a very rote and monotonous activity, working for the Specialty Department taught me most of the retail acumen I use presently, from recommendations for stellar recipes to making sure the consumer leaves the store knowing more about the products they regularly purchase. The culture was one of peer to peer uplifting, where most of the other employees were around my age and highly motivating to deliver premium service. The hardest part of working in Whole Foods was placating some of the really rare irascible customers who never seemed satisfied with a recommendation for an alternative item when the original item of their interest was out of stock, while the most enjoyable was to come in every shift and figure out what activities one could do to fit into the beehive of activity happening constantly at the store. All in all, working at Whole Foods Market (Midtown East) was a great experience and I am still very thankful for many of the practical skills obtained during my tenure there."
good,"Friendly team members and team leader. Good benefits and professional environment. I like to work here, if you are looking for challenge your self and find new experience."

good,great place to work. It has great values and also a great job to grow in. The hard part of this job is the fast pace during the day. The great benefit of fast pace time flies while at work
good,"A typical day includes me meeting deadlines for orders, possibly training new hires, delegating task and making sure they are completed daily, checking punches weekly and making any corrections, cross training in other departments to extend my learning and skills, and keeping the team moral high. The hardest part is dealing with corrective action for unexcused time and attendance infractions and the best part is building great relationships with the team and the vendors."
good,"Learned about food Quality how rotate product and learned about "
good,"Whole Foods has been the best place I've worked so far everyone is very friendly, only negative thing is I've been lied to about getting advancement positions."
good,"Whole Foods has a fantastic mission, great compensation and benefits, and some amazing people. I would recommend this place to anyone that wishes to be a part of a quick-paced work environment and wishes to be provided with opportunity to advance professionally."
good,"Whole Foods is a great company to work for. They provide nutritious whole foods at a great price. "
good,Busy at times and laid back at others (unless you're a cashier). Still a fun work environment! Worked around my school schedule and were pretty accommodating with days off.
good,good company to work for. leaders in the industry. organic products. several locations for transferring and promotions. fun incentives and discounts. .
good,"Excellent Leadership, job culture, and execution."

good,"Whole Foods Market has been a rewarding, great place to work for the past decade. In that time I have seen incredible growth, a company wide restructuring, and the effects of a company on a community. Over the course of my time there, I wore many hats, including the following: catering liaison, Associate Team Leader (prepared foods), receiver, and presently a specialist in the produce department."
good,"I loved working there not only because of the awesome coworkers and high standards, but because it was truly an educational place for both employees and customers. There are always new products, people, and events for the employees."

That's how i was recruited. There is a lot to learn and a lot to do, but if you show motivation and initiative, the sky is the limit with this company."
good,You come in and you run it like you own it. you check the store when you walk in and then you get to work. No is really guiding you instead you work a section and work it.
good,This is a company that treats their employees with respect. A very enjoyable work environment in my experience. Management was nice and thoughtful. Workload was manageable.
good,"WFM really does take care of their employees. Everyone is upbeat and outgoing, and the environment is truly one of a kind. If you're looking for a company where growth starts from within then WFM is the best place to work."
good,I love Whole Foods Market and every Thing it stands for. The employees get treated right and the management here is nice! All the managers are good to the associates. Everyone is treated with respect and the pay is great. I would love to keep advancing with this store in the future.

good,"I loved the fast pace, multi-tasking and the freedom to do whatever it  takes to ""Satisfy and Delight"" our guests.  I learned something new about food, techniques and diet everyday.  We work really hard but, make it look easy and have fun.  My plan was to work at Whole Foods Market for a year and ended up there for eight and a half years.  My Store Team Leader is an amazing leader and mentor to all Team Members.  I started on the Customer Service Team, transferring to the Sea Food Team and Restaurant.  Prepared Foods working the Chefs Case, sandwich, soups and temperature logs.  While making sure the Rotisserie Chickens are cooked to perfection at 175 degrees  and everything is clean, full and beautiful.  The chickens weigh approx 37lbs that you have to lift over your head into a hot fire and then take them off the hot spit, and into the packaging carrying them to the hot table.  I would have to say chickens became the hardest part of my job.  I looked forward to my shift, seeing my Team Members and guests each time I worked."
good,"I loved working for Whole Foods Market in Napa. The team in that store is one of a kind. When I started with the company I knew very little about natural and organic foods. WFM is great at providing you with all the tools and information you will need in order to provide the best service for your customers. Product knowledge, policy, procedure, and quality standard trainings are never in short supply. WFM empowers its team members to go above and beyond in their positions and in the service that they provide to their customers. If your desire is to go far with the company, the leadership will support you in that regardless of your time with the company. Advancement at WFM is based off of work ethic and effort as opposed to seniority."
good,Really embraces the natural living culture and helps promote it to all team members. 20% Discount is really a plus and helps team members try new products.
good,"Typical day at work at whole foods was great. I worked overnight so we would go in work the truck and get everything done.the work environment was lax and and management was great. I learned a bit of how supermarkets run, and techniques to boost sales. The worst hardest part of the job was locating exactly where some items were, and the most enjoyable part was lunch because who doesnt love to eat?"
good,"As long as you keep an open window of communication and are a good worker, this is a great place to work for, with a great starting salary for retail, and a fun environment."
good,i learned how to attack challenges with a team or by myself. learn how to manage the time given to me in order to get my assignments done.  i learned how to keep logs and track my paperwork. i learned responsibility and the importance of delegation in a team enviorment.
good,"A typical day at work started with produce walks and checking in with your supervisor, from there you'd be assigned either to CSC or the register and that would kind of determine what you did for the rest of the night. If you were CSC you'd be responsible for bagging groceries, helping people carry them out to the car, cart runs, and lots of cleaning in any given area of the front end, most of the time for the cafe. The coworkers were friendly, helpful, and great to work with. The management was incredible, nobody really felt like they were too above you to talk about anything with. Very personable staff and a very professional environment that encouraged individuality and growth. The hardest part of the job was remembering all of the PLU's for the produce because depending on sales or what was in stock they would always be changing and new ones would come and go. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and helping them out with whatever they needed, especially since Oakland is such a diverse community. You really got a feel for a lot of different types of people, all whom were generally very nice."
good,"* Assist Manager in building a profitable and team orientated   department."

good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Whole Foods. Desire to leave the harsh New England winters behind was the reason for my departure.

good,"It was a fantastic environment that allows space to grow and develop. "
good,"Meeting and satisfying a wide range of customers was a joy."
good,"Over the past 18 years, I have grown both professionally and personally because of my employment at Whole Foods Market. Every day I would learn more about communication, how to run a successful team, and the natural foods industry. Management always had an open door policy, which was highly appreciated by all. I've worked with a variety of co-workers and clientele alike. Trying to compete with fellow stores in the region that had double the amount of sales was difficult at times. I enjoyed the ability to mentor and lead many team members. I had an enormous sense of pride in knowing that I contributed to their success."
good,It was very good for the time being but in the end I found that the changing sleep schedule that came with an unset work schedule was holding me back mentally.

good,A typical day would be like being with family.  I learned that there are all kinds of people and mostly we all want the same thing in life.  Management was outstanding in the beginning but it eventually started feeling like a job.  The hardest part of the job was nothing.  The most enjoyable part was being with my family away from home.

The co-workers I worked with had the team player kind of spirit. The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate well with the difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to scatter around during the day and fulfilling many different tasks in one day.

Whole Foods was and I am sure still is all about being healthy, in regards to what you ate, and also mental and physical health was acknowledged.

Whole Foods Market is a very great company."

After the day is done we all go to the back and clean out our maintenance carts and clock out."
good,"Whole Foods Market has a great team environment.Leadership is supportive and helpful. I have learned so much about natural,grassfed, and organic products since coming to Whole Foods.

And the result was that most of the customer with whom I interacted were friendly and satisfied, and anytime there was a complaint, it was a relatively quick and easy process to solve it. I learned how to maintain calm and patience even when being yelled at by an angry customer, and picked up a lot of helpful managerial and training skills as well when I trained new Team Members. Although my schedule varied, which was sometimes aggravating, I always got a good number of hours per week and generally enjoyed and excelled at the work."
good,"A typical day for me at whole foods starts in the morning at 5:30. I help prepare the sales floor for our customers and clean to make sure everything is safe. "
good,"I work at the check out lanes.  I greet customers with a smile and engage them in friendly banter.  I ring up their grocery items and bag them for the customers.  I tell the customer to have a great day, thank you, and Whole Foods Market appreciates their visit.  I have learned how a grocery store works, such as buyers, stockers, inventory, and quality standards at Whole Foods Market.  I am constantly learning from management about Whole Foods Market and am being rewarded for my knowledge about the company.  The management makes the day fun by having small competitions to win prizes with my co-workers.  Management is great with overseeing the workers needs and breaks.  My co-workers are friendly and make my work day exciting.  The hardest part of the job is when we don't have a product in the store for a customer and having to tell them an item has been discontinued.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that I like coming to work and seeing the people I work with and the return customers.  "
good,"I was very impressed with the professionalism of the company from day one. would work for again in a heart beat. I got to work with some really quality people during my time there. I was separated due to the company attendance policy. It's pretty strict, but for good reason when many people tend to take advantage of leniency. I am eligible for rehire in six months and looking forward to it."

I learned that what we eat on a daily basis have tremendous effect on our energy level and health. The management staff is very supportive for others and they actually help you with your task. The co-workers are very helpful and willing to go the extra-mile even though it is not their duty. The hardest part of this job was answering a customer's question that is not dealing with my department. The most enjoyable part of this job was pleasing the customers and having confirmation that I did a good job."

good,"I usually got to work around 7am I started with measuring out all my ingredients to make the bread and after I mixed the dough I would let it rise. while that was happening I would start making the gelato which is italian ice cream, probably my favorite thing to do. I usually had my own free will of what kind of flavors I wanted to create that day. I usually worked with one person that would help in the task at hand. The hardest part of the job was usually putting up all the 50 lb bags of flour because there was usually like 20 or more at a time, it takes a tole on your back even though I am very active outside work"
good,"you will learn lots of new stuff,"
good,its really much busy all the time the management team helps out alot and time goes by really fast as a cashier and i think the hardest part is just standing for most of the day which usually brings sum kind of pain to my back i think everyone would prefer it if we could sit and do our job but i dont think that will ever happen.

good,"At Whole Foods Market I was always accepted for who I was and found the team effort to be helpful when customer service becomes a challenge.  I was often challenged to handle a stressful environment but never having to do that alone without assistance from another employee when I really needed help.  This is a great job for people that don't mind physical labor and cleaning. This company provides wonderful resources for people of any race, background, with a disability, gender, religious belief, etc.  The most accepting company I've worked for and the variety of employees working really sets a positive example for any company trying to uphold an open door policy."

good,A typical day working at Whole Foods was pretty laid back and enjoyable. My co workers were a pleasure to work with although management could have been more helpful. Face to face Contact with the customers was the best experience.
good,I genuinely had the greatest time working at the whole foods across from the grove. i miss it and I was super sad when I left. everyone including most of admin was amazing
good,Loved working at whole foods. Amazing company to work for. Besides the  childish coworkers i loved everything about working there. The management is great and the pay is more than worth it

good,"Love the company, and I believe you'll love it too. My regional management was great, and it was very pleasant to interact with them. I'm hoping that I can find a company that is very similar."
good,"A typical day of working at Whole Foods involves walking in and immediately having someone say hello with a smile. I would always try to show up a little early so I could say hello to fellow co-workers and also see how the store was flowing. During the work hours I would work to maintain the meat case and make sure everything is ready for the customer to take home. I would recommend recipes for particular cuts and items so the customer would enjoy it more. One thing I learned working this job is how to deal with angry or upset customers. Always try to do everything you know you can do for a customer before getting a manager. However, you must be careful not to upset the customer more. If nothing works, call a manager or shift leader to help you and the customer to solve the problem. The hardest part of my job was cleaning while being busy until closing. Sometimes customers had schedules that did not mesh with the store hours. It was very difficult when you have all tables, boards, and cutting utensils clean, but then someone needs you to cut a chicken. It was only frustrating and only made things a bit more rushed."
good,"I worked for WFM for 2 years as a Juice Bar Barista. My Manager was cool and my team as well. Very fun atmosphere, can be stressful at times due to thieves that would take things off of the register or around the store. Its a grocery store so any personal info does get around which is one downfall of working there but other than that I left only because I was tired of working the night shift that no one else wanted and as a result my kids grades were falling behind because I was not home to help them."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a quick-paced and energetic environment. I was always learning new skills, developing my career and always felt supported by upper management. Made many close friends within this company."
good,The best part of the job is the people who I work with.  The culture is good too.  The hardest part of this particular WF is the customer base.  Not all WF's are in area such as this and I look forward to finding a different location that maybe the customers are a little more used to shopping at WF.  The staff and management are very supportive of advancement wishes and will help if one wants to transfer to another store and/or position if one is open.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a lot of people every day.  I liked having the opportunity to give them a positive end to their shopping experience by getting them taken care of efficiently and with care.
good,"They get a lot of flack for recently being purchased, and team members not liking changes. That makes for employees who have been there for a long time giving the company a worse review than it deserves. "
good,I am always in awe of a company that makes it a point to follow through with what they do. Whole Foods is the best place in my opinion to work. They are very honorable in the way they handle themselves.
good,"Whole Foods morning production shift is fun because you get to participate in a group environment."
good,Loved working here. Really enjoyed coming to work every day. I had amazing co- workers. Cuatomers were good. Managment was good. They really worked with your schedule.
good,What is this for? Not sure where this goes or who uses it but it was a good company while I needed it.  I worked here after design school.  They took care of me.
good,I’ve learned different techniques throughout the store from customer service to working closely with our vendors. Overall my experience here has been a excellent one.
good,"Great company ! Loved working here. Management was awesome, everyone is very friendly. Very fast paced and they really care about there team member as well as the customers."
good,"Amazing culture and environment, but it is tough physical work. I started as a cashier and you have to memorize 100 codes right away (actually do-able!) and I was challenged each day. It's easy to move up at first- I was able to work in the COS office and as TE pretty quickly, but after that there's definitely a wall and less opportunity. They offer training programs and such, but it isn't always easy to get into. The hardest part of the job is making connections with customers for 8 hours a day every day, sometimes late at night and early morning.  It's so rewarding though, and amazing if you're at this point in your career. Absolutely an amazing company to work for but they will expect your best- be ready to give it to them."
good,Started great with the company. I had gotten pregnant only 3 months into working for the company and worked my whole 9 months and still receive my 6-week maternity leave and was able to come back to work. As years started passing poor leadership started to become a problem but overall a good place to work for
good,I loved working for this company. I made friends and loved going to work because the work environment is just great to be around. I had a lot of fun :)
good,Overall I enjoyed my time working for Whole Foods. Met a lot of friendly coworkers and genuinely enjoyed going to work. Great team oriented environment.
good,"Worked with all ages of people. WFM hired the most pleasant and customer service oriented people. We were always complimented by customers. They had one week for employees with free food, t-shirts and gifts and family fun games. Managers were supportive of time off in emergencies."
good,"Great place to work. Great management/team leaders -- they care about their employees not only as workers, but also as people. Flexible schedule. Great people to work with."
good,"Overall good to work for. They are flexible as long as you remain honest with them. If you are focused, then you will thrive. Your attitude will be your biggest ally; staying away from distractions such as gossip and effective time management are the key as well."
good,"Very nice place to work"
good,Whole Foods might just be my favorite grocery store chain that Ive ever visited. Working there was an honor seeing as I felt good about what I was selling to families in the area and knowing they looked forward to coming back.
good,"The people are great, and I enjoy a fast-paced environment, so this job always allowed me to have something to do! The 20% discount was really nice too!"
good,whole foods is a cool place to work at. plenty of room from growth. everyone is like a family. only thing is some of their policies don't make any sense. and they don't tell you EVERYTHING you need to know
good,"I worked for wholefoods for almost 2 years , hands down one of my favorite companies to work for , great managers , nice hard working people who value culture ."
good,"Loved this job. Great management. They treat employees fair. Great benefits. If you put in your time, work hard, be on time, is will be a good job. No uniforms. Yeah"
good,"WFM has a great company culture that is supported by most of the employees, especially the management. Grocery retailing can be tough/ unpleasant especially when the customers I interact with are mainly the ones who come to the booth with problems or complaints, but the management has been very supportive and wants us to do our best."
good,all team members get voted on after 90 days so all the employees really want to be there and enjoy their job.  Everyone is very friendly and passionate about healthy foods.
good,"It was a good expierence, costumers were very kind and welcoming. Workers were nice and welcoming also! I sugggest people to work there too. Liked the place"
good,"review summary, i do not want to write about wholefoods market but there is no way out of this review so i guess i can keep typing until there is no more"
good,My favorite part of working at this location is the people I work with. My department knows how to joke around while also working hard. I enjoy interacting with the customers.
good,"I liked how the team were set up. Each department was its own 'team' with a structure of team members, supervisors, associate team leaders, and team leaders. It made the chain of command very straight forward."
good,"A place with infinite chances to learn and teach customers about food"
good,Whole Foods is a great company to work for. All managers and team leaders are very understandable. Great core values. The company's benefits for employees are great.
good,"Ive learned how to manage my time working as a cake decorator at Whole Foods. A typical day goes by fast most times, keeping a productive and busy day. Ensuring all our customers get all the help they need with any questions they have. Most enjoying part of my day would be working with great co-workers, and keeping customers happy."
good,"Truly a team effort is put into everything we do at Whole Foods Market. When a team of people works efficiently, the greater amount of positive results are to come from the customers who shop with us! We put our all and our best foot forward when it comes to customer care, and it shows all throughout the store."
good,"The more time you put in, the more they take care of you. Good and stable place. They breed good leadership and those leaders are willing to pour into people beneath them. It is a chain that ends up benefiting the entire store."
good,"I absolutely love working for Whole Foods Market. The only drawback are the customers who shop there; many are quite needy, spoiled, rude, racist, and overall just plain jerks trying to take advantage of someone serving them. Aside from that part, I've been blessed with a very nurturing and supportive management team. The culture at WF or at least the location I work with is one big family. We are truly a team and we for the most part we can depend on each other. Whole Foods truly takes care of its employees with good pay and great benefits, and employees are often shown appreciation by management either verbally and/ or through things such as gift cards and public recognition. My store is also very accommodating of scheduling if you are in school or have certain outside obligations. Next, opportunities for advancement are highly attainable, as this company hires within a lot. I have witnessed several of my co-workers from various departments receive well-deserved promotions either at our store or another one. Working here has truly made me more conscious of what I choose to eat, has introduced me to all kinds of new foods, and has allowed me to meet some of the greatest people! The hardest part of the job: CUSTOMERS. The most enjoyable part of the job: Pay and co-workers."
good,My opinion on Wholefoods Market is that its a great environment to work in and you get a lot of benefits working there and you learn a lot i would recommend to a friend to work there.
good,"Fast-paced a lot of the time, always something to do, lots of variety. On-going product training, Good Organics training. Store Leadership sets a good example upholding WFM's core values, is proud to work for the company and shares that with team members. Team members are amazing, kind, compassionate, fun! Excellent benefits including PTO, health ins., gainsharing, annual Team Member Appreciation Week, opportunities to win WFM gift cards, and so much more! I LOVE Whole Foods Market and I'm proud to work here. The hardest part is reading/hearing others berate our company. No company is perfect and I hope our CEO is going make the right decisions for our future so that we remain the leader in our industry."
good,Management is very well organized for each department. Team leaders provide you with the necessary steps to succeed and grow within the company. Fairly easy job. Not much manual labor.
good,Management is flexible with student schedules and work with you if you want more hours. Coworkers are friendly and help you if needed. Starting pay is above minimum wage and you are eligible for pay raises with each yearly review. Awesome work environment!
good,"My typical day at work as a cashier consisted of cleaning my register, checking out customers, bagging, moving carts, and stocking my lane with different small items."
good,"I would advise someone to work at Whole Foods(Plymouth Meeting) without even thinking twice. It is an awesome place to work. Co-workers, benefits, the work environment in its entirety, and the product... all amazing."
good,Could have asked for a better team to work for at Whole Foods. The management is amazing. They are all understanding of the balance of work/life. A typical day is always productive but the environment is so positive the day goes pretty fast.
good,An amazing place to work with a lot of growth opportunities !  Great pay and some of the best benefits i have seen in the industry.  They care about their team members and really try to help people advance through the company.
good,Every single day would consist of people around you striving for excellent customer service. People would become more like friends than actually customers and co workers.
good,"I was a cashier at Whole Foods and it is great. It truly is ringing all day, but you meet some wonderful people. The store is big with a lot of employees and it is a lot of fun! They also give great hours."
good,"I worked in the Deil dept, I opened the chefs case every morning starting around 5:00AM. I made sure all the right products in the case were presentable with toppings and looked amazing in the chef case before the store opened at 8:00AM. Once my day starts I begin to start slicing meat/chees to the people that come up and request for some. I hand out samples to people to get them to try new meats and cheeses as well."
good,In our ever changing world it is nice to see a company pursue a better way of providing products to people. I have been treated well as an employee and like the idea someone cares about the people producing the product.
good,"one of the best place to work. a lot of people would disregard the idea of working at a supermarket, but this place was different. the atmosphere was great and the people there we're also great"
good,"I had worked for Whole Foods for 13 years. I learned how interwoven the fair-trade culture is internationally, and locally. The management and staff of Whole Foods is the conduit of this culture between the corporation, and the customers."
good,"Whole Foods is a great place to work for anyone who cares about being healthy and happy within an apathetic society that increasingly cares only about the size of your bank account and your ability to work endless hours (to just barely get by). "
good,"WFM is a wonderful, positive and unique work environment. There is a great level of appreciation for team members and the open door policy they have is truly helpful and effective. Wages are good and opportunities to advance within the company are plentiful and made easy for you should you excel at your current job and show interest. This is a great place to build a career."
good,"This job was a whole lot of fun. I fell in love working at Whole Foods, the co-workers made the job more enjoyable and created a positive work environment. My memory had improved because there are a lot of codes involved, tares, customers names, employees names, remembering where items are in the store. The leadership program was really phenomenal at Whole Foods. It is encouraged to move up at Whole Foods and staff are eager to teach you and show you how to get there."
good,"A typical work day consisted of cashiering/recommending products to customers/restocking/taking out trash and recycling and organizing carts. Working at whole foods taught me how to engage customers in a kind and helpful way. The culture of the job is what i loved most, Everyone was always so nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job was working holiday hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be of service to people everyday."
good,"This company was hands down my favorite place to work. It is unfortunate that I had to leave due to serious family matters at the time but if I had been able to stay, I would have become management at Whole Foods."
good,Working at whole foods taught me a lot a out team work.  And how to properly slice meat.  It's a great company that cares for it's employees and I would love to be part of that team.
good,"checking customers out via point-of-sale system, resolving customers issues/ wants/ needs"
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work. The pay scale is excellent. Also, the health coverage plans offered are great. The team member discounts are also the best (up to 20-35%) and many more."

good,"Whole Foods is a great company that is very respectful and fair. You can advance as much as you want, all if takes is hard work and dedication. I really love this company."
good,I started whole foods on April 1st of 2016. I got hired right away after submitting my application. Amazing workplace to work for and the aassociates make you feel comfortable for the department you work in.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers regular customers made your day all the fun stories they would bring up.Coworkers are easy going.
good,"This isn't your normal grocery store. Here, you feel like you are actually part of a team. My tasks during a shift didn't really feel too much like work. It felt like the team was building to create a better place. Tasks vary from shift to shift, so it stays interesting. "
good,Most days your fellow team members are always a joy to work with and the environment is very community oriented. Customers ask all sorts of questions to some people who then have to ask other people for the answer but eventually everyone gets and answer. There is also a sort of power given to general team members to make decisions like giving products to customers as necessary for amazing customer service.
good,"Great place to be. Just kind of hard to get into. You have to be really chill or know somebody already in the business. Overall the customer base is fantastic, employees are hard working and relatable. Good pay and room for raises as well as promotions."
good,I loved my Job there. Whole foods is an amazing place.You get to help people and your community become healthy and gain many benefits as well.the most enjoyable part would be the people that I worked with they where amazing.
good,I can say that I have been in customer service since I started working at 19. Whole foods bring in different people and provide a clutter free environment that I believe doesn't upset the customer and their  shopping experience.I really enjoy working for this company.
good,Interacting with customers and staff you learn more each day about products and recipes.  Whole Foods makes sure that each team member is filled with knowledge about healthy eating and healthy food alternatives in order to pass that knowledge on to our customers.
good,"Seriously. As far as grocery store jobs go, this one is the best. Hands-off management, they really trust you to be accountable for your own job. Plenty of creativity allowed in problem-solving, no micro-management, and managers shift every month or so so you're never stuck with a bad boss. Good pay and benefits. They really work with you to make sure you're happy where you're at. Love it!!!"
good,"Super laid back and easy going, amazing people, good pay, good hours! I felt it encouraged a healthier lifestyle, and increased my knowledge of different products, and organic living"
good,"Wonderful place to work, people are great!  This privately held company does a lot for the local farmers and community.  Natural and organic products, locally sourced just makes good sense."
good,Working at the Whole Foods Market on a typical day has given been enjoyable and also a learning experience. I've learned how become a better communicator and also how to work great as a team member. The best part of the job is the team and the customers.
good,Working for Whole Foods Market is a great experience you get to work with all kinds of people. As your working your learning about a product and knowing where it comes from and etc. Working with other team members is a honor because you actually get to interact with them. By working with them you become family and help each other out if there's a problem. There isn't a hard part of the job because I know how to handle a situation and there isn't any issues working for the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and helping them to what they need and also making sure they leave out the supermarket happy so they can continue shopping at Whole Foods Market. The management is excellent if you need to talk to them about anything they are all ears.
good,I was a cashier for the mill valley whole foods and working here was a great experience for me because we are all very understanding of our emergencies. people are very friendly and working there is fun.

good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work at, if a person is passionate about well being. I saw my team members as family members."
good,"A typical day at work would, meeting a lot of friendly and familiar faces. There is always something to learn everyday. My management is great. They are very helpful. The hardest part of the job is standing on my feet for a number of hours, The people I work with make working very enjoyable. The Managers are great!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking part in the usual work protocol or procedures while integrating the feedback we get from customers, our supervisors, and team leaders to make the service in our store as excellent as possible."
good,This was one of the best retail jobs I've ever had. They are willing to train promote and guide others to achieve. They also care about their employees just as much as their customers. This type of commitment to your employees really makes them work ten times harder because they are well taken care of!!
good,Great place everyone helps each other managers keep everything organized in each individual departments  never a hectic day just lots of lunch rushes but the teams always kept a cool fun place to work
good,"Loved my job, but I wish I would've been able to grow within the company. The company is great, they care about you. I had a really great time working for Whole Foods Market."
good,"At Whole Foods, I felt I really learned a lot of management skills and was fortunate enough to do so with a great staff of managers and team members who always worked hard to create a great atmosphere for both employees and customers. Whole Foods also encourages all team members to learn new skills in order to cultivate advancement in their own careers and I definitely benefited from this."

good,"Great job. Customers can be a bit ""interesting"" at times, but overall an amazing job to have. Management is terrific and they promote such a wonderful work environment."
good,This job has been great for me while I finished grad school. I was able to work another part time job in addition to the one with Whole Foods and go to grad school full time. My bosses were flexible and understanding when I needed to change my work schedule for school related activities.

good,"Great place to work, fun, great management staff, ethical and they take good care of their employees. Great benefits, great opportunities, lots of fun."
good,This program only lasted about 3 weeks. In my three week stay I worked on a wide range of projects. I designed a small stamp about the size of a quarter to a 60 foot vinyl wrap that covered about half of the Whole Foods Market Campbell location. I was 1 of 4 Store Graphic Artist to be apart of the program out of 36 stores in our region. It was a huge honor t be apart of the regional team!
good,"Days were easy to manage time wise, not too stressful and everyone helped each other when needed.  I learned various recipes and how to cook a multitude of things.  I've also eaten various foods that I never even tried before.  The company also had various charity events and gave back 10% of sales to a community business or charity at least  once a month, and all employees got bonuses based on store sales every quarter.  All of the leadership were helpful and personable, and they knew everyone by name.  Overall a great place to work and to shop."

good,"Loved the benefits, bosses, and respected the company's  core values and aim.Got 3 raises and a new position as Production Manager, PM, in just one year. Was the happiest I'd ever been at any job my whole life and I'd love to work there again.  Hardest part of job was strenuous, physical work and doing all duties under certain time limit but this was pressure I enjoyed, due to the adrenaline and sense of accomplishment I got from it.  Most enjoyable part of job was making guests happy with either my service,ideas or recommendations.  Employee discount and massages during my breaks didn't hurt, either :)"
good,"The crew that I worked with on the front end was very fun and positive, upper level employees were always fair and easy to work with. Customers were definitely more particular and often high maintenance."
good,"I love working here at whole foods. I learn how to cut meat, Better customer service skills and go above and beyond for customers."
good,"Working at Whole Foods Market  has given me something special that I never had while working anywhere else, a team and a support system that I never thought a job could give. The store I work at in Brookline is the smallest Whole Foods, which gives it a humble homey feel that really delivers a sense of being a part of a team."
good,great company excelled with whole foods market but moved to arizona.
good,Whole Foods Market is one of the best companies to work for in the grocery retail industry. There are great chances to grow within the company.
good,"very nice place to work. flexible, independent, team work feeling, excellent management team"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Whole Foods very much, but a chance for promotion was not available."
good,"a typical day at work would be trying to finish the sandwiches before we start to get busy, then I have to make sure that all the tempters and dates are done, and to complete all the logs. what I learned is that if I ever have a problem with one of my team members I have to let the supper visor know. I try to have good communication with my team members. the hard part of my job is when a certain team member complains a lot. the most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer comes to me and says ""thank you for the sandwich it was so good"" it makes me feel like they appreciate my hard work."
good,"Typical day: Providing services on the Chef's case (Cold items produced by kitchen staff and sold by counter staff) and Deli (Applegate and Wellshire items along with a great deal of in house items) More experienced members bounce back and forth between deli, CC, pizza and burger as needed. Kitchen staff will assist on the CC and other stations in a pinch. "
good,stocking the shelves and greeting customers with assistance. Showing great customer service all day and finish the day up with the presentation of the store
good,"WFM is big brand to work for. Presence in Big international cities, with a brand name, give you opportunity to excel. "
good,It is a great culture to work in. It is an extremely positive environment and your co-workers become like  family.
good,its a fun and family orientated place to work. benefits are great and you have awesome co workers.
good,Whole Foods was a very good company to work for. They offered many benefits and gain sharing. Moving up seemed very plausible in regards to the positions you were attempting to achieve. The management was pretty stable.
good,"Whole Foods is all about conscious leadership. Their belief is that people leave managers, not organizations. Leaders for the most part worked alongside team members. Their belief in local and missions and partnership was upheld in every aspect. Behind closed doors this carried through as well. It is not a company where we only talked about our ideals and goals, we strived to meet them and brainstormed ideas. If I were to describe Whole Foods in one word it would be Integrity. "
good,Very great compnay to work for. The benefits are great and the people are amazing as well. Customer oriented environment. Workign here has taught me to work and deal with people from all walks of life. It is not your typical retail supermarket.
good,"opening/closing registers. "
good,"Great placement with rapid advancement as well as pay above other grocers."
good,"Whole Foods has a great learning environment that translates across career paths. They provide education, benefits and advancement opportunities which are sorely lacking within the rest of the industry. Their network is large enough that it allows for mobility and mentorship throughout the company."
good,"The entire company is built around sustainability. Having a CEO that will pull a great product that brings in millions of dollars in sales because of how it is farmed, raised, or endangered is unheard of. The ethicality of the company is proven time and time again. They do this responsibly also. For example they do not just stop carrying a product because of the issue. If they plan on doing it, its initiated at least two years out so they do not damage the families lives after loosing such a great retailer. The employees are true subject matter experts and offer customer service beyond the competitor. Also, employees are empowered to have a voice and you can excel at your own pace with the support of your superiors."
good,It's a great job for anyone looking for a lower-end entry job. Great pay for the work and you get to socialize with lots of awesome people.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at Whole Foods. It is unlike any grocery store. Not only does it put the customers first but also team members needs in consideration. We had Team Member Appreciation Day, company picnics, Christmas party, and team builds. As a cashier I was able to develop a friendship with several regular customers. A few customers I communicate with over the phone. Working at Whole Foods taught me a lot about eating right. Every time I buy a product I always look at the ingredients to make sure they were natural ingredients. Whole Foods has so many events for customers and their children, such as a pumpkin patch. I also love that they give back to the community through 5% Days and hosting events in the store. One thing I love about leadership is that you can move up in the company without basing it on seniority. A person who gives 110% on the job can become a supervisor one month after being hired and a team leader within a year. It was a wonderful experience being employed with this company."
good,"1-a typical day would me be working the register all day"
good,"-hard work,depending on your sales always a steady pace"
good,"I was a buyer for Whole Foods Market for the vitamin Dept, Loved my job, unfortunatly my position was combined with another one so mine eliminated. Very nice to work with and would do so againif the right position opened up again"
good,"Whole Foods was an exceptional pace to work at. They treated their staff very well, and were very flexible. Management always gave direction and were very clear of their expectations. Because of that it made the whole teams unity effortless. There was really only one pitfall during my time at Whole Foods, and that was not having any sort of replacements for team members that called off making it a little more hectic for the rest. Overall, a wonderful place."
good,"Typical day at work is to come in fresh for one of the daytime rushes- breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Process transactions, take a break, process more transactions and just when you think you can't take anymore, it's time for lunch! I learned here to take it easy, everything does not have to be spastic even if it is not good. I also learned a great deal about food- types, nutritional value, organics, GMO's, celiac's disease, and more. Management was very understanding and very available as well as very willing to work with team members and the co-workers I had were some of the best I have ever had. They were always positive and always there for me and willing to help. That was my favorite part of the job, the culture, the team members were always really and sincerely there to help, and the food was great too."
good,There is a great sense of being part of a team at Whole Foods as well as plenty of independance. Most promotions are from within so there is plenty of room for growth and learning.

good,"I like working at whole foods market,also a great company to work for , my manager is excellent at what she do she very corresponding and understanding."
good,No two days are alike. It's very enriching to get to know so many products and the actual health benefits that you can miss out on just by eating other bad stuff. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that each day your making a difference is someones life.
good,"Whole Foods Market gives you a learning experience with food and because they have such passion for their products, you learn about what you eat. This company changes your life by eating healthy. Team members are encouraged by customers and Team Leaders."
good,"Whole Foods Market was a great place to work for because you were constantly learning. You learned every aspect of every department especially if you worked for the store that had the highest in sales. Everyone is nice, helpful and sincere but you cannot be a slacker because that really looks bad on the department. Eveyone worked took ownership of that department like it was their own business. The management style really depends on the Store Leadership so if you had someone with experience it really shows all around the store. The hardest part of the job is rotating hours, but that is retail. The most enjoyable part of the job is when your constantly busy because not because the hours go fast but you feel like you have a purpose."
good,The only reason I left this wonderful position was for purely personal reasons - not because I didn't want to continue working for
good,WFM is a wonderful environment for individuals who entertain a healthy lifestyle and care about their surrounding society. WFM encourages their employees to express their individuality and food preferences to clientele.
good,"working for whole food was life changing. i now eat healthly, and enjoy doing it.. whole foods as a whole was wonderful, ill definately work there again. the staffing and managers are the best."
good,"I loved working at Whole Foods a lot of benefits , the most enjoyable part was creating a relationship with the different customers that came in. It was a fun experience for me"

good,"Management was incredible. Coworkers were extremely friendly and good coworkers. Amazing staff. The benefits were incredible. Team leaders were highly motivational, inspiring and informative."
good,I worked for Whole Foods prior to Amazon so I do not know if this is still true.  But the people there were very friendly and the pay was great.  The supervisors were more than willing to work with the employees.  And it was a fun job.  They will put you to work if there are no customers but the time goes by fast.
good,Great company to work for. Gave me days off when I needed them and let me take vacations whenever I wanted. I enjoyed working there. The management and employees are great
good,"beautiful, love all the years I spent there, and serving the guest, the benefits were great. my plans for the future is to return. I also enjoyed, serving the food, ( organic and conventional )."
good,Everyone was equal. I love working in the Cambridge area there was a friendly people not so friendly people everyone had a smile everyone great people and everyone was treated like a family.

They feed their team members and give appreciation days.  During inventory they let you fear and every 9 months you get 20-50 cent raise. And it’s awesome. They want everyone to move up. Literally everyone has a chance to succeed in this place. Ima miss you wholefoods you were the best"

Even if it stopped them from doing what they were supposed to be doing. They made sure we had the item, if not a employee barcode to scan provided by amazon. We had to scan the whole foods employees barcode with our iPhone ( provided by Amazon). Overall, it was a great experience I would highly recommend it.

Whole Foods gets a lot of scrutiny in the media but from someone who works for the company I can say that Whole Foods cares a lot about issues that are going on all around the world.

good,"I learned how to work with many different personalities and work style of my teammates. Also many days I would close my section of the store with little to no help, which helped me with thriving by my self. The Bakery department leadership treated me very well and helped me with any issues I had. The workplace was relaxed and friendly.

Later, I joined the team as a product specialist and buyer, where I had a number of opportunities to compete with professionals holding my same position in other regions.

good,In my time at Whole Foods I was appreciated and had a handful of support from Management and Team Members with advancement. There is a bit of favoritism but if you keep your head down and just work hard most management will see that over any drama going on around you. The benefits are amazing and most people they hire are hard workers so you normally don't pick up the slack of others.
good,The commitment to quality is the cornerstone of the Whole Foods culture. I am proud to be a part of this company. We are looking forward to great things in the future.

good,"Whole Foods Market was by far my favorite company to work for. It was productive, fast paced, fun, and had excellent benefits that included healthcare, vision, dental, 401K, stock, and others. Had I not had to relocate for family, I would have proudly stayed working for the company. With fair and flexible hours I was able to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. With decent pay for my area, I was able to stay on top of my finances and save for my move. Whole Foods Market has wholesome core values and offers so many opportunities. If anyone is wondering if WFM is a great company to work for, I'm here to tell you that they are."

good,"Great team, managers supportive, friendly customers 99% of the time, great pay, room for growth, healthy food options, respect for workers and staff..."
good,"Whole Foods felt like a second home after only a week or two of working with them.  Everyone I worked with (with the exception of one manager) was amazing.  It was a fast paced work environment, but there was almost always someone there to help when you needed it.  One of the best companies I've ever worked for."
good,"It was a good job, got along with my coworkers.  It can get mildly passive-aggressive as everyone's on the ""positive energy"" kick, but so long as you mind your own business, follow the basic rules, get the job done and don't go out of your way/try too hard...you'll be fine.  "
good,The family I created at Whole Foods was forever. The education I gained from just working as a cashier was incredible. I learned so much about health and food intelligence. There was a constant feel for moving forward and committing to self success as an employee.
good,It’s a great place to work. So much to learn everyday in customer service. Easy and fun to work with co-workers and managers. Fun customer interaction.

good,"Working for WFM has been an amazing experience."
good,"Whole Foods is one of the best company I have ever worked for. The culture, and what they values is beyond my expectation. They treat their employers with care."

Customers teach and education myself on recipes, and even on products."
good,"great team members"

good,"Pretty solid job, worked there for 4 months, good pay, long hours, was given different tasks which is good because i like to do different things over a long period of time."

Team leaders actually cared about employees, and team members have respect for one another, at least at the store I️ was at. It was always fun.

They help out when the cashiers need it, and help to keep the store clean and neat. Everyone works together as a team to get things done, and we all get along. I would recommend this job to anyone!"

If you ever have the chance I would recommend working of them just to experience the culture of food and wellness that makes your job seem so less job like. The best part of Whole Foods is also what has made it really hard to work for other companies is they don't have managers, they have Leaders. It is a huge difference to work with someone who is Leading you and your team to success verses someone who Manages to make sure everyone is doing their job. "

Im very new to the company since it's my first month there. There is no stress from management so far at all.  I am a part of a team and we are like family.  I get really great hours and almost never work an entire weekend.  I usually only get scheduled for one weekend day a week.  I have open availability and encourage more hours.  I am paid a really great starting wage at $11.50 an hour and it's so much higher than the $8-9 an hour I got from other stores. Overall I know that I will go far with this company and it will be an amazing experience.   They have really great communication as they have a great work place website they use for messages to team members, requesting time off and seeing schedules and pay stubs.  Overall best job I've had and the best food I've ever eaten.  Whole foods encourages their customers and team members alike to try the food and products and actually give free samples and let customers take things home to try for free! That's amazing and I've never seen that happen before! I would refer this job to anyone looking for a great job with great people in a friendly setting!"

Whole Foods valued their customers and made sure they were satisfied. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy on holidays.

They take great pride in their products and the health aspect of many of their products such as gluten free, dairy free, sugar free, vegan products. They have a tremendous assortment of bakery products.  They have pastry chefs, cake decorators that do a tremendous job and are very skilled and hard working individuals.  They always amazed me with their beautiful treats.  During the holidays the cakes, pastries, cookies, brownies always reflected what holiday it was.  They are known for their Chantilly cakes which are incredibly delicious. You do stand on your feet, bending, lifting.  It has periods of being extremely busy with hardly enough time for a break but then it balances out.  I took great joy in meeting many wonderful people and helping them make decisions on what to buy for a special occasion.  If they wanted things written on cakes I would let them pick out the color icing, and took great pride in making it look nice.  If they wanted me to draw little hearts on it, I did.  Generally a nice place to work."
good,"We don't accept any tips  we have 30 minutes of break is a great place to work "

Some more than others, but I never let myself get to overwhelmed.

While on the register you will meet all kinds of new people and learn about new foods, places, religions, local events, local vendors and lots more all while working. The workplace is a very happy and positive environment where everyone is willing to help and learn from each other at the same time. While working I was introduced to a much healthier lifestyle and a better way of eating. The hardest part of the job was memorizing all of the codes for the vegetables, fruits, snacks, breakfast,lunch,dinner,coffee etc but being that everything was so repetitive made it very easy.

The store was divided up into teams (representing different parts of the store i.e. meat, produce, dairy, prepared foods etc.) and everyone was proud and excited about their team. There was this silent and healthy competitiveness between the teams that just kept so much vibrancy in the store. Everyone was so informative and kept up with health and food trends; everyone was just happy to be there. Whole Foods has this natural flowing allure about them that just make people addicted to their culture. The hardest park of working here was simply retail hours and your occasional upset customer-wasn't anything free food from management didn't fix.

They ask about the different ingredients in the products and where it comes from. Some of the items are weighed and priced. I learned about different products I didn't know about and how to weigh the items when the customers ask for them. Management was okay they worked with you whenever there was an issue that any employer had. However , you have to be careful and read the rule book because some managers don't follow the rules in the book. My co-workers were very friendly they train you if you did not know how to do something like how to weigh an item correctly. There was no hard part working in Whole Foods Market just watch, listen, and learn and once I got the hang of it I was fine.

good,"Whole Foods Market has always been one of my favorite companies.  Their values and the things they do are unlike any of their competitors.  I've never worked in an environment that cares so much about everyone.  Including their Team Members.  They offer incredible benefits for part-time and full-time employees, the leadership and management are very involved and have all worked their way up, and they offer a generous discount on all products in all stores nation wide for all employees.  Their entry-level pay is higher than any other company like them, too.  Which can be a life-saver for anyone with little job experience.  The only thing I can say that is a negative about Whole Foods Market is their incredibly strict attendance policy.  It is the number one reason people lose their jobs there.  It's regrettably how I lost my job.  And the attendance policy goes for EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter what tier level of command you are in. If you don't adhere to their policy, you will be separated.  No ifs, ands, or buts.  They don't let on how strict this policy is in the beginning so if you plan to work here, please take note that you cannot be late or absent unless otherwise approved by your team leaders (doctor visits and funerals included).  Otherwise you will lose your job no matter how long you've been there or how much you've contributed."
good,"Whole Foods Market is a great place to work. The company is operated by Teams. A Store Team Leader oversees the activities of his/her assigned store. Each department has a team leader assigned to oversee that department team. The Equipment Maintenance Technician, my position, reports directly to the Store Team Leader."

It goes to the TM's, (Who all start at $3 above minimum wage regardless of experience), It goes into the stores (Which are all gorgeous), It goes into the product (Organic distributors are more expensive than you would think), And it goes into the community. People that work there are awesome. People that shop there can definitely be overly arrogant, But a vast majority are just a bunch of healthy and overall positive people.

good,"my job included helping serve customers. providing cashiers with what they needed to serve customer. i met different kinds of customers. some were extremely nice but some were also extremely rude. i learned that by dint of hard work, you could rise through the ranks to occupy a reputable position. my co-workers were always there to assist me whenever i needed assistance. no regrets ever working at wholefoods."
good,"One after one, opportunity strikes to provide for a customer. I make my day go by attempting to provide for each one of them to the best of my ability. While also maintaining the morale of the comrades at my sides. Both are important to a healthy work environment and neither goal overtakes the other. As for the thing that makes me the happiest, it is making it through a day. Which sounds small, but in the end, there is an importance to the smiles on peoples faces. Especially those of my comrades. For they are the cogs that make every engine run smoothly. Where as, aggravation inevitably sets in from the many moods that string from those I work with, as per standard when dealing with multiple people with multiple ideas on how to achieve a goal with no organized idea. Most days things run smoothly but things always happen to become in the way. I have learned that the best way to move through any situation is to be fluid. There is nothing that can be gained by constantly fighting those around you. The line of command is in place to lessen the burden of such tribulations. They excel at their jobs."
good,"Very busy and lots of work to stay busy, Learned how to work speciality equipment, and help in the venues. Co-workers were all team players and provided assistance when needed they walked the walk and talked the talk. My job was always enjoyable and easy to do. Helping customer was my most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Whole Foods Market employs creative, committed employees. I enjoy the guest service experience. The hardest part of the job is deciding which bakery item I love best."
good,"I worked in the meat department. I worked with customers, mostly regulars that i would see. Before too long i new people by name basis. I learned how to cut meat and how to cook certain meats. It was really interesting at times the way some of the meat cutters would prep the meats. The team i worked with was awesome and probably some of the best workers ive worked with. Very dedicated to their job. Hardest part of the day was when we got a really random rush of people and there was only one or two of us to take care of. But usually we would get help from other departments if we needed. It was all about teamwork and we really helped each other out."
good,"This company is beyond what I ever expected it could be. With great people and great benefits, it really is an ideal place to work. There is so much to learn here, and the opportunities to grow are limitless. I am very thankful to have been able to spend the past 5 years of my life here. "
good,"Looking at it, I see that for things to really run smoothly you have to work with no ego involved. Everyone on the team has to be able to fill the gaps when necessary, it's a shared responsibility. You also have to take it upon yourself to be well educated, customers don't respond well if you're not speaking to them confidently, you won't close a sale that way, and being well educated is a key component in being confident in my opinion. There has to be some level of commitment to being better, and showing your team that they can be better too. You also can't be afraid to stay late, and I also find that it's always best to admit your mistakes and find a way to say ""yes"" and turn that into an opportunity."
good,"great vibe and good team leaders, very busy, lots of learning chances! very aware of food or organic food by customers. lots of chances to teach people about food and the care of their food lives."
