rating,review
bad,They definitely do not care about you as an employee. You are a no one. 12 hour days arent good enough. Place is awful. Bunch of idiots. The worst company you could ever work for.
bad,One specific manager has run countless employees off. One specific admin is awful to the rest of the administrative team. Easy job but lack organization and leadership
bad,Management takes advantage and if you come in late he don't communicate and tries to get you to quit so he don't have to pay you hours then deducted from gift cards for work boots
bad,They treat you like a dog an watch you like a convict sorry bosses that's why I wouldn't recommend a person to work these idiots that think their God an they try to fire people for no reason to make them look good fat an lazy people in the management got their by sucking A mostly Yankees that need to get out of our state Go Home you dont deserve to be here
bad,Not enough time to learn your route. Management treated you like dirt. Woked 18 hour days. Even had a manager try to fight me physically. Couldn't get things on the truck fixed. Just ungrateful management. You couldn't pay me enough to ever go back to that place.
bad,Drivers are told to report all incidents to dispatch when they do their fired the next work day their is no 3 day suspension as stated in their policy. Terrible place to work your just a number. And your replaceable. They dont care about you as a person only whats best for the company. Management doesn't care about you or the trucks and want division between drivers and mechanics they never fix the trucks hints the house hitting incident that took place in cleveland tn in Sept 2019 . Then blame the drivers for the faulty equipment. A joke company I hope they go out of business.
bad,"Management was rude, male shovanist and out right terrible!! I don’t recommend anyone working at the site in Lubbock TX. Never again will i work for this company!!"
bad,I liked it in the begin but. The equipment is not good the boss sucked  I the place sucked if there was a new supervisor then mabey it would get better
bad,Treat they’re employees horrible don’t care about your health at all I was the passenger in the truck and we were involved in a accident and I was terminated and wasn’t even the one driving
bad,"Waste connections in Clearwater is a horrible place to work at. It’s a very stressful job with low pay & a lot is expected of you. The new supervisor doesn’t care about the employees at all. The one that left to Tampa cared a lot more & wasn’t as selfish. You won’t have a life , your body will break down & if god forbid you get injured they’ll give you the boot. It’s modern day slavery . Save yourself trust me"
bad,"Fire all of the old timers, get reliable professionals."
bad,Horrible place to work. I wouldn’t even have my worst enemy work there.  Boss is horrible and when you talk to upper management and things in the work place not being right they brush if off like it’s not big deal. All the managers get bonuses and all the sales and customer service people get nothing.
bad,"On the surface they look like a good company.  I come with the better part of 10 years Class A driving experience, no accidents. But they insist on keeping me as a laborer saying there was no openings, yet they would hire new drivers and hold a career fair for more. The trucks are belong in the garbage they deliver as most of them are unsafe and wouldn't pass a DOT inspection - they actually ask you to avoid DOT because they know the trucks are unsafe and falling apart."
bad,They like to overcharge their customers and then not refund the money.  Had to leave because I could not live with my self.   They are crocks and should be put in jail.
bad,"Pay is unfair to hours worked, long illegal work hour days, no OT pay, mgmt. is beyond unorganized and plays favorites. trucks always broken down. Will let you go over anything and call it misconduct. Better off working at Mcdonalds."
bad,"Took 2 weeks to come in for an interview after multiple attempts for a callback from local branch. I was under the impression pay was $17 a hour + overtime to drive the truck but after a 45 minute interview the very last minute they tell you you will be a helper hanging off the back of a rear loader manually throwing trash for 3-9 years before being promoted only making roughly $11 per hour with no overtime pay working 50-55 hours per week or per diem $125 per day basically grossing $600 per week for a very labor intensive job. I applied for a driver position but they tell you everybody starts from the bottom. I have no issues with the company but wish they were more straight forward in there hiring ads explaining pay and you will be a rear loader helper. So I am under the impression going in I'll be making roughly $1000 a week to drive a truck not getting nasty with my cdl working 55 hours per week but instead its $600 gross per week getting nasty hanging off the back of a truck to manual labor. Just be honest, that's all I'm saying. Dont bait us and switch us at the end, that is unfair"
bad,They say that they take care of there employee they dont i have work for 2 of there companies both the same they dont care about employees only that the trash gets dumped i have a screw in my finger thanks to this company and the company scared me from filing lni if i was u i would stay away from them
bad,Trucks always broke down. VERY long hours. Inconsistent work schedule. Pay is not fair. Supervisors are constantly quitting. Routes are unevenly matched.
bad,"if you have disability you don't get nay opportunity"
bad,Typical day is driving 8 hours.  sitting in traffic.  workplace culture was great driving a truck.  However Lemay sold out to Waste Connections and waste connections is a large company.  No longer a family owned business so the culture changed from a caring company to a corporate disaster
bad,Enough money for that. The management over there is messed up at everything else is cool. If I had another chance to work there probably I will accept it.
bad,Working for Waste Connections was not the easiest place. The office manager instills work drama and pits employees against each other. It was stressful working there not knowing if you would get a secret shopper call or not. While I worked there every time we had an office staff meeting we heard nothing but negative.
bad,No life. Low pay. Horrible people and atmosphere.  Have to work all holidays and mandatory OT every single day. No room for andvancment and employees talk trash about each other all day everyday.
bad,"unfair employment, I will never apply there again"
bad,"Companies Like Waste Connections are not paying enough for your Class 3 license since there are fewer people getting them and trend is to continue into the future."
bad,"This is a cutthroat company. Claims to have an environment of accountability but this only applies to people they want to hold accountable. No pay increases given and if asked you will be labeled as not being a future benefit to the a company. This company expects you to work 50,60 or 70 hours a week with little to no appreciation for what you do and the time you miss with your family. Management only cares about what they can get from you and the bottom line for the company. You will only be as good as they feel you are that day, tomorrow you will be like the garbage they pick up ""disposable""."
bad,If you want experience in multi-tasking and no training this is the place for you. Turn over is the first red flag and lack of training is the second. We live and learn but look at all the reviews before you get yourself in this type of work environment.
bad,"A very messed up place to work for you don't know what is going on to last minute ,one supervisor might tell you this then the next supervisor might tell you this if you don't do it right you're wrong even though both the supervisors don't know what's going on you will be accountable for what happened it seems like the company is biased by racial issues you see a lot of Spanish people doing low jobs working hard but you see upper management which is Caucasian with the easy jobs. Needs better race relations and better management if you just need a job work until you can find something better not a place to retire from.some"
bad,my husband has been in this feild for over 12 years- with this company 9 years and sadly they do NOT get paid like they should for all the hard dirty work they do-
bad,"We worked from 5am until 5 pm every day.It was ridiculous.I would pick up 1000 homes a day meanwhile another driver a mile away from me was picking up only 100 stops.It was total mismanagement,apathy,and ignorance at the management level.When I started the company was IESI and it was great.I clocked in at 3:30 am sometimes when it was summer to beat the heat and they allowed it.Waste Connections runs on a fascist system where each manager at each location follows a corporate model but tries to make it appear like they are one of your brothers.If you get hurt on the job,no matter how good you are,no matter how long you have worked there,they will find a reason to get rid of you.If you get hurt,get an attorney before signing or saying anything to them.I also witnessed in my time rookies getting hired on for more than I was making after 9 years in the place.It is the shadiest company I have ever worked for and I recommend staying away from them and not doing business with them.They may say they care about safety,but it is only short term to protect their bottom line.Long term you get stressed out,overheated,and exposed to the sun and bacteria longer because of their working hour policy.If you work there, contact a union and get a better situation for yourself."
bad,"If you apply for this company please note a few things:"
bad,"In waste connections the first value is safety, however there have been more than a few times drivers are held to it until management needs stuff done"
bad,"I was hired on at this place last summer for about a week as a temp. The position was supposed to be permanent but they canned me, one of the department supervisors (a woman who I only saw when she came to collect another supervisor for one of their ""regular"" smoke breaks throughout the day. The whole place was a mess. They expected us to lie to customers about why trash wasn't collected or why their service hadn't started at their new residence. Just a terrible place to work. Management needs a complete overhaul. Everybody needs to be fired and then start over."
bad,The only promblem with this company if the GM does like you.  you will be back baled with the company and they will not give you a good referal........
bad,"Lets start off by, you do three jobs for one salary.  One is being a driver.  Two, is manual very hard labor.  Three, is customer service.  And let me tell you, customers are very demanding. Who would think, its only garbage.  Not only is it customer service, its all about exceeding customers expectations.  Trucks are older than dinosaurs.  Not everyone is treated the same.  They expect you to do pre trip inspection with out pay.   Contradicting rules... and theres more... but I'm tired of wriring."
bad,"Not a safe place to work, they don't fix trucks. Set you up for failure and blame you for everything. They talk to much about safety but there's nothing safe there. I wouldn't recommend working there. Management always is right even if you have proof that they are wrong. An employee is never right."
bad,"Not a good company to work for,  they don't promote from within but they will tell you during the interview that they do. It's a lie!!!!  Equipment/trucks break down all the time. Management is the worst most and most unprofessional place ever worked for."
bad,"This place is as nasty as the trash they pick up. Management is racist & sexist. They treat you like trash & have unexpected goals. They claim people just don't want to work, but the truth is they are hard to work for. The pay is horrible, you can make more working for 10 bucks a hour 80 hours a week. The equipment is horrible & breaks down daily. You have to suck butt to keep your job. Do not work for these people you will regret it."
bad,"not a good place to work. got screwed around, told not to come back. they tell everyone I quit when I did not. very unsafe equipment"
bad,"A driver is under paid and gets treated like a pup. "
bad,"They have terrible management! Look under MONROE God Bless the USA, Inc. (GBUSA) on BBB, they have a F rating. They do not care anything about customers needs nor their employees .  All the management is interested in is the Transfer Station that is being built. BEWARE!"
bad,I worked there for 3 months management had there favorites. Also I did a two man job for one mans pay. All they care about is partying at college football games. Management had no experience and was hired because they were drinking buddies with the district manager.
bad,"typical day was working on the junk trucks and dealing with the maintance managers constant harassment.  I learned that my manager would rather you put junk parts on trucks and have to hurry and get them on the road than fix them correctly.  Management all sucks and all cover for each other aRses. there was nothing enjoyable about this job, worst disorganized, mismanaged place I've ever been. very low pay and benefits were horrible. LILY KY LOCATION NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN AND ALL THEIR BUTTS SENT HOME......"
bad,They charge more then any landfill in the valley. But say they are not making any thing when it comes to raises. But then buy new trucks that sit for months. Because they really do ot need new trucks. I do not belive they will be around for much longer.
bad,"I’m 44 yrs old and never have I felt this much negativity from a work environment."
bad,Don’t try for advancement anything other than front line work is high turnover!    Impossible expectations and no other considerations other than bottom line for shareholders!
bad,"Do as I say, not as I do....will threaten your job, but do what they threatened to fire you about. It's a good old boys club and if your the pick you will do well and make good money...if your not in then you will soon be out. Management sucks!"
bad,If you value your knees and time with your loved ones this isnt the place for you.i used to work here and the reason i left is because this place im tired of breaking DOT policy theyre trucks are messed up meaning gauges dont work you never know how fast your going no A/C you literally feel like ur melting do not recommend to anyone
bad,This job is certainly not for everyone. But the El Dorado location has to be the worst. You wont get the weekends off so chances are your 3 day weekends start on Tuesday and end on Thursday. You WILL NOT move within this company. Period. Maybe horizontally but not vertically. Management at el Dorado is the absolute worst. They dont appreciate you and ignore your ideas.
bad,"Drivers fall asleep while driving with helpers on the back of truck, management is very Sh__ty, and have constant attitudes, I would not recommend this job to any one unless they need a job badly."
bad,"This company preaches ""Work Hard Play Harder"" and they are very proud of the culture. Unfortunately, since the Progressive merger the culture is gone and the ""Play Harder"" has turned into ""work hard work harder"" "
bad,Was not given enough supervisor on the job training. I just wished I was given better opportunity to be a great leader with company and assistant division manager  was not fair
bad,I have been  employed with (Waste Connections) for 13 months. I have not received any raises or bonuses. I work hard and do my job very well. I have been bringing all of my routes in earlier then scheduled each day.I feel like my hard work has gone unnoticed and unappreciated. Now I have  decided to take my hard working skills to a company with better pay and advancement. .
bad,Employee turnover is high.  Management and workplace culture needs to be improved and show cavalier attitude about its employees...if the job gets done that is it.
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. There is so much pressure to be perfect here. No mistakes are allowed. The stress is unbelievable. You have to do so many steps for what should be the simplest task. Office manager plays favorites. There are cliques. It's unwelcoming. The pressure is intense.  They don't care what the CSR's think, they just add more and more stress to their jobs.  Everything is their fault.  The computer system is slow and inadequate.  Most of the customers are rude.  You get reprimanded for being 1 minute late and other minor infractions. It was a hostile work environment.. One of the CSR's was incredibly rude to co-workers & customers alike & he got away with it.  Stay away from this company."
bad,Poor Supervisors  they have no idea what is going on in the shop when i got hired i was told i could make the shop mine and set up how i would like. Which did not happen tons of promises they did not come through with i was supposed to receive a relocation package the 2 week of employment it took a month and a half to receive when i did get it they taxed it 25% percent.
bad,"this job was the worse i've ever had, longest hours i've ever worked and only way to make good pay is if you truck breaks down daily. and trust me mine did, but once they got truck running half way decent and i was able to do route kinda like it was supposed to be then pay drop from 900 to 600 a week. and only one boss seamed like they cared other was a tyrant that was always looking for things to fire you for. mechanics half azz did there jobs, and like i said equipment was wore completely out. do not fall for there promise of making 65k to 70k training is only 17.50 and they did pay you for yards but now only a hour. the dispatchers wanted to be boss so bad there was a identity crisis.STRESSFUL is bottom line..."
bad,This is hands down the worst company I have ever worked for.. They have no clue how to deal with oil waste from drill rigs at all.. I was a operation supervision and was told several times we are trying to figure out how to do this.. They bring in very young site mangers that have NO clue how outside operations work.. I am very surprised that no one has been hurt or seriously injured in this working environment.. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE..
bad,"Management is a joke. They want a fun environment  by telling ""your face"" jokes but only certain people can play along. They say you will get an increase after 90 days but you have to keep reminding them about it. They want you to drive all over town and they promise to pay for mileage but you have to keep reming them about that too. They want someone who will eat, breath and bleed WCI. Be a brown noser and you will go far because if you actually have ideas and share them (which they say they welcome) you will not get a pat on the back."
bad,A call center with very high turn over.   Constantly recruiting and replacing status.    Low wage and poor hours. Grind the workers and replace.
bad,"Don't even think about these ppl are not for their employees. A typical day is getting 100-200 calls abt the driver not picking up the trash or the recyclables. Management is the worst team I've ever experienced. They never see your right only your wrong. And fire employees with no particular reason stating ""failed the introductory period"""
bad,"The pay is decent, however, it is a lot of manual entry. In fact, I have never seen a company so...how do we say...corporated on breaking your hands and your back. The atmosphere is sick. If you aren't a drama queen...you don't fit in. Then if you are nice to the customer you get dogged on. They think you should be mean unless your getting a payment or getting some new service in. Management...I wont even go there..end of story."
bad,I work for waste connections 5 years and enjoyed the first two year then after that it went all down hill. If you are not good friends with the boss and didn't do activities with her after work then you were treated terrible. You would be picked on on a daily basis. The boss would allow her friends to take up to a hr up to two hr breaks and lunches and would be fine with that while trucks would be waiting to get loaded. The boss would put on a big show though when the bigger bosses would show up. An employee could do the same exact things in the yard as her friends would do but you would be the one who gets reprimanded if you were not her close friend even if you went above and beyond.  Hopefully someday corporate will see this. Facts are facts.
bad,Wasn't a bad place to work for at first. The benefits sucked they don't give you the bonuses or raises they promise you. When I asked about my retirement the Site manager laughed at me and said it was a joke. And told me to just save my money. When I had a problem with the way the lead driver was treating me she said honestly I'm not gonna do anything about it. All the trucks are broke down constantly. If you write your truck up for repairs the mechanic will red tag your truck the next day and you will be stuck in the back up truck which should be thrown to scrap. The mechanics have until 6 pm to fix your truck but instead decide to go home early and red tag your truck the next day. Then don't even think about speaking your mind about it or you will be fired. Also don't mention the union that that every other solid waste driver is part of or they will eliminate your position just to fill it a month later. Also you only get three paid holidays off and have to make them up on Saturdays. The three sick days your given are usually gone with the first round of sickness cause nobody can afford to take the day off when they get sick. It's the lowest paid solid waste driver in all of America. And one of the few that are not union.  The lead driver will escape work like the plague even if it means everyone suffer. Favoritism is a large part of the way things are ran.  And be carefully of any holiday as there is about 7 jahova witnesses that work there and the only thing about the holidays they want is the tips from customers. 
bad,It's nice to work for a company that goes  against everything you were promised. Was on board to work 12hr shifts and never happened more like 14/16 hrs the lead tech is no help when need it. To management you have no value and when you you put your notice in you flat out a piece of s*** when walk the door. Tampa has none will not has respect for there night techs treated like slave till you quit
bad,"Starts with inspection of equipment, all is old and abused by operators, putting out fires all the time do not take care of equipment. Do not care about employees at all."
bad,"Stable job environment, young management who has very little common sense or trust for experienced drivers, pay is merely adequate nothing to get excited about."
bad,"Do not be a driver helper!!!!, drivers won't get out the truck to help ,won't take breaks or lunch.There getting paid big bucks to sit in the truck , while you slave your self for little pay ,not all the drives do this ,but most..."
bad,"If u like working for the Prison Chain Gang here u go !"
bad,Over worked and under paid unless you were in the sales dept.at one point was working over 60 hours a week and got nothing for it except screwed. Would suggest to stay away.
bad,"This company pays about $2/hour LESS than the average competitive local hourly wage for customer service representatives. In addition, at this location, be prepared to work on your own 1-3 days every week as your counter part will be calling in sick at least that much every week. Training is disorganized and rushed. You will be thrown out on your own with no help answering calls since the other rep is sick. Although you are new and bust your butt, management will have NO positive remarks or feedback to provide, even if you ACE their quality standards. They are also not interested in enforcing fair policy for all employees, instead allowing seasoned employees to miss as much work as they wish, come in late consistently, and treat less-liked employees poorly, even though it is completely unprofessional. A LOT of gossiping and bullying is easy to notice among office staff. Your counter parts are excused completely in treating new employees rudely in speech and behavior, given carte blanche in being aggressively territorial and throwing their weight around. They are free to dishonestly present the new employee in a negative way to management, and management will believe them without actually investigating. In addition, micromanaging at this location goes BEYOND your usual definition of micromanaging. You will be given 60 minute talks over something you were told to tell customers by veteran employees, which is ridiculous. You can get 100's on call reviews and that is completely disregarded and instead, management will find a way to tear that down as well. There is no praise, positive"
bad,District manager and district maintenance manager only care about themselves.  They will take money from your budget to cover their mistakes.They are shady as can be. . Operations manager is lazy as every always wanting to put his job off on other people. Truly the worst place I have ever worked due to the buddy buddy stuff with the DM and DMM.
bad,Be prepared to work for a company where you are always told what a bad worker you are. If you go out of your way to do a good jo it goes unnoticed. Favoritism is another thing. If you're not on their favorite list of people you'll get screwed every time. everyone talks bad about each other and definitely not a team work environment
bad,"They promise a sign-on bonus but it gets paid in small portions. Management is horrible, very moody, cursed at employees often. Pay is very low. They messed up the insurance so my dependants were dropped."
bad,This is the most ridiculous place. Filled with adult children with identity insecurities and obvious emotional issues. Completely unprofessional.  If you work here watch you back. Has the attitude of prison a prison culture.  Work here at your own risk.
bad,"They will push you to finish quick but work slow and safe no life outside of working there to many hours not enough trucks you are required to do your job then others job as well until the “team” is done, also read managements mind, as well as do their job for them, so many rules they can fire you for anything, the company is a revolving door for employees, trucks have 5 cameras in them"
bad,They are very unprofessional they will fire you for no reason at all or just because they don't feel like doing paperwork I was fired for failing a pre-employment drug test almost a year before working for them even after I passed their drug test and provided paper work stating I completed the return to duty process having worked there two weeks I was let go for that reason and also them saying dates on my resume had errors wouldn't recommend mworking for them to my worst enemy .
bad,Lot of overtime but  management   Kill the  Murrell and made everybody at each other‘s throat‘s managers did not get along with each other supervisors didn’t have a clue it would be a great job if they had the right management talk to corporate about the management issues and the politics They play the guy from corporate didn’t help matters maybe just quit along with a lot of other people they can’t keep good mechanics there too much drama
bad,"The supervisor and training is extremely unprofessional. The entire staff makes insensitive and sometimes racist jokes. They call threaten and talk to each other very badly and pass is off as them ""joking"" very unprofessional and uncomfortable."
bad,little to no supervision the chickens ran the hen house. They only care about the trucks rolling not the employees. They are all about profit If the supervisor doesn't like yo he will do all he can to replace you
bad,"The pay sounds great from the start, $165 per day, until you factor in 13-16 hours worked per day.  You receive overtime, but the more hours you work over, the less on the hour of overtime pay you make.   Confusing, right? Trucks have mechanical issues on a regular basis, making your job more difficult and laborious."
bad,With the drive cam no body have job secure... If you think this company you can growing up let me be honest with you... You gonna be on the wrong company.
bad,if your looking for true advancement this is not the place. the workplace culture is smoking mirrors meaning they say one thing but do another. i dont recommend the customer service job for anyone over the age of 35
bad,"If you carefully read job description they tell you being in the call center is a high stress job, who wants that? Customer Service means follow up but no time for that here, never fully staffed! No appreciation for office staff who take the brunt of it for the company! Continuously running out of garbage carts and parts to support customers needs, on back order for months with customer. Then a cluster getting them all delivered! Many fell through the cracks and new neighbors would get them while others wait months!  Not to mention $ 15.00 start here but elsewhere $ 16.00 start. If they would follow the proceedures passed out to employees that would be nice."
bad,"Management for the Dallas location is a Joke... "
bad,"Company is built on Servant Leadership and the ideology is great and the talk from corporate is empowering but they will not support middle management in any capacity. I was Legacy Progressive Waste and they were not interested in supporting the ""Change"" or stepping in when local management was involved in illegal activities."
bad,Out of the 7 operating jobs ive had in 25 years this is the worst. Just like all the reviews. Terrible management. Bad equipment. Terrible pay. 10 cent raise anually. And bottom poff the line benefits. Domt waste your time. The management is the main reason i left. Its terrible from the top down. Complete 2 face
bad,"Currently a typical day begins at 6 am and ends at 19 pm"
bad,"They don't respect you and there replace you in a minute and they play games with workers, and manager there plays games too, he's two face too, not a very good place to work for."
bad,"Stay away from this company. Unless you want poor management,horrible and completely unreliable equipment. A regular day is 12-14 everyday. And if you have the holiday off be prepared to work that upcoming weekend."
bad,"Do not work here management sucks, you dont get any equipment, constantly pushed to do unreasonable tasks and requests, they will promise you the world and deliver none of it"
bad,Its a 3am till done or 5pm which ever comes first. That's more time at work then home. Then commute. No help from others at all to get done. You work all day and ask for help to not get it and come back to everyone gone even the bosses.
bad,"was a horrible place to work, have people working on trucks that do not know how to use a multi meter. Whenever I noticed that i was teaching more than I was working, I thought I should ask for a raise. They just swept my request under the rug as if i never asked."
bad,This company makes a living off of firing and hiring. They lie constantly to their employees and tell them there are chances to move up. Lol. Ya right you will never move up to anything. If they don't like you for any of thousands of reasons they will find a way to push you out. Certain management needs to be fired due to harassment but never will be. Good paychecks are the only thing worth working for here.
bad,"My day was long and exhausting. I learned to try not to rush and be as safe as possible. Management staff was understanding sometime but on the other hand asking what going on with the route. Workplace culture was great because I like my co-workers. Working past 12 hour day was the hardest part of the day.  Again I enjoyed my coworkers, my job was a little easier because of them."
bad,"The management team does not train well as they do not want to spend the time and money. Also, they do not back you up when making decisions that are not written as policy."
bad,"Company not hold management accountable"
bad,"Was a good place but to meany back and it's always one person's fault no one else's. Some of the people like drivers where cool but had poor shop management. "
bad,"DM Recycling is without a doubt the worst managed company I've worked for. Discipline and policy enforcement is extremely SUBJECTIVE. Intimidation is their management model. Preach servant leadership, but in fact is the exact opposite. The more sense employee input makes, the more management resists.  Approach employee suggestions and concerns as subversive and REFUSE to allow employees to feel validated or empowered!?!? Hostile, unstable, uncomfortable work environment. "
bad,Management dont care about their employees. Us when u give them so.eone to hire that u know will bust butt for u they take their time hiring and lose them to other companys thats why this company in kilgore is always looking for drivers. Dont work at this company
bad,"To anyone thinking about working forr WCI, think twice. The mgt. of the company you're thinking of applying too will fill you with nothing but lies. They run every company they own the same way with the same paperwork and the same mis-management at every location. The individual mgt. at each company is given fat incentives to save every penny they can at the expense of the customers & the drivers. I know having worked for 6 yrs. under their ""servant leadership & their pyramid of success"". 28 yrs. in the industry & never seen such a business model. Making the top 10 execs. in the corp. as much money ss possible at all costs is all that matters. PERIOD! Worst company to work for I've ever seen. Glad I was able to retire."
bad,"Worked at this co. over 25 yrs.Last 6 under WCI. 60 hrs. a week Won't provide enough manpower to get work done.Micromanage every facet.Don't trust any of their employees.Just the opposite of the previous owners.Most of my co-workers have worked here over 20 yrs,all are re-tiring as soon as they can.Corporation is all that matters.WCI has ruined what once was one of the premiere solid waste haulers in the state."
bad,"A typical day was entailed to continuous getting in and out of the truck. Some of the items that were loaded in the back of the trash truck were heavy, and some were not. When the helpers were taken away from the drivers, it put more strain on the drivers. For example, I tore cartilage in my knee when the helper was taken away from me. I was having back and shoulder issues as well. "
bad,Upper management is horrific. Corporate in Denver do not operate the core values that the main corporate office enforces. Pay was great but no integrity from upper management.
bad,I would not recommend anyone going to work there the management in the shop is very bad and if you don't fit in with the group they will get you fired they
bad,"Relax pace, less pressure, pay is okay considering its location but he salary that was agreed on before I took the role was not what was offered to me. Management do not believe in second chances especially if you are a minority in a management role."
bad,Waste connections of Clearwater will be your worst mistake. The managers that are in place only care about a few of the guys the rest they can care less about. This was a great job without the poor management honestly with the managers that are in place now I wouldn’t advice anyone go there. They only give raises to their favorite few
bad,"They make a lot if false promises.  They outright lie to employees if companies they buy out, to keep them working until they can drive them away and hire gullible workers in their place. They care nothing about the condition of vehicles.... but you better get the work done still and don't complain."
bad,Please be careful working here. You will literally have to move a bed in becuase this will become your home. Whatever you negotiate as your salary/ pay rate GET IT IN WRITTING. Management is absolutely deceitfull and there is no organization. This Company should be ashamed of themselves for the lack of respect they give to US the everyday workers that do the job and tasks to maintain this company running. Very poor quality of work/life balance and dishonest managers and administration. The amount of work that is expected to be completed on a daily basis is inhumane. Working 14PLUS HOURS A SHIFT. I only came home for 4-5 hour to take a nap.  Also if you come in being a driver or a technician just know that you will be under paid $3.50 an hour.
bad,"Very stressful job trucks were wore out and abused. Upper people liked to play games and tell you what they thought you wanted to hear. Hard to get supervisor on the phone if you had a problem then he would just tell you ""I'll take care of it don't worry"", but usually nothing was done about the problem. My advice is do the job you signed on for and nothing more."
bad,was not able to make job progress as had  been agreement  on being hired.  hours and job were both subject to change  without notice.  enjoyed and thrived  on low supervision.
bad,"I had 3 different supervisors in the time I worked for them. By the 3rd one, I was training him as he had no idea how to run my site. I ran the site for them while being severely underpaid."
bad,"Management suck. "
bad,this is a badly managed company lots of hours no training pay not worth it. management not honest about how company works . uses temporary help to train drivers
bad,Condition of the trucks was poor. Drivers are not given proper training on safety and DOT regulations. Management does not know how to safely operate trucks. Work hours exceeds the legal limit and management edits DOT logs to be within legal limits without notifying the driver. When driver questions it they are reprimanded.
bad,"needs to be more employee active, better management, treat employees more equal to management officials. include employees in company activities, needs to be more family oriented, needs to have a better balance between work and home time."
bad,"If you say something your the Enemy No Rules No Structure .Certainly the 5 Core Values have disappeared Completely Safety""No""Integrity definitely Not."
bad,"very stressful, how to deal with competition, demanding with no regard with your experience, get it done with no regard to safety, dealing with poor management, the collaboration within the shop."
bad,I went through 5 sales managers and 4 different commission plans in the few years I was there. It was a very stressful job and I never saw a light at the end of the tunnel. This company was never going to change.
bad,"For the most part the company on the Olympic Peninsula are trying to become a ""Big City"" service area, while there are new customers coming onto the Peninsula adding more work for the company will not hire anymore CSR's to help with the phone or the ones they have do not answer phones, Mostly in that matter its a double standard, the favored employees get time to do their work, where as the non favored do all the phone calls and the daily work with no breaks from the phones."
bad,"No advancement for certain employees. No organizations, Rules are made as they go. Mangers are allowed to as they please while employees do not have a voice."
bad,Fulfilling workload. Great Co-workers. Lacking in proper management. Waste Connections has an extremely high turnover rate and expectations that should not be considered in placement. It is much like being under a dictatorship.
bad,This place was a joke starting with management. Not good with communication they talk to you any kind of way not caring who's listening.  Just worried about managers bonus
bad,"El Dorado Disposal (Waste Connections in Placerville) is one of the most mismanaged places I have ever seen. "
bad,"Poor communication from management in regards to start times and safety meetings. Work long hours, 13 days on before a day off and shifts were 12 hours. Start times were any where from 6pm to 8pm."
bad,"I gave my all to this company for almost 3 yrs & got kicked in the teeth with a stupid reason for termination. I loved the job as long as I was off the property. But the drama,poor management and the lack of fixing the truck correctly drives ya absolutely crazy. The way they treat the people that are making THEM the money is not right. I watched so many fellow employees be treated so bad. They always make you feel like you are wrong. It seemed like the more I cared the more they would knock me down. But I stayed because the customers that I developed an acquaintance with meant a lot to me. But they let go of me for doing a good deed and did not care a bit."
bad,"it was good for the first 5yrs than it went down from there,bad leaders n poor mangagers"
bad,Alright place to work. Management cares more about the customers then they will ever care about you. They leave you alone unless you aren't getting your work done. Pay makes up for everything though
bad,Great benefits but could be ran better trucks or outdated equipment so bad supervisors ride your back all day just wouldn’t recommend no body to work there
bad,"Management is horrible, terribly long hours. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone for many more reasons than are stated above. I am stressed out every single day and they always add more on you."
bad,"Job is stressful, training subpar, management needs help big time. Some over time. Pay just ok. Did provide cook outs and special events and tickets.."
bad,"Riding on the back of a garbage truck in a fast paced outside work environment in all weather conditions rain,snow,ice and long hours sometimes from 6:30 am till 9:00 pm"
bad,"Sorry place to work, getting paid 8.50 helper to work hard labor, the managers are dumb as a rock and only do audits OK once every couple months which everyone knows when they are. The helpers smoke weed drink behind the trucks this is by far the worst job ever, the drivers were the best ppl around except for the ones dat have been their for a while think their Foreman's. Best advice stay away they have cameras alot rules like they pay alot nk jib security ignorant non educared managers.."
bad,I would rather not give a review at this time as my opinions are skewed by recent experiences and would not be considered professional nor would they be acceptable.
bad,"I started as a roll-off driver 1 1/2 months ago at Waste Connections in Houston, have 18 years experience as a roll-off driver, no tickets, no accidents, missed 3 days in 18 years at a previous waste company.  I worked on Monday,was called into yard, and was let go, no reason, nothing. Terrible blow, for the people including management were great, don't know what went wrong, was doing the job according to my coworkers. I am sorry I lost this job, for I would of benefited them. I have great work ethic and appreciate a good job. But I will say, in their employment booklet, it states at least 40 times, TX. is an AT WILL STATE, we will fire you for anything but yet Waste Connections ask for a two week notice before you quit.. I don't know what I did, and I feel I deserve the respect to get an answer, any answer,but HR just stated I was not wanted, WELCOME TO TX. is what my friend said. Waste Connections, I started with a reck of a truck, did the best I could do, you could of gave me a reason,"
bad,"Worked as a Roll OFF driver with a fresh CDL. The opportunity to work here was a foot in the door of the world of trash. I like the job and the day to day flow. With that said I can not recommend this company. The trucks are in terrible shape and should not be on the road. I ended up working for a different roll off company because of how bad the equipment is. Also the cans that you use for deliveries are rusted out with large holes and customers even ask if it is even legal to transport these. When you are driving down the road with a load it’s common to have trash fall out because of old rusted out cans.  Almost lost my life twice because of these trucks. When you write up issues they reply with we know but it never gets fixed or takes months to fix. Even basic things such as AC in the hot summer days will not be provided. Have fun with that. The positives are as follows. "
bad,"They have pulled the string on plenty of guys 2/4 weeks before probation is done, can’t say it’s not done on purpose. Management is the biggest let down, they smile in ur face and try they best to take ur job, u can’t move up u have to be one of their puppies to be even be considered...."
bad,It’s a environment that doesn’t care about your life outside of work. You are expected to give your life to them and are threatened with being fired for every little thing. They burn out their controllers with unrealistic expectations and are constantly dealing with turnovers in management.
bad,If you do not have a degree its a decent place to work. However if you are educated and are a go getter you are gonna be stuck in the same role for years. Its almost like the company doesn't believe in advancing woman only men and are not open to suggestions that would better the company.
bad,"Long hours and hard work. Made some good friend while working there for seventeen years. Management was so so, could do a better job at being fair with all employees."
bad,"We just got bought out in Chicago,Seems like we are the only union shop WC has. I'm sure they don't like it. Here we make $33.72 an HR & $50.58 on OT. We just got our 3rd cameras installed &  but it has its advantages. Otherwise we haven't had any issues ""So far"". We are union so it's a plus & the union decides if our work rules are fair otherwise they can not be enforced  ""Benefit Union"". To all the other states from Mechanics, Drivers, transfer station & loaders & so on I would suggest calling your local union hall & get unionized because it gets you better pay, benefits "" Medical, Dental, Vision & retirement. Good luck to you all!!!"
bad,Work life balance there was awful. Often 12-14 hour days with no relief.  Huge turnover rate so always short on drivers. Little to no recognition for all the hard work.
bad,Learn new things about people and how they treat the people picking up there trash. Fast pace work that helps you stay in shape as you clean up the neighborhood.
bad,Union job. Good equipment. Decently maintained. Stable schedule. Due to local management and the companies safety policies its not worth it. You will be employed until your first safety infraction. No consideration for the occasional human error. Local management is not supportive in much of anything outside of the scheduled work.
bad,"Having worked on the sales team for several years, there was a huge turnover of long term people on the team. Commission plans are written so that management has sole discretion on how much you can earn. Every month you will have to fight for pay and will likely not win. And if you start to earn too much, the commission will change. If you do win a battle for your money, the next time you fight the same battle you will lose because management will change the rules. Customers are extremely difficult. Operations doesn't like sales. Upper management is mostly young, white males and love excuses to party. There is no accountability within departments. If you want to be unhappy, this is a great place to work."
bad,The work hours are early which is great. The pay is subpar for the industry. Least paid in the industry. Repercussions are consistent when you dont do as the pack does. Poor management they only care about the customer not the employees. they praise the people who do poorly at their job no actual praise for the ones that do thier job.
bad,Some managers don’t apply Servant leadership culture with their employees. They pretend to “care” for your personal and professional life but if you are honest and upfront you will be shut down. You have to lie like them. If they see you have potential they would put you in the shadows but they will use you on the back end where nobody is seeing who is really doing the job.
bad,Very very backstabbing and rude place to work. No appreciation for jobs well done. They always remember the worst. Little to any communication between managers and employees.
bad,"Bad management, only focus on the bad things... never expect to be appraised, because it wont happen. Only reason people work here are for the benefits."
bad,"Decent benefits but stressful job. Unhelpful management. Promotions were based on how close you were with management, not on job performance or qualification. Management left early multiple times a week but only a few employees in customer service were allowed off per day so requests weren't always permitted."
bad,"Awesome place to work, you can climb the ladder of success. Working for the people in the neighborhood making sure trash is picked up on a daily basis."
bad,WCI sold their interests in the DC market to a local hauler.  Big step backwards for the Division and anyone working there.  Career path eliminated.  Must pursue another organization.
bad,"Placing and compacting trash, hauling dirt for cover, grading side slopes and maintaining haul roads. NO OPINIONS  INCLUDED - JUST FACTS:  I learned that a multi million dollar company cares less about it's employees than their equipment and the equipment is purchased used, wornout and dilapidated. They appear to offer benefits that really are trivial while expecting work to be completed without providing adequate equipment to get the job done. In the great scheme of things,they spend minimal amounts of finances to keep the equipment working. When there is equipment failure management is quick to call it ""operator error"". When in fact it is ""worn out"" used equipment purchased to SAVE money. The co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was working with management that knew ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the tasks of working a landfill and was more interested in letting you know WHO WAS BOSS. If the employee is not a ""YES MAN"" he will be eliminated. The most enjoyable part of the job was .... LEAVING. Their equipment is a JOKE, (you get sent home because the equipment is broke down) their safety practices are a JOKE and their immediate field management is a JOKE. The sad thing about it is .. it used to be a great place to work and could be again but UNLESS and UNTIL upper management pulls their head out of the sand, stops pretending everything is OK and gets back in the game, it is going to get worse. Putting unqualified leadership in charge is NOT working. I did not leave because I was forced out like others .... I left because I saw what was happening to others"
bad,While the work is enjoyable the hours can be long but not consistent. Servicing the community is a plus and the feel of company community was of most importance.
bad,They tell you one thing and totally do the opposite. Make promises they don’t keep. Long hours without a break. I wouldn’t recommend anyone of my friends or family to work there from what I have seen so far.
bad,"I was working for Progressive Waste Solutions when Waste Connections took over. Received a much more larger workload with no pay raise. Overall, I think this company over-works and under-pays their employees."
bad,I only got 1 1/2 days training where others got 3 weeks then got wrote up because I didn't know things. My immediate supervisor was great but others were horrible. The office staff will back stab you in a heartbeat if you're not in there little click.
bad,You can't have a weak stomach working here. You have to be able to multitask. If you work hard and excel more than other workers you can possibly be (but most likely won't) moved up and absolutely no raises management is poor and will do whatever necessary to get their bonus at the end of the year.
bad,get to work and get log book do vehicle check get started on route pick up trash and take it to transfer station sometimes go back on route to finish if need to
bad,I'm looking for a career change or to work for a company over a corporation. I would like to find something in welding & fabrication. I support safety programs & safety policies.
bad,"When I first started with this company I thought everything was going to be great. I needed this job just so I could get some experience on my CDL license. The manager that hired me was great and I really liked his work ethics. But then they got rid of him because he didn't kiss corporate butt. They end up putting in a pushover who don't like to be at work. The trucks are horrible, always breaking down, no a/c in most trucks, which is bad when you live in Fl."
bad,"I'm going to assume not all locations are like this but mine in particular was terrible. Absolutely no training provided which was a shock considering how important the role was and the many responsibilities that went with it, poor management, terrible customer service reps. You can tell there was no training provided to them either by how unprofessional they are. Atmosphere was not at all inviting. Pay and benefits were great though."
bad,"Upside down pyramid is a false narrative on how they see employees.  Not worried about service.  Not worried about employees in the field providing service to customers.  They preach safety, but equipment is a joke."
bad,"They aquired the company I worked for....Changed the culture...Then sold us to the highest bider 6 months later"
bad,"Poorly operated, worked 50 to 70 hrs a week salaried and that wasnt enough for the site manager.  They want you to put the company first and your personal life second.  Coworkers were awesome for the most part.  Benefits were great, pay was descent.  If you smoke, drink, and love guns you will be a favorite and youll get away with almost anything."
bad,"Working for Lemay Shredding, I found it to be an easy, but physical and hard job to do.  But I did it.   I conveyed to management several times about the work load not even being feasably possible to perform realistically, and the called that a defeatist and negative attitude.     Only speeding thought safely and skipping breaks that they require you to take was the way to get things done.       The job says thier values, and they do appear to hold firm by them, however since late last year the atmosphere has dropped .    "
bad,"I was brought in on a false job description and grossly overpaid in hopes that I would stay. I was underutilized and disrespected daily with no regard or mediation from Management. Everyone is looking out for themselves. Beware... On a brighter note, the company culture is awesome. Great parties, perks, and free food. The only things I miss about working there."
bad,"Waste connections was alot of manual labor. Which I enjoyed as well as most of the drivers I was partnered with on a daily basis. However there are too many supervisors and they are constantly changing what divisions they supervise. Also I would get my route down in a timely professional manner and my reward was to go help other routes who would intentionally go slow, or were not physically capable of preforming the job."
bad,"Co workers great,they cook on grill for employees regularly,but lots of Rules,cameras in wore out trucks,corporate promise get all new gnc fuel trucks which never happened in 5-6 years,and the odors make a person sick....but the people that can handle the heat in a dusty beat HOT (no A/V truck are worth every penny they make..my last week before I quit my take home was a $1000 plenty of overtime."
bad,"Great company, until new management came in. WC Austin should stand behind their morals they claim to have, it’s a shame when family gets torn apart by a new management, but that’s how it goes. The culture is gone unfortunately"
bad,Great management and opportunity for advancement.  Pay level on par for industry. Long hours but working as a team seemed to make a hard job fun.  Taking care of your staff and customers in a fast paced environment.
bad,At this company I drove a rear loader residential garbage truck. I was on the truck by myself and was required to drive the truck and get out and load the garbage at every stop.
bad,It was fine in till the company was sold.However iam glad i worked there i learned alot.
good,"Typical day pick up 1000 homes,make 2 trips to the landfill while the company snitch,butt kissers have easy routes and same or more pay.If you clock inat 5am,plan on clocking out at 4pm at the earliest.Required to pick up couches,and other heavy furniture items on routes and put them in a front load truck.When the truck is damaged because of this,the management blames the drivers.The pay is not determined on merit or seniority.It is based on how much you pretend you are happy in the mornings when you walk in and your willingness to snitch on other employess and if you a dummy who votes no on a union vote you are gold to them for a while.If you work for these guys,I suggest you contact a UNION."
good,"Very unorganized, needs better leaders and management, drivers are more worried about theirselfs than the helpers on the back, wouldn't consider any new ideas or possibilities from helpers"
good,"boring, robotic, monotonous, and management doesnt have any idea what they are doing. they just want to please the people above them. dont care how they screw the people below them."
good,"The job was good, as long as you stay busy and keep focused on the task at hand, the days go by fast. there are good people who work there and can give you a rundown on the current and ongoing issues with the equipment."
good,"Not bad for a first cdl job"
good,"Great Benefits, Management is some what reasonable but controlled by corporate office. Management on the job site is constantly verbally aggressive and demeaning. Limited to no growth available with this company as Favoritism and know who rules. Overtime is mandatory and work is done in all elements."
good,The company itself is very wonderful however the individual casper location is not very good to work at due to small district there is no room for advancement the manager simply put is a snake in the grass who coddles certain employees says one thing yet proves otherwise I do not recommend working for this place unless management and mechanics are replaced
good,"depending on what  managers you are working with and are part of your team, it can be a great place and fun to work, or it can be terrible and super stressful to where you despair of coming to work."
good,Stressful job.  They require us to complete job duties without overtime and tell us we are to slow at our jobs.   I would not recommend working here to a friend.
good,"I outgrew management. There was nothing left to learn from them. Job/Life balance was non-existant. Often times, I was asked to place my job before prior engagements with my family."
good,"A typical day was taking 250 calls with customers such taking payments by phone, setting up new & cancellations or making changes to service. I learned that patience is a virtue. Management is only as good as their staff. The co-workers were a lot of fun. the hardest part of the job is wishing at times you good do more for your customers if allowed. the best part of the job is at the end of the day when you know you have helped a lot of good people."
good,Management is not strict enough in certain areas. Older worn out trucks with mechanics who don't maintain the equipment. Hoppers are hired through a third party which are mostly felons. One supervisor in particular was oblivious to anyone or anything that didn't benefit him.
good,"Planning day to day every morning "
good,This job is very demanding of your time. consistently working 10-13 hour days in any and all weather conditions. Management does not take into consideration how hot it could be and still expects the job to be done with no change in your pace throughout the day
good,"needs better management. good place to work at first, then they got a manager on a power trip, also encouraged work place bullying, also dont respect religious views of others."
good,Would never work for them again.  Work was not apprieciated.  Management would not listen to what you had to tell them on problems with the machine due to not wanting to shut machine down.
good,"not really a lot of room for growth and management is not strong, equipment is not updated or progressive I do like starting early in the morning and getting done mid day your are always over the DOT hour threshold."
good,Great place to work for events and fun. Other than that not a place for advancement. My immediate manager in IT was awesome. Other than that I will stand down on any other negative comments.
good,"Changing! Culture "
good,"I work in Knoxville Tennessee, our location is one of the largest hauling companies in company.  Inside the gates you find an unclean working environment.  Old offices and buildings untouched since the BFI days.  Some of the rudest people I have ever met work here and all complain about pay and unfair treatment from leaders.  This location is not professional in any way!!!!!  look elsewhere for employment."
good,"I worked 1:30-5 everyday after school and I walked around in rain, snow, or shine picking up trash. Its not really a career I wanted it was just a job during school to make some money. The management at the job is really good and great people to work with again, just wasn't what I wanted to do for my career path."
good,"Not enough training. I initially went in for another position. If you like being a customer service representative, this job is for you. Almost impossible to do paperwork and be on the phone 80% of the time."
good,"I would recommend people that wirk here make sure you have energy cause its nonstop from 5am until you're done with your route, or if you just want to get out of the house."
good,We have five supervisors and one manager on the operations side; no one talks with each other we have 6 people going in six different directions with no communication.
good,"Hard dirty work"
good,"Not a bad place to work as a mechanic, if you don't mind not having a life. The money is great but from Monday to Saturday, you basically live at the shop or on the road. And depending on where you work, your insurance will differ."
good,"The employees is what make this company great. The drivers who go out everyday in all conditions is the backbone of this company. The culture management tries to evoke, is the same culture management does not follow."
good,Lots of hours no home time to spend with family or friends want go home till the trucks ate fixed for the next day to many hours of work no home time .
good,The job paid the bills but don't care about your  work history or longevity you  could be fired at anytime the management promotion wasn't about what you know but about who you knew.
good,"A typical day was to come in get paperwork, pre-trip my truck then run my route. I learned to a lot of people love their garbage men and they show it by bringing us water/drinks and/or snacks. Management was ok, I did my job so there was no friction. I love my co-workers. The hardest thing about the job is dealing with all the slimy, nasty garbage and the smell that gets into my clothes. The customers and co-worker makes the job enjoyable."
good,"I worked for this company for about 4 years. In my time there I had good job security. The work/life balance was good doing front load, but the automated routes, lets just say the hours were show up and its dark, leave after its dark, and usually they wouldn't hire yard waste drivers, so when you were done with your trash route, you had to go back and finish the yard waste on your route. "
good,only 3 holidays off a year and you work those Saturdays to make up for being off. They don't tell you about the 4 1/2 miles of terrible dirt roads you have to take and they are almost impossible to drive down when it rains.
good,Will discuss if I meet with a company in person . It’s not a good policy to discuss a former company online. There were good days and bad days is the easiest way to put it.
good,Company is going through change after being bought. Management is good old boy style. Some hired from within with no management skills. Other managers have been let go because of gender bias.
good,"No room for growth, any and all corners will be cut, one person has to do all the stuff most people don't want to do. ""no one has job titles"" so they can make you do whatever they want."
good,not bad hrs work was fine stressful environment trucks constantly breaking down from over use .mechanics unable to keep trucks up & running due to warranty issues. they need to be able to fix the trucks .
good,"The job is good and the people in the office are wonderful, the problem comes to management. They seem to care more about profit and numbers than they do the employees."
good,There is a lot of hype about the company and how great they are but if you don't play by their rules...game's over.  The field positions and people are awesome...corporate needs some work.
good,it was a decent place to work for three and a half years I was satisfied where I was with me management team and liked my coworkers. but in the end very stressful about weather I would have a job from day to day. I still showed up and gave my all until the day I was laid off
good,"Learned to identify and communicate with different levels of management, negotiate sales/contracts, communicate efficiently with various depts to resolve customers service requests.Learned the importance of communication and follow up. I enjoyed building relationships with my customers/co-workers and the benefits that came from it. Wearing the hat of Account Mgr/Retention/Billing/Sales Consultant could be a bit overwhelming at times."
good,I worked 40hrs a week I learned new computer soft wear and paper work along with the office skill that I already had knowledge of.  Management had there moments of revolving doors there were managers that where meant to be managers and one's that went by the seat of the pants and really didn't know what they were doing. I got along with all my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was the lies that the company would feed the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills and the first 2 years of being with the company.
good,"applied for this position 4 times when openings were available in mcCall. got one interview. Manager seemed more interested in my age than the many years of experience, I had doing the job and the equipment , I was qualified to operate. i still receive calls from the recruiter, he doesn't seem to see any problem. the local manager on the other hand does. after the interview i believe i knew more about sanitation than he did."
good,"My day started about 4:30 in the morning, because I lived about 20 miles from work.Our day would start with any announcements that management had for us. We would pre-trip our trucks,pick up our routing assignments for the day and head out to work. sometimes I would train new drivers, other days I would just be lead driver."
good,"I worked as a landfill manager for 5 years working my way up after college. I moved all over the US for Waste Connections in order to help develop myself into a great manager and leader. Everything was going very well. I had a great rapport with my superiors. I was in it for the long haul. I was completely convinced that I was going to grow old with this company. I was offered a second promotion and moved for the 4th time in my 5 year tenure with them. One my 6 month anniversary, I was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated by my manager and regional VP. I apparently ""wasn't what they were looking for in a WCI leader"". The funny thing is that they offered me a severance package to ""keep my mouth shut and not give them any grief""."
good,This is a great job for someone that needs to provide for their family. If you are looking for a job to pay the mortgage then you should definitely get a job here.
good,You’ll enjoy your day until you have to do someone else’s work. Also the paying is okay but for everything you have to deal with it and the conditions you work in you should be able to get paid more.
good,This really is a great place to work. They have a lot of room for advancement. Great upper management. It's just hit or miss when it comes to lower management.
good,"not enough bays to work in had to work a ton outside with rain and cold never had any parts, not enough staff no team players great admin fed us all the time"
good,If your not in the click your gone. Was a fun job while it lasted. If you like a fast paced environment then this is your job. Play with heavy equipment and direct traffic. It slows down in the winter months. Then there's snow removal.
good,Not for those who lack intestinal fortitude. If you always wanted to be a garbage man when you grew up the glamor wears off quick. Not for the weak at heart.
good,"It prepared me to move forward towards gaining more experience to inhance my skills. I think every yard is different but my yard had great management. Mostly a great supervisor that worked well with me.  The pay was not great but it’s slightly above average. Raises aren’t good. But the job is fairly easy. You can get plenty of overtime. You feel appreciated, honestly."
good,"This is a good company to work for if you are a very (and I mean VERY) safe and skilled driver. You will be working in all conditions and sometimes treacherous roads. You work until the work is finished. They have a strong safety culture and expect near perfection in their drivers. You are monitored by a dashcam and have to be aware at all times what you are doing. You are part of a team, and they will help you but it is up to you to get your work done. Everyone has a full work load and expect you to be up to the task."
good,"This is not the company to try to advance in if you are a female, someone either needs to die or quit before you're even close to being looked at for a promotion."
good,It was fine but the newly acquired company did not want to follow the mission all that much and made it difficult as a lower level manager to make sure things got done.
good,"Good people to work with and friendly and kind to get a long with, they cook for us on holiday in give us water and powerade in the summer they give us a 30 minute launch break."
good,"Working with Waste Connections will provide you with a fairly decent job, the office people tend to be nice and there is a lot to learn... However, being a big company, you tend to be dispensable, especially if your numbers are lacking."
good,Be ready to work and got to be physically fit to be able to keep up to be a helper. Be ready for any work conditiontions rainy cold or hot. Guarnteed to work alot of hours and get paid weekly.  Job has its ups and down just like any job but guaranteed to get a check.
good,"great benefits, but if you have 3 accidents no matter how small, get caught on your cell phone they will let you go quick. the new company just bought it, and theyre struggling to keep drivers, lots of pressure to meet your quota,"
good,"Hard to advance, even harder to get pay raises. Hours are nice, supervisors are nice, just hard to advance past where you currently are, especially for females."
good,None to tell but a good job. Management is strict on safety. Good benifits and some good equipment .8 to 12 stops a day. Great mechanics to fix trucks.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of pre-trip of garbage truck, waiting around for assigned helpers to show up and be ready to leave on route (very often helpers quit or are unreliable so changes had to be made daily as to who would ride with me on route). Average time to route was 1 hour drive time. Typical route time is 12 hours from start to finish. Everyday goal was to complete route in time to make it to the landfill to dump the truck before they closed. "
good,"Management needs to treat employees equally also interact with their employees not just a few  chosen ones. Management should at least greet their employees with good morning, good evening etc. For the most part the office staff and drivers are like family.  I think management has brought this company down due to the lack of knowledge and love  for the business. I've been in the business for at least "
good,The most enjoyable part is the employees.  The day to day job is fast paced and keeps you on your toes.   Work place culture is enjoyable and exciting.
good,"poor management of staffing lead to burnout. pay is ok, lots of overtime available. Low staffing, low inventory and high breaking rate lead to worker frustration."
good,Waste Connections as a whole is a good place to work for and I did learn some valuable information while being there. The flow of the day was by far one of the best schedules I had because it allowed me to be home with my family on a nightly basis
good,Good customer relations and customer service. Enjoyed serving the public and daily interactions with the public. Work atmosphere is employee oriented.  No room for advancement since it is a small company.
good,Very tough industry! The people that actually do the work are for the most part very decent people! Some of the hardest workers you will find anywhere. And the company takes advantage of that. You had beter be willing to make the trash industry a huge part of your life if you want to work there!
good,"They strive to provide a safe work internment for all employees. Some feel that the high standards are not compensated enough monetarily. Good benefits may make up for lower pay. Although there is a lot of corporate protocol, there is a relaxed atmosphere that many employees enjoy."
good,"It's a big company but the one over in Kodiak Alaska where there is a small crew, you get lucky if you're a close friend to a manager otherwise you step aside and do the low end job among the crews."
good,I was hired in Residential Customer Service after completing six week temporary assignment as Receptionist while the full time employee had successful knee replacement surgery..
good,Always changing. The trouble is the boss likes to fear people into work ect. Its a lot of one sidedness. for example its all about the drivers and no one else.
good,Great experience and I feel as though it has prepared me for a managerial role.
good,This was a busy job worked in strip mines. enjoyed the people that I worked with
good,"I worked at a recycling center cashing out customers for CRV bottles and cans. The work will keep you occupied but some days will be so busy that your ability to complete tasks would be impossible without cutting corners as the workload can sometimes be just too much for a single offsite employee. The pay was quiet excellent and benefits were nice as well, though opportunity for advancement was out of the question, to advance I was told I would have to take a pay cut and start over in an alternate position within the company! "
good,"it's are strict and to the point work environment, i took a CDL form the jod and a great safty work ethic"
good,This was a Fantastic Experience!! I loved my position here as the Office Manager. My day consisted of several diverse projects! Great Company!
good,all shifts flexable pay bi weekly would go back is had the chance
good,Work to many hours do not have any set schedule work til your done each night no time for family life main priority here is working that’s it cannot keep people here because of the hours
good,"Very good job, every body work a team, but need pay more, you work for the trash, is heavy lift and you need to work in all weather no matter what, but is good job"
good,I enjoyed working there and like the people. There were many things I loved about working there and a few I didn’t like. My job was very stressful and I felt I worked very hard and would have liked more pay.
good,Overall satisfaction with the company. Good group of knowledgeable professionals. Pleasant work atmosphere contributes to the overall satisfaction rating...….
good,"We accept calls from customers for new service, misses, pick ups cancellations etc. The is a good place to work but the the management is not a team oriented."
good,"Woke up at 2:30 am every morning. Had truck trouble at least 3 times a week, getting stuck on side the road waiting for someone to come get me back running."
good,"I enjoy working for Waste Connections. Training every other week. Team building events are held almost monthly (cook outs, etc.).  Autonomy to work your area, but held accountable for performance."
good,"Start early, work late if you like and can."
good,"I learned a lot of valuable skills working for Waste Connections such as welding, body work, and engine repair. The Maintenance Manager was great about showing me how to make a repair so that I could do it on my own the next time."
good,Work load is heavy but very fun and challenging most of the people were really nice. Safety culture was great with plenty of rewads for being safe loved that place . the only thing was mangement did not really support me appreciative
good,Not my favorite place to work. Customers are angry and hateful.  Management was fair. I wasn't prepared or trained on how to deal with ignorant people.
good,"ok place to work,pay not that grat but decent,health care is expensive for family."
good,"Routes are planned so that you're on the clock 11+ hours each day even if you hustle. I've done rolloff, residential (manual and automated), and a bit of commercial in a rear loader and it's this way in everything. After 10 hours in that same frickin seat you're hungry, tired, more easily frustrated, and providing low quality service. not to mention missing out on a life. I've heard this isn't how WC is everywhere, but it's business as usual for drivers at any of the three Denver locations. I worked only 9-10 each day at a different trash company and, trust me, it's a huge difference..."
good,"Good company, great management. My only slight was that the residential drivers were selfish, Always in a rush to get off no matter who was left broken down until they themselves broke down then it was about “team work”. The mechanics were always over worked so unless your truck had major issues it would most likely get put in the back burners. The trucks were decent, atleast 1 person would break down during the week.The routes were medium to large, most days 10-12 hours."
good,It is a good job but not enough hours but over all a really good job just looking more for a career than a job thats were I have some types of struggles there there are all kind of jobs and not enough careers
good,your typical day was dealing with customer account and payment. I learned different aspects of the company and like a engine everything had to work together for everything to be smooth running.  Some of the management only cared about themselves while others cared about everyone. At the end the company was only looking at the bottom line
good,Okay to work here. Co-workers have their favorites. Work a lot outdoors in the elements even though there is a shop. there is never any room for all the work that needs to be done. 
good,I personaly llived working there at first until you make one mistake then they act like you owe them something because they didn't fire you or you got rehired.
good,Work by yourself. you're your own boss most of the time. I took care of the Colstrip-Lamedeer route and the ranches in between.
good,"I liked the work but the Customer Service manager was unprofessional and inexperienced.  Chances of advancement are minimal.  No teamwork accross department lines.  District Vice President has a chastising and dictatorial management style.  If you're a professional looking for a place to chill for a while,  this would be a great place to twiddle you thumbs."
good,"I enjoy working at Waste Connections, we have a great team. The only reason I would seek other employment is for advancement. Unfortunately in the accounting department of Waste Connections they are only hiring young men right out of college."
good,12 hours a day with the workload - but the drivers were great and most of the staff. the systems made the work load very easy and were the best I have used in this industry by far.
good,"As a whole, Waste Connections does care about the employee's who work hard to move up the company.  They truly support job advancement however, the current management in Central Region is ruining the compassion of the company."
good,I work for Waste Connections in Placerville California they were great to work with they took care of their drivers and made sure everybody was taking care of happy and our customers Waste Connections in Missouri is a little bit different I applied for 10 different jobs and it's either they won't give me a job because I'm a woman or it's because they're unsecured that I can't do the job when I've worked for Waste Connections in the past for almost 9 years in California
good,"Great management when I started, things went down hill with turn overs. Wish I could go back!"
good,Overall great place to work. I was able to exhibit my customer service skills at the highest level because we had lots of angry customers/
good,"Of all of the careers I have had, I enjoyed working for Waste Connections the most. People were very nice and we had a family atmosphere there. I made a good living for my family and looked forward to going to work everyday."
good,"During the company takeover, 4 managers in 11 months. Old trucks from other companies, old damaged containers with holes in the bottom. But other than that dealing with the drama from upper management who different time."
good,Having the parts you need to repair trucks was a problem.
good,"The job at waste connection was a great place to learn and grow . The daily requirement were demanding ,but it help a person become more efficient at the job . I received some needed certifications while working there . Met some get people and became lead mechanic . Just a great experience."
good,"Not a place for slackers. hard, fast paced work. Time goes fast due to the pace. You must be able to work with out constant supervision. It is all about customer service."
good,Treat employees well. To much turnover in management however. Pay is below that of waste management  operating in the same region. Good opportunities for transfers
good,Increase in pay needed across all managers. The work hard play hard mentality only goes so far. Feels like they want to just throw perks at you vs compensation.
good,Be prepared to work over 12 hours per day and between 40-50 hours per week.  Long hours for little pay.  Benefits provided to all full time employees.
good,"quiet friendly they feed you all the time manager is patient willing to  train at your pace, get tickets to games, give parties, If you have to stay over to complete work or come early to complete work it's fine they never say any thing about over time. nice comfort place to work.It's easy to work their all the employee get along and willing to help on another,the hardest part was finance for me."
good,Been working here 2 + years and I don’t like the way they do your off days. Only way you can get off is to take a vacation day. With all the drivers you would think they would rotate your days so you could enjoy a weekend off with out having to take a vacation day
good,Its a good pay job and have great benfits...managment is very poor and dont treat drivers with respect...but  the driver crew are fun to work with.supervior was nice to
good,"Fast-paced, fun work environment.  Room to grow, learn and advance in company.  Family oriented company that offers good benefits.  Professional management that goes above and beyond."
good,"Great company to work for. Fun environment, great team work. Working here is a great place for advancement through different routes. Started on portable toilets route then quickly moved to garbage truck route"
good,I learned many things at Waste Connections and I believe that it was one of the best companies to work for. Lots of training and support provided for every employee.
good,"When I was with Waste Connections, we had a good team and worked together well."
good,"I worked for Murreys Disposal for almost 7 years. It is a good, solid company with good wages and benefits. The management can be average and sometimes the environment was tense but I think this happens at every company."
good,Review route sheet prior to leaving for route sequencing new starts and putting them in order. once on route you follow route according to route sheet and pick up customers trash in a timely matter while having to help out on open or routes that are to big for one person.
good,"The management tells you that you will get a raise, but blames corporate about it, and you will never get any more money out of these people. Supervisors are the same. They have drive cam and hold everything against you that happens, remember you are in a garbage truck, lol"
good,Great safety culture. Really nice equipment. Employee turnover is quite high due to increasingly high safety standards. The pay scale is lacking because a lot of sites are not on union based pay scales. Benefits are not on par for the same reason.
good,"Come to work everyday, work with the folks that are there to develop a good operational plan on a day to day basis.  Come up with solutions to problems quickly and execute decisions effectively."
good,"If you have experience in Diesel Mechanics, then this is the place you want to retire from, but if you are just learning or want to know more, well in my experience this isnt the place for you."
good,its ok place to work. Plenty of work. Management could do a better job of taking suggestions from employees.its a who you know( buddy system) in order to gain advancement here.
good,"The company has changed in recent years, now it isn't about the driver, but the all mighty dollar.  Your happiness really will depend on the department you are in and the manager you have.  The money wasn't worth the lack of family time I had and dealing with the cliques and favoritism.  Making less money and being ok to go to work with people who actually care if means more."
good,I loved my job I didn't love the hours but we were trash and recycle drivers giving service to the city of Frisco Texas so it was time consuming and we had to help the slower drivers finish their routes
good,"Typical day: fast-pace, positive environment, always looking for places to improve work quality"
good,It's a good job for young fit help who want a challenge in there work environment good people to work with and always has enough work to keep someone busy through out the day
good,"the job is not hard, as far as most labor jobs go. Riding in the truck or on the back emptying garbage cans. Reward and bonuses around holidays, can get overtime no problem, if you wis to work longer hours.h"
good,"In charge of making sure drivers get their routes completed, assuring proper maintenance is preformed on fleet, maintaining customer service, interviewing new employees.  This company believes in Steward Leadership.  Management is their to make sure the employees under them have the tools to do their job to the best of their abilities.  "
good,"Very good, very fair company."
good,"I'm really pleased with the good team work between me and my co-workers. Also, the company offers really good benefits. I only wish they would change the Chinese time."
good,I've never quit a job. I've only ever quit managers. Life was good with the previous District managers but then we got a guy from progressive waste and he ruined the culture
good,"Work hard, play hard.  A typical day starts early and often ends late.  Lots of travel.  Processed could be more uniform and there is a need for internal mentoring.  Management does practice servant leadership."
good,"I have only been with the company a few months and there have been a lot of changes but overall everyone is trying to work through things and push the company in a positive direction.  There are a lot of challenges which is great and the executives are fantastic to work for; open door policy, easy to talk to, etc."
good,"The overall workplace culture is based on the sound principle of servant leadership. Allows for a good balance between the workplace and family. The most difficult part of the job was going through a period of instability in the management team, but overall team was a pleasure to work with and share the same principles and objectives."
good,The start of every day was to pre trip my truck to ensure that all mechanical components were safely operational.  I took pride in doing so as safety is my number one goal. As I would load containers onto my truck I would  360 my truck to ensure that my load was secure. It was the best career I had and I would love nothing more than to work for  Waste Connections again.
good,"Good place to work for take care of you.union job,hard work but well worth it.Fast paced. Get rewarded for a job well done. Safety is there number one concern"
good,"This job has its ups and downs. Working long hours, but the pay is nice. You get your route done but you never go home when your work is finished. There isn’t much room for growth. But job security is a benefit."
good,"Waste Connection is not a bad place to work for they do take care of there employees, they cook out and show how much they appreciate the work we do for them."
good,I like working at waste connections it was a secure job and a friendly atmosphere to work in it was close to my home the office lady’s where really helpful
good,"A typical work day for me would be waking up and arriving at 5am to work. On average, I’d usually leave work around 3pm. The driving itself isn’t a challenge since I’m very determined because I have two sons who I am sending to school. Personally, i am confident in my driving because I’ve driven roughly 5760 hours for waste connections (this is a conservative estimate). During my time working there, I never really struggled with the tasks I was given whether it be extra work hours or a trip to different city."
good,"Waste Connections is a great place to work, as long as there mechanics are up to speed on fixing the trucks. Trucks always need maintenance, but you shouldn't have a truck that you where told was fix 3 days in a row break down and lose air pressure as you are driving down a busy road fully loaded."
good,Hard working and the work is never ending even on the weekends due to garbage comes seven days a week in addition the pay is good as well as the benefits just a bad job life balance.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,Waste connections is a good place to work. The pay is decent and the health benefits are good. I like the vacation and sick leave policies. The employees are very friendly
good,I think every yard is different but my yard had great management. I was constantly told how much I was appreciated. That goes a long way. It’s not great pay but it’s slightly above average. Raises aren’t good. Career advancement is a joke. But the job is fairly easy. You can get plenty of overtime. You feel appreciated (or at least in graham). As long as you’re not ambitious and are content being a driver or whatever you’re hired for then it’s a great place to work. I honestly feel that your safety is their priority
good,great place to work boss super polite company parties every christmas we all get along like family we have great medical and dental insurance our 401 is the best we get matched dollar for dollar the first 6 percent
good,There used to be very toxic people working here who fired some great people. Those toxic people no longer work here and now its great. The work is consistent and you don't feel like you are going to get fired when you walk in the door.
good,"It was a good company to work for. I learned a lot towards furthering my career in the solid waste industry. I would recommend this company to anyone trying to further their career, as long as they are willing to relocate to where the company needs them."
good,Full filling job if you like working with people. helpful in almost every way to help you succeed. Management was willing to promote as long as you got the work done.
good,"Was a great job and good management but the pay eas low for a class A driver license. paid 15hr. At the mineral wells, tx.  It's ok for a class B but not enough for a class A. Fort worth pays 18"
good,The hardest part about my employment at Waste Connections is the time frame of hours that I work. I never know when I am going to be finished with my daily tasks and leave the job for the day.
good,"typical day would be to run a pre-loaded trailer to landfill, unload and return to transfer station to get loaded with material. that's what I did for 10 hrs a day. Other days when I worked for Met Council, I would head down to the St Paul Treatment plant to get loaded with waste water to bring to landfill."
good,Management in tune with employees' needs. Good working hours. Employees work together to ensure customer needs are met. Easy access from interstate. Employees respect each other.
good,we have meeting every morning we have fun working togetter sometime we have cook out good place to work managment are good
good,"Started out really good and gained lots of knowledge and then after some years it slows down and to move up you have to move out."
good,back office equipment is out dated. drivers are not held accountable for not completing jobs. turn over in upper management
good,"A safety first culture, caring and invested co-workers and outstanding management. Best infrastructure and support I have been around from the shift lead to regional manager. The company truly cares about the health and well being of it's employees. There are numerous benefits at Waste Connections that are not a typical in the industry. Communication is at the forefront and tremendous respect is given to each employee. The culture on the shop floor is one of growth and development. No co-worker has ever been too busy to assist or offer help when needed. Top of the line shop equipment that improves the safety and ease of performing the job/tasks. This is by far the best I have ever been treated by an employer. The one negative is that there are simply not enough mechanics to handle the workload. This results in a lot of overtime which affects work/life balance negatively. The pay is also below industry standard but the volume of overtime compensates for that."
good,Good job and people to work with and it made the days go by pretty quick.  Got to know good people
good,"Waste Connections is a wonderful company to work for, I was with them for 2 years and enjoyed every minute. They have a great company culture, Great people and even greater management. Great benefits and compensation."
good,"Good teamwork is for this job , and motivating others is strongly needed. I had a good experience and would love to further my career doing jobs related to waste connections"
good,I enjoyed my 7 years with Waste Connections.  The company culture was incredible.  I am sorry to say that as they have grown that culture is not as good as it once was.
good,The company is a very good place to work for depending on the location. They care about safety. The care about listening and that's a plus. There's respect. They also promote family  Activites.
good,A very fast paced work place. There are times that are very slow and you need to find things to do especially if you are not familiar with the company and field of work. I have been with the company for 12 years and it took me looking and playing around with reports and to keep me busy. I do have to say that I have learned so much but it took me learning on my own.
good,I really liked working for Waste Connections. There was a very good commendatory and family dynamic. It was one of the best places to work. I would recommend it.
good,"Typical day: Fast pace working on the routes.                       "
good,great place to work! just not enough movement for someone who works in the yard. everyone is very friendly. supervisors are very nice and attend to anything that needs attending
good,Great job for anyone that wants to be home with their family and make a decent amount of money to provide for your family. Great group of guys to work with.
good,"I enjoyed working here, the atmosphere and managers/co-workers made work enjoyable. Managers were very approachable, you didn't feel as though you couldn't ask questions."
good,"On an average day, I spent a lot of time in my car visiting clients in my territory and searching and cold calling on new business. Some days were spent in the office."
good,"It was a very different experience, but I still managed to work​there the disturbing things. I seen some very interesting things at that job. I wouldn't mind working there again."
good,get to work clock in open your toolbox get to work on the trucks there was always something to do management was good they were understanding and knew what they needed to get done
good,"•	Prepared reports and complex correspondence paperwork"
good,"This was a good place to work with a lot of great people. Throughout the years met and worked for some great people. Able to work with a trusted work ethics, the bosses trusted you to do your job in a timely and safe manner. Felt like you were your own boss representing the company in a professional manner."
good,"12 hour shifts with plenty of over time, no room to move up but still a solid job. Good environment to learn from the more experienced folks as well as teaching the younger kids..."
good,"Handle heavy call volume via switchboard. Enter contracts for the Sales departments. Maintain customer accounts including opening, closing, reviewing, and making any neccessary changes. Direct co-workers were extremely easy to work with on a daily basis. The most dfficult part of the job is the lack of available overtime and opportunities for advancement are rare. The most learned aspect of this job was the knowledge of operations with the company."
good,"management will tell you they have your back when they truly do not care."
good,It’s a very demanding but rewarding place to work. Most of the people you will work with are friendly and willing to help out when duty calls. My manager was great to work with. The equipment failures are a pain to deal with on a continuous basis but overall you manage to fight through the struggles.
good,"I must say my experience with this company was excellent.  I enjoyed the safety culture with them and although the work life balance is challenging, they made up for it."
good,"Good atmosphere to work in. Many opportunities for advancement.  I really enjoyed working in the operations department,  working with 150 drivers was very challenging but rewarding.  Wci has great appreciation events for the employees.  The was the hardest part of the job, as it was not a competitive wage at that time."
good,"Work side by side with your business partner to insure the most cost efficient management. Analyze expenses, labor, disposal, contracts on a day to day basis."
good,"Great company to work for. Some long days, can be challenging due to weather conditions. No boss standing over your shoulder.........................."
good,"The benefits were good. The Job opportunities were not great. The salary was not what I was looking for. Very good work enviroment, and overall a good job."
good,"I been with this company for 10yrs and i love my job! Everyday is a different experience ... i enjoy meeting customers and be able to offer the best customer service so the customer leaves with a smile! Thats the best part for me ... "
good,"For my company I was responsible for preforming preventative maintenance, as well as light engine work for our fleet of 13 garbage trucks. In that time I learned how to preform my various tasks in a professional safe manner. I really appreciate how my managers made me feel like a part of the Waste Connections family. Each day I looked forward to working with my supportive co-workers. The hardest part of my job was taking constructive criticism and using it to perfect my technique. At the end of the day I enjoyed thinking about what I was able to learn while helping my company further our goals."
good,This is a great company to work for.  They handle all aspects of Waste and Recycling Services and even have an Oil and Gas Division.  I would highly recommend a career at Waste Connections in any field you are in.
good,Great place for begginers in Heavy equipment operations. Hardest Part of the job is being able to endure outside weather. Good to bad coworker ratio is equal.
good,"Work 8 hours a day, 7am to 4pm most of the time. It's busy and productive which is great. I learned a lot about excel and mapping, training. In terms of management, I learn a lot about the company structure, and how to communicate with other people in those structure. Coworkers are friendly and nice. The most enjoyable part of the job is waking up every morning knowing that you will meet nice coworker in the office."
good,"Good group of people! Treat you right and take the time to train you. The only thing that sucked was the smell of the dump sites, and working the odd Saturday."
good,"Great place to work, I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time with poor leadership. The leadership was eventually replaced with a great leader but I was completely burnt out by then. Highly recommend working there, it's a great company."
good,I love my job and everything about it.  Be safe and learn.  Train and help others.  Opportunity for more hours. Good people around you who wants to see you advance.
good,Company gives you an opportunity to learn and know the job but a great place to work. Family functions are great to share with co-workers get to know them more.
good,Company takes care of employees great pay long hours good management good work culture. If you work hard and do whats asked its a great place to work would recomend
good,"The average day was like this: check-in by 7:00 am (not a minute later), rendezvous with the team, assess the condition of the garbage truck and set sail, patrol the town and empty garbage bins, report back to headquarters when the job is done. Management was alright. The culture was as good as it could be. The hardest part of the job was dealing with random cramps every once and a while. The most enjoyable part of the gig was cracking jokes with the team."
good,"A typical day at my work,It was fun once you knew your. route. Friendly environment. Hardest part of my job was trying to understand the people on the streets and on traffic. What i learn ,was always safety first no matter."
good,Waste Connections is fun and they are a great company to work for. There is a lot of room for moving up In The company.  They give vacation and sick time off.
good,The title was meant as a joke this was actually a great company to work for. It was a lot of hours though and you're expected to work under stressful conditions and some less than enjoyable weather.
good,WCI is a big family and we like to work hard so we can play hard. They have a lot of life long employees who are well taken care of. We view people as our number one asset.
good,"Raises are small and once per year.  Every employee gets the same percentage raise regardless of reliability, conduct, or performance which I see as unfair."
good,Work 10hrs daily. Goal is to work Safe and be Productive. Give 110% workers work as a  team to get the job done .Wear Protective Equipment. PPE. Coworkers works together to accomplish the job.
good,"Never get lunch , workers don't help each other out , don't offer pto , and doesn't compensate for lost hrs due to catastrophes, not enough pay for work that you do"
good,Love the job but truly wish it paid more. It's very relaxed and a great group of guys. The biggest issue is there's  wry few opportunities to advance in the company.
good,"Great place to work. This company is going to be the leader in Waste Solutions. However, they acquired Progressive Waste and with that came along a few bad apples that need to be dumped to rot in the landfills. Once they are discovered, the company will really live to their core values here in South Florida."
good,Was a wonderful company and very family oriented and truly care about there employees.  ................................................................Thhbthbtbggjbfhh Th mgrnht
good,It is worth working there. Great Supervisors and Managers and coworkers. I really enjoyed driving the side dump. Everyone has their own preferences though. The higher ups care about the employees.

good,a typical day at work started at 530 am it was a very tuff job and it was dangerous but good exercise I enjoyed it till they changed our pay to a day rate we worked 60 hours a week lots of times with no overtime pay and if the company would have kept paying by the hour with overtime pay I would have still been there today just did noit like working all those hours with out over time pay I don't mind working overtime but I like to be payed for my overtime
good,I usually start my day early in the morning by pre tripping the truck and doing my paperwork. Then i head to the route and service each customer that is on the route sheet. After the route is completed I head to the land field to to dump out the truck. I then conduct a post trip of the vehicle and end of the day paperwork. The work place culture was friendly.

good,"To start to work and be call the manager and ask how to fix a truck that some one else work on."
good,"Very fun and relaxed workplace, great group of driver's & co-workers for the most part.  Of course, it was much better before the merge,  buy-out & new management & leadership.  The new didn't seem to want to keep too many of the original around...for some reason?!  We were talked to & treated much better when we were Republic Waste...before the merge & then buy-out of us remaining.  New leadership/management is very arrogant, really enjoys his power & abuses it. Threatens in an example story telling way & always with a grin on his face.  Loves & will go head over hills, even been known of hiring private detectives trying to catch someone at something...like a Tom & Jerry game & then tells & shares with all...certainly breaching professionalism &/or confidentuality?!  We had virtually no turnover before & then when he/new management was in place it was constant & tremendous...even with new hirings that was not originally Republic Waste employees...!  It's sad to think that one man has the power & could cause so much demise of what is virtually at good company & a great place to work...!  It's one of those deals that you better hope he likes you & you stay on his good side...or he will ride you like an unbroken horse...until you brake?!"

I have a high knowledge of hydraulics, so this was not too hard. Management has a lot to be desired. My co-workers are okay. Some desire to learn from the more experienced while others seem to know it all and it is only a matter of time before failure seems to strike the ""know it all"".
