good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,My last position with the bank was as a receptionist/customer service representative in the mortgage department. The walk-in traffic was not nearly as high as it had been on the bank side. I more enjoyed the larger amount of customers I saw daily in the bank. I spent my time helping the mortgage reps with files and taking incoming phone calls for new loan customers. A big part of this position was ordering and keeping track of all supplies used in the department. My manager was good to work with. She did not micro manage but was always available to help when needed. My co-workers were a very nice bunch of people who rarely had spare time to visit or become better acquainted. The least desireable part of this job were the times when business was slow. I very much enjoyed my time in this department as it gave me a chance to get to know some wonderful people while learning some new skills
good,Promotion turnover is very high. Management is excellent and wants to help each individual succeed.

good,"As a lead teller I would have many tasks throughout the day. I learned many things and was able to advance quickly. The hardest part of my job was making sure that everyone was following the bank policies while still trying to maintain great customer service. It's hard to tell a customer ""No"" but there are many times in a bank where you have to do a procedure the correct and safe way and not the way the customer would like. The most enjoyable part of my job was building wonderful customer relationships and advancing in my career with Wells Fargo."

The management team was very helpful in my growth in the company. My co workers were great the team felt like more of a family rather co workers. Being with such a great group individuals helped transitioning from a collector/loan adjustor to my role as an underwriter. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing at the end of the day we are helping to make a difference in someone life as well given a second to chance for our borrowers to maintain the American Dream of home ownership

good,My typical Day at work consists of taking inbound calls from our banking customers. I offer advice and recommend products and services that meet our customers needs. I have learned how to be patient and really listen to what the customer wants as opposed to what they are saying. The hardest part of the job is not being able to provide more in depth customer service rather than also attempting to refer products to them as well. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and my coworkers.

good,A typical day at work with Wachovia consisted of working on various teams as either a Staff or Lead auditor. Each audit lasted anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks. Management was very supportive of issues that were uncovered during reviews. The hardest part of my job was obtaining information from business partners that did not want to disclose issues. The most enjoyable part of my job was traveling with team members.

I performed outbound calls to customers in America who've applied for home mortgages,or home loans as a normal employee, and I've got benefits as a normal employee, and my life since Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is has been a success in college, and my life."
good,"Company has a lot to offer.  But it starts with you.  If you're motivated and willing to learn and grow, this is a great place to work.  Everyone supports one another and the whole team works together as a whole.  If you're a team player, there's no reason why you wouldn't like it here."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"great benefits, good environment. Improve needed: Management. Branch Managers aren't coach as much as team branch members. District Managers need assistant to follow up on coaching Branching Managers. Bad management create discrimination."
good,No matter the branch that I worked at(I worked at 3) it is very prominent in the business that management makes sure it is known that customers are the center of everything we do & anything we do is for their financial success
good,You meet so many amazing people and leadership. There are some bad apples but overall the leadership is willing to work with you and help you grow. They really want you to succeed

good,I am so glad to be able to work for one of the best financials institutions. Wells Fargo give me the opportunity to buy my first  home and help me with scholar ships to put my kids on college.
good,"Working at Wells Fargo as an Equipment Operator/Lockbox service was great, only bad thing is that you're always on your feet, sorting out letters making sure they go to the correct place. If you are looking to go into Equipment Operator its great!"
good,I've learned a lot about this company within the years of working there. Very family and community oriented. I love that the company makes sure the employee's are taken care of and listen to employee's inquiries and take suggestions into consideration.
good,"The people at Wells are phenomenal - I really enjoyed my team a lot just didn't love the work I was doing and the hours were brutal. Overall, if Wells had a role for me in the location I want to be in - I would 100% stay with Wells."
good,The only bad thing I would say is the location company as a whole is Great looking to go back miss the company benefits in community service five star

good,It was an amazing company to work for. I would recommend working for the company. They offer great coaching and the management is always so supportive. The bankers are great too.
good,"Everyone is nice and greets everyone with warm attitude. On busy days, tellers do get busy certain weeks of the month and rather than idle around and observe, our branch managers happily comes on and assists and helps us. They have no problem jumping on teller stations on busy days and logs on to help with the long lines of customers waiting to be assisted. Even bankers will come to teller side and help us as much as we needed if they're not busy with their banker sides."
good,"If you want somewhere to come to work and just have to hit your numbers by following procedures this is perfect for you. Room to learn a lot of financial info, not really for growth within."
good,"The company has experienced quiet a bit of change from when I started with them back in 1993. I gained a great deal of confidence of the 26yrs of employment as I had daily one on one interaction with customers. In addition, the financial skillset will benefit me both in my professional and personal life. The level of training that the company provides will ensure that you're more than prepared for your position."

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,i really loved working here for 6 years and i hope to come back one day! this company really taught me a lot in life and i also met a lot of wonderful people in those 6 years.
good,"I joined Wells Fargo right out of the military and I could not have asked for a better employer. I love my branch and my team; it really does have a familial feel to it. The day to day isn't bad and most of the time it is an enjoyable place to work. You do get some unruly customers but it is to be expected when you deal with their money. There are several Line of Businesses (LOB) to get into, retail/community banking is where most start as tellers or bankers, if you have previous sales experience. Promotion and advancement is nearly guaranteed if you aren't an idiot and can function on your own. However, if you are looking to move out of your (LOB) it can become a little challenging. Overall though it is a great place to work I feel. Health and dental benefits are affordable especially if it is just you or you and a spouse. With kids it does get a little pricey especially on a teller or banker salary."
good,Well Fargo is really a very great place to work and it’s a team environment where your manager or co worker is ready to assist or help with any fit of difficulty you may be experiencing.
good,"Being able to help customers out daily really is something that enjoy, given that I come from a car dealership and they weren’t always the most trustworthy. Everything about this job is great, the only thing that I wish could change is the pay, I don’t believe we should get a crazy raise but something more often and more than we’re getting paid right now. Because even though it is an easier job than others, the things that we have to do on the daily basis, don’t reflect our pay"
good,My branch is a great example of diversity..we work as a team and accomplish more than expected..we come from different race different countries but we respect each other and provide world class service to every customer.. with great smile and warm welcome.. I learn everyday and enchance  my skill .. to become a better person ..with great responsibility of a company
good,Very team oriented. Management was great - did not micro-manage. Loved working there. Took over book of business that hadn't been serviced in some time - was able to connect and satisfy clients and bring in more assets.

good,"Great benefits, great people, always working toward advancement. If you are wanting to move up, or look for a new position, managers are always wanting you to succeed"
good,"Wells Fargo has been a tremendous place to learn and grow.  I would not have stayed with the same organization for 23 years if it had not been such a great place filled with great people.  On the flip side, the company is going through a lot of change, which will be good in the long run.  As a senior leader, I always told team members that there are three keys to success at Wells Fargo:"

good,Wells Fargo cares for its customers and always does what is right for them. It has long history of living up to its values and great culture. team members are values with great importance and it is a company that you wish to be associated it.
good,Terrific organization to work for that provides a great balance for life.  Tremendous leadership and the opportunity to help both team members and customers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I took advantage of the on-site gym. Could go at lunch, so managers were flexible and understanding about that.  Ended up not having enough business when I stated, so we were transferred to another department instead of displaced."
good,There is no place like Wells Fargo Advisors. I’ve worked at various organizations and haven’t seen the level of professionalism that I have at Wells. The culture there is peerless.  Hard to be promoted unless you obtain a license.
good,Management is amazing. They really look out for you here. They hire within and will help you accomplish your goal of a certain position that you want to achieve.

good,"great place to work, learned and molded into a financial novice consultant. was able to promote multiple times due to opportunities created and offered."
good,The most enjoyable part of my position is the people on my team. There is such a strong work ethic and team support like nothing I've ever experienced. Everyone is always there to help whenever needed.
good,I really enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. I loved the work environment and the people there. But being a sales assistant wasn't my career goal. So I left the position for a higher paying job on base.
good,"Working with Wells Fargo as a compliance specialist was excillerating. The job required us to form summaries and reports about the customers of Wells Fargo and the customers of the customers. The information included reports about offshore banking, fraudelent activity, financing terrorist or political bribing. Although the reports weren't dedicated to finding such activity  it kept us motivated on doing the reports knowing that we could stop any illicit activity that could affect the bank or the clients. Asides from all the hardwork and catching illicit activity, another factor that kept us motivated was the teamwork. The management would group us in different teams every two weeks or more. In this time we got to work with different coworkers and learn more from their areas of expertise. We would also go to charity events as a team . Working together created a fun environment ."
good,"I recommend to work in this company very good benefits, good pay and there are many opportunities to get promoted in different positions inside the company."
good,"Love the company but need  more family time. Am looking for part time, but WF has great career opportunities and wonderful training to get you to the next level you want"
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. They have great benefits and very caring supervisors. We did alot of team building and competitive things. Quality is a number 1 priority to Wells as it should be.
good,I first started with Wachovia and was very happy with the bank and culture. Once the bank was acquired by Wells Fargo it was a little bit of a learning curve. The two cultures were totally different. Wells Fargo had the bankers push products onto the customers that they really did not need.
good,"Overall, Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. The pay is alright, but the benefits are remarkable. There is seriously a lot of bonus that comes with working for this company. I had a wonderful experience with my immediate team and the surrounding teams in the area. It really felt like family at the branch I work at. The training is also spot on and they make sure they prepare you well."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,They offer great training that really prepares you for the job. There are plenty of opportunities to move up in the company as well as excellent compensation opportunities. They are a customer service driven company.
good,Great place to work - position was terminated and moved.  Helped employees with benefits packages and payroll questions and concerns. Regular 1st shift hours.
good,Good place to work. I love the benefits they offer and the hours are extremely flexible. They offer a lot of paid time off and if you run out of hours you could always trade shifts with others to get a day off that you absolutely need.
good,Wells Fargo was a fair company to work for. The employees and management were enjoyable. I looked forward  to going to work as a result. I learned how to deal with many types of customers and to be able to communicate effectively. The hours were great no weekends. The hardest part of the job was learning a lot of new collections systems. The most enjoyable part of the joy was the many pot lucks we had and contest.
good,When I worked there over 15 years ago. It was  a great place to work.  They provided benefits and weekends off.  Managers could sometimes be a problem though.
good,Great work environment everyone is nice if your smart you can advance to a higher position just need to be working there for quite a while .. management needs to be more helpful they want you to learn right away when they put you in floor that’s the only bad thing some favoritism... and some managers need to learn how to treat employees in front of customers
good,"good place to work."
good,"This has been one of the greatest companies I have worked for. They are a big proponent for Diversity and Inclusion. I have worked here for 4 years and I have had the opportunity to advance my career in 3 different roles. Starting as a Personal Banker> Business Banker> Now a Financial Advisor. A company that believs in your personal and professional development. "
good,"I was part of a 200 person nation-wide sales force.  Every day I got to do what I really enjoy - helping small business owners protect and streamline their business. I was able to partner with representatives from several levels of the bank in order to reach out to their assigned business banking customers to discuss directly with the customer their needs and identify opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce risk.  This partnering activity was done remotely, and face-to-face with both the referring banker and the business banking customer.  I learned over the years that almost every business owner has an interesting story about how they started and continue to manage their business.  I was very lucky to work with several excellent leaders within our group over my 15 year tenure. These leaders had a great handle on balancing professionalism and team development, and were great to work for.  I was part of a local team of 10 sales consultants that were very focused on achieving their individual goals in support of the success of the team as a whole.  The biggest challenge I faced in my role was that I wasn’t always able to get to the customer before they suffered losses/penalties from agencies like the IRS.  The most enjoyable part of my role was when my prospect, through a detailed discussion of their needs, came to an understanding that our services would help them protect their business."
good,"Loved working there, our team was like a family. Other than the pushy sales it was an overall great experience. I  went from teller to banker in 6 months."

good,"I am currently the top producer in my site, yet the lowest paid closer. "
good,A typical day for me is meeting and engaging with our internal customers to determine ways to improve processes and procedures within the company. The culture is family oriented and collaborative. The most enjoyable thing about Wells Fargo is the abundant ways to self develop my career aspirations.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great company, sorry they have such bad press, because the individuals in the branches was awesome. I think their new customer service guidelines for the tellers is pretty contradicting and the observations are pretty silly, and the work books you have to do daily or weekly are stupid majority of everyone fake information. It’s silly. Like school work at work. How old are we? "
good,"I enjoyed my time at WF Corporate. Good pay, benefits and company culture. Leadership was solid. Great opportunity for growth. Most leaders are approachable, but there are some basic office politics."

good,This job was one of my favorites. There are plenty of opportunities and career planning assistance. You get hands on training and upper level management always willing to assist.
good,"I left the company for my own purposes, but it is a great company to work for after the policy changed. Only as stressful as customers make it, but there is a serious matter to finances. The company is open to innovative suggestions for change and known for team building activities to alleviate stress associated with the nature of the positions. It is an all day type of job, but it makes up for having Sundays and holidays off."
good,I really enjoyed working for Wells it was life changing experience for me. I was able to learn and grow both as a person and employee. Never having any financial or corporate experience prior I feel like the company really focuses on growth and development of their employee's with both internal education opportunity' s and college. In addition to this their volunteer platform is amazon they have contracts with so many campaniles. As an employee you get a wide range of volunteer options from local to country wide. It really opens your eyes to other things going on out there in the world. You cant help but be curious and ask questions about different business and fields.

I enjoy meeting goals I set for myself.
good,"Working for Wells Fargo was an amazing experience, I grew so much in the 2 years I was with them.

They are true to their values and they actually care about their customers and their employees. The pay and benefits was excellent and there was unlimited opportunity for growth and career advancement. It was really just a matter of deciding if call center work is where you see yourself long-term or not. Other than that, it was an incredible experience with a great company! Definitely recommend working with them."
good,"Wells Fargo really cares for their employees and customers.  They go out of their way to provide the most competitive salary and benefits in your area. I only rated the compensation/benefits lower because of this years deductibles and copays on top of the monthly payment that comes out of our paychecks. Health insurance is truly not affordable for me at this time. The training is phenomenal and they really try to create an atmosphere of caring. I'd love to work here forever however, my position has been filled due to my FMLA."
good,Working at Wells Fargo was exciting and very challenging. My coworkers really made the place a joy to work at. The management was great and they worked hard at improving the work environment.
good,I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo Bank because it has a wonderful working team everyone has a chance to shine.   The teams for sales are always put together with seasoned sales associates and new sales associates.   I love when you hit your sales target that all know that you won a trip to the Wells Ware and they have a million items that are special and very much desired and ware to work.
good,Great for people just starting in the industry. I fear they will provide less jobs in the future and there will be less room to grow. Fun and inviting culture that makes you want to be your best self.
good,Reviewed and decisioned FHA and VA loans.Worked on loans in all the 50 united states and US Virgin Islands.  Trained other new underwriters the Wells Fargo system.

From the first day, I have felt like a part of the team and have been given opportunities to distinguish myself as a leader and work toward my future career goals."

Management and Wells Fargo as a company, encourages its employees to seek career advancement, and provides the opportunity, resource and environment for career advancement. As a Mediation Consultant, I was able to represent Wells Fargo and its partners in various mediation settings in order to meet the needs of the investors, as well as providing homeowners alternatives to saving their homes. This position was challenging, frustrating and fulfilling. With the exception of my time in the Navy, this was one my best jobs."
good,"I love my job and team. Not thrilled about how far it is from my home, but it is a great company to work for and it has so many opportunities, there is a lot of room for you to grow and move up in the company. i started out as a pb1 (phone banker) and in less than 6 months got promoted to pb2."

good,"Great place to work, but my manager was gone fro 5 months when I first started.  I had no leadership in my department during that time and the team I was assigned too had to grasp the self starter role quickly or get left behind. As a result our team was voted the best team on several different occasions.  I applied for a transfer to a higher level position and lost out on it because my calls were a little under par.  I found this out after the internal interview, but I was not sure where they were coming from since after 5 months on the job I had never had a call review.  I had a discussion with the hiring manager for the position and he said he was ready to make me an offer until the results of my call issues came up."

good,"Wells Fargo - Wealth Management, San Diego was an excellent place for a banking career as an underwriter.  Hours were flexible.

I believe their efforts are meeting with success."
good,"management is very supportive with job learning and advancement. The company overall always treated terrifically.  My last position with WF was with Wells Fargo Dealer Services and it was I have to say a dream job, from management to my entire team and everyone I serviced."
good,Working with Wells Fargo has taught me a lot. It was my career job at one point. My coworkers made coming to work every morning the greatest gift i could have received. I LOVED every branch iv'e ever worked in. I LOVED every lesson i was taught and ever reward i gave received. I have molded myself into this new and improved women working with them and if i was still there i would still LOVE everything all the same.
good,"Wells Fargo was a great place to work. The team members that I worked with were very nice, hardworking and great to be around. The pay was great for a part time job and I even got health benefits. My job was not easy per se, but it was not stressful at all. If you needed help or had questions, someone was always there to show you or point you in the right direction. The culture was extremely exclusive and progressive; I felt very proud to be a part of a company like that. There was no hard part of my job, but I was not in sales. I heard that the sales quota were very hard to hit."

good,My day consisted of helping customers with daily transaction. All of my co-workers were very down to earth and willing to help whenever needed. I enjoyed working there.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work. They give you plenty of time off you get to use as soon as you are out of training. Paid holidays, Paid volunteer time, and some flex holidays. The training is adequate, the virtual training definitely does not cover near all the things you need to know. But, they are always sending you to classes and seminars in order to better your self."
good,I enjoyed  my time working for wells. Everyone was very nice and I still keep in contact with some of my co workers to this day. Would the opportunity to go if available.
good,"Spent most of my day submitting files, collecting information form clients, answering phones and reviewing files with underwriter for approval. I enjoyed working with others and problem solving . The hardest part was maintaining 150 files when we are only suppose to have 30 to maintain good customer service."
good,"I would go in early to get my drawer out and my station ready before branch opened. I  would help the customers throughout the day and try to upsell them on accounts or our different options we had. I enjoyed working with many of my co workers. Some co workers would ""milk"" there job counting money or something while I was working in the drive thru. It would make the drive thru back up because we would have two lanes opened and the lead teller would be ""milking"" whatever she had to do. It didn't happen at every branch I worked at. Just some. I loved working with the customers. I had some customers who would not go to anyone, but me. They would wait till I was open and then I'd know exactly what they wanted every time. I had a pretty good following of customers at each branch I'd work at. I am very polite to each and every customer and do what ever I can if I am able when they ask me to.I believe in going out of my way for a customer and make there experience great."
good,This job has been great for me has taught me a lot about myself and how to better my work Technic to be more productive and self aware. We assist our customers with excitement  and cheerfulness.

good,opportunity to expand career and with multiple opportunities.  company is very good at community activities and support of all communities to enhance both employee and community.
good,"Depends on the manager that you have but overall, working for Wells is amazing. The best benefits I've ever seen or heard of, great work from home life balance, upper management either really cares about its employees or its public view, either way, we were recently granted two extra personal vacation days ""just because""! Job security is top notch although as of the last month, they have publicly announced downsizing so be cautious of the group you are applying to (go for revenue making)."
good,If you are considering working for Wells Fargo i strongly recommend it. Great pay for people just coming into the industry and plenty of career advancements
good,I worked as a teller for over 2 years at a very relaxed bank location with mostly regulars for customers. My team became my friends and it was an incredible experience.

My most enjoyable part of the job was my team and I was able to learn a lot about overcoming problems and being an effective leader.

good,Wells Fargo truly cares for its employees.  They spend a lot of time focusing on personal development and training.  Even though its a company that employs so many people you never feel like just a number!
good,"Don't let recent media coverage fool you. Prior to October 2016, Wells Fargo was indeed a stressful place to work. Focus on sales was ridiculously high and it created an uncomfortable culture. With recent changes in management and direction though, everything truly has changed. I'd still be working at Wells Fargo if I hadn't moved to a different state without  any nearby branches."
good,"The only people I ever had a problem with as WFB were fired for their poor behavior or management skills. "
good,"Selling to clients is enjoyable when their needs are presented. This leads to educating potential clients about the products we offer to meet their needs and helping them select the appropriate products."
good,"I loved working for this company , and I plan to return ! I worked for banker connection , and it was by far the best job I have ever had ! They are friendly and diverse !"

good,Wells Fargo Advisors has a great culture and the company works hard to excel in the community. It is a 40hr work week with great benefits including paid time off for vacations or sick time and paid holidays.
good,"Wells Fargo cares about their employees, the start off pay is $15, and us generous with raises, perks like free checking accounts, offer free stocks. It's been such a blessing working for Wells, the only downfall would be that the manager of this particular branch is rude and treats you like a child. Theres also so much gossip my ears could bleed. The other branch I've worked for and other stores I've seen were definitely not like this one. Too much drama and lack of respect at the Rio Hondo Branch!"

good,"Great people, great pay, and hour lunch . Just didn’t like all the money I had to deal with. Was scary. Didn’t like how If one person was short. We had to stay"

good,"Wells has a great ""team first"" attitude. They really take care of their employees and make customer service an easy thing to provide. Management is almost always very capable and very good at managing their team."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo. They helped me pay for my education and allowed me to obtain my Bachelor's Degree. They match 401K contributions up to 6% which is great too. Coworkers were always helpful and friendly. Within community banking there is a lot of possibilities of upward movement, but once you become a manager its really difficult to move higher. I would've loved to stay with the company, but the times I have tried to use my degree to get an analyst or accounting internship I was not even looked at when I submitted as an internal member, but when I submitted my information as an external I did receive follow-up instructions. It was very disheartening that they don't look within when they are helping so many team members get an education."
good,I enjoyed working along side my co workers we all became family and still speak to this day. Over all the people you work along side really make the job worth going to everyday

good,I enjoyed my time at Wells. I worked outside of the banking institution. They relocated my office to South Carolina which is the only reason that I left.
good,I worked on an auto-dialer which I loved all day. It pretty much kept me on my toes and kept me busy. The day would go by so fast. We would occasionally have our slow days but most of the time we were busy.
good,"We work on a individual production basis with different types of managers within our team. We have a easy going environment that is not micromanaged. As long as our work is completed to standards, on my team we are able to work at our own pace. "
good,"A typical day at work was enjoyable and management was always trying to improve their employees. They would stand behind you and review your conversation you had with a customer and ask ""What could you have done better?"" It was sometimes a struggle to constantly have to state what you could've done better instead of being told that you did great, but at the end you definitely learned what you could work on. When it was slow, we grew onto each other and it felt like family, because we honestly spent more time with each other than with our own families. The hardest part of the job I'd say would be the constant eyes of management reviewing us with our customers as if they didn't trust us with their customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the customers financially. I really do enjoy the happiness in the customers eyes when told that they qualify for this free account for their child, or that they qualify to get reviewed for receiving a credit card."
good,"I am a temporary employee but just got offered a permanent position making 50% more/hour more so stoked! I will still be working under the same management and I would consider them to be good management. They are available, follow-up most of the time and easy to talk to. There are many opportunities for growth and advancement!"
good,"My typical day at work was everchanging."
good,"The work environment was challenging and exciting on a daily basis. There were always opportunities to learn and improve skills and grow within the company. There was an open door policy with management and treatment was fair and just. The only downside was when the team I worked for was displaced, but there was no fault placed and I had no regrets working for this corporation."

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Teller Manager	"

good,The data entry specialist postion at Wells Fargo is a very good place to jumpstart your career if data entry is what you want to do.  It's very laid back and the staff is very friendly.
good,"Not a perfect place, but better than some employers.  There are great leaders to help you succeed.  Too many departments to cover all the differences, but you can move up with hard work."
good,Very Supportive local management!  Stood as a barrier against the machine!  Made reaching goals fun and was willing to pitch in whenever needed.  Much appreciated!

good,"Expect to handle a steady stream of customer transactions."
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo entailed usually 4 - 5 meetings a day to review project status and next actions with CTO's and their team. I also had the opportunity to work on the Data Analytics portion of this project which allowed me to enhance my Office Application skills i.e. in dept Excel Spread Sheets to show project status. The position I hold at Wells Fargo is a Contractor Remote Employee. The team I have been fortunate enough to work on is tremendous, if help is needed to address a situation everyone will jump in and help without any hesitation."
good,"The branch I worked at was cozy. All of the employees were amazing, however the management seemed to be less than great. There was never a sincere care from the general manager as well as the store manager."
good,Great place to learn and career advancement with in the company. Daily training and meeting making sure goals are met. Offers great benefits. Long term goals.
good,"Helped meet customers financial needs,"
good,They start you out with a really good base pay for a starting out job. You do have to have 1+ years of customer service and sales experience in order to get a job here.
good,I was able to overcome my fear of educating/ informing customers about anything they were offered on their accounts. Also learn empathy which help me with all my future jobs.
good,"good teams, well put together trainings ,equal chance to advance your career, great leaders and team members to learn from,  great benefits, a great help when unexpected things happen to team members"

The paid time off and holiday package is amazing and we have the best health benefits I have ever received from a job."

good,"Wells Fargo is a fabulous company to work for, they really take care of you and always want to know what they can do to improve your work experience. They encourage advancement and are extremely customer service oriented."

Along with helping customers be successful you actually feel like you are helping them vs how it use to be with sales pressure.

Some regular Customers prefer to wait for certain tellers/bankers because they feel better working with them; which is a feel good for everyone because we know we are helping people and gaining their trust and respect was important to us. You learn something new each day, from transactions to even policy and new documents that you didn't know before. Management differs from each branch depending on how busy or what type of management works with the team at each branch. The company is a very diverse company and they have many events that celebrate each culture; which are a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job is that you need to be on your feet for a long time if you are at a busy branch. You can sit down, but it really affects your job by slowing you down and it's just more comfortable standing up and being eye to eye with the customers, they will appreciate it too. The most enjoyable part is that all teammates get along super well, and you always have a fun day at work."

Also learned how to send money internationally, and deal with business deposit accounts. Management was great, they treat the employees well. Time off was generous, and benefits were fair."
good,"The bureaucracy of the world of finance is very complex with many small, specialized departments. For my role, I had to learn about how the company is structured and how it has to abide by rules set by the Federal Reserve in order to adequately manage risk. My role was brand new so there wasn't any precedent to go by but the other members of my team were very helpful with explanations and sharing resources."
good,This was by far a pretty good place to work. Management was very fun and it was competitive. The pay was well and the job was not very hard. It is a call center but doesn't feel like one. There's a ton of room for advancement and encouragement to move up in the company.

There is of course a lot of regulations and rules to follow, but it is a bank so that is to be expected. The only issue I had was the short lunch, 30 mins was barely enough time."

I learned that it's necessary to be flexible due to policies being changed and updated, while at times, all affected by the change were not made aware.  This, of course, caused a lot of confusion and required patience and follow up.  That was the hardest part of the job due to the constant updates and all being affected by the updates not being made aware.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers and learning how they effectively deal with the processors and policy changes."

You need to be able to row with change.  This company is huge and there are changes everyday, from the person or people you contact/work with to processes or systems you need to use to accomplish your work.  In general, people are pleasant, helpful and nice.  Now you have to remember you are working with people across the country and even though we speak the same language we sometimes interpret things said in different ways.  This can cause issues; be sure, as best you can, that everyone is on the same page."

I prefer the night shift and have done it for 12 plus years so I m able to coordinate my off time to cater to my two sons and their busy schedules. My shift starts and ends in the data center where my focus is on the nightly batch jobs, change managements, and system maintenances / upgrdes. I have learned how to motivate each one individually and to utilize their strengths accordingly The hardest part of my job is also the most enjoyable as well, and this where I do not have available to me and my team, the resources available during normal business hours. We have to analyze or troubleshoot in house.  "

good,·	My position is to take calls and give service to the Wells Fargo website. Help customers retrieve password and/or username. Answer general banking account questions; refer to sales for products and services.
good,"I found this place to be an awesome place to work.  From the day I walked in the door, I felt welcomed.  Everyday was exactly the same for the most part.  It was very goal orientated.  We were on a strict timeframe to get tasks accomplished.  I learned so much working for a brokerage firm.  I walked in with very little experience and walked out a better employee and person because of my time spent there.  The management there was very demanding.  This was great for me.  I knew exactly what was expected from me on a minute to minute basis.  The branch manager had total control over the office which kept it running like an oiled machine.  He never showed favoritism and made everyone feel valued regardless of your job,  This is where I first leaned to not let my title define my role within the firm. I was hired as a receptionist and quickly worked my way into the role of operational specialist. I was hired to answer phones and within weeks became a total functioning operational employee. I found the most difficult part of the job was learning the brokerage firm lingo.  It took some time for me to learn all of the terminology.  By the time I departed they offered to sponsor me to get my series 7 license.  I was very proud of myself for this. The issue turned out to be the lack of internal job movement for my department. I would have loved to stay there.  Unfortunately I made the error of taking the job for the law firm where I was offered much more money.  What I learned from this is that being happy at a job was more important than financial stability.  I enjoyed everyone I worked"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The best people to work with, enjoyed coming to work everyday. Flexable schedules, great management, good self development course offered. Very little stress"
good,I learned to never give up at this company. The goals were high and never unattainable. I worked hard and most of the time was a gold setter. There were opportunities to become a personal banker which showed me there is potential growth with this company.
good,"A typical day at work for me includes speaking with almost everyone on the floor and receiving a smile and a friendly hello back. I get to work closely with a lot of people including management so much so,  that when I go home I refer my co-workers as my family. We work very hard and our management teams acknowledges this by recognizing us with weeks through out the year  designated to just appreciating us. The hardest part of my day is staying on track. We have worked very hard to build a culture that is productive and enjoyable. This was done by hiring great people. These great people are very encouraging and amazing and some times this can be distracting. The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to see these same amazing and great people every day of every work week."
good,Very productive and fast pace job! Managers are very understanding and thrive on pleasing all customers. Staying error free and is a goal that has to be set and accomplished but is very capable of doing. Leaving coworkers will be the most hardest part of leaving job.

good,"A typical day at work consists of taking anywhere from 30-50 inbound calls to help customers their day to day banking needs. I probe for financial goals and priorities to help determine which products and services would benefit the customer most weather for present or future needs.  I learned various ways to help reach my daily goals and continue to learn in order to stay a float.  The management at Wells Fargo from the lowest rank to the highest are all down to earth and are their to assist in which ever way they may be able to.  The co-workers are like my family, especially my teammates whom take pride in sharing ideas to help the team grow.  The hardest part of the job is making sure to stay focused and maintaining your numbers to reach your goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job I would say has to be in working with the greatest group of people who have each others backs and work with you and not against you.  We all work together in sharing our ideas and sales successes to help each other get better and make the team a stronger one striving to be on top of other teams.  However, I must say even though we have several individual teams within the company structure at the end of the day we are all one within Wells Fargo and are working to reach the same goal which is making Wells Fargo the number ""1"" in the financial industry."
good,"Great place to work with great benefits. The job was great and everyday I learned something new."

good,its a great place to work just high in sales make is hard it stresses you out aside from that i love it!I wish hours were not that late as well
good,"I liked the data entry, I enjoyed working as a team and independently. I got along with all of my co-workers. I wrote procedures, trained people, helped other departments, and just really enjoyed the challenges. The hardest part was probably not being able to specifically talk to customers as I was not in the customer service department but had to use databases to solve the problems for the customer service reps to explain to the customers."
good,Becoming a Marine was one of  the proudest accomplishments in my life. I loved working with my fellow Marines in all situations and made life long friends. We were all will to lay down our lives for each other and I have never experienced the friendships that I obtained in the Marine Corp.

good,"You have an opportunity to meet a lot of clients, and business owners. I've learned Wells Fargo policy and procedures. How to manage myself. Wells Fargo is a diverse company, with a lot of great employee's. The hardest part of my job is keeping to myself and not building a friendship with the customers, because they were all so friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was capable of offering my clients with outstanding Customer Service."
good,I have learned many things while working at Wells Fargo.  I do enjoy working at Wells Fargo but I am looking for something permanent.

good,the company appreciates you.  Your family matters.  Hours were flexible to meet the needs of young mothers. Vacation days were awesome.
good,As a teller your main job is to perform monetary transactions with good accuracy while searching for new products and accounts for costumers. It's a very sales driven atmosphere and the managers will get on your case a bit for low numbers. Performance is tracked through a quarter system and sales bonuses were given based on performance through the entire quarter. Low numbers can get you written up and/or fired but managers are helpful and want you to succeed.
good,"This company trains their employees how to deal with customers and situations. They have a great management team. "
good,"Every day started the same at 8am. Review any unfinished work from the previous day and continue working till 4:30 pm. The work included paying bills for trustees, entering data into a spreadsheet, and if you finished early, ask anyone if they need assistance. On down time you are allowed to volunteer for special projects, such as planning company events, create new ways to learn about diversity in the workplace, or decorate the office. The managers have an open door policy which ensured that everyones ideas had a chance to make some progress within the company. Most of the people I worked with, have been long time friends and occasionally hang out after work. This has been the most positive coworkers I have ever worked with, which only made me want to work harder. The hardest part about the job was that I would no longer be face to face with customers, that only meant that I had to work to the point of perfection since any issue would have to be handled over the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job was volunteering for the Diversity Club and leading it. I had a chance to teach my fellow coworkers about obscure history which seemed strange at first but when taken in as whole created a wonderful picture."
good,"Reviewing mortgage loan for accuracy and approving funds to be disbursed to escrow company."
good,"I liked working at Wells Fargo Bank. But as a drive thru teller I was only entitled to part time. Overall the company is great to work for if you like what you are doing.  The only one thing i hated is keeping up with ""referrals""  . Every day I had to pressure customers to apply for credit card, loans, savings accounts , online banking and stuff like that. I only was able to breath thankfully to clients who would order a new ATM card or credit cart replacement. Otherwise I am not a sales person, so it was stressful for me."

good,"Most days are filled with collections calls; some good, some bad.  I've learned a lot about how to talk to customers, as well as educate them so that they can learn what happens when they leave their bank accounts in the negative.  The management here is wonderful, and very supportive; as well as the team members.  The hardest part of the job for me is having to constantly be on the phone with my customers, instead of having some personal interaction with them while helping to resolve their debts.  The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely giving the customer a clearer understanding of what's going on with their account(s) and being able to resolve their issues."

My co-workers were a diversified and caring group that worked hard but were a lot of fun during leisure activities.

good,"A typical day of work consists of matching mortgage and deed of trusst that will be sent into a computer databse. I learned a lot about the use of specific programs. Mangement was easy going as long as we complete the targeted goals for the day. Co-workers were very supportive. The hardest part of the job was the early training, becuase our team was separated and had to get together to do training over over the phone while watching examples on the screen. The most enjoyable part of the job was the meeting of new friends."

good,There wasn't anything about this company I didn't like. Simple as that!
good,"Wells Fargo is an employee oriented company. Management truly cares for the development and productivity of its employees. In my experience thus far all the manager I have and had, are very much involved in helping their employees develop a job satisfaction and advance the latter in the company. Both the manager I had and currently have are focused on ""challenging"" me in my position and supportive in ""advancing"" my knowledge of the job as well as moving within the company.The company provides opportunities to give back to the community, classes and session for self improvement (professional and personal). MOST importantly beyond the collective appreciation, i like that there is an individual recognition of exceptional employees by management. I enjoy working for Wells Fargo. It is always important to work for a company that you see yourself professionally growing and advancing with in the future. I get that here."

good,"They put us through a 6 week training course, it was super intense. Then I took incoming calls from current customers as well as customers from one of our partners that we gave special discounts to depending on who they worked for, and that information was known by the phone number they called in on. I had some great memories, I set the record for the most applications in one day, back then it was 7! I was a temp the entire time I was there so I wasnt able to receive the bonus' and commisions."
good,"A typical day at work is one that starts out very welcoming by team members and myself. We take the time to ask how each others weekend went and what our personal plans are like for the day. The learning experience is one that goes a long way, you literally learn something new everyday. Team members are great about asking for help or offering their own help during down time. The hardest part of the day is completing all of the necessary paper work to maintain compliance with Wells Fargo IRT. The job is most enjoyable when we offer team building exercises, celebrate holidays that includes games and activities, and participating in staff meetings where team members are often recognized."

good,"A typical day at Wachovia Bank would be to arrive there at 7:30 each day in order to organize each task by highest importance to events of lesser importance. Within the 28 years I was at Wachovia, I learned a multitude of degrees of business performance but also that co-workers were of great value. The hardest part of any day was dealing with customers from foreign countries and the USA that were not particularly happy if a problem had occured in their shipments. The most enjoyable part of each and every day was knowing that when I went home that I had achieved the highest standard I had set out for myself that day, and that was giving my customers an excellent standard of service."

good,It's actually a very fast paced environment on most days. Every day is a challenge. Greeting customers and making them feel welcomed is the most enjoyable part of every day.

good,Interacting with customer every hour of the day -
good,I have learned how to provide great customer service to all my customers and how to work well as a team with my team members. I processed a number of transactions per hour for our customers while providing astounding customer service while discovering customer needs as well. I would cross sell products based on what the customer needed to succeed financially. My coworkers and managers all helped guide me to succeed as a teller. Most of the quarters I achieved Gold or Silver status in my sales goals as well as customer service. The hardest part of the job was attaining certain sales goals every quarter. I was self motivated and helped my fellow team members and myself to succeed in our goals. The most enjoyable part of this job was talking to my customers and team members on a daily basis. As far as the sales and customer service goals there were a lot of back shop operational duties to finish on a daily basis as well. This job helped me grow in my communication skills and team building skills as well as helping me become a leader.

Also a typical day includes supervising the teller line and assisting co-workers with completing tasks, and at the end of the day I make sure that all the daily reports have been done and completed properly. I have learned that people working together can get very far and that it strengthens relationships among co-workers which makes it a fun environment to work in. Honestly, I do not think there has been a part that is hard in my field of work, somehow things tend to resolve themselves in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job are both the co-workers I have met and gotten to know as well as the customers who I usually see in a daily basis."

good,"I can say that from the time that I was employed at Wachovia eeryone used to ask me, ""Why is eveyone so nice here?"" I would reply well its simply anytime you can speak to anyone from the CEO, District Manager to your direct supervisor and they always treat you with respect regardless of your situation then you should and will get a loyal dedicated worker as a result. It started from the beginning, Wachovia always made you feel as important as their business and that made the hardest days easy to get through willingly."

My coworkers have been pleasant, professional, and extremely supportive. The number one reason I've seen that people leave their position is because they get hired in a higher one, which is pretty remarkable. Unlike other big banks, the spotlight on Wells Fargo has allowed it to shift towards customer service instead of sales; as a teller, I am never expected to 'sell' anything to customers. Incentives are based on customer experience surveys."

I was paid 18.00 to start for entry level with experience vs most companies on average  for  this area starts between 12.00 and 15 per hour with experience. management is fair understanding and always actively involved in helping you to succeed. Another pro in my department of collections. There was unlimited overtime and about 5 different ways of achieving bonuses. my base 35,000 per year. but with bonuses and if your embrace working on average 45 hour work weeks then you are compensated around 40,000. gung ho best collectors average around 60,000 per year.

The team leads actually have a pretty thankless job and get criticism from the underwriters and upper management and I sure wouldn't want their job.  I did appreciate them.

good,"I worked at Wells Fargo Advisors at their headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri. Not being from St. Louis I was quite nervous in moving to the city and working for a new employer. I had a great experience overall and would instantly take another position at WFA. The only downside to WFA is that they do have a policy of not allowing one to move into a new role within the company unless they have first been in their current role for more than a year. While this policy is reasonable and logical overall, there are situations when extenuating circumstances should be considered. While Wells Fargo has received a considerable amount of bad publicity lately due to their sales mandates on their employees, I never once was put in a position to ""sell or be fired"" and never asked to do anything unethical or illegal. I held two positions at WFA, one in a call center proactively selling products and one in a consulting role working directly with financial advisors encouraging sales and production."

Like many in-store retail jobs, I was the face of the company, I was the first experience that my customer was going to have, and I was responsible for it in many ways. The initial interaction with my customer, from the greeting to the printing of the receipt, was crucial and personal.  What I said and how I delivered information could not only affect me but also any team members that became involved. Wells Fargo invested the time to give proper training and skills in order to do so. Weekly meetings were set to discuss what successes or areas of improvement that we came across.

Benefits are incredible, though salary is on the low side. Also, while growth is encouraged, it is often a slower process to move into positions that are not entry level. Competition is fierce. Better to get good experience at smaller bank then move into higher roles at Wells than to try to move up from within."

I learned so much about banking, products, loans.  I worked with branch personnel, back office personnel, customers from all over the country,  lawyers and title agencies.  The management throughout all my positions was great. But the ones over the loan processors was by far the best.  Never have any managers been more supportive of their team.  They always made sure the employees knew that family came first.  My co-workers were amazing people.  Three became the best friends I could ever ask for.  The hardest part of my job?

I organized my pipeline by urgency and date of closing and focused on my work all day (except for lunch of course). Also during the day, processors would often come to my desk and ask for help on my files and other underwriter's files. I always helped. Every once in a while an email or call would be received from an HMC (Loan Officer/Sales) or borrower regarding conditions I requested on a loan. I would always answer quickly and politely, as our customers were fellow Wells Fargo employees and had to be treated with special care. Every day or so I might have a question that I could not find in the guidelines and other underwriters could not answer and at that point, I would go to my manager and ask for assistance. He was always available to answer any questions."

good,"The training was good and when we were on the floor, we got a lot of tips and reminders from our team leader as well as our SME's. When it's time for monitoring our calls, I was always nervous but thankfully, I passed them all. When someone failed in the quality assurance, the team leader would share to us the mistake so we would avoid committing it again. The management responded to our needs or queries promptly. I liked their workplace culture because if our team leader and SME were busy with other agents, we could approach any other agent on the floor and they were all willing to help. The hardest part of the job was getting calls from irate customers who didn't want to accept the company's explanation and those who said foul words on the phone though they ended up understanding us eventually as I let them vent their frustrations. The most enjoyable part of the job was when everyone in the team passed all the monitored calls and Compliance and we got a treat from our team leader for pizzas ."

Wells Fargo offer constant training and updates as guideline and regulations changed. The site was eventually ramped down. Many of us were offer jobs at other sites and if we could not relocate we were given a pretty reasonable severance ( 3 months pay and bonus that we earned).

I am sure other individuals may have had a different experience and have developed a different opinion but I would work for this company again if the opportunity presented itself.

A full work day would involve arriving early to open the branch, following proper opening procedures, having a lunch break, if scheduled for my part-time hours, and working until close, in which proper closing procedure were performed, daily.  Under the guidance of excellent management and senior team members, I learned how to become the best part-time teller I could become until it was time for me to further my career at Wells Fargo.  The workplace culture was one of the most enjoyable parts of the job.  I relished in the team work and comradely amongst my fellow team members.  We all cared deeply about our job performance as a whole team and I always felt valued.  Unfortunately the hardest part of my job experience was having to resign at such an early stage of my Wells Fargo career and leave my team behind in order to care for a loved one who had become extremely ill and needed 100% of my time and devotion.  I did not want my team/branch to suffer on my behalf, therefore, ultimately made the decision to party ways for the time being. I still look forward to becoming part of the Wells Fargo family in the near future."

good,A typical day at wells fargo consisted of inbound calls and solving customer complaints. I learned the meaning of true compassion for customers. Management was always there to give either positive or negative feedback which helped me to improve my job skills. The hardest part of the job was trying to help an angry customer and no matter what I said or what I tried to make sure the customer would hang up happy was always upsetting.

good,"I absolutely loved working for wells Fargo. Jobs weren't always a breeze but if you're passionate enough to do the work and be an over achiever you will move up and succeed! I have always had managers coach me in the right direction and give me critical feedback on my performances. The blunt culture and expectations helped me grow. I had decided to stay at home with my sons, but as much as I love my sons quickly realized how much i missed working in the job I had. Currently looking to get back in as I was there about 5 years.

I worked at 3 different branches and happy to say that each branch was well organized and had great staff. Starting out, management was very helpful and informative. The management team gave great direction and answered each question I had for them. I learned the day-to-day routines and was also able to work outside of the branch to acquire new accounts. The highest peak of the job for me was to deal with the customers face-to-face and familiarize myself with them not only as customers but as local people.

The minute I interviewed I got a sense that the managers, teachers, and fellow CSR's were genuinely interested in my and in my personal success with the company. I do not regret a day that I worked there and it was one of the few positions I've held that I got out of bed ready and happy to go to work.

good,"Managing 30 team members"
good,"I would arrive at the branch at 7:00 a.m. each morning. After entering the branch, I would hurriedly start my computer and start scrolling through the previous days reported sales and see how my branch and team ranked up in the day, month-to-date, and quarter-to-date against the rest of the district. No later than 7:45 a.m. I had to get the team into my cubicle to begin the morning ""huddle."" The huddle mainly consisted of discussing how our store did that day and how many sales we had to make by friday to be on track for the month. Often, I would try and engage my team by asking the top sales performer what worked well. I would then ask the lowest performer, if they were substantially lower, what they felt they did right and what they felt they needed to improve on moving forward. I worked hard to avoid cut-throat sales tactics. I believe that a store can be incredibly successful and the work environment incredibly civil at the same time. Kindness towards your co-workers does not necessarily mean poor sales performance. In fact quite the opposite. In these huddles my team would often encourage a team member that was lagging in their sales goals and help coach them. In sales one persons success means everyone's success. The reasoning behind this is reputation. If you have a happy and healthy work environment people enjoy working there. If people enjoy working there they want to stay there because the like their job. If people like their  job and want to stay in their job they will work hard to keep their job. Because the people at the job are happy and work hard customers will"

Wells is all about the customer as well, we are reminded to be a positive experience for every customer every time they come in. If they have a bad day we try to make it a little better somehow. I've learned how to balance making a customer happy while still upholding Wells Fargo's policies and procedures which can be a challenge. Our managers are committed to coaching team members on service and sales as well as operations. If a team member is interested in advancing with Wells Fargo our managers do whatever they can to help them and prepare them. I've had several coworkers since I've been to several stores and for the most part everyone I've encountered has really been an asset to Wells Fargo in that they believe in helping customers succeed financially and they care about Wells Fargo succeeding as well. The hardest part of the job for me is trying to make sure the customer leaves happy without compromising any of Wells Fargo's policies and procedures. The part I most enjoy is my fellow team members and the rapport we build with our customers."

The most enjoyable part of the job was the predictable work schedule and the team work among the operators."

good,"The day starts with opening the bank. Opening the vaults and getting your drawer set up. Then you get to help customers with banking issues. Always looking to see what is best for the customer and upselling when needed. Lastly closing the bank, balancing and locking everything up safely and securely. I learned you can be successful at any level as long as you stay focused and always put 100 percent into your job. My management was great and we all worked togeather as a team. The most enjoyable part was the customers."
good,"A typical day at work involved learning about a career in sports sales. I learned how to make cold calls, use computer systems, and work with other professionals.

good,A typical day at work is a day where i can go into work and say goodmorning to everyone and have a fun supporting positive enviorment where I can work with a team that I can also call friends.
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo for almost five years and during that time I was promoted four times. That just goes to show that when you had the drive to move forward, the company supported that and helped you along your journey. Being an Assistant Manager for Wells Fargo is probably the most challenging position in the branch. Not only are you responsible for meeting your daily sales goals (which are the same goals as a Personal Banker), but you are also responsible for managing the sales team. It was a challenge everyday to juggle meeting customers, giving approvals on transactions, joining conference calls three times a day and also prospecting customers for business. The enjoyable part of working for the bank was the relationships and friendships that you build with your team. It offers a very inclusive environment, where everyone works together as a team."
good,Enjoyed working at Wachovia had great benefits and training
good,"This is over-all a great place to work. Professional environment, caring and supportive management staff, peers were always a pleasure to work with. The highest levels of service provided to the customers is the most enjoyable and important part of my job. The training and skills acquired were far more than I'd ever expect to gain within such a large corporation."
good,"If you like a fast paced job, a teller position at Wells Fargo Bank is the job for you. There is much room for advancement within the company as long as you have managers that are willing to train you."
good,"Processing transactions/referrals,"
good,"In the beginning of work each day, the management would start off by letting the team know how they did in the previous day concerning sales, who was doing great in selling and what we could improve on. Then they would get hyped up for the day and we would start taking customers transactions. From having to deal with the typical angry customer to the customers that made your day there, I was driven to sell and make an impression on all my customers and relate with them and bond with them. The shift (if full time) ended at 6 and we would pack up our things, count cash, get rid of vital data and lock up for the night. I learned how to be proactive in sales, how to go outside of my comfort zone in talking to people and getting them interested in our products and i learned how to manage my time and always be productive. My management was there to really lift me up whenever i was feeling down in the dumps and they really felt and made things seem like it was a family business. They were the best and always strive for us to do the best and pushed us past our limits. My co-workers never wished bad on you. They were always there to help and to always tell you how to get an edge within the company. I think the sales part of the job had to have been the most fun, because theres nothing like getting that new checking account or working with a customer for many months to come over and try our products, and they finally make that move. The thrill of getting a sale and being able to say that you contributed and that your making the company better is utterly amazing."
good,"I learned a lot about the banking system. I was able to handle many issues at the same time, this job helped me out to be a great person at my job and with my personal life as well."

Make sure we are prepared to assist customers when the Bank doors opens. We have a Great Team and all get along. Even when we are short staff, we find away to make it work so Customers don't feel the impact. Also, we joke and laugh a lot. As for the hardest part of the job can be at times , disrespectful and dificult customers. When that happens , i try ti find ways to empithyes and compliment them in some way to lighten the mood. The most enjoyable part of the job, is being able to help my Customers. I have had the oppertunity to meet some of the nicest people."
good,"My position was in back office. My day started out reviewing emails and my assigned cases, as well as my [ending cases for the day. I will make outboud calls to clients to discuss the details of their claim and I will make a decision, based on the facts, if the client will be reimbursed. I will also receive incoming calls from clients in reference to reimbursement of their claims. I will process necessary entries to reimburse clients. My goal was to mitigate the loss, by locking compromised accounts to prevent further loses, ensuring a new account is opened with appropriate cautionary comments. I perform searches on any possible suspects for any right of offsets. I would hotfile and close any accounts involved in the fraud and will mail a demand letter requesting restitution."

good,"working for this bank should me not only the work experience but should me responsiblity, and also showed me how to maintain a checking account, this bank i worked for almost 10 years before leaving and the only reason i left because they closed in 2005."
good,"It may seem overwhelming the amount of responsibilities you are entitled to. However, after a while it becomes second nature, I became very resourceful when it came to identifying counter-fit items, and learning about various techniques to combat fraud . I learned many things at Wells Fargo which gave me the opportunity to grow and become more responsible than i already was. One of the most challenging things was dealing with upset customers when i first started on the job, now with the skills i acquired I learned how to diffuse the situation. I enjoyed meeting new customers and make that customer relationship, to the point where customers wait for you in line. Making new friends and branch events are what also made the job fun."
good,"The management at Wells Fargo was great! The daily duty was to make sure the customers were happy with the terms of their mortgage and insure all paperwork as well as insurance was satisfying and complete with the homeowners. I learned a lot about mortgages so when buying my own home I was knowledgeable on the process. Team work was the best it took a team in order to make sure the paperwork were correct being that we each had different task to perform. The hardest part about the job was if a homeowner purchased their loan from another company and something was done incorrectly we were not able to assist to solve the issue. The most enjoyable part was my management, team and the serving the homeowners making them happy."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work with great people. Everyone cares about how you are and learning new skills is top priority.

good,I truly enjoyed working at this job. Everyone was very helpful and more than willing to support there employees.
good,"A typical day at work involved: setting up our cash drawers, helping customers make cash and electronic transactions, finding needs, and achieving sales goals. I've learned a lot about customer service, cash handling, bank policies and procedures. Management was always available for questions, concerns,and always were happy to help. The hardest part of the job would have to be balancing sales and helping customers fast and efficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be the joy of having a customer walk away happy, and keeping them coming back for years to come."

good,"Excellent company to work for, I throughly enjoyed my coworkers and management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexible schedule"
good,"My day begins with looking at the prior day stats for the team, then putting them on the board where it is visible to all the employees. I check my emails constantly since that is the easiest and fastest way of communication, i check for things such as meetings, appointments, call backs, interviews and any prior one on one with my team. Throughout the day I send out temp checks to make sure we are on pase for the our daily goals if not all associates are on pacce the leadership team and I get on the floor and do side by sides and one on one coaching. We tap into call to make sure they are following procedures and using the sales ethics we have in place. The most challenging part is when someone has an off day, when they are following all the procedures and sales techniques but the customer says not right now, thats something that we cannot cotrol sometimes. The most enjoyable part is of course when we have a successful day and everyone meets their goals or when we have team meetings and have a team builder to remember why we are such a great team and giving them time to re focus on whats important to us and just enjoying time with our team to have a mental break."
good,fun place to work and to get along with other co workers . great company to move up in . and they appreciated their employees

good,"Working at Wells Fargo was a rewarding experience. Daily I would problem solve, speek to individuals either on the phone, by fax or email. I performed loan payment, loan draws. Maintained files and updated as needed. My co-worker and I worked as a team and helped each other out as needed. The hardest part of the job sometime was dealing with a customer that didn't understand what was going on with a loan they were requesting and the payment process, principle vs interest. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as I enjoy working very much. I enjoyed meeting new people and helping to solve problems."
good,"It was a Monday thru Friday and occasional Saturdays. A customer service position, I had to educate customers and answer questions about their mortgage. Management cared about your work and provided the tools and training needed to perform your work. My hardest part of the work, is when a customer calls and tells me how they are not going to be able to pay their mortgage. I enjoyed taking a payment from a customer."
good,"An amazing company, truly deserving of all its praise. The managers truly care about the people they supervise and the company has a clear vision and value. There are few companies with so much pride in what they have, culture wise."

good,I would come into work early in the morning and the whole day would be sitting on a computer assigning myself stuff to look over and pretty much approve for the next level. If there was something wrong with the document first time I would mail out a letter and a copy of a blank document. If more I would forward it onto a different team to do a phone call out to client. The only hard part was when I started trying to learn the new material around me. The most enjoyable thing was having group get together and congratulating someone or doing our weekly potlucks.

My positions varied during the 30 yrs with managing branch offices as my most pleasant positions within the company. The training I received in sales was intense and allowed me to advance to sales positions that I would not have had without this. I formed many client relationships over the years that are still active to this day. My co-workers were some of the best that I have witnessed and I still continue them even after the 30 years. Management was eager to see you advance and taught the many skills I needed to accomplish this. The hardest part of the job was the final merger that we went through where the focus was on sales and not on forming workable relationships with clients."

The management was strict but that is great for when the going got tough and the economy was hitting a low. The hardest part of the job was gaining new customers especially because people are under the impression that they are just being sold ""products"" and not actual benefits.

I learned how to work with a team oriented atmosphere. The management is very supportive in every aspect. The best asset for the management is that they all possess human relation skills which is extremely important when dealing with employees and productivity. The hardest part of the job I say is dealing with clients that are not as punctual as you would like them to be and the most enjoyable part of the job is that we don't just treat each as a team but as a family.

This type of processing was different than my past processing experience because the modifications where to help those individuals that were loosing their properties to foreclosure. The hardest part of the job was when someone didn't qualify for the program because their income was too low due to too much debt. Everyone in the office treated each other with respect and help each other if need to. The most enjoyable part was when the client was approved and I called them to give them the good news.I learned a lot that people can work together and get along with each other my experience at Wachovia was a good family experience we all treated each other in a professional manner.

good,"All the bankers I supported, which was 34, all were investment bankers. I booked flights, hotel arrangements, arranged and scheduled meetings and luncheons (in town and out of town). The hardest part of the job was travel arrangements at some time. Bankers sometimes needed certain flights that were hard to get or were sold out. New York business trips requiring hotel accomodations could sometimes be very expensive depending on the events that were going on in New York at the time of travel, we had a ""cap"" we could not go over on spending unless approval from upper management and sometimes that would delay things."

good,"Each day was started with morning huddles, discussing each individuals peesonal planner of goals and how they were to be achieved daily, These goals were monitored throughout the day to ensure accuracy as well as profit to be reported to district managers on evening conference calls. My day also included to ensure that customers needs were being fulfilled by scheduling follow appointments via phone or in branch appointments. I had opened on an average of 6 new accounts daily and submitted credit applications as well as working with legal departments, audits and operating the store. Throughout the years with the company I had achieved much education and knowledge on cross selling, product knowledge as well as customer service, working with a team of bankers closely sharing daily as well as future goals along with each individuals strengths and weaknesses creating a close knit environment with the team. The hardest part of my job I would have to say was to have to assist with my clients in legalities of losing a loved one that had been my customer throughout the years. The most enjoyable part of my job I would have to say was making a difference in someone's life. I had been with families that I have seen grow successfully in they're finances as well as being considered a part of the family seeing parents send they're children off to college, marriage & the birth of a grandchild in they're lives.

When I was in corporate actions prior to going to administration, I was the Voluntary Corporate Actions and Proxy Supervisor, My friend and co-worker was the Manadatory and Class Action Supervisor. They had gotten a Manager for the unit. Well, my friend passed away at an early age, the Manager knew that another bank was taking over our division and went back to his old job. My manager was busy with the meetings for the deconversion. I was acting manager for Corporate Actions, proxies, class actions, and the notification project. I also had to have meetings to sort out the Class action project. Which was putting procedures in place and getting help for the individual who was processing them. I was also asked to Back up the Physical securites/Vault manager when she was out. I wore many hats and about 15 people would come to me with questions. I kept my manager informed on anything important. She trusted me to run the departments when she was not in.

good,"My day would start with returning and answering client calls and/or requests, monitoring and reconciling balances, reviewing overdrafts, accepting or sending wires, and just an overall account maintenance working with a team of advisors. There was never a dull moment because within the financial industry you always learned something new whether it was a problem with the system or just dealing with a different customer. Different events would come up on a daily basis because all of my clients were individually different. I am a people person, so I really enjoyed working with the clients. The hardest part of my job was when the customer wasn't happy about something that went wrong within our systems, whether a statement, tax problem, or investment issue, and of course I had to resolve all the issues so that they were happy."

good,"For Wells Fargo Bank being my first job that I had to meet sales goals, a typical day at work would be giving the best customer service on a daily basis. I would balance my cash drawer before and after my shift to ensure accurate balances. Sometimes it would be slow and other times it would be busy so i always had somethings to do like balance the vault, answer phones and work on new sales and referrals with the bankers. I learned a lot at this job in the banking industry and it made sales a second nature for me. I learned to set my personal goals and how to find ways to meet them. The management at this company was amazing and very helpful to me. They always made sure I learned something new everyday whether i was looking to stay long term with the company or not and most importantly they showed me team work. My co-workers and I would get along very well and would help each other with either angry customers or trying to close a sale. Although sales came easy to me, the hardest part would be trying to meet daily sales goals, but eventually i always caught up. As all my other jobs i really enjoy customer interaction."

I would have never left except the parent company was winding down our operation, our futures were uncertain, and, in this context, what appeared to be a better opportunity came along for me. Keep in mind this subsidiary of Wells Fargo ceased to exist circa 1994 and subsequently the parent company was acquired by and absorbed Norwest Bank which kept the iconic Wells Fargo name. So, it is a completely different company now. Who knows? It could even be better. I have been successful doing business with them since then."
