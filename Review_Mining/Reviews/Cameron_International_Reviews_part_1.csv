rating,review
bad,"Don't work there, if they don't like you they will just fire you right on the spot because they don't like you. So stay away it would be the best discussion you made"
bad,Was lied to on multiple accations and no assistance unless u fit into the clique. Was told I could work as many hrs as I wanted as long as the work was justified then got wrote up for working too many hrs
bad,Coworkers are friendly. Upper management has there own agenda. No room for advancement you’re hired on as a position and you will be stuck there permanently. Found that everything is kept top-secret until the very last minute.
bad,"One person would work eleven hours per day for eleven straight days with three days off. It was a lot of physical work. Lots of bending over, stooping, on knees."
bad,"No internet access for students.  "
bad,"This is a typical oil field job. They don't care about you or your family. It is either do the job when they say and how long they say for, or pack your bags!"
bad,great company with ok management. lot of long hours and the rotation sucks. 21/7 is all they offer and its not going to change no time soon. its good to go and make money then leave
bad,"welding all day. I worked long hours but did not mind it."
bad,"Cameron is a huge company and a very good company, I've been working in Cameron for few years and try to find some new challenge in new company and new technology"
bad,"I started with Cameron  & Company as an intern. They placed me at Vencor Pharmacy in Colton, CA. I did not enjoy my time there. The amount of work expected with the small staff I was given was impossible."
bad,"They use you to work long, hard hours and expect you to be happy about it. The safety department is constantly on your case and fire you for your first infraction and is unchecked themselves. If you voice your opinion, you're fired. They are mainly run by family members being promoted, even though they don't know how to do the job, and overlook everyone else, especially if you're not related."
bad,worst plant manager I ever worked for! The Iola plant manager did not know how to interact with anyone.
bad,"A very poor place to work, they tell you one thing and then do another. I was hired at a rate of 12.00hr however the catch was I was paid 24/7 or so HR claimed. When I arrived out in Minot ND I was told that I only received that pay when out on location flowing a live oil well. That never happened because there was no work out in that area for a new company. Basically put don't work for this company they are a rip off!!!"
bad,"If you are other then white, smart, hard worker, and follow all the rules. You are waisting your time working for Cameron. The port northwest location are not allowed to promote, transfere, any minority. If you interveiw there just look around. No minority managers, lead men or any in a leadership position. they have saftey guy which is black, i feel sorry for the guy. they disrespect him, they walk out the meetings. and if your black you dont have a chance."
bad,Hours are long. 330pm- 2am Mon-Fri. 12pm-8-pm Saturday and sometimes on Sunday.
bad,"Get ready to be overworked and get highly underpaid. This was probably one of the worst workplaces I have ever encountered in my life (answering emails 24/7, boss yelling and men hitting on you 24/7)."
bad,"Management lies to you in Minot, ND. They tell you one thing and do another, they will promise you one thing and then when you drive 10hrs to get there things change, they claim they didn't say this or that. Just come prepared to be disappointed... O and the best part HR will tell you that you get paid 24hrs a day 7 days a week, then when you get there they will tell you its only if your out on location, which is never because this company is just starting up in the flowback division, so then your stuck out there making 12.00hr sitten in a shop doing busy work!!! I was fired because I applied for another job with another company because there was no work..."
bad,"No room for improvement. Management clearly doesn’t care about your workplace happiness. "
bad,They operate without any concern for safety or employee well being. You work 100+ hours a week on location and no schedule so you can work on the road months at a time
bad,Be prepared to be treated poorly if you decide to come here. First shift has more priority than second shift does so therefore second shift is at the bottom of the barrel
bad,"poor management."
bad,"I signed a retention bonus saying I would stay in North Dakota working for them in return getting a $25,000 bonus. Ironically 1 month before my bonus was due they pulled it (right after they hired 6 new employees!) "
bad,Was lied to before I ever walked through the door. They have no work. You sit at home waiting for work. They took your salary away you were told you were going to have when you took the job. There never was a schedule they told you were going to have.
bad,"From the day I started with this company I was moved and shifted around. I was promised many things that didn't come to be. The problem is lack of management and organizational skills. I worked with many employees out of the corporate office and didn't have anywhere near the problems I had with this particular office. I am a business professional that had average expectations and to say the least, they were not met. I would not recommend working for this particular location to anyone for any type of inner office role."
bad,Cameron in Carmichaels is a bunch of gossipers who are more than willing to love you if you hangout and drink with the college looking boys. If you don't then your on your own. No jobs and yet they will promise you the world and you won't work . No sales people to obtain jobs and yet the one they have will lie to the end and say he has work in 2 weeks and then it will be pushed back for months at a time and you will work in wellhead or you get talked about and threatened to get wrote up. If I wanted wellhead then I would have hired on as wellhead not well testing.
bad,"I worked for Cameron Surface Systems in Altens, Aberdeen. This was truly the worst place I have ever worked. No set procedures, no SAP access, yard and workshop was an absolute mess, bullying was constant, direct and brutal, the list goes on. HR was literally non-existing. During my, thankfully short time at this base, several colleagues report the bullying tactics of management to HR, all of which fell on deaf ears."
bad,"Do not work for this company, corrupt management, constantly turning over employees in critical environments, bad ethics."
bad,"The office i work out of has very poor management. There is not enough work for everyone, and the work that we do get you have to be buddy-buddy with the managers of you sit at home. I was told that i would work for 3 weeks and 1 week off, so far its been more like work 1 week and 3 weeks off. i find it sad that I work for one of the top oilfield companies in the world and i cant afford to move in to a $500 a month appartment."
bad,A typical day at work consist of piles of folders with information that needed to be input in system. I learned that when working hard is the best thing to do The management was all over every week someone new came so I didn't know who was in charge. The hardest part of the job was end of month because the shop never had there information correct. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers.
bad,"Management is a joke. No home life for the people actually doing the work. Right now Cameron is just too big to fail right now. You better believe when they get some competition, they will get run right into the ground. Everybody there is just trying to get everything they can out of this place while very few actually care. Don't turn your back on anyone at this place."
bad,"cameron at the port of iberia is very unorganized!!! management is terrible, yard is horrible trash everywhere, shop bathroom is terrible. you never know how many hours you going to make, if there is a power outtage they make you use one of your own personal vacation days. penny raises once a year. i would not reccomend this job to anyone. TERRIBLE company. o and also the lowest paying company at the port of iberia."
bad,"Would not recommend anyone to apply for a job at Cameron a Schlumberger Company, on I-10 and Pederson Road in Katy Texas.. You never know the hours you will be working, plus it's a Union shop, take care of the lazy, and screw the good workers..."
bad,Management does not listen unless you are a consultant. Promotions are based on who you know and not what you know.
bad,"The work was great, co-workers fantastic. Immediate supervisor, horrible, had never been in the field before. Couldn't plan or schedule work. Work 60 hours one week then sent home for three weeks. Couldn't manage his people. If someone quit or was let go... the other half of that team was sent home as well. When you have good, responsible, reliable people working for you, you don't send them out the door. You should at least let them know they would be called back."
bad,"Cameron bought the smaller company I was working at, LeTourneau. To be fair, at the time of purchase, we were not doing really great but not dead either. As soon as they took over they started ""digesting us"" into Cameron, implementing their systems, policies, title rankings, etc etc... Interestingly, Cameron did not necessarily do the same with other companies it acquired. "
bad,"Management lacks direction and makes decisions without thinking of the consequences. This Calgary company is being managed out of Houston and and they do not understand the Canadian environment. Customers are often unhappy with the incompetence of some Cameron employees and it is embarrassing for the other Cameron professionals who pride themselves in their work. If you are competent, they overwork you; while the incompetent sit idle. I doubt that they will get many jobs in the future. They undervalue good employees."
bad,"long hours, favoritism with everything!!"
bad,"Following up with production and vendors for project status. learned SAP system"
bad,There's a lot of favoritism a lot of family members working that are in charge of the facility that make the rules as they go. Safety is always talking about being safe and working safe and being in a safe environment but are two safety personnel they are never walking around in the shop making sure that all the safety policies are being done.
bad,I worked contract in payroll tax. The Payroll Manager talked about  private HR issues regarding  my coworkers and  I reported it and told her she was wrong for discussing these issues. I left because of the Payroll Manager.
bad,"management is horrible, and people don't encourage or mentor you. If I even get a chance to work at Cameron, I don't know if want to go back or not. However, some guys are good, just like any other company."
bad,"The work was very fast paced, but the management was very unorganized. Most months went by flying by the seat of your pants, with very little to no future planning."
bad,"In the initial interview management glorifies the company and how the company sees its employees. They have opportunities for educational advancements and will cover the cost if successful. As a new employee they make you feel small and training is very poor in the assembly area anyways. They hire way to many employees and you learn very fast your only a number at this company. A lot of the time you would have 3 employees standing around you while you do your work, telling you other ways of doing it. Micro managed big time.  Lack of communication from management to employees on the floor. Very unhappy work environment. Pay is poor as well... I don't feel they listen to there employees concerns or are concerned in rectifying them. False hopes with positions and poorly led. No integrity and lack of professionalism. Felt confused and misled right from the start. If your a motivated individual that has goals set high and are ready to work hard to get them..... I recommend you truly evaluate your decision before making it. At least in the Assembly department. Your kept at a very slow idle."
bad,Worked there for 3 years felt like I was back in High School.Lack of respect and maturity among front staff and Co workers.Really surprised how un professional the branch was.Welcome to no life and forget your family only moved ahed if you where friends with the right people.I figured doing a good job and being honest would get you places not there.And for what the expected from you the wages where not even close to where they should be.And if you didn't work you day's off the would get mad and keep you from the field if they felt like it don't waste your time.  
bad,Worst management I've dealt with in a long time. When you think Cameron. You think top notch. Not at this location. Alot of accidents get brushed under the table. Inexperienced leadership. They take no suggestions. Their way or no way. Pretty sad. This place is extremely cheap.
bad,"Terrible management. Everyone's only intrest was getting out of work by putting it on someone else. You are always on call, there is no planning and everything is last minute. Equipment was decent but poorly maintained. This place killed your family life because of the poor management. Didn't need to be."
bad,Job was fast paced and I really enjoyed what I did. The management was not all that great. Field Employees were on an on call schedule so if you did not get along with management you received limited hours.Employees stayed at home unless you got called out and only got paid for hours called out. Work schedule was 7 on 3 off and management expected employees to work on days off.
bad,"Cameron was notorious for it's lack of progression plans for employees, often others who were qualified were passed over for ""older"" individuals who, admittedly, did not have the right qualities for key leadership positions. Racism ran rampant in one particular group, as well as ageism and sexism throughout the company."
bad,"Work long hours, management only support production, did not care about employees safety.  Did not practice what the corporate preached, but corporate did not practice safety either."
bad,"Pretty much all upper management and alot of employees are related.  Alot of favortism. Never-ending overtime!  Place is ok if u attended Oakride Schools in Muskegon Mi, thats all the supervisor brings in there."
bad,"It was a good place to learn but not a good place to work, promises were made and not kept.  i did work with a good group of people, i would not recommend for any one one to work for Cameron until there are some major changes in the front office"
bad,With the market down thing have changed dramatically. Management is terrible and the over moral of the building is not good. Many lay-offs and people quieting because of the lack of loyalty to employees.
bad,"Long hours,12hr days,  Very hard physical labor. 25% of your time will be assembly! the other 75% will be very hard and dirty disassembly of gate valves and sand blasting in sand blast room in the heat. Gate valves assemble very fast. It's the disassembly/ sandblast that takes a long time. Extremely greasy, dirty, oily. You will destroy your own work clothes. No raises. Many tools and equipment are broken and wore out. "
bad,to much favortism. people put in positions because of who they know not what they know. very inmature leadership.
bad,Possibly a good company for new hires but not for experienced hires. IT Management has no clue on how to manage experienced IT personnel. Company fosters a draconian abusive culture that inhibits professional growth and overloads IT staff to support multiple Enterprise applications without proper training. When I worked there management was running the show by the seat of their pants.....
bad,The merger with Schlumberger and downturn in the oil market took it's toll on Cameron.  Schlumberger came in and cleaned house like they always do.  Read the other reviews all true.
bad,"If you are looking for a career where you can be happy and stable with your life and your job, this is not the place for you. The corporate non-sense is overwhelming."
bad,Management was the worst with the exception of just a few managers. The employees were always insecure of their jobs and position within the company. The politics was horrible and you have a totally inept HR department which sides totally with management you have NO rights. No wonder they went under! All said they had some of the best and most devoted workers who tried to make it all work.
bad,If benefits is more important to you then this could be your ideal work place.  Compensation is low as compared to the average rate with a high potential to perform the task of 2-3 people.  Advancement and Growth opportunities are slime to none due their good old boy network within the Management Team.
bad,"Most co-workers competent, in depth background check. Long process to hire. Learned about wellhead valves. Work conditions outside harsh half year in ND cold, windy. Independence most enjoyable part of job."
bad,Good Looking Facility air conditioned shop..Production orientated shop..not quality minded.
bad,"It's great working here at the beginning, then they start showing favoritism between your race and gender. Kind of sad. Management lie to you constantly saying that they're going to resolve issues but never do. Some machinist slack and others have to pick up where they slacking having to do finish the previous shift work and do their own work. Some machinist try to purposely sabotage their coworkers."
bad,A Cameron e uma empresa que tem muito funcionário.
bad,Co -workers are great and caring. Company is working on innovation to keep up with the Industry.  Management is changing.
bad,"Surface division is the Most Hostile work environment I have ever encountered."
bad,"Aside from the excellent benefits, my time working for Cameron(Process Systems Division in Magnolia, TX) was completely miserable. I have worked in oil field related companies for the last 11 years and since working for Cameron I had never seen such an extreme disreguard for employee safety and morale. The management team in charge of the facility that I worked for was all about pushing for the dollar not matter what the cost to the well being of the employees preforming the job. "
bad,When I was here I worked constantly but the wages were so low that I honestly just feel like I waisted 2yrs of my life trying to move up a ladder without rungs. Works work though. Not sure how much people are working now adays in the branch of cameron i was working out from. I always felt like a second class citizen. In alot of ways your treated that way on the construction side of the industry no matter what your trade is. Construction is construction on land or offshore every job has an end and usually its in site. Not many long term gigs. Contracts are never forever. They generally always have a projected end date and that my friends in lies the problem. I would like a job that gives me a reason to believe that retirement is possible and maybe even a little nest egg that was built up by me little by little through a steady and continuos flow of paychecks that i earned from working steady. Third party contractors work from contract to contract job to job. No security no stability. Your not even promised to come back the following hitch after earned time off. If you think politics are bad on land... go offshore. They got guys that will figuratively speaking of course...Stab you in the back cut your throat and take food out of your starving babies mouth without batting an eye or giving you a reason for why they are even doing it. They don't have to tell me why I know. They don't care and what sad is they never will. If your not somebody your nobody in there eyes. My advice is to just win the lottery. Good Luck!!!!
bad,I did not receive the bonus i was promised when leavimg the project in Alexandra Egypt. I finished the fabrication and brought the original construcion manager to complete painting and shipping.
bad,"Typical day included getting told what to do. HR was incompetent,"
bad,I do not want to rate this company as they have been purchased by larger company.  I was required to work many  days for more than 14 hours a day and months without a day off.
bad,Terrible Management. Too many people telling you what to do.  There is no management system. You have to be in good or not good at all. You don't have just ONE supervisor.
bad,"Where margins are big.... sins abound.  The industry typically would throw money at problems instead of establishing standard work through documented policies, procedures, work instructions, training, and internal audit."
bad,"a typical day at work using cranes, forklifts, learning how to repair valves and building different types of well trees and equipment, management was pretty horrible it was all inside family, co-workers fun to work with, nothing was to hard when you got use to it, fun part coming in on a busy day to keep you occupied with work."
bad,Long hours. No time with family if your on night shift. Also they don't have a set schedule you could work 8-12 hours and not even know when. If you have a family matter other then a death you will end up being threatened with your job.
bad,"Great company to work for, but the work-life balance is horrible. Long hours/weekends and not enough staff to help balance it out. Other than that management is OK and has great Benefits"
bad,"Projects are challenging and interesting with offshore skids."
bad,"My boss was a really motional person. She was not fit for her position. Not sure how she could be a manager. Good salary and good benefit, just management was too young."
bad,"Cameron is an oil and energy flow equipment manufacturer with a dynamic culture and a great potential to continue its penetration of the oil and energy markets it serves. Finance mgmt is compulsive and lacks fundamental direction, the former is reflected in the high turnover of key financial positions experienced in the last two years"
bad,"It was a good place to work and good culture. many thing to learn and also supportive co workers. "
bad,Great Company. Management wasn't very good. Did not plan ahead. Was forced to take several weeks off. Great people. Great benefits. Upper Management was great.
good,"The poor ratings are due the immediate poor supervision and it political favoritism. The supervisors on the low end of the totem pole had their favorites that would get away with everything then made life difficult on the hands they did not favor. Upper management were down to earth and approachable but underhandedly influenced by shop supervision and lead men. Overall, it paid the bills with endless overtime."
good,Meh. I can't really explain it better than that. Long hours for little pay with very little to no raises and everyone with little to none experience who gets hired after you do will work less and make more because they're friends with managers.
good,Alright job i would not recommend nobody to work there if they want to move up and better your life. It is an unfair environment to work in which make you very frustrated.
good,"Not a place you will enjoy working at, low pay and poor training. The culture is broken due to a 97% turnover in their shop and seems likely to continue."
good,The supervisor works with my schedule. There are alternating weekends off. Overtime is provided when there is a high demand for the products. Great benefits.
good,"If the jobs would have lasted in this area this would be an enjoyable to work, grow and retire from. They would enable you to learn more and be certified in areas to move further in knowyand wages."
good,"On call 24/7, work 12 days on and 3 off, work around 100 hours a week"
good,"Good company, good benefits, good training but Company doesnt make eforts to keep their people or reassign them in the company....they prefer to just lay off and constantly hire new ones."
good,"available 24/7 to service oil and gas industry"
good,The relationship management and the common worker was very poor. I was able to sharpen my skills as a machinist in spite of programing issues that were so bad that I often times had to rewrite 80% of day to day program.
good,Activité soumis à la variations du prix du baril de pétrole.
good,place to work with full of fun with sufficient learning.very less mentors and SMEs especially in India. less job satisfaction.
good,"Esperienza estremamente positiva,  colleghi disponibili al cambiamento e grandi possibilità di sviluppare competenze su vari aspetti"
good,"Heavy manual labor some days ending with a detailed report to supervisors. Some days are just learning experiences where seasoned employees have the time to educate newer workers like myself on stages and processes in the Oilfield Industry."
good,"Cameron's executive leadership practices old school, don't rock the boat mentality. While they espouse creativity, innovation, collaboration, and integrity, they don't practice it and resist those who do."
good,"concurrence"
good,I work for one of the Cameron acquisitions. and Cameron has done a very poor job assimilating the facility into their corporate structure. After 2 1/2 years Many things are still left undone.
good,"The program is a great program, yet it is one of the worst schedules (depending on your location) in the oilfield and in pretty much every other industry as well. The pay is amazing but sometimes money isn't everything."
good,Cameron pays well but has a lot of layoffs. It also takes 3 years before you get 2 weeks vacation.
good,"did not like overnite hours, no heat. Was told i would go to days and never happened. Pay was great. Like working with co workers. Gave employees jackets, caps."
good,"Before being bought out, it wa a great place to work. Post merger, not so much."
good,The day is busy and full of things to do. My co workers are willing to help in anyway the can. The management  plays a important part in day to day operations.
good,"Lavoro in questa ditta da più di vent'anni ricoprendo svariati incarichi e posizioni. Ho avuto modo di crescere professionalmente ed umanamente. "
good,"the company was alright to work for but the people working there was a diffident story"
good,"The overtime hardly available, the breaks were short. The staff was friendly and the benefits were poor. There was no job security. Very low pay for the work being done."
good,This was a family business that was truly beneficial for those who were apart of the family. All others were simply staff.
good,"Traveled internationally was great on many projects. Employee working on big project with on concept of team work, and backstabbing among employees was bad. Management wasn't very good."
good,typically I worked 21 straight days with 3-7 days off at the end of the hitch.  Tested wells and conduct samples and operation of well sites to ensure good working order.  Posted results hourly and submit reports twice daily.  Responsible for all personnel on site and activities being conducted.
good,"This branch has tons of potential to be a place you will never want to leave. But unfortunately upper management push for production, by any means, will force you to rethink your choice of employment regularly."
good,"They have the potential to be a very effective company. All the procedures are present which should guide them to success, if only they were followed by management...."
good,"Although I liked my job, Cameron is a good ole boys club lacking in diversity. Represention and respect for people of color is limited here. At times I felt like I was walking into the Jim Crow 1960s upon arriving at the office."
good,"I like the job, three weeks vacation to start, one week paid sick time, they buy you a Christmas present, give you a Thanksgiving turkey or ham. Health Benefits are mid range. But it's about money, every day living, and that aint very rewarding. They aint given raises to their people in 5+ years, I been there for over a year. They also pay bi-weekly, life dont wait, things happen and you gotta pay the bills, it's hard having to wait or manage your money over a two week period. The cost of living goes up and up, but peoples wages stay the same. But there are MANY companies that are the same/similar. I dont know how we the people stand for such treatment. The propaganda in this country has taken over....but, hey it's the best, right."
good,"The only thing that I did not like is upper management (white based) and they would favor there own people. Nobody cares on what you do as long as you get the job done to make them look good. If your looking for a job this is okay for the meantime, but if you looking for a career don’t even bother with this company. Money was good and the benefits were great but other than that I have nothing else to say about this company"
good,"Low job security, multiple lay-offs in a short period of time. Great benefits for employees and respectable working staff across the entire plant facility"
good,"Cameron was a wonderful place until purchased by schlumbreger."
good,"Average place to work.  Had some benefits, but the plant I worked in was going through a transition and eventually closed.  I would not have accepted the job if I knew the plant was at risk of shutting down."
good,"i liked it, didnt like the shift i got, the machine i was operating was the largest i had ever run, so i enjoyed the expeirience. it was a fanuc control machine so it was easy to get use to"
good,"Good environment, fun fast paced job, nice people, good benefits, good pay, slight room for advancement, good place to get your foot in the door, would recommend"
good,"Cameron was driven to promote those who wanted to succeed and grow with the company; however, Schlumberger lessened in promoting employee growth and creativity."
good,Cameron is an okay place to work if you want to make decent cash to live on but not much more than that. management was reasonable and helped when they could.
good,"Cameron was a ok place to work. It wasnt great by any means, but it  wasnt horrible. I learned what is like to work for a company which is driven by engineering. As a supplychain professional they did not listen to anything supplychain had to say."
good,aprendie muito os pedreiros mim ensinavam muitas coisas não   agerencia era boa gostava muito dos meus colegas la so era ruim quando atrasava o salario por que não tinha extresse
good,Most recent manager was unsupportive which made my job difficult and cumbersome. All the other years and managers was a great expericence.
good,"No life, 100 plus hours of work/week but good pay. No job security...You can go from too busy to sleep to no income in a days notice,"
good,"At Cameron Roles and responsibilities are understood, PM has the ability to take the lead role for executing projects with support of senior management and co-workers."
good,"Typical day would start at 5:45 in the morning, start processing paperwork and measuring valves. Learned how to use tools specifically designed to take precise measurements. Hardest part of the job were the hours, when it was busy we would work 80+ hours a week. 120+ every two weeks. The most enjoyable part about the job would had to have been the coworkers. A lot of guys with their own personalities, experiences, stories, and opinions."
good,"Have to worry about plant closing all the time."
good,"- Enjoyed working with all levels of peoples in the project team"
good,"it's oilfield work, so it's not easy.  definitely no complaints because you know what you're getting into in that type of work. The main problem with the company is that there was no schedule even though they lure you in with a 3 week on, 1 week off promises. which comes out to 1 week of vacation per month! you can't beat that! but...that never happened.  The most I worked was 67 straight days, in Texas living out of camper on location 70 miles from the nearest town.  This is a great opportunity if you have nothing else to offer in life and have to support family, OR you're young and want to  put money away at a young age.  at 3.5 years in and 32 years old, my outlook on life changed, so I needed a career change.  The money was not ""life-changing"", in fact, people have been getting pay cuts lately so it was time to go."
good,"Several time we had worked until wee hours in the morning like 3 - 4am and next day we will have to report to work at 9am latest."
good,"A typical day would include reviewing estimates, project specifications, dealing with drawing issues, customer needs and quality issues."
good,Cameron is a good company to work for. You have to be assertive and learn quick with minimum training.
good,Great stepping stone for your career.
good,They demand overtime. Like 12- 12 to 18 hour days and 2 off in a row. If you love the smell of grease and sweat. If you love being crapped on. Then this place is for you.
good,"Great place to learn and grow experience. Excellent medical and 401K. Highly secure job from my experience. Problem faced was if you are excellent at your role, it can become very difficult to grow if you direct manager does not want you to move. Need to have the right connections internally to grow otherwise you will get stuck."
good,Not much time to spend with family work a lot of hours.  The hardest part of the job was having to spend a lot of time away from my family.  The most enjoyable part of my job was fitting.
good,"since the schlumberger buy out, now just a number to create revenue. Career advancement is now virtually impossible and they care nothing about your personal life"
good,Travail en intérim de 18 mois puis un cdi. Malheureusement suite à un problème économique (machine à remplacer donc grosse dépenses pour l'entreprise) les intérimaires ont été remercier après 6 mois et nous ne sommes pas allé au bout du contrat.
good,"Totally in charge of procurement and quality control of frozen seafood from all over the world. Online process control, inspection and loading supervision."
good,"During a workday you typically started with an analysis of the cash flow and if we have or not the information for short and long term forecasts. All the accounting was outsourced which gave me many headaches. Especially in the translation of Brazilian accounting numbers to American accounting numbers (FASB 52). I learned it was hopeless for me to put in a good day's work while the accounting was made elsewhere and the numbers never balanced."
good,"Great working environment."
good,Working here is ok. Great benefits and compensation package. However lot of bureaucracy and politics and its amazing how much time sometimes it can take to even get a single thing accomplished. Definite lack of accountability.
good,Just like everywhere there are some thing that can change but all in all its a great company. You go to work and start with a safety topic and when it breaks light you start working. Co-worker do really well with working with each other. Management is poor but you will live. The hardest part of work was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part was the team work.
good,"Cameron was a good company to start your career.  Unfortunately, the responsibility does not scale well with the compensation.  A great place to be if you're single, not so great if you have a family."
good,I test and repair pressure relief valves. Depending on the day I will either go out to the field and test the valve on location or the company brings them into the shop and we test and repair them in the shop. I've learned the internal componants of a pressure relief valve and how it works. Along with all the different types of pressure relief valves and the need for the different types of pressure relief valves.
good,I would like to get a job that I work all year round its good place to work and funny ppl good long days and hard work staff pretty good. Great place.
good,So many companies are going down. Really can't just blame them.                            Good while it lasted.                                      Could turn things around in the future.
good,Good overall internship experience. They gave us responsibility from day one and hands on work. They used the internship as an evaluation for future opportunity for full time employment.
good,"Most companies I've worked in oil/gas usually pay pretty well when the market is doing well, but also like most oil/gas companies when the market drops they tend to lay a lot of people off.  Cameron is no different."
good,"When I first began working at Cameron, the job was challenging and rewarding with the understanding that there was positive advancement.  Now that they have been acquired by Schlumberger, the family first feel has been replaced by business first.  Benefits and compensation have severely tapered off and the company is not willing to meet industry standards for compensation."
good,"great international exposure and learning opportunity, good company overall but there was poor leadership in my department and lots of turnover.  However the person I reported directly to was a great person personally and professionally.  I understand that this department has been reorganized and the  turmoil is no longer there."
good,good company to work for. I no longer work for this company and really do not wish to be included in this mandatory review of the company. thank you for including me though.
good,Very little training.  Micro managed.   Purchasing group were very reserved and did not work well with new employees.  I was hurt on the job and was basically pushed out of my position.  Did not totally understand all about the job as I was only trained for 4 hours.  Management was very hostile after my return from my surgery for my on the job injury.
good,fast paced warehousing operations
good,Corporate entity allowed local office enough autonomy to accomplish tasks at hand.  Local management lacked direction at times but was supported from other aspects of organization to get things done.  Shame it was sold off.
good,Employees were fun and many had worked there many years. The hardest part of this job was mainly management and their outlook for their employees careers going forward.
good,i would go to work drink some coffee and o to my morning meeting where my supervisor would tell usbwhat we are going to be doing for the day. so i did my work for the day then went home. it wasnt to bad
good,Ok place to work. Not laboring. Management needs an overhaul. Pay scale needs to go up. A/C shop out of the elements. Decent benefits. Stay fresh in most NDT certs.
good,I was responsible for the inventory of the warehouse and entering that information into SAP.  I handled sales calls and prepared the material to various companies.  I prepared the bill of ladings for the inventory being shipped out.
good,"After being bought out by Schlumberger and the downturn in the industry, there is a lot of uncertainty. Everyone is being either being moved around or laid off. I was a direct hire and was not part of the rotational program, but yet I changed group 3 times and had 6 different managers in 2 years."
good,"This company was the my first place of employment in regards to my desired career after graduation. "
good,nothing to tell the company employed 100's of people but is no longer open. It was a great place to work with great co workers.
good,"The local branch worked well together as a team to complete jobs and satisfy customers requests. Corporate interaction with its local branches was a struggle and only seemed to make everyone's job more difficult, which then dissimulated our customer relationships."
good,Solid company to start your Oil and Gas Career. Management is based on right place right time or external candidate. Would recommend.
good,No longer working for Cameron It Is Now A Schlumberger Co. Lay off due to economic down turn of the oil production industry.
good,"Cameron, and my Aftermarket facility in particular, are one of the top performers for Oil Field services in the world. Overall, it is a great company that offers top of the line products for their customers. "
good,I enjoyed working here.  The group of people that I worked with were very polite. The days seemed short due to this office being really busy.
good,"nice work place white good management. decent amount of politics, but this is expected of a big company. the most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues."
good,Good but not great place to work. Most employees are engaged in reactive jobs and often times can be quite difficult to implement change and be proactive.
good,"Prior to taking this job at Cameron, I was warned by a contract employee who turned down a job for the company that the employees do not believe in teamwork. Unfortunately, I have found this to be true and in today's work force, a teamwork is needed for a company to thrive.  If everyone is divided, the common goal of company success is thrown out of the window."
good,"I have added the experience of assembly and blue print graphics to my list of career skills. I have mastered the assembling, packaging and testing of wellhead equipment."
good,"Management style is american which does not involve too much micro-management. Being a young facility in Cameron, there is a more vibrant work culture and team spirit in the workplace."
good,"On call 24/7. Work a lot of hours and do no get much free time. Employees in Colorado were not the friendliest. No days off when you first start. After about three months I moved to the 10 days on, 3 off schedule."
good,Cameron is challenging and rewarding in turns.  The average days consist of more than you think possible to accomplish.
good,"Excellent stepping stone. Take advantage of the experience (good or bad)"
good,Cameron is a great place to work with the exception of the management. The Management is very poor and needs improvement.
good,"Comparable wages, very clean and safety is number one.  I guess the main issue I have is the lack of organization of the machine shop and tool crib area for a multimillion dollar company. Overall its really not a bad place to work."
good,"Cameron is a leading provider of flow equipment products, systems and services to worldwide oil, gas and process industries."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was providing successful training virtually and hands-on to HRBP's in regards to Org Management, Employee Changes."
good,"I relocated my family over 1100 miles to work for this company. The company as a whole is great but the yard/ division I work for is nothing short of a joke. I am not big on bad mouthing employers, but this company has made it very easy. I have never been lied to or decieved like this before."
good,Co-workers are helpful and willing to help whenever you are in doubt.
good,Liked working on the heavy equipment. Very hands on job overhauling the compressors.
good,They did not care about my disability.  Se previous review it wss the same place.
good,During the work day I would communicate with my customers on scheduling through shop for actuate delivery.
good,Enjoyed my time with the company.  Unfortunitly the Springfield location was going to be closed.  I saw this coming a year before if happened and went to Navistar.
good,"A typical work day for me would include working with MRP to determine material requirements and then going out to the market place to source the required material. I also dealt with issues as in invoice payments for our suppliers. Also coordinating with the warehouse to make sure materials were received on time to meet the required delivery dates was a key part of my job as well. "
good,"I enjoy working with the diverse crowd that we have. It's definitely challenged me to the furthest degree. Management has been a fluid area in our department, but has taken a turn in the right direction for 2013. Working at Cameron has definitely taught me that there will always be change, the sooner you accept that, the more you'll advance in what you do."
good,I would come .for a shift that started at 7am - 5pm generally but workorders were dispersed if nothing was needed breaking and scraping of old meters
good,"I worked in the controls department for an internship and the department was small and under funded and generally, people there didn't seem happy."
good,"Applied to a few jobs in Carmichaels, PA. Would like some opinions/experiences if they are out there. I like to find out as much about the work environment as possible and none better to ask than current/former employees."
good,"A typical day at work, required checking emails, and SAP for tasks assigned for that day."
good,"I get thank-you’s, accolades, even sometimes small token gifts from the people I work with on projects all the time. I always take a mini-training approach over just doing it for them where feasible, but I’ve also learned how to best serve users that do not have time or inclination to learn to do SharePoint. I don’t believe that SharePoint can do EVERYTHING and feel that I am very good at determining requests for solutions that are not a good ""fit"" for SharePoint -- I always research their options and pass them on to where they can get help. I have a checklist that I use to assess requirements before beginning any high usage, hi-visibility request for a SharePoint project, and the first consideration is whether an enterprise method already exists to address it."
good,"Requirements are for you to do nothing but work. When you have proven yourself, and have given everything for the company they do not want to promote you, but give you more things to do."
good,"Workshop staff and management were excellent and engaged, but the higher ups pushed unsafe practices on occasion just to get jobs out the door for profit."
good,"Many employees, including many long termed ones, were laid off. Middle management toward the end were saving their own jobs by moving their direct reports to undesirable positions."
good,Very good collaborative environment.  Extremely professional demeanor of senior leadership and managers.  Culture was very supportive and dedicated to improving individual performance.  Provided good opportunities to learn and develop.
good,"Could have more meritocracy, did not rotate people as many good energy companies do. So most employees did not know what other groups were doing and the challenges they had. Having said that, senior management was pretty good. Employees had what I believe good 401K and bonuses. Fortunately or unfortunately, during the last downturn, it got acquired by a large services company."
good,Layoffs can occur quickly. Not any other observations about the company except it was bought  by Schlumberger. I like the company's location and they invested a lot of money into new equipment
good,"Very robust project management office with full of process, procedures, and templates. Cameron utilize a very heavy ERP system, SAP, in which requires constant training"
good,"With the oil market roil, Cameron has been hit badly. Opportunities for growth are very limited due to wage freeze and business contracting. Coupled with incapable leadership sworn in by political maneuvers, the organization is weakened by the day."
good,Working at Cameron was exciting and challenging.  This was an engineered-to-order facility so the scope of work changed from project to project.  The focus was on teamwork and all the department worked together to increase efficiency and productivity.
good,"Training was almost non-existent in your direct duties.  The measuring tools we worn out and did not get replaced when needed."
good,"Typical day at work revolves around providing technical support to manufacturing and external suppliers as well as working with engineer personnel on old and new products."
good,A typical day at work is working allday with one 20 minute break. I learned how to work a CNC Machine. Mangagement is favoritism. The co-workers are cool but some don't mind there own business. Hardest part of the job is when you are on a HOT job and being rushed. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get a job out the shop without any NCR.
good,"Long hours, good pay for all workers along with good benefits, but your basically a number unless you know someone. Management is pretty decent at what they do. Hardest part is just the long hours and work days."
good,The people were really nice easy to get a long with. The trainer was easy with showing me how to operate the machines. They did a lot for the people at the work place.
good,"Good schedule.  They have either 21/7 or 28/14. You don’t see that a lot in Flowback."
good,"Hard work where you need to keep your attention at all times, with good safety culture first and good behavior."
good,"I worked at Cameron during the oil industry slow down.  There were monthly layoffs and a difficult environment.  Not Cameron's fault, but I decided to move in a different direction."
good,Due to the market conditions advancement is stagnant. Very process oriented. Safety concerned. Fast paced and challenging environment. Customer focused.
good,"Good support from management, if you are willing to go extra mile and solve the problems. its currently undergoing changes due to market and merger with SLB. A potential for great future with this new merger."
good,"Good place to start your career as you get to learn many things at your own pace. "
good,A lot of overtime.  Poorly managed during my time there. There were some safety  issues of the drilling facility.  This division moved to new location.
good,Benefits and compensation at Cameron are wonderful. Opportunity to work on global assignments. It is difficult to get promotions or move to different assignments from departments. Middle management could do better at communicating changes and business direction to staff.
good,"At the time it was a good place to work, but very low pay"
good,"Great atmosphere and great place to work. I have been working with Cameron for over 10 years and for the most part it has been great."
good,"I enjoyed my time at cameron. Unfortunately, the company had to layoff due to the industry crisis. I recommend working for to begin your career."
good,"Good place top work but layoff almost every 2 years. pay is good, most management are quality but layoffs always loom."
good,"typical day at work would be having a meeting and then going threw our days task. managment always takes care of our needs. co workers are great, hardest part of my job is that i dont get mentally challange at all. the most enjoyable part is knowing i have a for sure job."
good,"buen clima laboral,adquisicion de experiencia y conocimientos sobre otras tareas."
good,Large part setup on HBMs. Having the joy of working on large parts and knowing a job well done at the end of the day.
good,"It is a good place to work, the work was steady. Co workers were great. Always had good team work. the management was awesome. at the time I worked janitorial overnights. I would have stayed if i could work the hours."
good,"Management team at Cameron was substantially young, with very little knowledge of the service line that was dealt with on a daily basis.  Would not recommend this company to a friend."
good,"good place to work, pay is good for area. not easy to get cross trained on other areas.  committed to safety, benefits are ok.  management could have been better"
good,"manufacturing environment - lots of parts, SAP software, had my own office which was very nice, good people and hard workers"
good,"Cameron was a good over all experience, good benefits,   good pay and employees were pleasant to work with. in lieu of lay off this company would be a great company to retire from."
good,"Cameron went through a few system upgrades during my years with them. Payroll was on Cyborg and then moved to SAP. Everyone worked together and learned the system well. Management in our department changed several times - some good, some bad but the work was still done and met the deadlines. All and all it was a good company to work for."
good,"A typical day at work for me would consist of many things. For example checking in on production orders, making sure we will be meeting deadlines, doing a walkthrough of the shop to see what operation or step we're on certain jobs, entering production time in SAP, approving payroll time, having a safety meeting in the morning, looking ahead to prioritize the jobs\work coming in. I have learned a lot here from working out in the shop floor to coming up into management. I have many good employees that work with me which makes my job somewhat easier. The hardest part of the job for me would be dealing with upper management it’s not as organized as I thought it would be. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would be seeing the end result of what we manufacture. From my employees taking pride in their work, to the quality, to the time it took to complete, and most importantly customer satisfaction."
good,"A rotina do trabalho é indefinida e sem planejamentos. No entanto, as atividades corriqueiras são de costume práticas, como analisar os componentes do produto fabricado pela inspeção de qualidade."
good,Very fast paced environmnet but no oppurtunity to further career. SAP HR was used daily for HR transactions. Daily and weekly reporting with excel.
good,"Come in, review daily tickets, prioritize the issues,  resolve issues."
good,Management weak and untrustworthy especially since the Schlumberger take over. Be ready to work when your hired by Cameron usually operates in a constant personnel deficit.
good,Great place to work. Hours and pay where there with benefits upon signing. Lots of training offered outside of your job description if you wanted it and there was never a lack of safety training.
good,Great place to work when business is good. Be aware this company is in the oil industry and is highly affected by the ups and downs of this industry. Job security and work/life balance is not really part of their culture.
good,"Fun work environment however they are very dis-organized and make major changes from day to day."
good,"On-site installation, testing, troubleshooting and repairing: casing heads, tubing spools, frac valves, back pressure valves, two way checks, and other surface systems of oil and gas flow control equipment. "
good,"I obtained my class b cdl through Cameron. I also attended a wellhead class through Cameron. They will provide you the knowledge you need to do your job. Management was very fair in passing out tasks and awards. Some co-workers were slow at learning their roles, however, most were very good to work with. The hardest part of the job would be not being home for long periods of time."
good,"I begin my day with reviewing any existing emails followed by attending our daily safety and work flow meeting. I then host a warehouse workflow meeting with my immediate crew. Once the cycle counts are completed I process the counts into SAP then research any discrepancies. I am responsible for making sure all shipments, productions orders and incoming orders are processed in a timely fashion. Throughout the day I’m producing pick tickets and processing pick tickets that have been completed. I interact with customer service team here and cross country to get shipments shipped. I monitor all incoming emails that pertains to shipping and receiving. It also my duty to make sure everyone is working safely and  in an environment that meets the ISO standards. Once a week myself, the planning team, facility management, and customer service team get together to touch basses on order standings."
good,"the managment in this company is a joke as well as the pay, i was with them for over 3 years and they couldn't figure out what they wanted me to do and how to pay me for it."
good,"•	Reviewing plant’s Risk assessment on a yearly basics."
good,"Cameron was and is a great company, but to think that one division can't work across district lines was counter productive, one division sale staff suffered but they had All of the experience and other division had an excellent sales person but their talent suffered, so instead of combining the the divisions they would rather lose the work, not good"
good,"Productive work place, long  hours, fair pay.  Allowed me the opportunity to utilize my skills and abilities. Opportunity to meet and interact with other skilled workers."
good,The job was intense and a good learning experience for the gas industry .  You were able to see all aspects from well drilling to completion and flow back.  Not a family mans job no time with family.  You make good money just have to willing to put in the hours.
good,"Good people but not willing to advance newer ideas.  Old culture was firm."
good,"This company has changed significantly since I worked for them.  Unfortunately, any discussion I might have goes back to their original company, NATCO, which no longer exists."
good,"Very fast pace company. good workers. committed staff. "
good,"This was a contract assignment that I was only at for 2 months before I had to relocate to Ohio.  The people were friendly, it was a little stuffed shirt environment though."
good,"Interface with customers and sales representatives to handle both pre-sales and post-sales service functions."
good,Working for Cameron was a great opportunity to cross train as well as become more confident in my skills as a leader. They were generous with the training programs made available as well as any interest in pursuing additional certifications.
good,"Friendly working environment, unfortunately due to economy downturn which lead to retrenchment. This have a strong impact on lack of job security."
good,Job was a great experience. a great place to build skills and move up the ladder. Professional and great workplace The most experience and learning experience for me
good,"Work days were pretty extensive, with a production mindset. Working in quality, it was a struggle to keep the production managers in check when things were not up to the quality standards enforced."
good,Cameron Singapore is a nice place to work with ample of opportunity to learn and excel new things. I loved working there as I could developed my skills in Business Analysis. I worked with global team from different time zone and languages. The hardest part of job is that we need to stay awake for long hours to handle meeting and support people from different time zone.
good,It was not the best place to work but it was far from the worse. I enjoyed the people I worked with but there is the usual bureaucracy that all large companies have.
good,"I learned a lot throughout my rotational program with Cameron that I feel I can apply anywhere."
good,"Great job, and work environment. Mostly working in a shop never outside. Most shifts are 12 hours long. Work schedule is 11 days on 3 days off."
good,"Managerial Politics."
good,The company as a whole is ok the attmoshpere is great there are very good people working for the company but the managaement sucks and that ruins everything
good,Very fast-paced workplace.  Extremely stressful at times.  Co-workers all went through the same experiences with management.
good,I start my day by looking at computer to see what need to be done before the day was completed. I learned how to run the show at my station area and i learned how to drive a follklift. I enjoyed everyday at work.
good,Relax attitude with management. Only problem is the chaos and management doesn't pay attention to much
good,Long days but had a lot of fun at work. Everyone is helpful and the management is great.
good,Changing inserts as needed. Checking part to make sure that all measurements are in tolerance.
good,"Typical life of a service technician at Cameron was all work and never at home. I worked may 130-168 hour weeks here. I learned alot here. I learned how to run most of the systems and equipment that I know how to run here. The management  was not so great, there was so much going on that they had trouble keeping up. The co workers, those that I knew, where great and we treated each other with respect. The hardest part of the job was all of the hours worked with very little sympathy or give and take from the management. The best part of the job was the fact I made a lot of money."
good,Sewing windows in canvas boat covers. Meet some really nice people.
good,"-Knowledgeable staff"
good,Cameron was a great way to get introduced into the Oil and Gas industry. It has great training programs and upon graduation usually has good placement into a full time role.
good,Very Informative. No room for growth. Overall good job for time being.
good,"I have learned a lot during my work period. Co-operative co-workers, and good management."
good,Manager of Engineering Documentation. Company lacked publications department. I defined staff requirements and hired staff.
good,"Cameron is a great company to work for. I live in Texas, so I am looking to relocate somewhere clos to home."
good,Was a good company back when I worked for them. we worked my than family could stand I missed first birthdays and some Christmas Hollidays
good,Great place to work with lots of experienced people. Management could use work but other than that its a great place.
good,I work with some really good people.
good,we work 12 straight days 12 hrs a day. Good money just long hours.
good,"I started as an expeditor, basically meaning I supply the assemblers with the parts that they needed expeditiously.  I had the opportunity to learn much more. Everyone at the job had stop work authority, which means if you notice anything unsafe you have the right to stop it. I really appreciated their safety team. I worked 12 hours a day and was off every other weekend. I really enjoyed working with some exceptional people."
good,Loved it there. Just work was so slow . Great benefits package.  Great pay. Do your job and they let you be yourself. You have a production goal you must meet but it wasnt difficult.
good,Great benefits. Competitive pay. Plenty of overtime. Work/personal life balance is hard because of the long hours and on call duties. Overall very  good career.
good,Since the acquisition by another major O&G company it has not been such a great place to work. Lots of layoffs and uncomfortable work atmosphere. Learned a lot there.
good,My company the Western Co. of North America had been merged with BJ services. Initially I stayed with Cameron thinking this would a better opportunity since the industry was doing well and this was a chance to move out of EP and the Service industry. I found working in the manufacturing are was much more a controlled environment and just wasn't the best fit at the time. I was able to rejoin the BJ group which had purchased my company the Western Co. I initially came on board to help integrate a newly acquired Coiled Tubing business into the BJ system and culture and develop Standard practices for their operations.
good,"Worked there for about four years I went from assembly to welder, to tester even went offhsore since I was one of the fews that knew how to do a little bit of everything. I felt I shoukd of been more compensated for all the hardwork and long hours (including my weekends) I gave these guys. Overall good company but they need to learn how to value and compensate good outstanding workers."
good,"It is a good place to work and make money. The downside is that when things get busy, it can tend to take over your personal life. This is the biggest reason I decided to leave (coupled with my hour to and hour from work commute)."
good,wish I would have stayed there. the work changed day by day and I like that. nice people work there and we became like family.
good,"Can be very hectic during ship out time, pay is good for some departments. Work atmosphere is great if you enjoy challenges and high producing environment."
good,"Was a nice place to work, till production slowed. Learned all of the job basics, company changed names three times during my service. Hardest part of the job was adjusting and dealing with the inclement weather."
good,Work is very stable and hours are great but not a place that pushes for growth.  Expected in some cases but I'm more interested in growing with a very stable company.
good,Wasn't really there long enough to make any kind of reasonable assessment of this job. I was only contracted for a couple of weeks
good,"Daily work goes as per the planned procedure and a thorough trainings were done before carrying out any underlying task."
good,Cameron taught me a lot that i can take with me throughout my career.
good,"First major company I worked for, entry level."
good,"Supervised shop activities in manufacturing, had a great crew of employee's that always did what ever it took to get the job done and meet the custormers needs. Sometimes we had crunch times to complete a job and get it out the door to prevent a shut down at a site. But always accomplished our goals and felt good knowing that we made a differance. "
good,Enjoyed the job.  Learning a lot myself teaching and instructing others in shipping and receiving. Wish I had more backing from upper management. All in all it prepared me in future employment.
good,"The job was great until companies came in and bought out Cameron and layoffs started happening, then the work disappeared and we sat there day after day waiting to be laid off."
good,"Overal a great company, but some higher management people had their favorites who could do any type of mistakes and get away with it."
good,"Generally working on 5 to 10 sales orders per day."
good,"Fun and easy way to learn about the oilfield "
good,OneSubsea is a great company to work for and offers great benefits for retirement and investment programs. They are for the most part pretty flexible with family and work and ensure safety at all times.
good,learned a lot in the years I worked there pay wasn't the best but it was better than most at the time had some good times and some stresfull times but over all it was all good
good,It was a pretty good place to work. I would not have left if the oil field did not start to downsize. If they were to call me back i believe i would return to my role at Cameron.
good,great place to work but very competitive have to be able to pull your weight or you wont make it learned a lot management was pretty good no room for advancement
good,"Ambiente de trabalho excelente, ótima interação entre a gerência e chão de fábrica, forte cultura ao aprimoramento e crescimento profissional."
good,I greatly enjoyed learning how to repair and test fracking valves as a valve technician. I had plenty of hours and enjoyed a great work environment with motivated and friendly coworkers. The only downside was that I was never hired on full time with the company and that I was laid off in 2015 during a slow season for the oil and gas industry.
good,Excellent company to work for good clean environment good management to work for and a good relationship with my peers. I learned a lot over my time there with great job satisfaction at the end of every shift
good,"Before being bought out by Slumberger, Cameron was an awesome company to work for. All managers had an open door policy and suggestions to improve work environment  were appreciated and encouraged at all levels of the company."
good,"Good company to work for, I felt like I was part of a progressive company. Learned a great deal from the personnel and management. Company was full of hard working people."
good,"At the time it was a bit overwhelming ,no  shop had machines and we had to manufacture a lot of wellhead equipment, I was learning and teaching personal plus learn a new computer system, but all in all it was good."
good,"Twelve to 14 hours a day"
good,"Being in Oil & Gas is like riding a Roller Coaster.  "
good,"The job is mainly dependent on the market. If prices are up, more exploration and more jobs. If prices are down, less exploration and less jobs. Simple economics"
good,I've been with Cameron for three years. So far I have enjoyed working for this company. It's a large company but the environment makes it seem small.
good,"Load up at shop with equipment drive to job site work at site until  job was done. Drive back to shop and unload equipment if need. Fill out ticket. Do paper work. "
good,"It is wonderful to work here but there are still long timers that are a in positions of authority but are a little slow to embrace changes in the industry. That contributes to some stress; however, with Cameron, employees start out having 3 weeks paid vacation, 5 sick leave days, major holidays paid and a paid floating holiday. Overall, I would say that Cameron takes care of their own. With the new acquisition, everything is pretty much up in the air and job security fluctuates with the oil market (as with any petro-energy manufacturing business)."
good,I enjoyed working for Cameron.  My coworkers were supportive and most people with join in if you have clear set of goals and purpose for your project.
good,"Good company for work but have one big disadvantage, only one custumer!"
good,"During my time at Cameron, I will say I had a wonderful and supportive supervisor. I looked forward to coming into work each and every day."
good,"Fun place to work and I could learn somethings new every day. I ENJOYED WORKING WITH MANAGEMENT AND MOST OF MY CO-WORKER. I think once you learn your job ,there is no hard jobs to do.I really enjoyed my jobs ,because they all was in my field of work."
good,I believe its a good company it just needs people more suited for leadership positions instead of people who know the right  people.
good,Good place to gain engineering experience in oil and gas equipment design and fabrication. Was able to be involved in a lot a projects involving oil and gas equipment. Was busy all of the time.
good,"Great company with advancement opportunities."
good,"there was a typical management employees relationship, where the workers union had the interest of the management and the workers at heart. It was a project that started with a few staff and grew up to 8000 workers by the end of the project. working conditions were not typically hard as we enjoyed carrying out our regular duties with some state of the art machinery."
good,"Spent almost 35 years sacrificing to contribute to this company."
good,I enjoyed working for Cameron. I was able to learn a lot of new things.

good,"political games in every dept , you have to play. people view HSE as a supporting role and difficult to meet the demands and expectations of especially female bosses."
good,Overall the day was fairly standard. Would be given a job and a due date. Most of the time management left you to do your work and get it done. Management was not helpful in resolving issues though. It was sometimes hard to get information.
good,I enjoyed working at Cameron very much. I had opportunities to grow in my field and training/development avenues were always at employee disposal. Attended multiple quality leadership sessions with production/admin management teams. Built comradery.

Worked with project managers to make sure we were meeting our deadlines.  Then passed the work on to the production artists that worked with me and answered all questions related to these books that they may have.  I learned so much during my career there especially the computer programs.  My management was always great to me during my entire career.  Especially in my last position with the company they never micro managed us and respected us.  My co-workers over the years were all great I made many friends over the years that became like family.  My last coworkers I worked with so well we had a great team we always helped each other, got all of our projects out on time and were very productive.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the coordinating and assembling information for our manuals I love doing type of work."

good,I have worked for Cameron most of my adult life. I can't begin to describe how much I learned working for Cameron. The training and experience I received was invaluable to my career. The management through the years was extremely fair in evaluating their personnel. The company culture for the most part was as I would describe as a family atmosphere. I will take lots of valuable lesson learned from Cameron to my next employer.

good,Originally I enjoyed working for Cameron alot until a Field Service Supervisor messed up everything.  Basically the work/life balance got completely lost.
good,Cameron Drilling Systems is a good company to work with a good work environment.  There are some bumps with the integration with Schlumberger since the they purchased Cameron.
good,Cameron felt like a family before SLB purchased them. it is now a very numbers driven almost robotic feeling coming to work. nobody gets raises or promotions and you are expected to do more work with the same amount of pay.
good,Really fast paced with lots of work hours. Learn alot in a very short time and are expected to continue to improve every single day. over all its a good place to work.

good,You get to see the world for free and every job is an adventure. The whole company in total is fun but very serious when it comes to work need to be accomplished.
good,A typical day of work involves me working on my tasks right when I arrive to my desk. The tasks are fairly monotonous and you learn to fight boredom in different ways.  I communicate with many different people each day and help resolve invoicing issues.  I have learned the Accounts Payable system at Cameron and what the work environment is like at an unstable company.  Management is pretty good overall but supervisors are simply ok overall.  The hardest part of my job is to stay current on all the various issues I could be handling at any one time.  If one were lazy they could cut corners and find themselves in a mess very soon.  My favorite part of the job is working on unusual issues and providing solutions to vendors or procurement using the knowledge I have gained.

good,While working for cameron I learned a lot about bops and how to build a lmrp and lower stack plus cameron does care about safety first. I would love to stay there but I need to move on because the company is slowing down.
good,"Cameron is a great Global Company that is being purchased by Schlumberger."
good,Cameron Drilling Systems and Cameron as a whole had excellent work benefits and compensation. If given the chance and resources I would probably work for this company again.
good,"Great group of people to work for. It has a good culture and a good balance of work and family. "
good,"Medium size location with plenty of opportunity to stand out. Moderate amount of red tape given the size of the facility and company but easily navigated. My roles include creating routings and manufacturing instructions, non conformance disposition, and bill of material evaluation. My department was also over designing and fabricating tools and fixtures for manufacturing."

good,Typically days at Cameron were looked forward to.  I worked with SAP here and was able to learn and utilize a good deal of organization with regards to the type of work I was doing.  This work was with fixed asset management as well as project management assignment of network and activities for the Subsea group in Engineering.  Management was professional and supportive for the most part.  My co-workers were energetic and functioned as a integral parts of a team.

I learned SAP skills, how to build a job from the ground up and cost it out for the bid process and I also learned to work on my own with not much guidance.  No hard part to the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when we got work and we bid the job and decided on what areas we would build and could maintain at the facility."
good,Awesome management team. Great co-workers and a relaxed environment. 
good,"The company itself has wonderful opportunities. The shop I was in was too tightly knit with the buddy system. One employee didn't like me and just so happened to be the managers ""buddy"". The hostility shown to me was ignored and justified by management  due to the employee having a rough upbringing. I was hired under the guise of a stable work environment then laid off as soon as things slowed down."
good,"Good Place to work i loved my job, It was good Getting all that expiriannce driving and operating diferant kinds of forklifts. I got called on the walky talky alot to move matirials in and out of the shops,load and unloaad trucks. coworkers help each other out. the manegers were fair and helpful when certain things came up. The Hardist part of the job was most of the time  i never knew what was going to arise that day."
good,"Had a healthy work environment and great management team. Team members were easy to work with. However, wouldn't recommend long term employment. Labor is hard, which isn't intimidating, the downfall is the hours. Within my almost-three months employment, I had a total of five days off, two of which were for the birth of my daughter. This was a transitional job for me, loved it but the time at work (with the hour commute was 17 hour days) was not worth it to my family."
good,my work experience was great and worked with an awesome manager.  In the beginning many opportunity to grow your skills through workshops were available where you would receive a certificate.

Great knowledge, and training new engineering employees was my favorite part."

Also, management changes and commodity changes,  We have weathered the storm (changes) well."
good,"Most days were spent gathering information from the company data base in order to compile a data book for the customer following either company guidelines or customer request. Verify that if it was a third party inspection project, that all needed documents were filled out and signed according to company policy.

There is a sense of flexibility with your work day and managers are typically very easy to work with. I've learned a lot about the corporate environment working here. My co-workers have all been very pleasant to work with. The hardest part of my job has been the training portion, because I am someone who prefers knowing exactly what I'm doing and knowing the ins and outs of my job. The most enjoyable part of my time at Cameron has been the exposure I've gotten to the various facets of the company."
good,"My day consisted of going to the office early and getting things done before everyone else got in for the day.  I enjoyed all the relationships made while processing stock options for employees globally.  I developed wonderful relationships with all the customers and my coworkers. "

I really enjoyed the challenges and I grew over the years and succeeded during that time frame."

good,"I've had a great experience working at Cameron. Management really understands work-life balance. "
good,"Cameron has one of the best work/life balances I have ever heard of within the Oilfield services sector. From my perspective it also has the best work atmosphere around town.

Making sure our service to them is satisfactory and being completed on time to their schedules. I've learned to work with all different kinds of people from different ethnic backgrounds and upbringings. Also, have learned how to manage people in a way to generate the most productivity out of their working time. Hardest part of the job is a balance between life and work. But, once you find that groove then everything is pretty easy. All boils down to time management and prioritizing. Most enjoyable part of the job is not every day is the same. You will run into different obstacles each day and you have to find new and effective ways to overcome them regardless of the situation at hand."

good,Cameron provided a good work place with good employees and management. I learned a lot about the oil Industry and the product (BOP's) that Cameron designed and fabricated for their customers. My boss was always nice and professional to me. He had very good communication skills and was very knowledgeable about our devices and product. The hardest part was probably dealing with SAP during collaboration and downtime. The most enjoyable was all the smiling faces and all the knowledge I took with me.
good,Company Was Brought Out By Schlumberger Therefore Management Doesn't Know What Direction Its Going In. Employees Are Worried About Getting Laid Off Due To The Economy And Stocks Are Falling.
good,Set up in 2013 and invested > USD 100k on infrastructures. People collaborate and stay focus on the business. Good teamwork in general.
good,"-Arrive on site, inspect the equipment, install the equipment, pressure test, FSO, demobilization;"

Personal truck made the miles away from home not so bad. hardest time on job is when the summer heat makes you sick. easy part was the driving and seeing the scenery and talking to the other people at the location.

The challange was to use up pre-existing unused stock and convert for  current customer orders.
good,"Lidar trabalhar com pessoas de diferente nacionalidades e culturas e como obvio exercitar o equilibro da emoção sobre as pressões laborais quando necessario. A parte mais dificil deste trabalho foi ficar mais de 90 dias fora do convivio familiar e a parte mais agradavel do trabalho, conhecer novas pessoas ampliar o meu curriculum de experiencia neste ramo da Logistica e na industria petrolifeira e sem esquecer nossa parte de criança que nunca se apaga nos corações dos adultos crescidos."
good,Cameron had a lot of good stuff going for them . I worked for them so i could feather my knowledge with the mechanical side of the equipment
good,Great learning experience and training.Freindly atmosphere and good opportunities for taking more responsibillity

good,"Very goal oriented, very organized, great money.  I learned a lot about the oilfield and how to supervise individuals in daily tasks.

good,A typical day was a meeting first thing in the morning to discuss job tasks and duties for the day.  Management would come thru and talk to you as a normal person a couple of times a week.  The different departments worked well together and communicated well on all overlapping job tasks.  All employees were very helpful on helping with any questions needed.
good,"There was literally nothing hard about the job, they provided all the tools, everything was new(cranes, forklift, tools). I guess the hardest part of the job would be, flipping the big hydraulic boxes that we would build."
good,I enjoyed Cameron culture a lot. It's why I chose them actually. The work-life balance was amazing. But once they got purchased by Schlumberger it really changed. I went to an SLB building with SLB managers and really disliked it. The culture was entirely different and work-life balance was much harder to maintain.
good,Helping other to achieve the best possible outcome by providing resources to a needy population. My workplace was pleasant and the other employees friendly.
good,"Management is great, pay and benefits are even better but at the end of the day it is still the oil field and if the market is down so is your job."

good,I worked for Cameron for almost two and half years where I have grown to love the Valve industry for Oil & Gas operation.  Cameron has provided me the ability for uncapped learning potential with room for advancement based on proficiency and work ethic.  I would not have left this position had my family and I not been relocating back to our home town in Louisiana.

Cameron would always have different and difficult projects at times requiring myself and my coworkers always to be on our toes and work together.

This was after a daily stand up meeting with my supervisor to find out where I was needed the most. I did my part as a team player from shift to shift. Unfortunately due to a huge slow down in the oil industry it was decided that a workforce reduction was needed for a third time in three years. It was a great place to work for.

good,"I can't speak for every office, only my own, but from what I have experienced at Cameron, it is an exceptional place to work. It is a collaborative environment in which team success is more important that pointing fingers when something goes wrong. People with more experience are always willing to explain things, and reevaluate when an alternative idea is presented. There have been many changes to the management structure and the processes by which things are accomplished, which causes strife in those who have trouble with change.

good,You have task like if you are around sights and you see something unsafe you can stop the job and write it up and at the end of the day you would turn it in and the next morning without using people's names you could win gift cards but you better be honest about the safety reasons and not just trying to win a card cause an investigation will take place on each accident.
