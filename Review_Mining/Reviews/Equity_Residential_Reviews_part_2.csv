good,"Upper Management truly listens"
bad,"manager turn over rate is ridiculous , so many mangers in a short period of time there were many issues with schedules because you have to cover double shifts every oother day and they are very mean to employees"
bad,not crazy about this company they do not care about the people who work for them. they only care about meeting the goals required by the upper management team
bad,"Under the poor management    I left the company, because I was bullied and she wanted me out by telling me that I don't have work ethic, after I won 17 times EMC365, two times silver coin, three times nominee in the elite team, and a winner of the ten ways and etc"
bad,"Not a good place to work. No work life balance.  Management is not very good.  Never had the tools, materials required to accomplish the job.  No raises"
bad,"The company was ok no complaints. They trained me and help me through mistakes. High turnover in managment tho, which was discouraging and I chose not to move up with the company."
bad,"Equity Residential used to be a great company to work for. Now that it is exiting Orlando it has turned into man vs man to keep your job. Which isn't including the dishonest people in management who are constantly manipulating to keep their butts safe. I learned everything I know at Equity and Equity has helped me truly excel at my job. Management honestly is a joke, RM's are completely disconnected from the real life of each property. The Community Manager is the biggest con-artist of them all who lies with a straight face right in front of you and lies to your RM. I wouldn't recommend working for Equity right now."
bad,"Terrible employer! Don't be fooled!  Management is an uneducated, cheap and a sleazy group. If you want to work like a frantic lunatic with very low pay, handling communities of angry residents, this is the job for you.  A highly miserable experience."
bad,"I worked there 2 years ago.  The pay is low. The company's expectations are unreasonable. If you want to work long hours and be treated like a 2nd class citizen, this place is for you."
bad,"Equity does not care about their employees, only about keeping intimate friends employed regardless of their performance"
bad,I have nothing positive to say. The manager on a different property I was transferred to was out to get rid of me. You either had to be the step mat for the senior agents or you were done!
bad,"The Management is all about money and not the residents. They do not work with the prospects at all, they make so much money but do not want to change the things on the property that can look much more appealing to our prospects. They show favoritism towards certain employees and they are not held accountable, and they are promoted in higher position without fallowing the company standards rules and policies. Opportunity for advancement was completely based on an almost nepotistic basis. Upper management is focused on the bottom line and the employees and tenants are most affected by their policies."
bad,I worked there for about a year the property was for sale the entire time i work for them.  my maintenance tech quit and they wouldn't replace him because they were selling that went on for 10 months.  i was asked to hide things because they didn't want to fix them because they were selling

good,"Upper Management truly listens"

bad,"manager turn over rate is ridiculous , so many mangers in a short period of time there were many issues with schedules because you have to cover double shifts every oother day and they are very mean to employees"
bad,not crazy about this company they do not care about the people who work for them. they only care about meeting the goals required by the upper management team
bad,"Under the poor management    I left the company, because I was bullied and she wanted me out by telling me that I don't have work ethic, after I won 17 times EMC365, two times silver coin, three times nominee in the elite team, and a winner of the ten ways and etc"
bad,"Not a good place to work. No work life balance.  Management is not very good.  Never had the tools, materials required to accomplish the job.  No raises"

They do not work with the prospects at all, they make so much money but do not want to change the things on the property that can look much more appealing to our prospects.

Opportunity for advancement was completely based on an almost nepotistic basis. Upper management is focused on the bottom line and the employees and tenants are most affected by their policies."

I learned everything I know at Equity and Equity has helped me truly excel at my job. Management honestly is a joke, RM's are completely disconnected from the real life of each property. The Community Manager is the biggest con-artist of them all who lies with a straight face right in front of you and lies to your RM. I wouldn't recommend working for Equity right now."
bad,"Terrible employer! Don't be fooled!  Management is an uneducated, cheap and a sleazy group. If you want to work like a frantic lunatic with very low pay, handling communities of angry residents, this is the job for you.  A highly miserable experience."
bad,"I worked there 2 years ago.  The pay is low. The company's expectations are unreasonable. If you want to work long hours and be treated like a 2nd class citizen, this place is for you."
bad,"Equity does not care about their employees, only about keeping intimate friends employed regardless of their performance"
bad,I have nothing positive to say. The manager on a different property I was transferred to was out to get rid of me. You either had to be the step mat for the senior agents or you were done!
bad,"The Management is all about money and not the residents. They do not work with the prospects at all, they make so much money but do not want to change the things on the property that can look much more appealing to our prospects. They show favoritism towards certain employees and they are not held accountable, and they are promoted in higher position without fallowing the company standards rules and policies. Opportunity for advancement was completely based on an almost nepotistic basis. Upper management is focused on the bottom line and the employees and tenants are most affected by their policies."
bad,I worked there for about a year the property was for sale the entire time i work for them.  my maintenance tech quit and they wouldn't replace him because they were selling that went on for 10 months.  i was asked to hide things because they didn't want to fix them because they were selling
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
bad,"manager turn over rate is ridiculous , so many mangers in a short period of time there were many issues with schedules because you have to cover double shifts every oother day and they are very mean to employees"
bad,not crazy about this company they do not care about the people who work for them. they only care about meeting the goals required by the upper management team
bad,"Under the poor management    I left the company, because I was bullied and she wanted me out by telling me that I don't have work ethic, after I won 17 times EMC365, two times silver coin, three times nominee in the elite team, and a winner of the ten ways and etc"
bad,"Not a good place to work. No work life balance.  Management is not very good.  Never had the tools, materials required to accomplish the job.  No raises"
bad,"The company was ok no complaints. They trained me and help me through mistakes. High turnover in managment tho, which was discouraging and I chose not to move up with the company."
