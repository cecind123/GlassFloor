rating,review
bad,The Exide Technologies manufacturing plant in Manchester IA is one of the worst factories in the area. The environment is dangerous to your health and pay does not line up with the health risk involved with working in this factory setting
bad,your typical day is stressful and management does not care about you or your safety. the only important thing is numbers. the only good thing is your paycheck.
bad,"no good healthcare benefits to choose from, very filthy environment, lots of stress, always threatening to work every sat, very uncaring for their employees, company is for whatever benefits them without consideration of the employees!"
bad,"Exide Technology is recovering from bankruptcy, It is currently in early re-structure program because of the loss of customer satisfaction ( $1 billion loss). A lot is expected with minimal reward."
bad,"It's was bad move to Exide, very stressfull work manager and supervisor left job bad staff bad co-ordinator, two time bankruptcy bad management,  stay away if you can."
bad,"opportunity for advancement is minimized and you are expected to save the day without any teamwork. the more you do, the more they will expect out of you with no growth attached."
bad,"Long hours,No work life balance and management is very poor. "
bad,Never worked in a place like this and will never do it again. No appreciation for the jobs that are done. Would not ever recommend to anyone I know or care about.
bad,Uno schifo totale. Azienda gestita da presuntuosi ed incapaci
bad,"Not a great company to work for . Micro Managment from the ground up, it is no wonder why the company has went bankrupt two times with some of the practices.  I would not recommend this job to my worst enemies."
bad,"aucun avis, expériences professionnelles acquises, bonnes relations avec les responsables."
bad,"No communication at all between the drivers and management goes over and beyond to make the job hard, They wiil not listen to the drivers it is all about them"
bad,"the worse job I ever had, the most stingy company I ever worked for, the worst warehouse manager I ever had.  super heavy acid burning stinking."
bad,Learned alot during very pivotal period of organization's restructuring
bad,"Hardest job I've ever had in my life. It was extremely hard work, and the people work really hard for their money. But they did not complain. We were jus glad to have an income."
bad,Extremely stressful and lack of caring management.  Long hours they push and push you to perform well above normal people abilities.  Chemical hazards is everywhere.
bad,The leadership team is extremely disappointing and the culture is toxic.  The company has a good mission statement on paper but the company does not practice it and does not value its employees.
bad,"No incentives, no yearly raises, turn over rate is crazy no acknowledgement when you do a good job, morale is low as it can get, They always want more out of people but never give anything in return no thank you no nothing....dont waste your time place isn't goin anywhere"
bad,"Typical day of work was to verify and respond to emails, telephone and voice mails, enter orders, order products from our US warehouse, set up new account, process credit card payment, back up shipping and receiving, reception and invoicing"
bad,"This company is in bankruptcy....AGAIN.  The ""numbers"" are to high and the quality is poor!"
bad,"It is by far the worst place I have ever worked in my life. The company will never care for your safety. If there's something that needs any sort of improvement, and you raise a flag about it, they will tell you that it's been like that forever and that other employees have been working under the same conditions for years. Racism and bigotry is openly expressed. If you're not a WASP you will receive a different treatment.No training for everyone.You learn on your own. No matter how good they pay it is still not worth it."
bad,"The worst place ever to work . Management has no Ideal  what they are doing. Never ending  shifts. You worked 18 to 19 Hrs a day ."
bad,"I worked for Exide for 7 plus years. I worked in two production departments. The overall training and safety procedures and non-existent. It’s constantly hot and In the summer you work in very humid, 120 degree plant. It was normal for people to blackout on the production floor from heat exhaustion. The company itself doesn’t care about you whatsoever. You don’t get raises and once you top out at pay, you stay there. You get a week of vacation for the first 3 to 5 years and you are forced the take it when they tell you. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone unless it’s a last resort."
bad,"Terrible front office management. Horrible machinery. Front office never has workers best interests in their decision making. More, more, more. That is the theme of upper management."
bad,"Leadership is not aligned - there is no common goal or clear vision of where company is going. There appears to be a serious lack of understanding of the business, bench strength, and what it takes to get results. 3 years after exiting bankruptcy, current leadership appears unable to move the company forward."
bad,Managers and supervisors and randomly selected. Favoritism and childlike behavior exists. If you have a family and have real responsibilities I would not recommend that you get a job at Exide.
bad,"When I first started it was a great job with a good hourly rate. But as soon as they saw that I was going in to overtime they changed me to salary, then of course started working me up to 60 hours a week. At times I was asked to do jobs that would take me well past the legal limits for my position. When I asked about rules and laws I was given the run around and never got a straight answer."
bad,Health & Safety is a joke. The roof is in dire need of repair. It rains on employees during inclement weather. Employees are encouraged to work unsafely on a daily basis and no one ever sees the health and safety supervisor.
bad,They'er liars from management to the employees just to get rid of someone they don't like.The HR department was a scam they fired people that had better sense than them they don't like people who are smarter than them.
bad,"I was a supervisor there for a year. My direct manager was outstanding. He understood the day to day operations. Together we achieved a 95 percent on time and Inventory accuracy. We had a staff of temp employees that keep over turning based on performance. It was a very hostile place to work based on temps and some employees   Above site had zero understanding of supply chain, motivation ,OE , positive reinforcement. My Manager left (they pushed him out) I walked out after talking with HR and the place went completely down hill. The people that took over all were fired. Both my reginal directors were fired in a less then a 9 month span when I was there. This was done from headquarters who as I said had know idea what they were doing I had over 24 years in the Pharma field as a Supervisor and Manager before coming here so I am not someone who has no experience This is why they have filled for Bankruptcy twice and they will eventually fold as a company"
bad,"I don't recommend this facility to anyone at any level. The place is a mess, terrible air quality, no training or SOP's just word of mouth, they do not blame the process and point fingers at the employee."
bad,your worked to death in the summer with temps in the plant reaching 130 and laid off in the winter. lay offs are every year and can be longer than 6 mos. the management will hire you then look for ways to fire you. your not treated with respect for the skills you bring to the job or just human respect period. you are required to give a blood sample every 3 mos to keep track of your lead count. However the workers there for the most part are good people.
bad,"I've worked here for two and a half years. In that time I've learned if this company needed the blood of innocent children to grease the gears of it's machinary, exide wouldn't hesitate to hire someone to kidnap kids off the street."
bad,Hardest and hottest job that you can imagine. Lead is so nasty. I feel sorry for the Maintenance people. Great job if you like taking showers with other men. Still had Skin problems after leaving this job for about 2 months.
bad,"There is a reason Exide is in its second bankruptcy. The management team is sucking the company dry. The lack of properly qualified members of management will sink this company. The management team is a joke. They turn down people who hold fresh MBA 's and put uneducated , ghetto  people in positions which require a analytical comprehension.. They are loosing customers. They're stock is worthless. Can't keep a CEO. And they totally could care less if the company folds or not. The company has been running in the red for months. The working environment is depressing."
bad,Many dedicated employees with the passion to be successful but due to poor fiscal planning and over reaching upper management the company had to file bankruptcy for the second time.
bad,Extremely physical job...horrible management....tension between departments caused by management. Only positive of job was decent pay
bad,"This company posts job listings for positions which may be open, may not be. What Exide won't tell you is they already have someone in mind for the position, but want you to spend time writing a resume, cover letter, etc. for a job which you will never get. No interviews, unless you already work there."
bad,This company has had a ton of turnover. There are no goals or direction.  Money to make improvements doesn't exist.  They have filed for bankruptcy multiple times.  Picture rats trying to climb on top of each other while the boat sinks.  I didn't realize you could get PTSD at work - this place could do it to you.  Anyone who has talent in their job won't stay long here.  They deceive you during the hiring process and try to lock you into a relocation package to keep you from running out the door.
bad,Delivered and pick up  batteries. It is a very fast paced business and cut throat. I spent 17 years with this company and they treated me wrong in the end.
bad,"Constant lead AND Cadmium exposure."
bad,Hardest working hourly employees I've ever had the honer of working with.
bad,"Incapable managers, I won't recommend, doesn't work for me, not willing to provide the support needed to be successful. One of the worst job networks I ever experienced."
bad,"Exide Technologies conducts its business with employees similar to a socialist state. You will be told what you want to hear upon being hired. All employees of a similar job title are paid the same amount, regardless of time of service or job performance."
bad,"The managers treat people horrible, the HR manager is a joke and they need to hire someone new who has common sense. The co-workers gossip and and back stabbers. They don’t appreciate their workers."
bad,Not a bad job if you dont have kids no life outside of the job and dont mind the fact you work with lead that is a major hazzard if you meet those requirements then exide may be right for you
bad,le responsable de maintenance incompétent ne devrait pas avoir cette fonction
bad,"Worked 6 days a week the whole year, poor management, supervisors attitudes vary, depending on where you work and what shift you work decides how heavy your workload is."
bad,"Very bad health environment. Harsh working conditions. Highest levels of management ""fooled"" by plant management. Treated people   with disrespect. Absolutely worst job I have ever had. Everyone in Bristol area knows about terrible reputation of this plant. Extreme turnover rate. Had to hire large group every couple of weeks to maintain workforce. As many as half didn't make it through orientation period. A group of ""good ole boys and girls"" ruled the plant. No dissension possible without retaliation due to tight personal relationship between production management and HR management."
bad,"You are just a number back breaking work, look elsewhere they do not pay well, Batteries are heavy, customers will not help you either, it's just a stepping stone to another job!"
bad,the make batteries big batteries small batteries  black batteries white batteries they closed down and now they dont make batteries.  thats what happens
bad,Operating Plastic Injection Molding Machines(hand lugging). Quality inspection of product. Trimming flash(extra plastic) from product. Learned Manual and Automatic Operations of machines. Had great 3rd shift Supervisor which moved to a different department. Management was know to not follow through with things they said they were going to do. Co-workers were fine. Not as motivated I myself. They were a little immature. The hardest part was learning a new machine but a nice challenge. The most enjoyable part was the fast pace and staying busy.
bad,"Very hard physical work, wearing a respirator in the heat."
bad,"This company has a lot potential but their workplace culture is the worst, they don't value their employees and use them as machines. The pay is good but the risks for your health are high."
bad,"It's hard to stay competitive with other low labor cost nations producing batteries.  There are hazards to the job that should include Hazard Pay, but that is not a focus when a company is having a hard time competing.  I applaud the current employees for trying to make it work, despite the economic situation."
bad,"A  nivel compañeros muy contenta pero a nivel de Dirección o promoción, no hay desarrollo para el personal."
bad,Very few benefits not able to take a day off for ANYTHING! Long hours most days are 12 hours when you start and you have no vacation for 3 years. Work 6 days a week and have worked 13 days straight. No time for anything other than work.
bad,"les avantages sont donnés aux personnes exercant la délation!!!"
bad,I worked for the company for 7 years. I had no advancement opportunities and no pay increases the last 3 years (but management got raises and bonuses regularly). No leadership from the plant manager down to the supervisors and they don't care about employee safety. I worked directly with the batteries that came from assembly and I WOULD NEVER BUY AN EXIDE BRAND BATTERY. Not a bitter employee but I personally know and saw first hand that they sell bad and defective batteries to customers (many get returned regularly).  The company pays well and has good insurance which is about the only good thing as well as plenty of required overtime.
bad,business decisions and a bad economy forced the corp. to close the plant. If I could have stayed I would have.
bad,The pay is not that bad but it should pay more. People are exposed to lead through all 8hrs. There's changes of security issues that haven't been addressed the correct way.
bad,Decent pay. Long hours. Hot enviornment. Acid burns. Blood lead through the roof. Pressurized hoods when blood levels get too high. Filthy lead paste everywhere. Incredibly hot in certain areas. Management is absolutely terrible.
bad,"Constantly losing customers. The type of company that waits until people quit to offer better pay. Lately the workload has almost doubled with no intention of obtaining additional staff.  Instead shifts have often time just suddenly doubled, increasing to 12-16 hour shifts last minute.  On the plus side if you can hang in there and are willing to relocate there are eventual job opportunities regardless of lack of ability.  If you can make it through the inevitable bankruptcy (I believe this will make 3-4 in the past 10 years) that is coming."
bad,"A nice place to work, conpensation is good.Management dont really reward employees with compliments or positive feedback.The moral of the employees here was was never that good..It is a dirty place to work and they do not emphsize safety."
bad,"Can't clock in until a specified 6 minutes before your shift. Managers and supervisors micromanage and bird dog employees constantly. Cameras in breakdown and at smoking areas. Don't be late from breaks or get written up. Hourly employees can't have cell phones because of ""lead exposure"" but managers, supervisors, and contractors can have them. Union plant and management HATES the hourly worker. Have to make an appointment to see HR if you have a problem. They're so overworked, they can only see you from 2:30-3:30 on Tuesdays or Thursdays. Otherwise, they're too busy watching cameras or trying to catch someone chewing gum. Little to no pay increase. Currently at less than 1% a year. Insurance keeps getting worse each year. Costs increase and coverage decreases. Been in bankruptcy several times in the last few years. Don't pay suppliers and therefore are limited on who will supply them with parts. Management policy it ""make it work"" instead of getting the right supplies. Constant lead, cadmium, acid exposure. Frequent blood  tests. Not enough showers for number of employees. If you're still reading this, please find a better employer."
bad,Muy mal ambiente de trabajo. Demasiadas horas estraordinarias y falta de comunicación vertical. Eres un número y no una persona.
bad,This company recently declared bankruptcy.  The work environment is unsafe at best.  Dust collection systems for the lead dust in the air routinely do not work from lack of parts that are deemed to expensive. During summer temperatures on the work floor are routinely over 100 degrees F. There are little if any cool zones to help stop heat exhaustion.
bad,It consist of 12 hours shifts of high temperatures. I fill orders safely n productively as needed. I learned the history of the lead battery and what it takes to maintain them. It has very poor management. Theres always drama between fellow co-workers and poor attitudes. Very negative enviroment. The hardest part is the stress of all the work and stress that consist of lifting batteries from five pounds -135 pounds. The income is the best part of the job.
bad,i was a blast and reverb operator. so most of the time i was removing hot slag or skimming from lead pots. the furnaces are extermely hot and the lead is poison for your blood.
bad,"I really enjoyed working at exide, but unfortunately the company has closed, otherwise I would still be working there.  i like everything about Exide.  The job pay was good."
bad,"You must work very hard.  This is expected. You are compensated well for this.  I would say this environment is similar to a military one. It is very sink or swim, and it is up to you what you can make of the opportunity."
bad,It is an ok company to work for. But the management team needs work. The employees get a lot of negative feed back until. They had extremely long hour at one point. 6am -10-11pm.
bad,Received very little training or guidance while working in a remote location.  Routinely had to drive more that six hours a day while still being required to work eight hour days.
bad,Work as fast as you can to make product. that over the years management started to worry about production and did not care about employees. Not a good environment to work in at the time. The Continuous work in terrible work environment. Getting my pay check at the end of the week
bad,"It's a good company but a bad plant in Columbus, Georgia. The upper management particularly plant manager, operations manager and human resources manager do not understand the concept of team work. They plot against employees instead of help them. They use people as scapegoats when they are the ones that should be investigated. If corporate don't look further into their actions and behaviors they could be shutting down this facility."
bad,"You make lead acid batteries at Exide which requires you to wear 10lbs of PPE + a respirator at all times while in the plant. During summer is 100% humidity and 100+ degrees, During the winter it's just above freezing, and sometimes below. There is no department in which you can work where you are not going to get Acid, Lead Oxide, or Lead on you. Environment wise this is the most toxic facility I have ever worked at. That being said I made enough money to pay off a 30 year mortgage in 3 years. Like I said, its a horrible job, but great pay if your willing to work in that environment."
bad,"If working for an organization that looses business constantly, is always on the brink of bankruptcy (again), never gives raises, is managed by two individuals who don't have a clue, with a co-worker who backstabs you and others to management, with ZERO room for advancement..."
bad,I really hated the job... it was very hard work... You had toi do a lot of lifting you had to deal with battery acid getting on you... and you were on your feet for 12 hours
bad,"This is a great company to gain experience and develop skills.  Most areas are disjointed and the company has never look at finding best practices and rolling it out as a standard."
bad,"absolutely loved this position because of the great challenge of learning Lead / Acid Gel/AGM Battery production, from raw materials to completed product. So much differing types of equipment here! Lack of skilled management in H.R. as well as engineering really causes this job to be very long and tiring, without leaving newer technicians in place long enough to truly learn that equipment technology. Too many changes in upper personnel, and NO job security, but great pay and benefits."
bad,"We were bought out by another company, no severance pay given. No training in new system. We were informed a week before company switched with no heads up"
bad,Lead recycling factory dirty dusty hazardous work hot molting lead battery acid dangerous work be very careful or you will end up hurt or worse just make sure you know what your getting into working there
bad,"Terrible management. Right from your direct supervisor to the higher up. As an employee I feel very under valued and there’s a ridiculous amount of nepotism as well as rules not applying to some people. One person would be quickly terminated, suspended or generally reprimanded for breaking a rule but others will catch a break for the same thing."
bad,"Poor management all around. Went through 4 managers while I was employed there. Under staffed, but corporate does not approve over time. very stressful work environment"
bad,"There is a huge lack of communication in the entire company.  Managers are provided with very little information, but expected to come out with the best results.  The technology is lacking especially for this type of company."
bad,Implementing new policies that make it impossible for the company to advance. Corporate decisions that directly impact branch directly. Lack of compensation for workers that excel or meet expectations
bad,"I thought I had job security, but they had 3 rounds of layoffs.  I was in the last round and the filed bankruptcy as well.  I did like my position.  The place was very ""clicky"" and cut-throat; you could feel the stress in the office all the time."
bad,"Exide has declared bankruptcy twice in the last ten years, and is still fighting to get out of their current bankruptcy position.  Jobs pay well with decent benefits, but it's a hazardous, lead-filled work environment.  Promotions are based on seniority - not performance results.  Management/executive leadership focuses more on some departments while leaving others to fend for themselves.  They could be a great company if things ever turn around, but it doesn't seem too likely."
bad,“Indirect Labor” gets the most work and least pay in the production process of the job. It’s fast passed and they expect you to move mountains while not properly compensating for the job done!
bad,"Exide is a great place to work if you want good benefits, lots of hours! If you can handle 110 degree work temperature and manually labor and long  excessive hours with only one day off a week, this is the job for you!"
good,"Currently a disaster, mastering any skills is difficult, training is non-existent."
good,"Union shop which was good, but the union is only as strong as its members. Dirty place to work with plenty of health hazards around. Most of the managment team was a joke."
good,"The only bad thing about working at Exide was lacking of communication.You didn't know about something till at the last minute.Just like when they closed down,no warning whatsoever. The workers were great to work with,the supervisors some were good some just terrible. Other than that it was just a poorly managed company."
good,"Constant change of work schedule with short notice. Unable to properly manage people, plant and materials. All around unsecure place to be employed."
good,lots of good people and great supervisors. uncertain future. company went through bankruptcy and is now in proccess of laying off people and giving loyal employee paycuts.
good,any small mistake made could get you screamed at by supervisors. much like a day at boot camp in the army. It was degrading. The majority of employees were very arrogant and unaccepting of new people .Monthly blood testing for lead exposure .required heavy rubber resparators in unbearable heat.This was not an enjoyable place to work.
good,Not a good environment for advancement. Micromanaged and controlled. Too many people wanting to do your job and not allowing you to do it as you were hired to do.
good,There is little chance for advancement unless you know someone and share a beer with them after work.  Nothing is based on hard work or dedication tot the company.
good,Good pay check you will get to work alot of hours.The job requires that you have to wear a respirator and have to shave daily you get a 30 min.break and two 15min.break on a 8hr.shift.
good,No family life period 6 to 7 days 10-12 hour shifts and when you do have time off you just wanna rest and sleep no family time. You are supposed to work just like a machine none stop but is expected to have the same production and quality after working months of 50+ hours a week.5they want you to use all your vacation time up so you can have days off.
good,"One of the toolmakers that resurrected the company's, second generation, tooling that had engineering flaws after years of service and production. Spent quite, substantial time, resurrecting a shambles, talk about your fixer upper ! Great Pay, substantial injuries on the job, without company support. One had to seek medical attention on one's vacation and tight point system. Almost made ten years in this company. I felt I could have been offered a third weeks vacation at eight years of employment. Worked above and beyond to improve this company while, well, it didn't matter."
good,This job was a very demanding job. The work conditions were almost unbearable in the summer and winter. Due to cooking of cells of batteries to summer temperature exceeded 100 degrees with the blowers blowing hot air. During the winter months the blowers blew cold air.
good,il faut gérer le stress quotidiens et le manques d'effectifs
good,"Typical Day: Depending on your job and/or shift depends on your start time. You show up, clock in, change into your uniform, don your respirator and head to your department. You'll either sweat to death or freeze to death. You'll work your butt off with little to no appreciation from most supervisors. "
good,My Job Profile is :-
good,Pay and benefits are good. Work with hazardous materials. Management micro manages all aspects of the company. They aren’t open to ideas except from a select few people.
good,L'ambiente lavorativo è abbastanza ottimo.purtroppo respirare polveri di piombo e acido solforico può portare problemi di salute abbastanza gravi
good,if you can deal with lead for 10hrs or more and wearing respirator then its not so bad. also its not a climate control facility. depending what position you have. it could be cold during winter and very hot in summer.
good,"Loved working with the people.  They were great and usually had your back.  If you needed help doing something someone was there to help.  If things were not being done correctly, someone would tell you before getting in trouble.  The work was extremely hard, although the company considered it medium.  Most jobs allowed for short rests between procedures.  Excruciating heat and numbing cold. Proper procedures not posted and not shared very easily.  Employees held their knowledge close.  Management was completely oblivious to what was going on in the workplace. They didn't care about employees lives outside of work, only that the job got done and they made their numbers for the corporate office.  Worked most holidays.  The pay was better than most in the area but lowest in the corporation for people doing the same job.  The people were the best part of the job.  Some were the best friends to have and the worst people to work with.  This was the best job I ever had and I wish I was still there."
good,At Exide I was a Maintenance Tech keeping the battery recycling machines up and running.  I enjoy the maintenance side of the job.  I took pride in helping to train others in the field.  Hardest part of the job was having to wear a full face mask/respirator because of the lead in the air.
good,"they pushed you very hard for numbers, instead of quality!"
good,"Start work at 8 am every day. First thin as I get in, is Log into Kronos to timestamp."
good,"The work was dangerous but the pay was good. Worked with toxic lead, but they tried to take all precautions to protect us."
good,Hardworking and loyal staff. unfortunately the company suffers from a long history of underinvestment and poor management that had left much to be recovered to make it a sustainable company. Good luck to the team left there
good,"Exide is a good place to work if you are a hard worker who likes to make a lot of money. The 12 hour shifts can be tough at times but you get used to it after about a month. You have to change into a company jumpsuit in the morning and wear a respirator on your face all day because the plant is literally filled with poison (lead oxide) in some areas. The pace is extreme at times especially for someone trying to learn how things work. Once you get off the 90 day probationary period there’s MANDATORY overtime every single week. You will work 5-6 twelve hour days some weeks. All things considered though, bringing home 1000 some weeks with nothing more than a GED is hard to argue with."
good,Exide is a good company on the way up.  It has career advancement opportunities.  It has now gotten its cost structure in line and is positioned for success within its industry.
good,"I would recommend Exide if you really enjoy working in the manufacturing field, the benefits are not bad, but this is my first full time job, I would definitely recommend this place"
good,"A very busy place to work.  I managed the warehouse with only one helper two days a week. I had two delivery drivers, so I had to call all customers to check on orders, package them and load them on the trucks."
good,"This job consisted of a lot of lifting, twisting and working with your hands. Not for the weak bodied. Long 12 hour shifts in a hot production floor covered in plastic that is covered in acid."
good,"The environment is always extremely hot, even more so during the summer time.  If you are a newer employee you could be bid out of a job without knowing it, and if you are hired to an off shift good luck getting to 1st."
good,"Great warehouse staff, but both head offices leave something to be desired. A typical day in the warehouse was tedious and very repetitive. Delivery driving was the best, especially my out of town runs."
good,The work environment was very hot and dangerous. Supervisors varied some good and some not so good but overall a fulfilling job until unforeseen circumstances arose in which I was needed somewhere else.
good,"It was Hot place to work, wore air helmets, air mask.  This place was for more speed than quality."
good,"it is a factory, it is a very dirty place to work and the management shuffle is outrageous, there is not a lot of continuity in in management. there is a very popular saying there, don't worry what the bosses say because next week he won't matter."
good,When I first started to work for Exide it was a great place to work and they treated their employees with the respect that they deserved. When the new management took over they stopped caring about the employees.
good,Not really that bad of a place to work if you have a good work ethic.A lot of hours but overtime after 40 hours. It's battery delivery so there is a lot of heavy lifting and stacking. You need to be strong and fast.
good,"it was alright, met a lot of people,I think diversity was one of their strongest points, cause there was a lot of people from different areas in one place and it was a good feeling, did not feel like an outcast at all so its good"
good,"Long days at work went by fast because you were always busy."
good,"My day to day activities as a supervisor are very hectic with little to know learning curve for a new employee coming into this company. I thrive on a challenge however with the challenge comes the opportunity to succeed when given new ask to do, not to be given a new task to fail. In a nutshell Exide is and can be a much more successful company with all of their employees if structure is set and everyone has a clear understanding of the direction of the company with managers communicating with supervisors, to supervisors getting the proper information to inform direct reports overall vision for the company. I can say that Exide has many employees who have been there just as long as I've been alive however I have heard from the employees themselves its because of the monetary compensation that made them hang around not the organization of the company."
good,"The typical day consisted of a 12 hour shift of demending physical labor in either very hot or cold conditions. Picking orders at full speed in order to keep up with finishing lines."
good,Exide was a great experince the company has great benifits and the people I worked with where a great group of people.
good,A good company with good pay! A company that demands hard work and long hours but rewards its employees with good community outreach and family programs
good,"It paid the bills, most employees are friendly hard working. Company does not like to fix problems. 12 hr days are not uncommon and sometimes there is no end in sight."
good,"Because Exide has declared bankruptsy a few times, the turn over is immense. Because of the turnover, they have issues establishing good cultural values."
good,I love that they job is Mon-Fri. But they have too many lay offs. Supervisor on 3rd shift seems to always be intoxicated. And they dont have many pay raises. Just cost of living raises.
good,"It can be a good place to work depending on your department/supervisor and management. You will be required to wear a jumpsuit and possibly a respirator, and shower at the facility as well as get routine blood draws to test lead levels. My department had poor management. Supervisors had very little communication with each other. Most of the time they asked me what I was supposed to be doing for the day! I had a lot of mandatory overtime"
good,They shutdown with out us knowing and left everyone jobless was a great place to work and environment i learned alot of different skills at exide amd most paid job i ever had
good,"The people are great, the equipment could be better. There are several instances of ad-hoc solutions being welded in place, which can be frustrating when one is told to hurry up and fix something that really wasn't even installed the right way."
good,Exide provided me with the opportunity to advance in my career. It also gave me a chance to grow and learn the world of Safety. I gained vast knowledge and experience working in the field.
good,New CEO and CIO are working fast to change the culture and lead the company in the right direction.  Processes need updating. and the HR department must figure out how to reverse the trend of employee turnover within the company.
good,"Typical day at work is dependent on your position. They con you in with a 3 days on 4days on strategy. You get your proper schedule for about 2 weeks then are forced 72+ hrs a week. Only good shift out there is day shift. Day shift gets paid decent, leaves early, an doesn't require 72+ hr work weeks. Very good pay however managers determine your employment. You can do your job very well and properly yet still get terminated. Warehouses are way outdated, have to remember all battery types by location and number; nothings really labeled in the warehouses as it is all ran down needs redesigned. They mix an RF system with an old paper system very confusing at times. Managers can be extremely rude, if you have a family and are not on A shift your relationships will be ruined. Lead is an issue can cause major problems."
good,"Work is slow some days and fast another, make sure all paperwork is in order, everyone has to be on same page everyday. Hardest part is getting people to work weekends."
good,"good place to start out after college. was a stepping stone to better job. my manager was good, but my heart wasn't in the work so it wasn't very fulfilling."
good,New management team from Michelin has been on board for approximately 3 years. The company overall is a very nice place to work and the team is very driven.
good,A typical day at Exide was different  depending on the work schedule every day their was a different outcome because of the work Environment we had different people from different t parts of the u.s.because the company was the only one in the west coast .
good,"My normal day started with routing orders to be pulled finished and staged. Daily equipment and quality audits, Contacting customers and inputting orders. Shipping and receiving. Coordinating with the operations manager on daily duties.Keeping files and documentation up to date."
good,"Shortly after I started working the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy.  This created numerous challenges to get work completed and many individuals left or were asked to leave the company."
good,Need better benefits and more raises. This would help with the moral and turnover Need to do random drug testing. They need to crack down on people that don’t obey the rules. But overall it’s a decent place to work.
good,"Great company until they filed bankruptcy."
good,"Exide holds a promising career for many individuals without any post-secondary education.  With the possibility for advancement, one could make a career out of any job at the facility.  That being said, Exide is a very dangerous environment to work in daily (health, safety, and environment)."
good,Compensation was adequate for the job and area.  Facility was adequate but could have used updates.  Management culture was accurate for this type of business.
good,"Cannot advance unless you are buddies with higher ranks."
good,Closed sales area after working for the company. I really liked working in route sales and traveling all over Indiana. This is something I am looking forward to finding again.
good,not a bad place to work management was not the best but i made the best of it. more worried about production # then the safety of the employees at times
good,"Exide is a place where you can express yourself and are rewarded for hard work. There is a lot of lean manufacturing training and opportunities to make improvements. Unfortunately Upper management has made some poor decisions,usually because of budget problems. Lots of good people in a company struggling to survive."
good,"At the London warehouse, ( which doesn't exist anymore), batteries arrived up to 3 x weekly, all just black case. The product had to then be sorted and set up for labeling. Product was first volt checked then labeled to customer specs, and then picked to orders and set up for shipping. All employees handling product needed to be TDG certified."
good,"I work in the elements, when its hot its hot, and when its cold its cold.  I appreciate hard work and this job is nothing less.  There is a lot of heavy lifting on a daily basis. management sometimes seems a little confused, they will tell you one thing and you will do another. There are a lot of good people that work there, hardships with bankruptcies has put a lot of stress and demand on different departments in the plant.  The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to work along-side good friends in which I have established great relationships."

good,Exide Technologies provided me with many valuable skills that I am able to take with me to future prospects.
good,Excelente componente de aprendizagem e um ambiente de trabalho exemplar
good,A typical day at Exide starts of getting batteries load on trucks to be shipped out. Then once your finished with that you have to wait until all the new orders are finished being placed which could take up to 5 hours. I didn't have any coworkers in the warehouse with me so i worked by myself majority of the time.
good,Cela m'a permis d'avoir ma première expérience professionnelle en tant que Intérimaire Entreprise intéressante
good,"No union, workers unhappy. Tried to make workers get tons of overtime."

good,love my job. i have many responsibilities.  I am just needing a change  
good,"Good place to work, but job secureity was an issue following 2 large lay offs in a couple of year. Around 200 were laid off the first time and 300 the third time."
good,job was very detailed with keeping track of purchases and completing purchase orders daily.worked hand in hand with suppliers to make the company better
good,this was not one of my favorite jobs its very hot and strenuous on your body but it was a job and it paid the bills
good,You show up for your 12 hour shift and change into your uniform. You go into the plant for a short meeting then take over for outgoing shift. You will be working hard from beginning to end of your shift. The temperature is well over 100 degrees inside and you spend the majority of your time standing over lead with a temperature range of 600 to 1500 degrees. You will use 40 and 90 pound jackhammers frequently. The work is very hard but you can take a break in a cool down shed whenever you feel overheated. You will work 3 days on have 3 days off one week then 4 on 4 off the next week. After 60 day probation your pay jumps to your department maximum. This is a union job so it sucks paying monthly dues but you have to pay even if you don't want to be in the union.
good,I was the EHS Manager for a battery plant with about 250 employees.  The work environment was tough with heavy workloads and a hot plant.  Pay was very good for employees for the area.
good,"A typical work day consists of connecting test equipment and compiling the data. I have learned to set up and operate test equipment in chemical lab for lead and acid analysis, also mixing chemicals needed for testing. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people and their knowledge they bring to the company."
good,"Great place to work but management at corporate level is floundering"
good,"12 hour days, required overtime, work in high temperatures, managers more interested in getting the job done than in individuals, teamwork among co-workers to complete the job.  I liked having the ability to work without being overly supervised and accomplishing the daily tasks."
good,I enjoyed my time here with a great team of commodity managers. What a great group of guys! 
good,"The position granted many opportunities to advanced my skill set and learn about a variety of equipment and processes; furthermore, it allowed ample freedom to generate projects based upon need and data."
good,My job as a circuit tender was very challenging and different from any other job that I have had. I really loved working as a circuit tender. I enjoyed working with most of the people and I really learned a lot about batteries in the time that I was employed with exide technologies.
good,Long Stressful Days Poor Ventalation No Secure JOb Security Bad Managaement . Work 7 Days A week 10 Hours Ready To Find New Job That Treats Me Better.
good,Very productive lean work force. Research & Development group assignments were all interesting and technically challenging. Management encouraged and created an atmosphere for innovative staff problem solving along with pleasant constructive work environment.
good,Long hours in rough condition no days off for months at a time . not a place for a family man.
good,start day with safety meeting and all that we needed to get accomplished that day.      I learned that there are so many type of batteries for so many different things.  Management was great. They always treated you good as long as you did your job and stayed away from drama in the work place.  Hardest part of the job was lifting and tugging 150 to 175lb batteries.  I enjoyed putting the plaques on the batteries and volt checking them. I hated to see it shut its doors in Bristol operations.  I could have seen myself there for a long time.
good,"flexible scheduling, "
good,fast and kinda hard at first but when u first start the training needs more to it..i always worked 12hrs days due to i liked doing what i did and there is always overtime .some management r very good on doing there job but there is some that really dont care what is going on..the hardest part of job is if u dont have teammates helping u because its one team one vision..and the training i think should be longer and actacally show them how to do the job right.the most enjoyable part of job is it a challange and i love challanges..
good,I liked working for Exide sorry to hear it was gonna close people were good to work with and supervisors were good where I worked.  I had a lot of good years there.
good,My typical day at work consists of meeting customer orders to tight deadlines. I have learned alot about the warehouse industry and also achieved my fire marshall and first aid certificate in my four years at this company.The management are highly professional and fair and my co-workers all work to the best of my ability.
good,Its one of the better paying jobs in the surrounding areas. It's a hazardous environment to work in and can be dangerous to your health. The hours can vary from 40 hours per week to over 60.
good,"Due to the branch relocating and existing employees did not want to transfer, the company hired a brand new staff and we worked together and set standards and policies to make it work for everyone. We made it our own. It was fast paced and we were self trained The difficult part that we dealt with was not having managers directly in the same building. They were located in different states within the United States and they were always responsible for other branches. So, being able to have the support when it was needed, lacked at times."
good,"J'ai été ravie de travailler pour une si bonne entreprise."
good,"This company provides health care, paid-time-off, and other benefits to employees. Environment was fast-paced. Typical factory setting; cold in the winter and hot/humid during the summer."
good,It’s a very nice job. The hour cuts and sometimes our benefits are not very well. Strict guidelines are required. I do my job there very well. Sometimes very stressful.
good,Exide Technologies is a very dynamic industry leader in a worldwide market. Exide has always found a way to excel in a very old automotive and industrial market
good,"Initial training was given but did not seem to have enough ongoing training available.  "

good,Exide is a good place and good company to work for. The only problem is that they are struggling financially because they have filed for two section 3 bankruptcy since 2006.
good,"problem solving, implementing Toyota Production Systems programs, Implement A3’s, Supervision of production, successfully managed production activities so all orders were shipped on time, Investigated and implement ideas for quality improvement, increased productivity and cost reduction, managed documentation of and training on production procedures and work instructions, made sure that products were produce on time and are of good quality, set up and verified the functionality of safety equipment"
good,"I worked in two plants, Manchester, Ia and Bristol, Tn. The Manchester plant was a GEM ! Great people, wonderful management, just a great place over all ! Bristol, however was at the other end of the spectrum, its hard to believe they were the same company, however the pay, benefits and home life were good."
good,Exide allowed me to provide for my family for many years. Their pay was above average but the company required extreme dedication to remain employed. I feel I can work anywhere after having been employed with Exide.
good,Trabalho muito exigente mas muito recompensador a todos os níveis

good,"The current CEO is doing a good job of turning the company around  after coming out of bankruptcy. Sometimes the communication from corporate to the plants is lacking, but overall, I give the company a positive review."
good,You would take over for the shift that was there before you when you first come in. You have to pay good attention to your parts that you make. Management is always taking suggestions into consideration. I feel like other roles there should be paid more.
good,"The pay and benefits are excellent, but management is lacking and bottom line employees aren't appreciated. There are a lot of people who have been able to work there for a long time, but the turnover rate seemed very high."
good,Job is nice for inside work. It can get really hot while wearing a full face respirator and working around molten metal kettles with temperatures over 1000 degrees Fahrenheit.
good,I liked working everyday over there and the Boss is super friendly. All the necessary training was provided and every one was very cooperative to begin with
good,"Rated job twice a year, hot climate due to the humidity of working with batteries, some heaving lifting in casting, worked with acid & electricity while charging the batteries."
good,"Not a horrible place to work.  Departments seem to be at odds with each other.  Facility wide needs major repair.  Employees are very diverse which sometimes causes problems between them, otherwise very hard workers."
good,"I worked out of town for awhile until I got into the local routte."
good,"Constant change."
good,it was okay just really bad for your health but pay good and really good benefits but some overtime required without warning
good,I was a teacher before doing this type of work. It wasn't easy to get used to it but it is an union job and the pay is good and the time away is even better. C shift is working nights at the beginning of the week and is a great team to learn from.
good,I would recommend Exide as a good place of employment. It benefited me a lot working there. The whole process of how the lead is made is very interesting.
good,"HOT! Lead in your blood can be harmful, no life outside work with all the overtime. Money is the only thing that keeps you there and the benefits are a plus"
good,Well protected in the hazardous conditions far as uniforms and safety . Working a lot of hours 6 and 7 days . Break room was clean on the hour every days
good,Great company to work for plenty of overtime available if desired good benefits and company provides good safety training and safety awareness very fast pace environment with high production requirements
good,Exide was one of my favorite jobs. It paid very well and I learned a lot from my time there. If the management had been better I would have loved my job even more. Given that I would still highly recommend Exide Technologies to anyone who wants a good paying job to make a career out of.
good,"Étant restée 6 mois, ils m'ont donné de belles opportunités pour pouvoir faire plus au sein de l'entreprise."
good,Después de muchos años de trabajar allí tuve la oportunidad de promocionarme.
good,"On average checking machine and performing general maintenance during break downs, checking product for quality at the end of each cycle."
good,"It was a nice place to work, with excellent co-workers, and environment. The hardest part was the heat from the furnaces, I learned you must keep the production going 24/7. The management can change orders at any moment."
good,its hot... the hours are long... and it can be hard work...  but the pay is good... management is fair to everyone...
good,"Overall this company was a good experience that help me gain essential work skills such as responsibility, organization, and to meet deadlines."
good,"I handled all paperwork for the line, checked that the product was up to the plants standards. I learned a lot about my machine and my teammates areas and the basics to be able to run their machines. After a few months, I found my line group and the three of us worked very well together. If part of a machine went down than the other two would keep our areas running and help once the other persons section is fixed."
good,Typical energetic work day. Daily downtime force you to improve your multitasking skills. Teamwork within the workplace was a high. Lots of  time the lacking in inventory parts would be due to management issues. The benefits package is great. The hours are sometimes long and draining.
good,"Exide is a okay place to work, its a lot of repetition. For the most part its an easy job. Weekly paycheck is why I stayed there for as long as I did. Its a warehouse so its dirty oil, plastic trimmings an lugs on the floor is common, its an okay place to work. They always need people on 3rd shift, the manager is okay once you make an impression on him, if you have a good work ethic an can deal with warehouse gossip apply."
good,Like everything is laid back. Bosses were nice. They arent so strict with anything other then safety. Do your job and its pretty much laid back throughout your shift. Shower after shift over to get any leads off of you.
good,Loved my time at Exide! Great company for advancement with fair expectations and compensation. Lots to learn and plenty of opportunity to shine if you are willing to work hard and gain knowledge.
good,"I made my own schedule, prospected, serviced customers, solved problems, and made customer happy. The territory was acceptable for the travel I had to do."
good,"Exide is a good place to work.  They are making moves to make it a great company.  The work was enjoyable.  Enjoyed the Customer interaction and relationships.  The many changes in direction, management, and structure after emerging from reorganization was challenging."
good,Responsible for all daily production entries and any financial performances on a day to day operations.  At month end and beginning performed the month end close and reported to our corporate office.  Responsible for reporting results and variances that   were created from month end financials. Worked closely with various employees and other managers in the office. Very good relationship. The hardest part of the job was the extra travel that was required.  Some were at difficult time for family responsibilities.  The enjoyable part of my job was being able to report good results to corporate and and local employees.
good,I worked here for nearly a year and a half and bumped heads with the branch manager on a daily basis. He's a very hard person to work with and everything is a catch 22. If your in a driving position it would be much easier to tolerate the work. Being the warehouse manager/ supervisor was no fun. Pay and benefits were great as well as the overtime. Other than that it's a very unorganized last minute type of run workplaces due to the branch manager.
good,"It was a very testy time for me when i started because i was working in the smelter extremely hot year round especially during the summer months, however i moved up rather quickly"
good,"Great job to have. The company takes good care of you. No big complaints here."
good,"Got more experience driving, also managed my time doing deliveries.  Very professional. A lot of psychical activity involved in the job. Long hours and sometimes had to drive out of state."
good,"At the time of my employment job security was excellent.  My supervisor was very easy going and as long as I did what was expected I had very little contact with him.  Benefits were good, getting time off was never a problem and the atmosphere was pleasant."
good,"Did not care to much for sitting in a cubical all day on the phone, but I did how ever enjoy the conversations and accomplishments I was able to make over the phone. Moving lead from one location to another. I maintained two of the largest smelters in the central region of the US. And it was quite challenging. Friendly competition was always around with fellow co-workers and great incentives."
good,"This job was amazing. I miss the co-workers and the customers. I was planning to retire from there in the future. However, I did not like how things were handled from upper management when I had a cut in hours, and how upper management did not care."
good,"Produce batteries daily, strive to hit target numbers.  Safety , quality and production.  Coach, train and develop staff and team leads.  Follow and implement Safety."
good,"I am very honored to have worked Exide Technologies, the people that I have worked with we're very helpful for me to learn my job, but what I mostly like about  Exide Technologies was caring about the workers safety they show a lot of concern and compassion. The job wasn't hard because everybody worked together,helping each other out. I am glad that exide Technologies give me a chance. I will miss    them."
good,"Managed a national network of 3rd party contractors providing preventative maintenance and on call service to several national accounts. "

good,"Check attendance, do write ups for supervisors.  Keep track of vacation days, perfect attendance.  Put all new and changes into the maintenance file in META4 for all employees. "
good,Great people but always worried about tomorrow. They don't want to lay off folks but seem to be in a constant battle to cut costs.
good,"I worked at the Columbus, GA office where it felt like BCBS took advantage of workers being in a position to work for less. Most companies would take advantage of the same thing but my experience was with Blue Cross so I can't say I'm sorry I left."

good,"It was trying during the first couple of years having to deal with suppliers calling in for payment while the company worked out its bankruptcy situation. I've learned that hard work and dedication will get a company out of a slump and back into good standing. I was also able to be promoted during my seven year stint working in this kind of grueling environment. My co-workers were solid people, hard working individuals that made up a great team.

good,"Overall, a typical workday as a Quality Auditor. I learned a lot about batteries in the automotive field. Immediate supervision was top notch. I simply couldn't ask for better co-workers. The worst part of the job was maintaining the highest level of workmanship during the shutdown and closure of the facility, but that was eased considerably due to the excellence of the people in the work force. Their continued excellence and pride in their work gave me the strength and courage to continue to the last battery with the rest of the team! I cannot stress enough the degree of professionalism I was honored to be part of that I found in the Exide Bristol workforce."
good,"The job was simple. Processing truck load of batteries and cores in and out. Yes it may have been stressful some days when the end of the year inventory came but it was well worth it. The employees were very friendly and helpful, no one was ever stuck on a task by themselves."

good,When I would get to work the first thing I would do is bring trucks onto the scale to get weighed and send them to the appropriate docks. Then when the trucks came down out of the lot I would weigh them out and sign their paperwork or give them a bill of lading if they were taking a load of lead out of the plant. The co-workers were absolutely wonderful to work with. We were like a family. I really enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basis and loved when I got to be the actual shipping and receiving clerk for the day and got to schedule shipments in and out of the plant.
