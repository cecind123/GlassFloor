rating,review
bad,Terrible company and culture.  I really have nothing else to say.  The people are terrible and management is  terrible. worst company I've ever worked for.
bad,"I had security of working there and be able to retired.  I was able to have flexible hours. Till new president and CEO take over the business, it is getting hard to work and have good business relationship with co-workers.  Only people get promote one who has relationship with upper management, family business."
bad,"Gender discrimination. Lazy and incompetent developers are not fired requiring the good ones to pick up the slack creating resentment. Computers are very old and break constantly. Vacations are frequently denied because of project mismanagement. Death march projects are the norm. Devs are expected to work extra hours every day to do operator tasks. The DBAs, network team, QA, and business analysists are all incompetent. Change control software doesn't work and upper management refuses to improve or replace it. No modern development methodologies like DevOps, CI, or Agile. Culture of political optics, blame, and gaslighting employees. Low wall cubicles have no privacy. No documentation on custom software products. No tiered software support levels. New CEO is out of touch. Devs have to work even when they are ill. The facility is in disrepair. Time theft is rampant. There is so much technical debt it is unsurmountable by current staff levels. Upper managers are hired straight from technical positions and have no formal training in how to properly lead people. The team leads are great, but they are given no authority and their suggestions are ignored and in some cases even resented by upper management."
bad,"Mutual of America offers below average salary ranges for each job category. The benefits are average - nothing special. There is high turnover because you can make more money elsewhere in NYC. There is always a shortage of staff for each department, and not much gets done in a timely manner. Management is very strange because most top management is over 60 years old and have been with the company for over 20-30 years! Therefore, the company does not use best practices in each department. They are way behind in product offering, technology and compliance."
bad,"Nepotism rampant- bonus structure is a riddle.  Toxic work environment."
bad,Management does not care about its employees despite porpoting to be a people first company.  Many people work 7 days a week for below market rate pay.  No remote accommodation
bad,"Company promotes doing what is right for the client.  Internally, it is all about numbers.  Management is poor, and disconnected from field sales and processes."
bad,"Mutual of America is a place for workers who have gained experience elsewhere to go and retire not a place to start and grow."
bad,"Entry level position, good for a year or three. No advancement opportunity. Was able to earn series 6 License and learn financial terms as well as make financial trades and withdrawals from retirement plans."
bad,"Mutual of America is behind in regards to technology, and is not interested in adapting to the new age of technology. Little room for growth. Pay is very low."
bad,"No job advancement, no training, and bad management. Pay is low and hard to get promoted. Also no marketing and only cold calls."
bad,"Good place to retire but not a good place if looking to start your career and grow."
bad,"Typical day work consist of taking about 450 to 550 inbound calls a day, and process high volumes of withdrawal request in compliance with Finra and SEC regulations, in my time there i had a raise and was moved to the withdrawal department, but the company culture and management was not what i expect from multinational company like Mutual of america."
bad,"Excellent Benefits and Work/ Life Balance BUT no one wants to take responsibility for anything yet Employees so involved at the water cooler a company conference was themed ""Do your job"". Plenty of red tape. Takes forever to get any tasks done (including bringing in business). Antiquated technological and operational systems."
good,"Work load increases with each employees departure, and not being replaced; with no compensation adjustment for increased responsibilities."
good,"no annual raises, no support staff help. you have to get by on you own attrition by retirement, no planning outside consultants have more say than long standing employees"
good,"The management at this company needs a lot of work. Their style is very much ""Stick and carrot"" regarding work incentive. The micro management is over the top at this company and they still strongly enforce cold calling (200 minimum dials a week). Also there is no room for advancement into management."
good,"constantly micromanaged, still using software from the 80's, you get 18 days paid vacation you cant take because call center is understaffed, asked to stay extra hours because they are understaffed, no promotions, no salary increases, very conservative"
good,"Could not complain about the benefits. Only problem was with top management in Boca. Saw way too many people get promoted by who they knew not what they knew. For most of the people in computer operations it was a dead end department. No chance for advancement in tech support, PC group or programming. They always hired outside for that."
good,I moved up in this company a and made decent money for the area but the pay was not in line with the amount expected from you. Poor training and high stress.
good,"Wonderful company, great team members.  Sucked didn't pass.test when ai could have made a difference.  I wish them the best in all their endeavors.   Good luck."
good,The company is a good place to work but needs to focus on improving technology. The company also needs to look at the number of staff members to improve moral.
good,The department that i'm working at is quite stressful but overall MOA is a relaxing place to work at if you don't need to worry about making enough money to pay bills. They offer pretty good health insurance. I have learned a lot from this company.
good,"This was a great place to work, however they are not flexible if you have a family issue."
good,MoA provided me with the opportunity to join a reputable company who placed a great emphasis on their employees.  I enjoyed my time with the company working for a great boss.
good,"Good for anyone looking for entry level work for retirement basics."
good,"The quality of work probably depends on each regional office and the quality each office manager. If you have a fantastic manager, it would probably be great."
good,Depending on your department it can be an enjoyable experience. Overall the culture is old-school and very traditional and not much room for growth unless someone retires. Underpaid for the workload but is balanced out with the benefits.
good,"Determined the continuing eligibility of a caseload of more than 500 "
good,Great company to work for. Coworkers are great people. Office space is big. Learned a lot about life insurance and saving for retirement.
good,Mutual of America was a great company to work for however did not allow for telemarketing rep to give any guidance or recommendation to clients.
good,Old established financial firm trying to catch up in the technology world. Nice to have benefits  first day but would prefer shorter vesting period for pension.
good,"My job consist of filing legal documentation that requires legal approval from insurance departments. Correspondence with the insurance departments is key to learning and developing insurance provisions for the insurance contract becoming approved. Such contracts require the understanding of regulatory and statute of law from insurance codes per state. Once approval of such contract must be develop in a process that requires the use of Exstream software which requires complex coding and development under a Object Oriented Platform. Mutual of America has basically taught me how to develop contracts while understanding legalese and programming applications."
good,The benefits here are better than one can find almost anywhere.  The company has trouble getting rid of poor performers and does not promote high performers; unless you're friends with someone important.
good,"Overall working here was an alright experience, good benefits and not that hard of work.  Biggest downside was dealing with co-workers that would throw you under the bus to clients, and the micro-managing supervisors. Not comparable to most large brokerage firms. While on the clock Co-workers and management care more about their own personal lives and bring their drama into work."
good,"If you already have the skills, it is a fantastic environment.  It lacks the resources to train and develop young talent.  Mutual truly cares about their clients and stresses customer service."
good,"Overall, I like working for this company.  However, poor local management has sullied my time here and made things difficult to continue.  As much good as there is bad with this company.  The position/location makes a huge difference within the organization."
good,I have a disability which made my job difficult to do. I eventually lost this job because I had to go to too many doctor appointments.
good,"I liked working for the company but certain people were promoted to run an office because they wrote a lot of business that their managers helped to write, These people ran offices because of that but were not trained to run an office. Some of them were horrible and very arrogant. America is very clicky. If you're not in the click, you will not move up or you will get fired. I liked what i did but the pay is horrible and the goals are very unreachable because of the way the job is structured. At one point the goal was 9 Million dollars, They expect you to reach that goal and no extra bonuses or any type of commission paid along with salary. That is unreasonable."
good,Good for career starters who are looking for developing their skills and knowledge. Open to mold young graduates into responsible professionals. Very much sociable and family oriented. Not much room for growth and career advancement.
good,"Company takes good care of employees.  Offer great benefits, paid time off, incentive compensation and pension plan.  Great location on Park Avenue."
good,Mutual of America is a very simple retirement plan company. They provide excellent benefits but there aren't enough divisions to be able to be promoted or transfer departments.
good,The Company supports their employees. They promote unity and teamwork. Coworkers become more like friends and family. You have the ability to grow with the Company when you're eager to learn.
good,"Good Benefits including a matching 401K and a company funded pension plan. A good enviornment to work in."
good,"I enjoyed the professionalism and history of MOA. Being an intern in the purchasing department, I've actually learned a lot of intangible skills."
good,Worked as a seasonal temp in a mail room environment. Everyone seemed nice. The stay was short and a position was offered but the traveling was an issue.
good,"Mutual is niche-market retirement company. They have great company values, and it is a warm, welcoming environment to work in. The company is lagging in the technology front, and that is a hindrance everyday on the job. Mutual offers great benefits, and does not lay off employees, however there is very limited room for advancement."
good,I enjoyed my time and the work I accomplished with Mutual Of America very much and I gained a lot of experience with customer service while I was there.
good,good place to work no room to grow would be only downfall. supervisors was nice co workers was nice hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for long periods of time

good,"I really enjoyed working with them.  I really liked the people I worked with....my dates of employment where from 1989 to 1994, in Atlanta, GA."
good,This company was a great learning experience. I interned there between my junior and senior year and I felt that it was very helpful. I was able to use classroom knowledge and apply it to real world situations as well as getting a feel for what it is like working in a professional environment. My supervisors were excellent and always willing to answer questions. They do expect you to do actual work which I felt was very valuable. You are given responsibility and held accountable.
good,"I worked from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. I've learn a lot about the Mutual funds and coporate actions. My management were mostly fair. My co-workers were mostly supportive and pleasant. I loved working there. Although I had to work on certain holidays. Nevertheless, I was compensated for those days. The most"
good,"The company has a great friendly environment. All employees and upper management are approachable. Company also cares for their employees. A lot of sports team, internal events, and great benefits."

good,Great beginning building to learn and train on knowledge of package units as well as environmental controls issues using apogee/Desigo system. Taught me the ropes of what it take to be a PRODUCTIVE engineer
good,I can't wait to work there again. They treated me very well as an intern and I learned so much about office culture and job expectations. I am applying there now I hope to work there  again.
good,"This was a great job,  however I felt mislead when I was informed that I had 90 days to pass and exam.  Its more like you have 30 days to pass. The food here is great, the pay is great and the benefits are awesome. The people are great as well."
good,"Staff are very friendly and helpful. If you were to have any issues or need help, it's not a problem. Environment is also clean and safe. Food plaza is a plus located right outside of the building."
good,A company that cares about employee's and clients. Could have a better service division.
good,"Awesome company great people to work with easy job granted a temporary  job but I loved it and will miss them.  I scanned files, did mailings, made copies and fax to main office in New York. also opened and processed mail"
good,Formal office atmosphere was a very useful introduction to a professional environment. Co-workers very very helpful. Internship program included classes on public speaking and business etiquette. Interns are well paid. Very valuable experience overall.
good,"Great place to work with potential to advance if you put in the effort. Can quickly get promoted and potential for advancement if you work hard enough."
good,"It's like you are at New York, you get to eat for 3 dollars lunch and breakfast, pay very low taxes , like 200 dollars a year. Good place to work, lots of dirty old men chasing young girls. Job easy if you know mainframe"
good,"My boss was great, very knowledgeable and helpful. Kind and considerate. The people were nice, stressful at times because you're working with Sales people trying to meet their quota. All in all it was a good place to work."
good,Work at Mutual was very straight to the point. It’s an old company with an old system that still works well for them. Loyal employees at a standard office.
good,"I loved working for this company. I worked for them for 5 1/2 years until I had to relocate to Florida. I tried to stay with the company down here,but there were no openings in my field."
good,"Great place 5 out of 5 Stars.  Great support. I like working at Mutual of America first and foremost because I enjoy the field of Wealth Management and I enjoy working with clients to help them meet their financial goals.  I also appreciate the longevity of the position. When I worked with MoA in 2015, I was impressed with MoA’s companywide network and how easy it was to ask questions and get answers, even when the answers came from New York or Florida. Since I’ve worked for MoA and the team in San Francisco and Hawaii, I already know I like the team and would love to work with you again."
good,Mutual was a temporary assignment on an as need basis.  After first assignment I was requested to be the first to call at Metropolitan Temporary agency.  The position was a front desk executive receptionist required to float from floor to floor.  The demand was the ability to graciously accommodate guests from various departments and direct them accordingly.  Incoming calls were transferred to the appropriate department which demanded a quick understanding of the phone lists which varied from each floor.  A professional interaction with both staff and clients was paramount. Management as well as staff for various departments were pleased with my ability and professionalism.
good,Learn from the best. When you work there you stayed there for a long time because there culture was great! Teamwork at its best!
good,"Learned plenty while working there. I was able to learn and progress and experience multiple aspects of running systems in a mainframe and desktop environment, especially in a support role."
good,"People help people  to  get  the job  done."
