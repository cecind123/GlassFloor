bad,Bottom line is that the overall communication is lacking. Management says one thing but tries to assist in your failure so they can fill the seats with people who are just yes people. It's a churn factory.
bad,Worst company to work for warehouse dirty unorganized management unprofessional no training all about management getting bonus they dont care about well being of employees and hr socialize with each other outside of work if you aren't in the click oh well if you dont work you are good if you are a good worker then you have problems
bad,"In my last 10 years of working I have sen a lot of stuff but this extent of double standards and favouritism, wow.. Never ever before. The only good thing about being inside sales is you have your own desk and computer. A LOT of backbiting and slandering. Even to the extent of backbiting and slandering of people with whom you sit in inside sales for 8 hours a day and 7 days a week. I seriously wonder how any sane minded, professional individual could spend more than a few minutes their without loosing their mind."
bad,"They sold to a US company 2 years ago and it's worse then ever.  Warehouse manager kelly and cheryl treat people so bad and no one does anything about it.  They play so much favourites there. "
bad,"Never work here the money is good but the politrics will keep you shaking and scratching your head."
bad,Sent to the zone needed most help pulling orders when rest of the warehouse had home zones the workload was not evenly divided.
bad,"Old thinking, very political, most have the... just working for a paycheck mentality. High stress, and workload. Upper management is from old industries that failed. They, and their replacements (their rich friend's children or associations) are there to fill a personal need at your cost. Most do not move up in their game. Yet, this is much the way it is in big business."
bad,vCollecting data from store locations to prepare a Profit & loss statement.
bad,"Overworked, under appreciated working in a dept that was poorly created. They need new experienced talent in upper mgt starting with Shared Services Sen Director. Poor decisions created a leave dept that’s out of compliance. Turn over is insane due to poor treatment.  Basically your not a Specialist. You’re a micro managed specialist who takes calls in an inbound call center environment in addition to high impossible expectations of the job itself. Upper Management doesn’t even know their own policies & never follows what’s in writing on the policy. By far the worse place I’ve ever worked at a contractor. They use several agencies to fill Leave roles all with different pay per hour. They will low ball you! Don’t take less than $23 an hour!  Current management needs house cleaning in itself. Overworked and only talks permanent positions to increase morale. If you enjoy the twilight zone, working in this place is for you!"
bad,"Very bad workplace culture, Outdated systems and software, Favoritism by management, Time wasted in multiple meetings and not in productive work, no opportunity or focus on employee growth"
bad,mise a pied en raison d'une blessure au dos fait dans le cadre des mes fonctions. M'ont causé des problèmes pour mon chômage ainsi qu'à la CNESST compagnie non coopérative du tout avec les employés.
bad,"Company used to be a good place to work . They continue to outsource to India and no appreciation for employees , Managers are useless and Director has no sense of direction ."
bad,The only reason I didn’t leave sooner is because of my fellow employees. The warehouse management is the worst I have ever seen. They could care less about your health or other things outside of work. Warehouse managers have their ‘favorites’ and no one is treated equal.
bad,"We had an excellent company till the merge of Altrom. People meshed together like family . We didn't even have to talk, we just knew each others thoughts and to help the customers anyway possible , even after hours . We the staff ,had after hours dinners and played pool, we helped each other if cars were broke and brought in donuts and other food so work would be enjoyable and everyone was fed and happy . I had hurt my arm and got terminated because  of it (or so it appeared )because shortly after ,that was the case . Myself and my customers were stunned, as they know, I would do anything for them. The company staff have dwindled since then ,5 or more quit quickly after. When our record before the merge was outstanding.  People only left due to pregnancy or health issues. The manger, so I have been told now , just hides in his office and is rarely seen . He isn't a part of daily activities and ignores any happenings with the staff or otherwise. It was ultimately the best place to work and now the worst . I whole heartedly think autocamping sabotage the new company and is forcing out all the reputable staff. The staff are on the front lines and they killed off exceptional workers . Then handed the company over with skeletal  remains. Then again why would they hand something over that would make someone else rich , that would be ludicrous."
bad,Enjoy working with great group of parts professionals.There are many fulltime employees who have worked together for many years. The industry has changed a lot over the last 10 years as has the competition.
bad,"CEO never invests in sufficient infrastructure for employees to do their job, has poor communication skills, and abusive to his staff. Very numbers and bottom line driven. General manager does what he can and is level headed, but he's ultimately beholden to the owner who has very little business sense and even less social ability."
bad,"Daily car inspection, order picking, prepare deliveries, load vehicle, organize route and schedule for timely deliveries, pickup returns and cheques, organize credits and other paperwork, clean warehouse Dangerous Goods training, WHMIS, safety courses, loose management allowing for harassment, abuse of lunch and break times, inside workers were lazy (e.g. leave a mess for others to clean) , drivers ended up doing their tasks,  no concern for operational expenses, disorganized dispatching, overload of deliveries often leading to late lunches(half hour), unwilling to do minor repairs for vehicles(burnt lights - 3 months to fix, leaking tire - more than 3 weeks, only winter tires on the front), lifting 40Kg kegs of oil, constant lifting of 20 to 30kg break rotors, handling 200kg drums of oil by hand, getting out of the warehouse and drive."
bad,Start out as promising future for me. That lasted for only 4 years of my almost 6 years with them. No reliable upper management. Passing the blame game. No ownership of responsibilities. Taking ideas from others and saying that there own. Wrong people making wrong decision's. Unprofessional decision's based on popularity. Overall what use to be a great company to work for.
bad,"The pay sucks, Lack of overtime. Management sucks the supervisor talk to you any kind of way. the have a point system if you come one minute late it's a point. the don't have a grace period  for being late"
bad,"i have been in the workforce since 1976 and i have never worked for such a poor management team.  the only enjoyable part of the job was meeting and dealing with the customers.  the more i was away from the warehouse, the better my day was."
bad,"Management was subject to quotas which were tough to reach due to competitive factors and failure to respond to pricing, inventory issues throughout the company owned stores and independent stores.  Quota was the primary basis for evaluation of job performance.  I had great communication with management, co-workers and personnel."
bad,"Upper management is absolutely lost!  Noone is navigating this ship.  Very interested and engaged in themselves and their success! Couldn't care less about anything or anyone else, especially the organization!!!"
bad,Their approach to running a company was early 20th century.  We were not allowed to leave our cubicles unless it was an emergency.  We were punished as a whole and not as an individual.
bad,"After putting 15 years with this company and to be call in a room to tell a person you are going to let them go because you have out-source their job to another company. When the drivers ask about this 1 year early, and was toll that we would not be out source your job, and to find out 1 year later that your are going to be let go this was not the way a company should have deal with this. And the company that came in had us to field out applications and telling the drivers that we would be haired on. But after one week later to come back and tell the drivers that we will not be haired on was not the way to deal with this. While some of the drivers had 15 to 30+ years with this company and to only offer one driver to stay with that company was not the way to deal with good working employee who have been with a company that long, and who have been good workers."
bad,"Nothing to review.  The job was to fill in for a medical leave employee.  However within months she had passed away.  The job was never offered to me.  Selfish as it seems, I felt I did a good job there.  No thanks were ever give.  The culture there was that everyone was in there own world.  No communication was ever given except only if you did something wrong.  No appreciation was ever given to anyone."
bad,Very much micromanaged. Felt more like a factory then an office. Every piece of work was scrutinized. Focused on your errors more than your accomplishments.
bad,"I had worked for GPC corporate from October 2005 thru November 2016. I held positions in outside sales, Filter Rep, Territory sales manager and Brake and Under car rep. In all this time I received good reviews with no disciplinary actions. In May 2016 I underwent a rotator cuff repair surgery to fix an injury sustained on the job and was fired."
bad,"Bottom line:  there were never enough employees to keep the store running correctly.  All other difficulties came out of that fact.  Large amounts of stress, backbiting, raised voices, etc.  There were no procedural changes made there that lasted more than 3 weeks.  "
bad,"Napa is an older top heavy company.They expect a lot for the pay ,decent benefits and retirement plan.One should watch your back at this company as advancement is limited"
bad,It was not a pleasant environment to work in. Company does not care about its employees. Work hours were fair and overtime was always provided.
bad,The market EIS competes in is very competitive and shrinking. Not sure if they will be able to diversity enough to sustain long-term growth and ward off being sold by GPC.
bad,This is a very fast paced physical job for 11$ an hour.  The work load is big and the timeline makes the job hectic.  The warehouse need maintenance and the dust fro years of age will  mess with your  allergies badly if you have them. and the management would squeeze water out of a rock if they could.  the hours weren't bad mon-fri  8am-5pm. but for the pay its almost not worth. Had i high turn over rate at the entry level position.
bad,The company is interesting to work for. Some good experiences some not. Overall if you can handle the management and the way they do things it's now too bad.  The people there are great to work with everyone is helpful. The benefits are decent and the pay is good. I was there for 15 years and had good and bad experiences as with any where. When I was let go they were downsizing and it seemed they were looking at the people who were there for over 10 years to let go first and I got caught up in that.
bad,Old School sales mentality.  440K SKU's offered but only a handful are actually sold. Trying to be everything to everybody. In the process of rethinking the strategy but slow to change.
bad,Company is currently going through new changes with new upper management who lack the knowledge and skills to run a business that revolves the automotive market. Other than the issue with upper management this is a great company to work for and gives you the opportunity to gain vast amount of automotive knowledge and help customers with automotive issues.
bad,"Management was unorganized. No one knew what was going on even though it was an open door policy. I loved working with my coworkers, they were really nice people, however when I was laid off, it was sudden and I wasn't given an opportunity to be absorbed into another part of the company even though I had experience in other areas. So even though their were no major problems where I worked there was no confidence in the employees that they would be able to work for the company with any longevity. Length of time with the company doesn't matter."
good,"This was once an AWESOME company to work for. However, 1 senior leadership change, quickly changed that. The work place became very oppressive, and the director was an absolute bully. He bulldozed the employees and seemed to take joy in trampling over employees self esteem. "
good,"When i started there were many stories about upper management stating as stockers or dock loaders. As the years passed a trend began where the upper management were outside grad students who never loaded a truck in their life. "
good,"I cannot speak for all of GPC; only where I worked.   When I started at the old location, it was a nice place to work, but when we moved to the new location, things started to change.   As years went by and management changed so did the workplace atmosphere, people’s attitudes, and the stress of feeling like your being setup for failure."
good,I had a great boss but there was no career advancement opportunity. No opportunity to enhance skills or learn new things. More of a dictatorship workplace environment.
good,I learned alot of streets that i didn't know. I met alot of new people while working there.. Some days were better then others.The work place was always neat. The hardest part of the job was driving in very nasty weather but it's what we had to do to get our product to the customers to make them happy..
good,"very unfair,Stressful job, works off productive, heavy lifting, no room for growth, management messy, very low pay, the benefits are expensive, not flexible"
good,Genuine Parts Company is a good place to be employed. They offer consistent hours to work and decent pay to compensate you for your job. They also offer wonderful benefits and any dependents you may have.
good,Once corporate decided to change management at our subsidiary it all went downhill from there.  There were at least 11 people that were let go that had been there for 15 plus years once that new management came into the company. They brought their own people who had actually been with three different companies together before they ever got to genuine parts.
good,"When I first started the job & company were good, then the owners decided they wanted to step back from the business & hired 2 people to run the business, one the hires was the absolute worse person they could have hired, this person was arrogant, rude & had no people skills."
good,"Decent place to work, management is good. Hours and environment are good. Nice people to work with no real big issues to know about. Company seems to be growing and doing well."
good,"I have had the opportunity to work on multiple IT projects.  Each project has granted me access to learning new experiences and gaining additional knowledge.  In addition, I have been able to become better at the skills I already had and hone them to a new level of expertise.  I interact daily with interdepartmental teams, my co-workers, drawing off their experience and knowledge when necessary, networks, 3rd parties, our DCs and our customers and suppliers.  Each interaction requires a unique communication which over the years I have learned to adjust and tailor based on my audience.  These are all skills I use at my current position and look forward to using at future opportunities as well."
good,Not a progressive organization.  Culture is challenging. Organization does not adapt well to the changing environments.  Management needs to commit to training and employee development.
good,"The termination process of this company was both unethical and illegal. Management is very cutthroat and not invested in their workers, only maintaining the illusion of their own position. They assign ""projects"" which are excuses to make low paid workers work outside their job description as ""business development""."
good,"Good people"
good,"I worked for a subsidiary for GPC. In the beginning, it was exciting. The subsidiary was under a restructuring with fresh management, open to new ideas, and welcomed employee feedback. In the last 2 years however, the level of employee involvement in the company began to drop. Although the revenue for the company had more than doubled since I first started, employees were seeing more cuts to annual events and the little things they were doing to boost employee morale. When I began to research where i was on the salary range, i noticed that i was about 30% under the going market rate for someone with my level of experience. I also discovered that I was under paid by about 50% to the person that held the position prior to me taking the job.  I had no prior disciplinary remarks in my time with the company. When raising these concerns, I was generally brushed off.  When I mentioned the pay difference between myself and a prior employee in that position, I was told I was paid what I was because i had worked up through the company. I held my position and did my job well for 5 years, but yet they didn't want to compensate me for those skills. This was a typical strategy for them, promote within so that they can pay those employees less than what they were worth to cut cost and benefit the management teams quarterly bonuses (additionally, they pulled bonuses from all non manager positions). Other divisions in GPC may be better about this, but my experience is solely based on my experience in the subsidiary I was based in. I would not recommend any of my friends to work for the subsidiary"
good,"So I will say that the job security here is pretty darn good, you have to really mess up to get let go. That being said, you will not be compensated at the level you should be for your experience and expertise. If you come in on the lower end of the spectrum, it is pretty difficult to advance your career."
good,"the job is simple, not hard at all. The manager is easy to get along , everyone is friendly. The most enjoyable part is you deliver t to some nice customers"
good,"Very busy work environment. "
good,This was a challenging position. Very demanding operation. Was hard to keep employees do to dam and of the workplace and pay.
good,"Within the company there are very good people and at the location i was at shows , however the company was not the best and they do not really care for your well being."
good,"Various IT management roles in GPC corporate IT.   Overall good people for the most part,  but very, very slow to make any decisions.  Then once a decision is finally made,  there is no time left to properly implement."
good,Willing to stock 1000 items per day. Pullers pull at a fast pace for customers orders to be ship out same day. Must be able to pick up 60lbs parts. People are willing to help if you can't get a hold of a manager at the time. Support to learn how or understand you position with more break down. One on one training is given. You can move up in the company at fast pace with meeting quota.
good,"Steady work environment with adequate work hours."
good,Great team work and the store i worked in we were more a family and worked well together
good,"Learned alot about parts and how to use books more efficiently. They have good training to serve there customers with great service, and keep an altogether fun work atmosphere."
good,I enjoyed working for Genuine Parts. I didn't care for the work environment. It was like being back in Middle school. Management promoted employees based on who they liked instead of what you were contributing to the company.
good,You will end up helping with store moves much more than working in sales.  Inventories and store moves are the responibility of the sales team which means $500K worth of product has to be moved by the people that are supposed to be out selling product.  Its back breaking work that usually does nothing to improve sales or hit quotas.  I would steer any talented sales folks away from this position.
good,They are still relying on old ways of doing business and use of technology. The organization has a tough time attracting and retaining top talent in the Atlanta market.
good,"Job is not difficult, just takes some focus to avoid errors and mistakes. Lower all expectations of potentially being compensated for efficiency or hard work."
good,Learned all about auto parts and different cars. Learned about management and how to handle people. To take care of customers. Run check out. Learned how to look up parts on computer
good,Do your work and don't socialize while working.  Pay is standard warehouse with very little/few raises.  Option for benefits after 6 months.  Long term employment if you like the work.
good,"A typical day at work, answering retail phone calls and ordering parts and also taking orders from local car repair shops. Very fast past environment."
good,"Daily activities include:"
good,The Management there needs a little retraining/refresher course
good,My co workers are awesome. The lower u are on the totem pole the worse the management and benefits
good,The staff at the location level are good. Management at a multistore level is not attentive to the needs of their workers. The work while not physically demanding requires focus. The pay is bad and not nearly enough for the work that you put in.
good,"Answer phone calls daily"
good,genuine auto parts is a overall good place to work. i dont think its a career maybe better for a retiree or college student. the pay is a little low in my opinion but management is fair and the discounts are nice.
good,"On an average day you use 4 - 5 different accounting systems to find one answer.  Management has been at their positions for decades and while they have a wealth of experience, their view is out dated."
good,"This is my honest review."
good,"Enjoy independence of driving to many customers."
good,"Working at NAPA ( Genuine Parts Co.) was my first venture into the Auto parts world, "
good,"I worked Monday through Friday, 12:00pm to 8:00pm on most days. I really enjoyed this job. I was a Main Store puller where I pulled customer orders from the warehouse for the front store. When I wasn't doin that, I did pulls going to other stores in the state or Loaded trucks and stocked warehouse shelves. This job often required the use of a riding electric pallet jack or manual pallet jack. I got along with all my co-workers and most managers. The hardest part of the job, I believe was the hours and never having 2 days off in a row..The days off were always separate."
good,"Easy job, and co-workers were friendly, hours weren't dependable. Other than that the place is really great. I will still go back to the same position back if can."
good,"Use to work the night shift before switching to the day shift ."
good,Position description during hiring and what it turns out to be not exactly the same. Way to many weekly work hours but respectable pay and benefit package. My direct manager great person but sort of hands off unless something is going sideways.
good,"It's a corporation. You are still just a number, but they take better care of you than most places that you are just a number at. I was paid decent. The work was of a medium difficulty."
good,"Great work environment and coworkers. Management structure not efficient, department sizes and workload not balanced effectively. Most enjoyable aspect of job was problem solving and working with great people. Least enjoyable was handling the workload of 5 people and working 14 hour days regularly."
good,"Like most corporations, the biggest problem is management"
good,"Laid back atmosphere."
good,"Although the company cherishes long-term employees, it really doesn't know how to nurture and grow the employees like it should. Limited work from home options, formal attire at work and not understanding that developing talent is a partnership between company and employee all mean the company takes a hit on the ""great place to work"" scale."
good,"Outside of management changes being a monthly event, the company has great opportunities for advancement.  Good company to work for . Good benefits . Gave me the greatest start to a career. Consistently challenging."
good,The work place was fun! Did a lot of teamwork! bonuses were based on your work and i was part of a great team so we always got them! Hours was great and management was kind!
good,"Helping customers out finding auto parts they need to fix and repair their vehicles, answering phones, computer skills needed, heavy lifting at times, checking in inventory, putting inventory away, some deliveries when busy (local)"
good,- Typical day at work would be to oversee HR Assistant. Daily review of employment applications and phone calls from inquiring candidates or concerns from employees
good,I loved the fact that my gifts were observed and i was promoted base on my hard work ethics and dedication. The hardest part was getting no team support and accountability reinforcement. After giving 150% effort to perform my job with compassion and only received positive remarks. They discarded me based on rumor with out consideration for my hard effort.
good,"Very busy. From time you come in and leave there is always something to get done. I have learned many things in purchasing.  How to handle 100 different vendors and ordering thousands of parts on a day to day basis. Having a good relationship with vendors and learning agreement needs.  "
good,"pull and pack parts"
good,GPC is a stable company that has been around for years. They are old school when it comes to some policies and do things more in a traditional way.
good,"The best part of My job is meeting new customers and finding a way to help them solve their issues. I have learned that most people that come in are not having a good day because they have a vehicle that is down, so you can't take their bad attitude personal."
good,i liked working in auto parts but was offered more money to work for newspapers. didn't have any complaints about the job. Still would kept on working there if i could of.
good,Great company but management is too busy worrying about paperwork and not concerned with the customers. Allow the paperwork reduction staff to do the job they are given and not hound us all day to get paperwork done.
good,Best place to grow. Stability is the one reason I enjoy the company. The culture of the employees is that of tenure and a feeling that the company cares
good,"Did everything from loadtng unloading trucks shipping and recieving,route driver salesman warehouse manager, inventory control.Company reman auto parts for Ford.Branches in San Leandro,Los Angles,Salt Lake City ,Montana and Arizona.Lot of turnover with employee's,management changed alot,owner was tough.Being watched from long distance was tough.Hard to explain some things that they can't see.Best part was being able to work your way up."
good,"They are a great place to work, many people here have been around for a long time, indicating great stability. Work life balance is a huge plus here as well. While they struggle to keep up with the times, management does attempt to keep employees happy."
good,"Gave me the greatest start to a career."
good,"Genuine Parts Company is a great place to work.  They have a good pay scale and good benefits.  I really enjoy working there but unfortunately there is no room for advancement.  I have been there for a long time and have prior Management experience.  I went through there Management training course and graduated but when it came time for promotion I was overlooked time after time.  It didn't matter that I was more qualified then the others, it mattered that I was not one of upper managements friends.  Those are the employees who got promoted every time.  If you partied with or were good friends with upper management then you were the one who got promoted."
good,relaxed atmosphere able to help customer and give them a reason to come back to shop with us advancement is a little difficult to prove youre self to management
good,"Provide sales and marketing leadership as area sales manager. Revitalized under-performing territory into top producer servicing 100+ accounts across RI, MA, NH and VT as manufacturer representative for global enterprise. Organizational recognition included Rayloc Sales Manager of Year, NAPA New England Sales Representative of the Year, President’s Club"
good,"Well you come in the door in the morning clock in and check the truck the fluids and feul. Then check if there was deliveries that needed to go out or if there was parts at the wherehouse that needed to be picked up. Then I would head out with my deliveries and print out for parts geeting dropped off and also parts that needed to be picked up from the wherehouse. At the shops that I would drop off parts at I would check if the company had returns that I would need to take back if there was I would get out return slips collect the parts and write out the part number and description of part, then load up the parts after the company had signed the slip."
good,"You always have some employees that don't work, no matter what. It makes the workload heavier for the people who actually work. Management doesn't much pay attention to that. Other than that! It's a pretty good place to work. Opportunity for advancement & laid back JUST enough."
good,I love my job. But I need a career. The only way to get any kind of raise is to get promoted which is usually seniority based. I dont particularly care for the idea of not getting a raise/promotion until I've worked for the company for 10+ years.
good,This company is a good company to work for but what I don't like is once the pay scale is reached there are no more advancements in the position at which you are working so if the cost of living is going up and you have reached your max you're next step is to seek a part time job
good,I worked here part time and did so while going to school for my degree. I enjoyed the atmosphere and pay but there wasnt anything that I would be able to do with my degree once I got it and that is why  left.
good,as long as you keep up with your orders and follow what needs to be done you'll be ok and always watch for damaged goods cause sometime they get across. lunch is usually the fast paced time cause everyone usually comes on break to get car parts. at the end of the day it always nice to know you have help someone in a jam with there car
good,"I would like to thank NAPA with the opportunity to return when I once worked for and Independent owner in the past. The NAPA parts system is one of the best in the industry. While being an Assistant Manager at the Norwood, OH location, I set out what I was asked to do, and that was to make location look competitive enough to attract a buyer for the location."
good,Started off as a temp for the scanning department.  Then was hired full time and advanced to Account Management Clerk.  Nice clean work environment.  Recognized for birthday and service.
good,"GPC is a great company.  They are always looking for ways to improve and make things better for the employee, while working toward their business vision."
good,"This is a Fortune 200 company. I am only exploring my options because I feel I have some valuable experience to offer .I feel it is important that I see opportunities because changes are coming"
good,Enjoyable and challenging. Working with company personnel and independent owners to help the success of their business.
good,My first real job out of high school and the pay was great for the time. They had good benefits and there was plenty of moving around room. Some of the positions were harder than others but once you acquired
good,"Overall good company. The benefits are good, as are their health program that enables you to earn money that you get at the end of the year. The vacation is acceptable and is nice as it accumulates quickly."
good,"Great place to work with plenty of opportunities for advancement  "
good,I am a fairly new employee with Genuine Parts Company. I have met a lot of people since working there. The work-life balance is good. I am still learning a lot about my role.
good,"My typical day was finding and supplying part to mechanics."
good,"Good company to work for.  "
good,They provider everything I am looking for in an employer.   Indeed has been an amazing place to work. The challenges are daily and varied and leave me satisfied. I have grown a lot working here and see a lot of potential for more in the future.
good,Overall nice job-culture environment involving management and co-workers.
good,A typical day at work is very fast pasted.The co-workers were some of the nicest people I have ever worked with.
good,"I liked to get there by 6am to get the (have to) work done before 8am. I learn how to serve a customer properly and how important a positive attitude is to employees and customers. My management taught me allot about the parts business in turn then I taught our employees about the business because I was promoted to Division Training Manager. I loved my job it was exciting to see what the Training did for our employees. Some employees had worked for other Parts distributors and had not received training that like what NAPA provided. The hardest part of the job was scheduling travel time and hoping the travel venture (airlines) was on time with no delay's that was tough! I enjoyed seeing our employees grow in the company and turn out to be great managers. I worked for GPC started in March of 1972 retired in June of 2006 I enjoyed my ride with this Great Company! I worked the jobs I want to work I liked them all it was a great growing experience for me. I started in Spokane went to Great Falls MT. back to Spokane then worked for Mountain Division yet resided in Spokane. My job titles were Territory Manager, Store Manager, Balkamp representative Mountain Division Training Manager."
good,"This was a third shift computer operations position. No supervisor on staff. A night filled work load always complete by the AM operation hours. I often was piled on by others who failed to complete their job duties during the day. It was fun, a challenge, as well as a learning experience for me during those early days of my IT career."
good,A typical day at GPC was filled with batching and coding invoices for imaging. Processing Priority Check requests and keying above the quota of invoices ( 100 ) I usually keyed about 200. My coworkers were the best. We worked well together. The hardest part of my job may have been Month End Closing. Balancing DC statements and COJ statements could take its toll on you. But when the whole department would complete the Month End Closing within the 3 days was always a nice accomplishment.
good,"Working in the automotive field can be challenging but at the same time very rewarding. Through the years i have learned from skilled people, training ranging from ethical and personal empathy with employees all the way to a broad spectrum of NYS laws , profit and loss and how to build a winning team. A typical day at work can be quite face paced and you are thrown many obstacles. Customer relations are key and most enjoyable."

good,"•During a typical work week, one of my biggest tasks is checking in on my staff and assessing progress on various projects. I like to meet first thing on Mondays to discuss our priorities for the week, then meet again in the middle of the week to check progress, and once at the end of the week to discuss goal setting for the next week. I meet with smaller groups of my staff in the middle of the week to troubleshoot any issues. For example, during a recent mid-week meeting, I noticed one team was a few days behind on a long-term project. I met with the team and, together, we came up with a strategy for increasing efficiency. I also attend a weekly meeting where I present my department’s progress to the executive board. On Fridays, I make sure all tasks are completed and I've sent all the necessary communications via email and in person. Finally, I create a list of priorities for next week."
