rating,review
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
bad,If you like to do stuff mechanical this job is for you as you have to put in and take out mold's from molding machines. Plus you have machine alarms going off all day so you can't get your work done.
bad,"Was a good Company but they closed."
bad,Upper management makes inconsistent decisions with a complete disregard for how it affects current personnel.  Don't bother looking for a solid answer because it will change with the wind if you ever get one. Expect to be overburdened due to management's lack of foresight and perpetual understaffing.
bad,The front office people talk about the back workers and make fun of them. They have their favorites that can do whatever and come in whenever they want. Everyone else better tow the line
bad,you work very hard for little money the only good things about the job is to the benefit and the days you have off you get four consecutive days off in a row
bad,"Management, Human Resources, communication, no room for advancement it took almost a year to get hired on it’s a very long drawn out process hired a lot of illegals"
bad,Itw is not a good place to work for they treat like dog the management suck there they not nice to on one is not a good place to work. So dont work there
bad,ITW doesn't develop young talent. They expect you to meet your goal and provide no resources to help you do so. I would not recommend a peer to work at this company.
bad,A typical day at ITW would be that you can expect for things to be unorganized when you get to work. I've learned that they will change things at the spare of the moment and they do have poor management. Safety isn't a top priority when working and if injured they never show concern. The hardest part of my Job was having 4 to 5 different duties at one time and best part of the day was when i was getting off work.
bad,Very very poor management too much favoritism dont pay enough .  easy work just not my kinda place for work. Supervisor let there position get to there head.
bad,People were mean and overall hypocrites!!I hated everyday there.All people there did was gossip and yalk about one another.Your work was never rewarde.Hard work at that!!No one took yhe time to say Hi in management.Looked at you like you did not exsist!!!
bad,Myself watch your your pay check because they screwed up my paycheck Thats why i could not go to work they took to much money out and did not have money
bad,"There was no consistency in management, rules and regulations which lead to unsafe and confusing work environment. There was no room for advancement in the company and no pay raises merit based or otherwise."
bad,There people should of came first no changing everything firing everyone is not a good way to start when you just come in to a company.!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!??!!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
bad,I have nothing good to say about ITW - the facility was filthy and the people were rude nothing good to say  people were unclean and the bathrooms were filthy.
bad,"If you want a job where all you hear about all day is gossip about other co-workers then this is the perfect job for you. Management knows about the gossip-infested work environment and won't do anything about it."
bad,"the company has been going downhill for years and it appears to be getting worse, if you have a choice I would choose any other company but ITW Evercoat."
bad,They have no respect for the employees. You work hard and long hours for very little pay. They have overly strict and unreasonable policies that make you a slave to the job. Needing to take unplanned time off will cost you your job. Your punished for being one minute late. You're expected to take a lot time off without pay to lower costs for the company. This is not a dream job meant to be a career.
bad,I worked here like 12 years or more ago I really have very little to say about this place as I am sure its completely different than when I was there at work.
bad,ITW is for a younger person because the pay is not enough for the labor you're performing. They aren't very patient with their team members nor do they care about what's important to their employees. They do not properly train you either. It's definitely not a company that I would want to work for permanently.
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
bad,"Fortune 500, manufacturing company with over 550 business-unit locations and 50,000 employees. "
bad,"I worked there twice and the last time was for about 2 years. I was let go unfairly the first time and was hesitant about going the second. Because I have a good relationship with Kelly Services and I wanted work, I agree. The kind of place where you only there for a paycheck is not my ideal setting but necessary sometimes. I prefer working in a positive environment where morale is not at a low everyday."
bad,"these people don't really care about you, they just pretend they do I really did not care for this job because nothing you do is good enough for them."
bad,This place just uses you. They keep saying they are going to hire you but they never do. The tell you that you have to work harder.
bad,didn't even get to know employee before they judged them as unsocial... thought it was work not high school
bad,at this job its just come to work and pack screws and then go home at the end of your shift
bad,and extremely discriminatory toward people that are not like them. Stressful and walk on eggshells. I would never recommend this place for work. Their Karma is arrived!
bad,"This place could be a great place to work at, but it will never be as long as they have the person that they currently have as a productions manager. This guy has the biggest mafioso complex and acts like a tough guy on a daily basis, he doesn’t care what happens or how good of an employee you are as long as he’s ego is fed, he tries to intimidate the employees and fires people and brags about it. None of the managers have any professionalism, so save yourself the waste of time and keep looking!"
bad,"A job to have if you’re in school, Company (Management) has No direction on where the company is going, WON’T receive proper training (Major Safety Violation), Employees that have skills & training don’t get compensated,"
bad,People have personal issues there and manages gossip flirt and tell your business  . They treat their good workers bad and rather keep their lazy workers there because they’re  friends with them . Please do not apply you will regret it .
bad,When the owners would come in town they would hide some of the workers from the owners by giving them the day off. I was asked to hide some bad parts.
bad,"Es kommt immer wieder vor, dass Versprechungen des Chefs nicht eingehalten werden und anschließend dementiert werden. Beispielsweise zugesagte Gehaltsnachverhandlungen nach der Probezeit, oder zugesagte Fortbildungen."
bad,"Itw texfast, delta management lie to employees about how great is to be employed here. They to run a business 24 7 with a sKelton  crew. Most of management are very  self center .Upper Management Never Say A Hi Or Hello To Employees On The Floor ."
bad,"Low Moral, lack of Team, I do not enjoy working here.There is no job security, high turnover, low pay."
bad,Generally ran by majority males. Biased  company  that permits inappropriate  behavior  from Operations  Manager  in Kennesaw  GA.  No support when reported  to HR on top if illegally  using making  3M product  without  their knowledge.  Very poor professionalism.
bad,"Very poor management, understaffed & a lack of respect for their staff. Poor communication & poor decision making on future planning. Absolutely no respect for tenure or senority."
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
bad,"The company has too much race issues,I was an apprentice that was told I wouldn't lose my regular job as an OPERATOR if I didn't pass the apprentice program, that didn't happen I was terminated and didn't get my job back as an OPERATOR..so I was hurt and ashamed and force to find other work after 8 years with the company."
bad,Bad reviews   Manager hard to get along with  They say u can move up but that’s a lie. Dead end job  don’t trust anyone   Too much work for the money.
bad,"Could be an ok place to work. Except it is far from that, instead you stand and watch the circus show all day. Supervisers are the worst part of this place. They even made the circus show better by including ""leads"" to partake in the circus show. They did a great job in choosing these ""leads"" if their intent was to make the circus show even better. Great job ITW, Richton Park!"
bad,"I was extremely unhappy while I was working at ITW Daelim.  I was constantly sorting parts for quality issues, and never felt appreciated or that I had a voice in anything I worked on.  I quit my job as an engineer to take a much lower paying job so that I could be happier. Supervisors and employees were always miserable, and temp agencies were constantly feeding the revolving door there. It was not a good example for a quality system.  When I worked there, management did not support the quality department much.  The GM and another key manager were let go, so I'm sure some reform has occurred and it must be better now."
bad,"Não tenho nada positivo a comentar. Ambiente de trabalho não é positivo, pessoas pouco preparadas para cumprir com suas atividades de maneira geral."
bad,"First off, I want to say that I STRONGLY believe that some of these reviews were written by management, or by one of their vile minions.  There is NO WAY that an operator who worked at Mokena or Tinley Park would say that they loved their jobs and found them enjoyable.  ITW is a horrible place and working for them is anything but enjoyable.  They don't want smart people working there, they want ""yes"" people.  If you are anything but that type of person,  then they will either find a way to fire you, or they will torment you so much that you will choose to leave, just like I did.  Management and HR are the main culprits as each one washes the other's backsides.  I cannot believe that they've managed to stay in business for so long with standards like these in place.  Do yourself a favor...if you are even considering working for these people, DON'T!!!  I learned my lesson and left before my soul was completely destroyed by them.  This place and the people who work for them will make you just as sad and bitter as they are."
bad,Son muy buenas personas y companeros de trabajo pero con las cosas ke te prometen no las cumplen
bad,"Is a great place to get trained at and learn about cold forming and the manufacturing world. However, the inexplicable lack of attention from management to the shop floor fails to recognized rapid growing talent. Also, management seems to have the wrong idea of what actually cold forming headers are and the skill that is actually required to run machinery effectively. You could have high production numbers and high standards in quality, but no one cares. The best employees are leaving in waves, the only ones behind are a bunch of trainees that require one or two more year of training at least  (with no one to train them) and old people ready to retired. There is no maintenance, no PMS for machines (you run it till it breaks) , none working force monitors, lack of tooling/cheap tooling , lazy leads, extremely dirty, a lot of safety violations, management and plant manager have zero clue of machines and tooling (all they do is forward emails and yell in meetings)."
bad,"Management is underminding and deceptive. Hard to work under micro management, autocraticisum, and nepotism. Doing the right thing should be easy, but company culture drives management to seek other alternatives to issues and concerns across the board. Fellow empkoyees are not treated well,  and favoritism is dominant in the compamy. Health benfits are better than good, but you will have to use them often becuase of the wear and tear you will endure from working there."
bad,the place was good to work when no supervisors were around. it was very stressful with management.felt as though they didn't care about our concerns. pay was horrible
bad,"Each time there was an opportunity for somone from within to have a chance at a promotion, we were told we were not qualified. However the person hired for the person was no more qualified than the employee who was already in office."
bad,"Trainer was very racist, went to supervisor numerous times and got absolutely no where...in the end I was terminated for continuously going for help. Would have been good place to work other than "
bad,"If you’re looking for a place to work that does not hold you accountable for anything and you’re just there to collect a paycheck ITW shakeproof Elk Grove Village is the place to work  All you have to do is show up I’ve seen machine operators who are suppose to check parts every 15 minutes run equipment for days without checking their parts only to be rejected with no  repercussions The place is extremely filthy there are numerous safety violations and if you do report anything to management such as safety ,cleanliness , or employees sleeping on the job or food lying on the machine  management here’s you out with no results  it’s all about production numbers"
bad,They do not treat worker with any respect on a typical work day. I have learn my value to a workplace is better than ITW due to lack of respect and morals they have at this job. The management is terrible worst place i can picture myself working at. Very friendly co-workers most people are there due to it being hard to find work elsewhere. The hardest part of this job is working for people who have no respect for you or your wellbeing as a human. The most enjoyable part of this job was the end of the workweek.
bad,I worked shipping and receiving I would take off the machines off the trucks and  material . And I would the  finish machines on the trucks with a forklift truck. The was nice to work for . And I liked my job there. The management was okay had no problem will them.
bad,Poor General Manager and managers in Arden. Cut throat environment. Managers lacked the skills to manage effectively. General Manager was never in the office
bad,Very toxic environment for women at the Binghamton NY facility (aka instron).  Women were abused and discriminated against on a daily basis and were told to stay out of sight in the back of the building.
bad,"A typical day at ITW is stressful. No one does their job like they are supposed to and everyone takes short cuts around the policies and then wonder why they got in trouble when something goes wrong. There's no supervision and there's double standards. I don't recommend working at ITW because it's ghetto, there's a lot of unfairness, a lot of favoritism, and it's H.E.L.L."
bad,its just boring.you dont make much .even the regular pay is bad.its dreary and there is zero room for advancement.you have be direct hire and have a better job you you want any actual money.
bad,"If you are Hispanic,  you might fit in better, because dominant language in office and manufacturing floor is Spanish. Management is horrible. Really bad and tense atmosphere."
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
bad,"A typical work day very fast paced, very hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter you never know what time you were going to get off. Poor management."
bad,I was an a AR Machinist in Binghamton. NY and had things thrown at me and told that a monkey could do my job.  I was told that women must stay behind the wall so they could not be seen.  All that despite three of us employees alone brought in more than 2 million a year with our hard work.
bad,Will not recommend working here unless entry level employee...
bad,une journée de travail typique: surchargees
bad,The directors do not manage or have creativity.  They are simply followers and take direction from VPGM.
bad,I learned how to assemble car interior pieces and make sure they weren’t being distributed out dismantled and defected. Over all the tasks were not difficult.
bad,Easy fast pace job. A good leaning experience for most beginners. Sadly there wasn't any room for growth in this company. And the pay and benefits weren't great either.
bad,"Worked with good people, however management was not so well. Management was very hot tempered with their employees. I really enjoyed my job and the people I worked with."
bad,This is a company that worry about employees safety. They love to see you put in effort beyond there expectation. The company hire after a hour and won't give you a raise.
bad,"not enough work or pay terrible people."
bad,Bs job ... stalks your every move like you a jail inmate can’t go to the restroom when needed like I was a 2 year old didn’t train me how I was supposed to be trained then got the nerve to let me go because someone else came to work on time worked like a dog and still got let go.
bad,"you learn about grinding raw material, ran a line, fork lifk., load and unload truth, I love the Christmsas parties, the cook out and people,. there are a family"
bad,"I worked for ITW Westminster, MA for a little over one year. then ITW had a massive layoff. "
bad,"North Star Imaging in Rogers, MN is owned by ITW. The fat man in the General Manager position is false and dark. He's intimidated by intelligence and those of light. If he were removed, the whole company would improve. There are wonderful intelligent people that work there, but poor pay and hours. Most managers are good and fair. It's a great job if you don't intend to go anywhere."
bad,"Been going through corp wide restructure and have had 4 different job titles, responsibilities and territory geography during the changes. I am salaried and commission paid employee and there is no transparency in way we are paid on commissions and mgmt clueless to how low moral is with outside sales team."
bad,I worked for this company for a year and it was absolutely terrible. They pay you next to nothing and expect you to work mon.-fri. which is fine but when their production needs are high they make weekends mandatory to force you to work sat.-sun. Management talks to down to employees as if they are worthless.
bad,"I would say the worst part about working here was the inconsistent, random, micromanagement of the supervisor, and upper management. No talking while working, since we seemed to always be behind. Bathroom usage was questioned. Even while training you were expected to picked up the slack and work around new people to keep production flowing as much as possible. Higher ups standing around and watching you. Management checking your press run times, again while training was taking place. You must be constantly moving and doing something even if your press is not running. Even stretching, while ""encouraged"", still deemed as an excuse to stop moving. It does not matter how well you do your job, you could be the best operator ever, but your raise is only determined by your attendance. 50 cents or 30 cent raises. Pay is terrible. Only positive thing was pretty good benefits."
bad,"Management is basically non-existent. He does not want to ""deal"" with problems, so he ignores them.  The ""inmates are running the asylum""  They tell you that you will work an ""occasional"" Saturday, the fact is you are lucky to get one Saturday off a month.  Hours for first shift are usually 9 hours (5 am to 2:30 pm) though they will throw in some 10 hour weeks beginning at 4 am.  Some of the co-workers are great, most of the others will treat you like dirt."
bad,"Good benefits, working to improve diversity.  High turnover and not enough career development.  Leadership is very concerned with shareholder value and not customers or employees."
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
bad,"The work is very easy but requires high quantity of production. The pay was extremely low. Not enough to support a family, Bad work morale, Bad communication to employees"
bad,"I worked at itw for 2 years and I was promised advancements and never saw them. I worked in production and had struggles to try to show employees and managers problems on the floor."
bad,ITW use to be a great place to work for until 2 years ago. They restructured the management and they don't have a clue wants going on. If your black your chances are a little better. The latest plant manager doesn't know anything about the fastener industry and is a complete moron!!!!!!!!!
bad,"I recommend this job for people whom stay alone with no children. Living paycheck to paycheck for a single person is alright, but with a child, it’s no help at all as a single parent."
bad,"Pay is ok but company policies are strick for employees excluding  management. The auto environment is dirty, very hot, noisy, & hard to breath its so hot!!!"
bad,hours weren't that good. work was extremely boring. hard accurate work was not appreciated. no room for advancement. had two 15 minute breaks. no overtime available.
bad,"There is no accountability for any mistakes made in daily activities."
bad,"Low wages, poor benefits. HR is the laziest HR department in my 30 year career in the work world. Low tech, bad decisions. Has some good people, though."
bad,"Management spends their day patting each other on the back and gossiping about the people in the plant that actually get work done. "
bad,I personally did not like looking at the same four walls it just wasnt for me. The benefits were decent but the management is a bit stiff.
bad,"The company was not pro-active in educating our customers."
bad,"management ploblemes"
bad,"It's the most easiest job to have. You get 10 day vacation and sick days. But you only have to deal with favoritism when coming down to supervisors, short breaks, and working almost every day when you don't get production, no matter what shift, everyone has to get production, even if your shift did. Also make sure you get your pay when working a position, you will get flat rated. But I have heard things changed a lot and are changing even more"
bad,"This was a horrible place to work.  Expected to be on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week even when on vacation.  Poor management, due to being young and inexperienced.  They pick young graduates and move them up the corporate ladder at a quick rate regardless of experience or how well they handle the job.  This plant makes a lot of money inspire of all the issues internally.   I worked for other divisions that were great, but unfortunately they were moved to Mexico."
bad,Horrible place to work. You literally have to figure things out alone. There is no sense of team and they will sit back and happily watch you fail. Bad
bad,"They work you like slaves, you will be on your feet during your working hours, break time & lunchtime is the only time you have the opportunity to sit. You must lift over 75lbs. "
bad,"The original company (Alpine) was sold to ITW, shortly afterwards the lay offs came. Alpine was a great company to work for. Offered bagels on Fridays, .25 soft drinks"
bad,"I thought this place will be my life, I gave them my all. I was there for 8 years thinking that this be a future for me like many others, and they took everything away in a matter of minutes. local managers suck, corporate management sucks also they don't know how to do business and  they only see you when there is bad news for that I give this place a 2."
bad,"You will be doing needless things that take away from your actual job.  Also, they just consolidated with another division and started a full second shift but the people they hired to lead have no idea what they are doing."
bad,"Management constantly preached ""Quality over quantity"" but the work flow screamed the opposite. You can never make plans for the weekend because you ""might"" be working Saturday every Saturday. You also might be scheduled to stay an extra 4 hours without any communication on any given day. HR is constantly replaced so HR has no power in terms of problems one might face working for this company."
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
bad,job pays decent but poorly managed and to much favoritism to 1st shift and certain employees.they will not listen to anything you have to say they take first shift's word over yours.
bad,"They hire only young people and get rid of anyone over 55. They don't pay a competitive salary. They hire as competitive but quickly ""compress"" and ""stagnate"" salaries. Corporate management is useless and corrupt. They are people users in the worst way."
bad,"Many changes have been done in the past  years some good, a lot not good. Year after year the company production and sales have dropped drastically. Upper management continued with raises and bonuses, but the workers did not get much of a raise or bonus.  There is no direction."
bad,"Upper management continues to make promises about improvements that they are going to make but nothing changes other then they continue to turn over middle management."
bad,I prefer not to fill this out for fear of retaliation. There are many things that used to make this company great that have fallen by the wayside.
bad,"Maybe I sound like a disgruntled employee, but after working here and still currently working here I feel like this place has gotten worse over the years.  I don't mind learning more things and having more experience as times goes on.  That's expected.  But at the end of the year, when your review comes, you expect to get a decent raise.  You don't.  More responsibility, less reward.  The management has no previous management experience and has no idea what goes on and you have to pretty much figure everything out for yourself.  The only good thing about the place are my co-workers.  Most of them know what they're doing and are willing to help when you need them.  I wouldn't recommend friends , family or a stranger off the street to work here."
bad,"Controle de qualidade, busca por soluções de projetos e melhoria da produtividade da produção;"
bad,"this job does not recognize their employees for work completed. I feel that this was not a good job for me but this only my opinion, there is too much"
bad,"This place started out great, then they went from 8hr shifts to 12hr shifts. Since then it was one big ball of mess. When I decided to move I put my 2 weeks in and the next day they told me to not come back after all the overtime I put in, all the extra help I made sure to help with. I felt like they couldnt get rid of me fast enough after I thought they respected me. I was wrong...since leaving that place has lost 80% of the ppl."
bad,Why am I reviewing a company that I will never work for again? Total global corporate involvement micro managing every aspect of work but spending more money than they save. Everyone in fear of being let go to reduce cost
bad,"The drama in this place is outrageous. They don’t even work you 40hrs a week. I loved my supervisor, but the team lead was the ring leader of mess. Nobody’s on the same page and they aren’t any guidelines or work standards and nobody is sure of what’s good or bad"
bad,Very hard to work here as a new employee. Very little room for learning. It’s a very fast paced and stressful work environment with a grueling weekly schedule. Very little time off for new employees. Pay is too low!
bad,"There are some good people that work at the facility in Danvers.  The culture seems to be very much based in politics.  I have found that there is some age discrimination within this facility.  I do not believe that the CEO is aware of it.  If you are hired by these people, get everything in writing.  They are not above lieing about benefits, raises and working conditions.  "
bad,"Upper management changed drastically over the last 2 years which caused a domino effect on the moral of the employees. "
bad,"ITW  is great, but the commercial construction group continually mismanages people and projects."
bad,I worked for ITW for almost a year and was anxiously awaiting my departure. I found the particular unit that I worked for had an antiquated ERP system that did not directly link to the corporate office systems. Too small to work for.
bad,"Attitude of management is not employee friendly."
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
bad,You are subject to the culture of ITW ((holding company) but rather to the smaller entity of the firm it holds.   Lacks real diversity. No unity w parent company and benefits dumbed down by region
bad,"Company has major issues that they allow to occur without taking the necessary steps to fix the problem.  Instead the target the low hanging fruit and band aid the problem as opposed to identification the core issue and fixing that, mainly because it requires some type of financial commitment."
bad,No room for advancements to better yourself fast past no time to fully complete task set by supervisors gages never get calibrated so measurements r always incorrect no real quality control
bad,"Management is very cut throat, unethical, and full of clicks.  Also lots of incompetence around which management wants so you can be controlled.  Also if you have suggestions or improvement ideas, not welcomed unless local Managers can disguise as their own."
bad,"If you are related to the management team, then you can advance."
bad,This company pays well and has excellent benefits. The trade-off is that those appointed to management positions have had little to no management training and therefore don't understand it.  Employees are consistently given supervisory and even managerial tasks to perform without equivalent compensation. Nepotism and Favoritism is rampant and goes completely unchecked.
bad,"Plenty of work, poor management, great co workers, don't plan anything work 60+hrs week. Shift rotates to what management thinks fit, poor quality standards. As long as it has threads on it, it's shipped out door.  No one cares what goes on"
bad,ITW is an old fashioned manufacturer that was at one time innovative and cutting edge. It is now flailing to try to keep up. Management doesn't have or give a clear direction.
bad,Didn’t really have to work with anyone but sometimes needed other people for bigger machines. I got along with everyone that was higher advanced than me which helped me out a lot. They were helpful for the most part. But once they thought you were fine with everything they would let you go free without any questions.
bad,The work and the floor employees are great. Management not so much for example it took this company over a year and a half to get a simple hi-lo license. In this time i was told just to be careful by my direct supervisor. Corporate seems to be moving in and at this time taking a lot from production staff what they have taken from the hourly employees they made sure the salary employees still get the benefits the moral was really low last i was at this place.
bad,"ITW purchased the car care division from Shell back in 2011. It was a nimble, entrepreneurial company that has now been overrun by corporate and has poor leadership. The core values that ITW boasts they live by are not followed by their leadership. Employee morale is at an all time low. Raises and bonuses continue to lessen year after year even when the company is performing well. The management cant be trusted and are not looking out for it's employees."
bad,"Legacy employees are huge roadblocks to progress. Hostile work environment.  Upper management makes biased decisions, too many resources in one plant and not nearly enough in other plants even when both manufacture the same products. Meaning, one plant is a sweatshop and the other is relaxed and has reasonable pressures. The General Manager is superb at justifying the reasons for continuing with the sweatshop culture."
bad,"This was a good company in terms of the people and the dedication they had in providing great products and great services to the customer."
bad,"Hartness was a good company when it was family owned.  ITW bought them out 7 years ago, and the change was gradual at first.  The company culture changed for the worse.  There has been a loss of customer focus.  Employees are unapologetically treated as disposable commodities.  Most of the better managers have left or been let go and replaced by ITW corporate folks.  "
bad,EU Leadership is forward thinking and has defined growth objectives. The NA group has overbearing cost controls and un yielding to move into the 21st century for managerial practices and employee development.
bad,"Ultima etapa de mi relación con ITW"
bad,the work is not hard and management don't do what they should to make people want to continue to work there. I liked what I used to do there and I did what needed to make the employee feel welcome and appreciated their work performing.
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
bad,"I have learned quite a bit in my short time, as my entire department has left! You never know if you are on the next round of layoffs. They seem to do it bi-annually."
bad,"Overall, I liked working here from the aspect of the co-worker relationships that I nurtured during my employment."
bad,"ITW as a company is good but working as a Quality Inspector for  ITW Mokena Plant was the worst experience. We were always understaffed since I started and the supervisor would threaten to take sick time (which is only 24 hours) and PTO if you couldn't come in early or stay late to cover a shift due to understaff. (Also if you were late you had to use 4 hours of sick time even if its a minute!) I believe Quality Inspectors were treated unfairly because the supervisor would push new employees to quit with her rude comments and over work old employees with the schedules and physical labor of taking on multiple QC jobs at once. I recently left this job a few days ago because I was told to come in early for a week straight on times I cannot make due to having younger children in daycare, even though they hired me knowing this. Other than the horrible management I think the discounts for employees are amazing, but I would not recommend Mokena plant due to how hard they work employees because of shortage."
bad,Great People in operations.  New GM at this site does not understand how to motivate effectively. Salary staff very strong and floor workers have incredible work ethic.
bad,"I really enjoyed what I did on a daily bases, I like the hands on, learning new things , hours worked were GREAT, lots of over time, people on the more part were friendly."
bad,"Nice workplace but hostile environment. Management can be better. Coworkers are nice and well mannered and able to learn a lot from the ones that been there awhile, As Quality Inspector, I learned the ins and outs of the automotive industry as far as the gas pieces and doors, learned how to do measurements using calibers. Overall it was a lesson learned"
bad,"Well paid job. Co-workers and supervisors are nice for the most part. Too much over time without prior notice. 7 day work weeks are not unusual with no notice."
bad,"8.5 hour shift Monday-Friday"
bad,"Fumes are terrible.  Not the place for people with asthma and allergies. Machine Operators are stuck in one place all shift. It's like working at a drive thru window every day. Team leads and Supervisor watching you. Piece work, so your parts are timed and counted."
bad,Pay was too low for all the work you do and they demand. Management is terrible but the good thing is their benefits and vacation time makes up for the poor management and low pay! Plus side they are off on weekends and overtime is frequent!
bad,No room for growth modern day plantation will work you like a dog then send you on your way once they're done with you. Pay is absolutely horrible they treat you like kids
bad,Long hours and hard work along with poor management is a recipe for disaster. If we had better equipment to run and someone who knows how to manage a factory it would be a much better place to work.
bad,"Disorganized, dishonest, only saving grace is good benefits."
bad,"The job was ok as far as working in a laid back environment, but the job has no room for improving your capabilities and work structure. I've been promised to move around and learn new skills, but it was only talk. You get a raise once a year ( only gives you like 15-30 cent raise. I been there for roughly 5 years, i only made $1.28 more since that time period. Would be a better company if it was manage by better people."
bad,Working at Zip Pak is a fast paced environment which continuously requires adaption to day to day changes which will provide a high quality product to our customers.
good,"Heartless supervisors, Job is actually easy, management makes it difficult.  Some co-workers will go out of their way to help you.  The best part of the job is going home."
good,This company was ok to work for it was so disorganized the people were very rude not very helpful when asking questions about the job. I felt very uncomfortable
good,No se tiene seriedad en conflictos personales con empleados
good,working on the assembly line making car parts or filters for ford motor company.
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"Poor Management.  No job stability focused on cutting cost instead of qualified hard workers"
good,"Great pay and benefits, horrible management, overall it is a good company to work for but it takes several years to get to day shift and work all weekends"
good,"Like any company, ITW cooking division wants to produce as much as possible for its customer base at the least cost possible.  However, in my opinion the upper management team in place at time I was there were completely clueless what it really meant from real engineering prospective how that should have been done.  Communication was not great.  Upper plant management seemed to be afraid of corporate management and would do everything they could to not be fully honest with the corporate team.  This to some degree handcuffed middle management because of the ""don't tell bad news to management"" philosophy.   Management in the cooking division were not engineers and had no clue about actual basic engineering practices.  If ideas were presented that were not in there scope of knowledge, they labeled you a arrogant person.  Training meetings were very poorly communicated to the point no know knew they were even scheduled.  As an engineer, you are requested to do more than one thing at a time, but when you present that you are and can do more than one project at a time, you are told you are doing to much.  It is a very difficult work environment to succeed in."
good,"Its a nice place to work if you don,t need a stable income. Due to supply and demand the automotive industry has its ups and downs and work hours will be adjusted accordingly."
good,"its an alright job for somebody who doesnt have many daytime activities going on. if i hadnt wanted to continue my education I mightve still been working there. the only down fall of the job was the not really knowing what time you would be getting off,you might finish your work at 3:30 then have to go help someone else and be stuck there til 7:30"
good,"Better than some , worse than others. Typical Automotive molder. Run extremely lean, even in the salaried support positions. Always a fire to put out. All in all, not a bad place."
good,"First thing, THERE IS NO ON-SITE H.R.! That's a problem! The person in charge of payroll is in another state. That's a problem! For to be a small division of a large corporation you would think things would run a bit more smoothly. Not the case here. A majority of the people who've been there for years, are some of the laziest people I've ever worked around. And the on-site management seem to be content with it."
good,I'm just at ITW as a contractor at the moment and not involved with any of their internal actions. As a temporary employee with the opportunity to continue as a contractor. Currently its a 6 month contract.
good,Will not make changes. Poor communication. Bad upper managment. Cant be efficent in a managment role as HR and plant managers tell you to not do REQUIRED duties as a manager. Such as to not let people go when there is a need.
good,"Poor Managing, Chaotic Work environment, Information does not flow smoothly, I worked under 4 plant managers in the last 2 years. Pulled in every way."
good,A typical day would be very high pace. Also the support from the management team was far and few. Most of the shop-floor operators are paid very low pay rates. So the effort from them was very minimum.But the most enjoyable was the interaction with shopfloor employees.
good,"good experience. My work includes managing a team of specialists, analyzing data to draw conclusions and carrying out random visual inspections. I am also involved in carrying out a Quality Check List, signing off sheets that have to be filled out and writing up reports for the eyes of senior managers."
good,Clock in pre shift meeting then go to the floor and put oil in the machines load wire fill machines with coolant take batched nails to inventory load nails for cell tech to pack and ship
good,of course the minorities are geting screwed on pay...bc they dont understand there worth or power as a unit.   management is just a home-grown circle of clowns
good,machine operator worked in fast paced warehouse production was required 6 days a week no paid lunch really easy training and job assignment left job due to moved
good,only worked there a couple months people are great there surprisingly considering the very poor management and treatment of employees and especially temps turnover is above normal and pay is way below demography of area
good,"I've given this question some thought, and overall I've been very satisfied with my job. I've been able to work with some really interesting people."" The hard work"
good,"ITW is constantly changing its management views, no set procedures in place. Always starting new working procedures and no one in management to uphold."
good,"It's an okay place to work. Some things do remind you of working on a plantation because it is very strict, even with going to the bathroom. They are based off a point system which will screw you and no matter what proper documentation you have, it doesn't matter. But if you can keep up with the pace of the company, then you are good to go."
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"Normalmente aguardávamos, eu e um colega de trabalho na área de Mecânica, um chamado para a manutenção e/ou resolução de problemas no maquinário, que estivessem prejudicando a produção. Também realizávamos manutenção corretiva no começo, periodicamente, conforme instrução prévia. Aprendi sobre o meu comportamento no local de trabalho, realização de manutenção elétrica em equipamentos, dispositivos e aparelhos elétricos e eletrônicos industriais, alguns elementos de mecânica básica, e principalmente uma introdução à área de Automação Industrial, na programação das funções e sistemas da máquina, na qual desejo me aperfeiçoar e especializar nos próximos meses. Meu superior era bem ativo, se envolvia nas atividades, conduzia e ensinava em diversos aspectos na manutenção da máquina, até por experiência própria, até que ele saiu por problema de saúde. Desde então, a gerência passou a ser indiferente às nossas atividades e realizações, e não valorizava tais feitos, tendo em vista que a empresa estava sendo vendida e próxima de perder o contrato com a Estatal para qual prestávamos serviço. Os colegas de trabalho eram de ótima convivência, reconhecíamos nossas posições, tínhamos um relacionamento profissional estreito, e compartilhamento de experiências nas áreas diversas eram constantes, apesar das limitações impostas pelas máquinas sob nossa responsabilidade. A parte mais difícil foi o começo, por ser a primeira experiência profissional, o nervosismo e a falta de apoio inicial foi um obstáculo. A parte mais agradável sempre foi a resolução dos problemas, a percepção da qualidade na"
good,"I operate an injection molding press. I place the filter media in the proper posistion, start the process, remove molded parts from machine, check for quality then pack and label. Very easy work, excellent co-workers."
good,"If you are looking for a job that you can show up to wearing belly and knee high boots then this is a place.... a few work hard...the rest, its a joke! the pay sucks, even if you work hard... you can do more than your job, just to get paid less send those playing with there hair I would not recommend Richton park location to anyone! its a joke"
good,My typical day on the job was doing the same thing each day. i learned how to work hard and be as trust worthy tha any body else. management had their days good and bad the only problem is tha they takes it out on you.the co-workers were very easy to communicate with on a daily basis. the hardest thing i had to do was learn my job when i first started.and the most enjoyable part of my job was just coming to work and doing my job every day so i could support my family
good,Long hours for $10/hr. You don’t get a lunch at all but you do get three fifteen minutes breaks. If you can handle up to 50 pounds in the air for 10 dollars an hour then this job is the one for you.
good,"Turned in a manager for violating the Code of Ethics, and was terminated for it.  So much for being anonymous and helping the company maintain their integrity."
good,ITW is a good company itself. Those managing the company in prior years were not good. Company is constantly looking for opportunities to cut cost. Ok place to work overall.
good,Was a good place to work until the started their new strategy and closed or relocated over 50 plants world wide with more planed. Poor mid level managment is a comon problem. Uper level and lower level was great. The problem is you do not know when you walk into one of there plants if today will be the day they announce your plant is closing.
good,"Pro: Great experience to lead, good pay, opportunities to present to leadership and travel"
good,Company pays well but management is horrible plays favorites very unproffesional and 1st shift is always right .Some co-workers are out to make you look bad and get you fired.
good,"tedious work, one week we are slammed with orders then the next week half the plant only works twenty hours. Get told one thing and the total opposite happens."
good,"The work is very consistent and keeps you busy through out the day. Although the breaks are short, you really don't get a lunch. The pay is just not right, especially for what you are required to do. The management doesn't listen to one another. The supervisors don't do there job."
good,"sort out orders "
good,"Work is steady"
good,No matter how hard you work and how loyal you are...you won’t be appreciated. A lot of staff have come and gone over the years. Nobody stays there that long which shows a lot about the company in itself.
good,It was stressful and wasn't pleasant for African American.  The manager there was not nice and did not to hear what no one else had to say. It was his way or no way
good,Just lack of good management a lot of supervisors changing over the years as well as human resources a lot of down time due to management not getting material in time
good,I learned how to put different car parts together and i enjoyed this because ive always had a passion for cars. I would be willing to accept more job offers if pay rate was increased.
good,"As a temp, my work performance was excellent. When the time came for me to become full-time, I was asked by my supervisor to find another temp agency that would charge a lower rate. I was then instructed to work for that particular temp agency, and I would eventually get hired full time with the company."
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"Ok place to work, hard work, fast paced, high production needed. work long hours and many changes constantly going on. work load varies day to day, run from 3 to 9 machines."
good,"Check out maintenance work orders, forklifts, air-brushers, oil feed lines,  air compressors, parts inventory, lights that needed to be changed, paper products that had to be filled"
good,"It's ok luches and breaks are come first,  first come basis. No one goes on Break or lunch until last if you are new. No talking or friendship with fellow workers"""
good,"I think this place doesn't pay enough. You barely make minimum wage starting off and raises only come once a year and the maximum raise is very small. Really great coworkers though. Also, it's a busy job wirh high expectations so it's challenging."
good,It's been overall a decent job just looking for a change of pace and a different feild of work.i have been here since 03 and my pay has only went up 50$ more on the week and it kinda has poor management skills
good,It's decent. Employee's can be a little more focused. Job advancement are little. But possibility of a new position does come after awhile. If you're looking to further your skill's in learning a variety of machine's..this is the place to go.
good,Me  lo pase genial y el personal  era muy divertido
good,"Worked with customers daily via phone call center. Entered orders via computer system, created RMAs for the products, invoiced customers, worked with logistics in getting robots from Point A to Point B while creating the proper paperwork, researched and helped to solve customer issues. Learned lots of computer work and how to deal with customers. Management was supportive on most points, but had a lot on their plate as well.  Co-workers were very helpful and a great sounding board for issues trying to solve. Hardest part of my job was trying to resolve issues in a timely manner while getting management's approval. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and having each day be different than the one before."
good,"High turn over rate.  Focused on  shareholder value only.  What have you done for me lately company.  Can be an outstanding performance one year, then miss one goal the next year and they look to fire you."
good,"I worked as an assembly tech for 17 years here. It was a good place to work until ITW got hold of it. The supervisors are so job scared it makes the environment terrible. One supervisor was exceptionally rude. People complained to human resources, nothing happened. The lady in HR was shacked up with him."
good,It is a tough culture to come into as an outsider.  Upper management has very stringent guidelines to hold to which is holding them back from being a successful company.  Their is a lot of knowledge in this company.  Very strong engineering base.  No room for advancement in middle management.
good,"at no other place have a I seen corporate be just a support office for a bunch of small businesses. ITW is super decentralized, allows a lot of autonomy to its subsidiary businesses."
good,"This company is good, it's just under bad management. I don't like to criticize the company's but you ask the question.  Lack of training communication between management and employee. I think it can do a lot better. Employee to employee everyone gets along again it all comes down with management."
good,"i really don't have much to say.with the work needed,i feel as thought they should pay their employees more. I was a temp and received my paper work to be hired in and next day or so i was let go for no reasoning"
good,To much responsibility for very low wages.  Just dont see a future for myself.  Worked with nice people.   The building is very old and needs updated.
good,Fair place of work. Good benifits. No work life balance. DIfficult commute. Nice campus. Culture is strange. Public transportation is close by for City dewellers.
good,"If you get the chance to land a job an Illinois Tool Works company take the job, learn the industry, learn their toolbox, and make a decision at that time on whether you want to stay or look for something else."
good,"good company good for young adults, benefits are great zero t"
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"A typical workday is trying to prioritize what needs to be completed first to meet shipment demands, while staying in compliance and being safe.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get the job done while being understaffed and the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all deadlines, which I have consistently done since joining the team. My co-workers are the best and we all work very well together.  I have learned a lot about medical devices, where as all of my past quality experience has been in pharmaceuticals for over 15 years."
good,"A few stressful days, some fun and relaxing days,  the best  of all was dealing with the customers/distributors and serve them in all that was possible and allowed to do. "
good,"A regular day at ITW would a easy going pace with everybody working. I learned certain things about different car parts in which i were working with. The management was pretty solid, i never had any  problems that wasn't fixed and my co-workers were kind also. Overall ITW is alright."
good,I came in at night feed a machine small filters most of the night. When I got done with that I will sort through the parts i just ran and look for defected ones. After i finished sorting i pack them into boxes then clean my work area. Co-workers was alright we had some good and bad ones.
good,"interesting work attitude"
good,"Temp job, good experience but pay could of been better. I was doing maintenance here. Good people, good enivornment. Though the pay is lacking and had to look elsewhere."
good,Not to many opportunities to advance up in the company but the benefits and environment is safe and friendly many machines to learn and get more hands on experience
good,"I worked in a strategic role, at the corporate level. "
good,"co workers are great people, we all get along, lot of work, fast pace, salary could be much better we give a 110% we take our job serious, to make sure everything goes out when its suppose to, I go beyond what's expected of me, dedicated, punctual and always there."
good,They don't keep upper management around long enough to implement plans. New management come in and make changes which puts us in the hole. Machine operators are put on 12 hours a day to dig out of the hole. Management is changed then the same process starts all over again.
good,very fast paced environment where climate conditions were undesirable.  friendly employees and management staff.  good hours with chance for overtime to compensate for low wages.  summer outing and winter outing paid for by company.  safety and perfect attendance rewards motivated the employees
good,Heavily cost driven culture - President's level gets it.  VP GM level not as strategic in the US.  The EU management is highly engaged and strategic in its approach.
good,"Great company but lacks pay for work required. The amount of work expected is overwhelming and at times, unrealistic. Management needs to get better and upgrades need to be made to tracking inventory. RS Scanners would be a huge help to tracking what is pulled and to what is produced."
good,"Nice environment but since they are so small, very little attention or guidance provided by upper management.  In general everyone hard working and very consciences at their jobs."
good,Advancement is hard however there is room for growth. Overall low pay scale. Poor communication in production needs and lacks management support on everyday goals.
good,Due to significant management turn over you always feel like you are interviewing for a new position. Although the company had developed a good set of tools the end goal was always changing depending on the style of the current manager.
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"The company goal is to satisfy the customer. Depending on the supervisor, there may be some manipulation to insist for an employee to extend their working hours. I learned that the employee is only a means for a goal, but not always valued for their worth. The culture is to continue high turnover, with many temporary employees and not focus on needed training. Either you got the skill and you remain employed or you are out of luck with few training opportunities and you are fired. The hardest part is the 10 hr to 12 hr shifts that I had to endure, during the times my location had one shift. Even having to come in a few hours early to make up for a newly created shift that was inexperienced to production goals. Lack of sleep was an issue. The management lack employee appreciation and with minimal satisfying gestures. I enjoyed the individual that was my manager, which later management lowered his position to a supervisor. He worked above what he shall have done. Took his personal time to ensure production was completed. Listened more than the rotation of supervisors and team leaders that did not last long. I admired him, even though the pressure was placed upon the operators on the assembly line."
good,With another shift leader and floor manager it would've been the top of the line local job for me. But I had a injury on the job and the shift leader and floor manager didn't take it into consideration that I might have been seriously injured. I pulled a disc in my lower back with excruciating pain shooting from my pelvic to the top of my head is my description.
good,People are great to work with! Environment is okay. I learned to work with different people and the machines were a good learning experience. Glad I had the chance to pick up a new skill.
good,Very stressful upper mgmt. had lots of problems working with the employees. Long hour days 15 hours a day sometimes . Keeping my team ahead of the other teams was fun but lots of back stabbing going on. I managed the best team and made my team happy and safe. But they never seemed to want to fix things or help take care of there employees.
good,"The company had a streamlined process for interns.  We were given a range of opportunities to find our best fit.  There were company events to promote teamwork (ex. sand volleyball).  It had a rather typical large-company structure and the associated paperwork.  The most enjoyable part of my job was participating in a product development brainstorming event.  The hardest part was convincing them I could take on a challenge, even as an intern."
good,Can be a good place to work. Must be a self motivated person to learn. Could do  better job at choosing team leaders. Their lack of professionalism holds this place back a little.
good,Layoff every year jobs get slow run out of work to do . Management works hard to get jobs but it is a lot of red tape for them.They need more growing develop . And when there is work they can put out a lot of product it is not hard work . they have a lot of good lines and setups
good,"The aspect I enjoy the most is working with customers to resolve their questions on equipment failures.  I enjoy explaining to them at a level they understand what the probable causes may be.  I initiate changes to processes to better serve our customers and develop service bulletins and work instructions to ensure our company goals of support are met.  "
good,"Shipping and receiving duties - domestic and international orders. Fun co-workers, especially at lunch break"
good,Work 4 ten hour days. A lot of turn over. Low pay. Co-workers are fun to work with.
good,typical work day running a inject mold press push the button and inspect the finished product 
good,Inspected production. Perform inspection and testing duties to insure that shipped product fulfills all customer specifications and quality requirements. Managent and co-workers were exciting and fun to work with. Troublshooting was the mos chalenging but was the most enjoyable part because it was never a dull moment.
good,"The division is relatively small, giving me experience in many different aspects of the business. Management and co-workers are friendly and easy to work with. The automotive industry is very demanding and fast paced. Days are often very long and stressful."
good,My time at ITW Muller... then ITW Mima was very instructional. ITW has such a rich and diverse employee base to draw from there is something new to learn every day.
good,Bad Management from the git go. Work environment was not well and people just didn't get along. I feel that if there is new management or training there wouldn't be a turnover.
good,Good place to work with good Benefits. Sometimes expects a little much from one person. over all not a bad place. Not much over time and no room for advencement.
good,"ITW has an am, pm, and overnight shift. The work conditions are fair, but the pay is on the lower end. Overall, ITW was good experience and I met good people there."
good,Ok company to work for good no team work in the work place every one take care off them self 40 hours work week pay every two weeks need improvement in the company
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"Operate and deliver material to line changed materials operate floor jack, operate forklift management was ok hardest part of the day would be coming in after second shift and having to stock what they didn't do and make sure my shift had what they needed through out our shift not a problem for me though."
good,"The people are amazing, I felt very welocome on the team. Managment needs to have a huge reality check. what they expect from you is not really doable, for me. Pressured to work overtime due to poor scheduling by managment."
good,"the place is great, its organized. well managed, has tons of work for everyone. the place always stays busy. treats everyone with professional respect and manner"
good,Good place to work.  Ever-changing environment.  Must be able to adapt to change quickly.  Capable of working in a technical environment is paramount.
good,"Itw was an ok place to work, it just didn't pay enough money. It was a 8 hour job but they were always laying off and there was no room for advancement."
good,"Productive Environment"
good,I liked this company's hours and Monday through Friday schedule.But it is a very racist company to work for.You have to know someone to move up the ladder or you have to be Caucasian.This company is not very fair
good,"I learned a lot about everything from printing to electrical work, to welding to team management. The only thing that particular business unit was missing was a respectable and stern authoritative figure to hold individuals and teams accountable."
good,Long fast pace job. The hardest part on this job was keeping up to make production. The most enjoyable part was being able to go home on time. I learn to do numerous jobs.
good,It wasn't an bad job. I don't enjoy working in warehouses. The job was simple it self come in watch this machine make sure everything work correctly and not you had certain instructions.
good,"Working at ITW was a good experience, definitely learned new things. Their working hours were great. If no overtime needed you would only work Monday through Friday."
good,"Standing long hours, heavy lifting, bending, use hand tools, make boxes, paperwork, keep area clean, cross train, machine operator, exercise to start day off"
good,The job at ITW was ok in the beginning until I started noticing the nepotism and favoritism being thrown around. That made the workplace undesirable and I believe it was tome for a change.
good,I feel its a great job but not enough pay The management was poorly not enough communication about the plant. The culture of the plant was great good veracity of culture .
good,"they have two shifts for manufacturing department, first and second"
good,it was ok i just didnt like my hours or pay rate was low. everything else seem fair and the people there was nice. lots of young people though that talked alot.
good,No opportunity for advancement  pretty much work by myself all night I'm the only one that answers the machines did not get break coverage for the first two years
good,"As an auditor, you visit many different companies and have the opportunity to travel the world and experience different cultures. Great opportunity for a candidate fresh out of college and able to travel."
good,The company has transitioned from a growth centered company to one focused on cost cutting and minimization to drive stock prices.  There is a point were this will catch up and damage the businesses and brands in the company.
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,This was a job I had while going to school and it was close to school so it was convenient. I didn't  plan on staying here very long but long enough to get school done.
good,ITW Magnaflux can be a great place to work but its structure does not present much opportunity for advancement or professional development. The centralized ITW approach to organizational learning and everything else dampens innovation and favors groupthink.
good,Excellent Benefits. Good Pay. This company comes out of Illinois where the corporate office is located. I worked there for about 2 years. The benefits are very good.
good,"Due to the wide variety of duties I perform during the day, it is hard"
good,I think ITW can be improve to meet the qualifications that every business needs. The management at ITW is not up to expectation and this business is not very organize.
good,Great benefits.  Very segmented company going through growing pains in certain groups.  High expectations and requirements to wear many hats on a daily basis.
good,the facility was clean. There were a lot of different job opportunities. they had good benefits. Only bad thing was the employee drama.
good,Lower level employees make the company successful. They are hard working and great to work with. Liked the 80/20 tool box training.
good,"Great atmosphere, great people to work with. Learned all areas of the business. Started in production and then was promoted to shipping/receiving warehouse clerk."
good,"Lots of drama in this unionized shop really turned me off. But it is a boring job so I guess people need something to do. Overall not a really bad place just a few drama queens. Pay is low to start, no vacation your first year if you work on the floor. Getting overtime is usually not a problem. They lay people off allot if you are new. The floor level engineers have allot of hats to wear."
good,I was night-shift supervisor in an extrusion/printing and bag-making company where I was able to gain both supervisory and hands-on machine knowledge. Being in charge of a large work-force in a busy environment with tight schedules taught me valuable skills that I have used for my entire career.
good,"I feel like the management at ITW Shippers lack on communicating with the employees that work out in the production, I also feel like their always hiding things from their employees."
good,"Demanding work, unreasonable expectations, resulting in stress, regular changing of management, chemical smell in air from printing inks and chemicals, leaks from roof when rain,and snow and ice build-up on roof roof in winter, also resulting in leaks. Good 401k plan.Many foreign workers working 12 hours shifts 6 to 6 and 6 to 6. Some vary monotonous procedures."
good,"Wysoka rotacja kadry zarządzającej, kompetentni współpracownicy, brak odpowiednio zorganizowanego marketingu, możliwość samodzielnej pracy."
good,Tons of experience gained in the supply chain field. Took part in ensuring customer orders were filled accurately and timely. Also monitored inventory levels
good,ITW is a good place to learn and be involved within a large fortune 200 firm.
good,Fast pace environment. Continuously assisting others while managing the production facility.
good,I typical day is rather normal got to work from 6 am to 230. struggle with the schedule change where from one day to the next we can be working overtime and the next day we aren't. I looking for something that will challenge me to become a better working and will allow me to get into a career that I enjoy.
good,Good place to work. I started out there with limited mechanical experience but I learned quickly and was running the machines with best operators there. They have a lot of layoffs tho.
good,the training was terrible you stood in the same spot for the whole shift not good for your back the managers were never around the  co-workers were ok
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"Go in to work and get right at it, weigh rolls and make lids and pallets.  I learned how to bring the line back up when it goes down, also how to make sure the trim blades are changed out and pull the trim back if it loses trim.  Management was good.  Co- workers were fine no problems with them. Hardest part of job was when we ran 9.5"".  Most enjoyable was bringing the line back up."
good,"They offer the best of the best as far as instrumentation and training goes. However, there is very little effort to advance personnel or positions. that's all"
good,"ITW offers a good place to work, however, there isn't much room for advancement unless you are willing to move to another location. Promotions are given randomly and you don't get the opportunity to hear about an opening until they have already given to someone."
good,This is an environment that lends itself to autonomy.  The people are all very professional and friendly.  They truly believe in empowering their employees.
good,"Upper management does not get involved in our business, even with significant reductions in revenue year over year.  They have a very hands off approach, and don't help even if help is needed."
good,"ITW as a whole is not a bad place to work.  They do demand a lot, but in return, you can advance as far as your abilities will take you.  ITW GTR, on the other hand, will overwork you and push you as far and as fast as they can.  Most employees compensate by just working on whatever the current fire is with worrying too much about the rest.   I did enjoy my time with them and they gave me several great opportunities that I may not have gotten otherwise.  I only wished that they operated under better senior management."
good,"This was once a great place to work. However, top level changes in direction have forced consolidation to improve stock value. Service levels have dropped horribly and many careers have ended. Don't see how they can keep this going."
good,"ITW is a great place for interns and professionals just starting their career. They are very adamant on jump-starting your career and getting you into a position where you can gain lots of experience. Unfortunately, there is a growth ""peak"" and with lots of uncertainty/lack of clear direction from upper management, it is not clear as to what the future will hold. The company is also very focused on Sales/Marketing initiatives, so if you are in that field, you will be treated well. If you are in HR, IT, or Finance, you will not be seen as a necessary asset to the company for very long."
good,Low starting pay but yearly increase with great job performance. Opportunity for advancement when other positions are available. Started working in Warehouse then moved to Chemical Batcher.
good,"Constantly putting out fires trying to deliver to the customer.  Constant lack of needed items to be successful."
good,i love my team. sometimes the nature of the industry is a bit cyclical meaning you need to work extra hard in down years for the industry. management expects a lot with little guidance at times
good,"ITW is a great company who I had the pleasure of working for.  Unfortunately, I had a HR manager who was reluctant to forgive honest mistakes.  I have nothing more to post."
good,"the job had great benefits, good hours, and the tasks were ok.  they worked with you to learn your job. some people were friendly, but was set in their ways."
good,"the hardest part on the job was running line and trying to meet production before the shift ended , sometimes we worked 12 hours or more we had good days and some bad but it never stopped our work"
good,"After 21 years @ 6 different plants within the Company I retired in a cut back having to do with budget cuts and restructuring.,"
good,"Learned lots of things working at this company, may not pay the best but advancement is there if youre truly ambitious."
good,"_llego área trabajo recibo turno y empiezo mi turno dando seguimiento a pendientes y a la vez realizando mi rol de trabajo diario como ir maquina por maquina checando el producto que no haya tenido algún cambio desde el inicio de producción, liberación de producto terminado, liberaciones de inicio a producción que se den en turno y seguimiento a issue que salgan con cliente o interno"
good,ITW was a productive environment. A typical day at work was pretty busy. I learned how to multitask and get things done efficiently. Our management trained us well and they were a good staff. My coworkers were good people. We all had the common goal of producing the best products we could. The hardest part of the job was the intense physical labor that took a toll on your body over a period of time. The most enjoyable part was the people.
good,working for ITW was fun and knowledgeable. Here I learned to use measure tools and leadership.
good,"  I set up and run a CNC machine making hundreds of parts.  Check parts often to make sure they match the prints.  I then assemble them together."
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,Benefits are superb and the company itself is great but this location seems to be poorly run.
good,overall good job not very difficult but hours and employment affected by auto economy
good,"A day at ITW for me was operating machines not to much heavy work, the managers was awesome work place always was up to part and clean and they always made sure that us as  employees knew how we was doing!"
good,"I believe ITW is a good place to work but not amazing back when I worked there, before name change. The work environment is overall positive. Definitely a job when you need it but not a last resort type."
good,"Itw was a cool place to work starting out. Doing this year, they did a transition, and it was the wrong think to do. Should had stuck with the old ways."
good,"A typical day starts with a safety meeting, followed by stretches then assignments are given typically as a mold operator you're given two machines and told to inspect parts while wearing white gloves so that you don't get oil/grease on the parts.  Hardest part of the job is probably dealing with the fact it's relatively slow paced there's a lot of just standing and waiting for parts to come down the conveyor belts."
good,Started as a family owned business but eventually purchased by large corporation.  There has been growing pains with new product demand but not enough people to do the work due to labor market.
good,"1.finish what first shift didn't get done fully"
good,"The company gradually lost its divisional entrepreneurship by over emphasis on corporate interference, governance and not adapt to market segment targets."
good,fast paced work environment that you work 12 hour days and have a good group of people to work with. On the job training and everyone is willing to help each other out would recommend working here if someone is looking for a job
good,"Stockholders are the only thing that matter to the management at this company.  Employees are expected to assume many roles outside of their primary function.  However, it is a solid financial performer."
good,"Expected to maintain Financial  accuracy and work with Managers to control costs.  Reported financial results bi-weekly to Corporate.  Worked with various teams to improve the process of various job function and to reduce costs. "
good,I would prefer not to say anything about this company thank you it was a ok place to work till layoffs just started for work slowing down but was good at one point
good,ITW has great benifits and vacation time. The raises and pay rate could be better. Exspecailly for good employees that are always doing their best and have been there for several years.
good,Production was fast paced well needed. 8hr shifts and OT on weekends sometimes. Patience is key you have to be able to deal with people on a regular basis. Exciting fast learning availability.
good,"Not a terrible place, but unorganized due to poor communication. Clean. Strict,  but not in an overbearing way. Pay is lacking. Benefits are good.No swing shifts."
good,Great place to work and advance fortune500 company family admitsphe great place to meet new people and become friends manager are fair and honest helpful co workers

good,"I enjoy all the aspects of my job."
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"A typical day at ITW is very easy going. Its a very laid back organization. I learned a lot of different positions. Some management was hard to work with, but most of them was great. The co-workers was fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is the amount of salary that they pay. They will give you a position but don't want to pay you for it."
good,"start work at 7.30 am"
good,"Excellent coworkers, "
good,I set up machines and lead our department team. Had fun working there and enjoyed the people a the plant.
good,troubleshoot all production equipment.
good,OK experience but the people aren't to good.Learn a lot of stuff.And I enjoy the work. I really didn't learn to much at ITW. I learn alot about defects and the frame and what it takes to put part on car doors
good,"As a Fortune 200 company, ITW has many benefit perks that are above other companies. ITW gives reimbursement for charitable donations and will match your contributions."
good,"Pros: "
good,Very diversified company. Comprised of many business units. Got to work with several departments and areas. Cool company culture. Quiet environment to work.
good,"Clock in, check the daily workload and start your day. With the current restructuring, it's hard to say how much room there is for advancement in the immediate future."
good,"I only worked there for a very short time, but I did not mind the place.  Not much stress, small group of employees and good system in place which made work much more sufficient."
good,"I actually met alot of people on this job due to being moved around at different positions. I've learned how to put together plenty of pieces of the car, plus I was able to meet my goal before the end of the day."
good,"My first two years there were amazing. I was very involved in the company and would often work overtime to meet the need of the clients. I respected my supervisors because they deserved it and returned it. Once moving to another building and job, I was verbally abused by the shipping supervisor and given no help with this matter. My last day, he screamed at me putting me in tears, I used vacation time to go home and received a voluntary termination letter in the mail the next day."
good,The hardest part of my job was the training and knowledge that had to be learned to run the equipment properly. The company offers a great benefits/compensation package with room for growth.
good,I worked molding presses and had a number to hit on the parts I made there was really no talking just work but on lunch breaks most employees would speak to each other and have a good time after working the presses so long when they malfunction you learn how to fix them yourself.
good,They are not a bad company to work for but the compensation when it comes to wages leaves something more desired when working afternoon turn there isn't much overtime available  on this shift and the HR makes inconvenient mistake that involve payroll.
good,The Job Is Very Is Easy To Learn When You Are Train Right And Have Been On The Operating Machine More Than Once.  I learn How To Make Gas Parts For Automated Car.  My Co-Workers Are Very nice and hardworking people.  The Hardest Part Of My Job Is Keeping Up With Quota Timer.  The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Is Working with The Co-Workers.  We Feel That If We Work Together On Certain Projects.  More Things Will Get Done Quicker And Faster.
good,Ability to follow simple oral or written instruction
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"Closeness to home a plus. They discriminate  between the regular employees and the temporary employees."
good,It is a good entry-level job for a plant. You work long hours but you were guaranteed 40+ hours a week. It was a hot working environment was the only drawback to working in that plant.
good,"Grreat place to work at just feel like its not worth it in my opinion."
good,"relaxed"
good,"Typical day at ITW would consist of receiving and sorting incoming and outgoing mail and packages according to postal regulations and unit requirements.Delivers and picks up mail and packages at proper locations, Weighs and stamps or makes arrangements for outgoing mail and packages, operating mail processing machines as necessary. Maintain logs of postage charges, receipt forms, and other records as required.Perform data entry activities and assist in filing and archiving documents"
good,"I didn't mind the work I was a mechanical brazer and doing the same work for the same company in a different state. The only difference is the ITW in the state of Illinois, Chicago was a union shop....Workers there got paid 40 dollars per hour for the same thing that I did in Florida for only 15 dollars per hour."
good,Love the challenge it brings sometimes. Learned how to operate so many jigs.
good,"A typical work day consisted of shipping truss connector plates and construction hardware plus receiving of raw materials. I learned about logistics, inventory control & becoming an effective leader. The hardest part of the job was nothing. I believe you should give you all to your job. The most enjoyable part was working with the same associates for the better part of 8 years. We were like family."
good,ITW is okay  honestly the job itself was fine but they’re pretty ruthless people over all no matter how nice they seem. Cooperate world never changes.
good,It was a great company to work for...not alot of mobility though.  I enjoy the atmosphere and the people and the flexibility in schedule is definitely a plus.
good,58 hours a week running junk equipment pay is too low for what they expect out of you vacation and health insurance is the only good thing about this place
good,Los niveles de producción son bajos por la mala organización
good,"A typical day at work is always stressful  here. Its a fast paced job where your running 2-4 different machines. which are dropping parts that you have to inspect & package. not all of your machines are next to one another. You have to find another co-worker to relieve you. meaning they have to run there machines and yours, because they would never stop the machines. All the co-workers are friendly and very helpful."
good,Worked here for 3 years as temporary. The more you do the more they expect. Zero praise for learning new things. I was let go because I was sick and I had no benefits so I was unable to take a sick day or vacation day. My boss sat around ate chips and talked to the other woman boss all day long while I did all the shipping for her. The other departments have much better management.
good,"1: Personal einteilen, Fertigungsaufträge/Planung machen, Fertigware einbuchen und Halbfertigware anfordern"
good,"A great deal of the job is highly physical, and the hours do tend to be difficult to deal with."
good,"Overall, my experience at ITW was great. I was able to work independently and develop skills in a high-paced environment. Compensation does not reflect a worker's overall contribution to the company, however the benefits are great."
good,"Management can be difficult at times, corporate oversight often superscedes local management decisions.  Sometimes feels like shareholders are more important than customers."
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"My entire crew was great, but job security was nonexistent as I was laid off along with many many others around the same time. I'd work here again in an instant,"
good,"Temperature controlled, light weight, good benefits.  Pay is fair for the job required.  Supervisors are friendly and knowledgeable.  Plant conditions are clean and organized."
good,I loved learning how to setup the machines and the work environment is great.  Even though the job is dirty the pay is great. The hours are what the problem is though...  The shifts are offset.
good,an overall good place to work. but no room for advancement. there is a good atmosphere between co-workers. they also provide decent benefits and reasonable pay.
good,"High turnover and long hours. However, the benefits and paid time off packages are awesome. Workplace culture was okay. The hardest part of the job was fast pace environment; very stressful in regard to meeting mandatory deadlines."
good,Worked at a station and make part until you hit your quota for the day
good,ITW is a fast growing company that is growing everyday. The only problem with this company is they don't pay their employees what they are supposed to be paying them. Employees havent had a raise in years.
good,Manage all Logistic aspects both International and domestic for 3 divisions now that we have merged 3 division under one name. I have learned all aspects of transportation both foreign and domestic including being responsible for creating all export paperwork including hazmat. I also manage making sure that for all imports that ISF is properly filed and the HTS database is up to date with working with our engineering department. I work closely with all vendors and maintain multiple spreadsheets that show the progress of our shipments. I am also part of a logistic council that consist of 7 other divisions and negotiate contracts with LTL carriers. The hardest part of my job is that I am the only person throughout the 3 divisions after the merger that has any knowledge of logistics. Because of this reason it is very difficult for me to take any time off and have no back ups. My co-workers that are left from the merger are the most enjoyable part of my job. Since we are a very close group we are always there to help one another since we are all wearing so many hats now. 
good,"Work days are typically different everyday, as we would run different things almost daily."
good,"A typical day is to work on any computer problem I will have to fix or repair it. But overall I have learned alot with her with Computers by installing, repairing or anything to do with computers in general. Management is ok but the lack of communication was missing. No advancement to work in the field of Computers, which I was willing to learn more. My coworkers was great and I enjoyed working with them, which made my day go fast."
good,The position required a large amount of depth to be successful. The management team provides help when needed and will allow you to spread your wings as much as is needed.
good,"typical workday includes managing in process manufacturing quality issues and making progress on upcoming manufacturing products."
good,good place to work at the people was nice and fun to work around if you get the chance to work there i think that you would enjoy it very well. They take good care of their people.
good,"Great place to work.  Good benefits, 401K, nice people to work with.  Overtime available. Clean, safe, uniforms provided and cleaned.  Management respects the employees."
good,"I was only a temporary employee with Human Resources, but I did enjoy my time working there in the small amount of time. Since I was temporary I was not covered under their compensation/Benefit package."
good,Great place to work with many career development opportunities. Offers ability to work on personal career advancements and network within the company while mastering current role.
good,"good company to work for, but we worked A LOT OF OVERTIME. Became familiar RF scanners and complexities of oversea shipments. My only regret is accepting first shift position"
good,"Great place to work. Good people and culture."
good,"ITW is a Fortune 200 company with approximately 14 Billion in revenue.  They have been going business simplification over the last 6 years to separate the performing and under-performing groups. Unfortunately, the ""Specialty"" group is a mixed bag of companies and products and cannot be simplified easily. To my knowledge, the other 6 groups are more consolidated and completed the simplification process."
good,Great spot for me to start my career and learn office culture and discipline. Loved working here! Very close marketing team with projects focused on assisting sales.
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.

good,"Aprendi muito na emoresa, creio que o mais importante foi aprender a ser dinamico e conseguir ser agente de mudanca alinhando a equipe ao redor de um objetivo comum."
good,Although all was a good experience.
good,It is a fast paced place to work with friendly co-workers. ITW has great benifits. Each division is like a working for a smaller company with the benifits of a larger company.
good,You must always watch your back here.
good,"good business principles, adequate management - little room for professional growth"
good,"Assisted in building furnaces, Load/Unload inventory, and Operate power tools"
good,"I learned so much from working here. I was in all types of jobs from production clerk to benefits representative. I learned all different things while working here but I liked the Human Resources job the best. I did the paperwork for the newly hired and terminated employees and many other HR related duties; Management was very easy to communicate with and were willing to teach you; the co-workers I had at the time were good, we worked together as a team; The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the people that I had to work with and getting to know them."
good,"I learn who to mix chemicals , check hoppers , lab testing on different grades of plastic , check railcars , troubleshooting equipment"
good,Good place to work. Benefits are great. Small company feel but larger corporate support. Many locations world wide. Decentralized structure that lends itself to owning your own projects and ideas.
good,"As long as the brand falls within the strategic vision of ITW's business model, life is good, which is be in a niche industry and be in an oligapoly, so that price competition is not high and healthy margins can be maintained. The minute this changes, it becomes difficult to manage the business with a long term point of view. Most often than not, everything is looked at from a short term perspective for what could be quick wins. Given a healthy OI is the main goal of ITW, I do like that they don't always chase top line."
good,Decent overall place to work staff r awesome and easy fast paced work and very respectful people and pay rate was decent just lack of communication between employees and staff
good,I learned how to keep track of inventory and do labels for product being shipped out. how to unload and load a trailer. Was a good company to work for and recommend for anyone wanting to work with machines.
good,"Typical day involves guys setting their machines to the slowest speeds and sitting/standing around on their phones as the boxes of parts fills up. After 20-30 minutes you would take the 4-5 20 lb boxes off the conveyor belt and tape it, slap a sticker on it, and stack it on a pallet, throw empty boxes down, and repeat. There was no supervisor on my shift, and no manager, they placed a regular worker in charge of checking to see who came in and who didn't. If machines broke down you were expected to fix it yourself or wait an hour for the only maintenance tech to come work on it. Most guys became aware of the way things worked and took advantage of it all the time, there were a few goal getters who really tried to make as many parts as possible."
good,Lack of upward mobility for me personally based on decision to not relocate.  Great business training and opportunities for advancement if you are comfortable moving to where the opportunities are.
good,"Daily routine included working with customers, design work, lab work, and collaboration.  Developed work instructions and traveled for customer visits and was exposed to Quality and Production."
good,I feel that my time spent at ITW benefited me in the ways most closely aligned with career advancement and skills development.  The work environment was fast paced and required me to perform tasks daily at an extremely efficient level.
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"You will get the resources you need to succeed. Initially, there is room for growth. However, the decentralized nature of the company limits your opportunity."
good,"ITW is a great company to work for.  It's a bit old-fashioned in the corporate office, but any doubts about company should be placated by the company's performance, which has been fantastic."
good,50% outside 97 deg. troubleshooting newly manufactured ground support equipment is hot and can be stressful at times. On the other side when working in lab at 75 deg. is great.
good,"They have good benefits for the employees,they also have good celebration.The only thing I did't like it was always so hot very uncomfortable to work."
good,"Management was good to work with, friendly culture. Always something new to work on every day. The company paid for further education, the health care and retirement available were great."
good,"A ITW é uma empresa multinacional de capital aberto e cresce através de aquisições de outras empresas de segmentos diversos. Desta forma passa por transformações o tempo todo se desfazendo também em sua totalidade ou parcialmente das mesmas empresas adquiridas de acordo com sua estrategia e de seus respectivos diretivos.."

good,"In the last 5 years I worked out of my house, promoting sales, contacting sales agents and customers in Latin America. Also made frequent trips through the region and trade shows. "
good,Work is low stress and our work/ life balance is good. Flexible schedules are good and the work load is fair. The people are nice and the culture is relaxed.
good,"I worked the 2nd shift. It was fast  paced and a blast to work with people who wanted to get the work done as much as I wanted to."
good,"ITW/Hobart is an dynamic, fast paced company which demands excellance from all employees."
good,Great company to work for. Currently a lot of instability as they look to consolidate businesses.
good,to inspect break pads make sure no cracks or chips Company was ok just dirty
good,This company provided a stable work environment and I worked with good people. I am in sales to make the kind of money I am worth.  It was difficult to make a huge difference in my commissions and bonus because of the design of the plan.
good,I enjoyed this job as I have many tasks that needed to be completed with time frames. I managed my day by prioritizing time sensitive issues etc.
good,Fast Pace in growing company a lot of benefits. The job is not for everyone and you are mandated to do long hours and work weekends. Good opportunity for the individual looking to get his feet into Food Equipment services
good,Lots of opportunity to grow into leadership roles with all of the different departments and business units.  80/20 is a great concept that they preach throughout the entire company.
good,I love my position when I am left alone. Over all the job is easy and laid back. The management team makes it hard with the favoritism and the behind the senses conversations.
good,"Great if you're in the industry already with the skills needed. Don't bother if you're a temp / new hire who has soft skin and doesn't know what you're doing already; the management is in disarray and constantly changing and will pay little attention to completing you're actual training. they assign a trainer and usually do not follow up on your progression. hostile work environment, everyone there plays the blame game. will hire temps, string you along and promise permanent employment just to can you when your temp period is up."
good,Always have stuff to do throughout the day. Management is is always willing to talk to you if you have a problem.  I have learned many new jobs since I’ve been here. Most people are very down to earth and easy to get along with. They’re also very helpful.
good,I loved this job I started Supervision after my first year there. I was sent to classes to help become the best I could be at my job. I treated everyone fairly and never had an employee that said I mistreated them.
good,"The people that you work with for the most part are great.  I worked in operations and when revenue goes down, their resort is to run with a leaner headcount so people are wearing multiple hats."
good,"I loved working at this company punching holes in one end of shipping tubes for computer components. And, working with a variety of people helping train new hires on the proper and safe way to run a punch press and a plastic extrusion machine."

good,It was my first job and I had fun and learned new things on this job. I would have stayed longer but I was under a temp service and when I wasn't hired fully when told I was I had to leave and move because of personal reasons. But I would have stayed on longer. Good pay and good hours aswell as good team work.
good,It kept my mind engaged and allowed me the freedom to continuously be challenged while keeping production.  I Enjoyed working for ITW.  There was never a dull moment.
good,"Each business division is allowed to operate like it's own company with very little input from corporate. This allows for business to flow a lot more efficiently, cut down on red tape, and makes you feel like you own your own business."
good,"They treat you fair. Had great reliable hours and pay, Management is good as long as you are willing to work with them. My co workers were very friendly and helpful."

good,"The job was not hard at all, I overall liked it. It was very flexible for the time that I needed for child care at that time. I would go back and work for this company."
good,"Corporate has high expectations of each division, but provides tools and flexibility for the leadership teams to develop strategies that are appropriate for each business"
good,"It was just a temp job when I was younger, still living with my parents. I enjoyed the environment and the management was down to earth. Everyone had their own work station, but could still talk to others."
good,"If you want to have opportunities to advance your career, then ITW is the place to do it. The company encourages employees to wear many hats, which leads to more job duties. If you ask to be involved with a project to gain more experience in a certain area, they will do what they can to accommodate."
good,"ITW Tomco was a small company.  It had a friendly, family atmosphere.  I liked that it was fast paced a no two days were ever the same.  For the most part hourly and salary employees worked well together to get finished product out the door.  That was everyones main objective."

good,Decentralized business units enable individual businesses the opportunity to control their own destiny.
good,"Coworkers are the greatest. Opportunities to advance as long as you were open to learning. Very pushy management at times. Was a super great to begin with. After some time they acted as though they could care less about employees as long as the production was made. Cost cutting measures were a little too extensive and other pet initiatives made it difficult to work in an ever changing environment."

ITW (the umbrella company) does a great job in offering assistance, benefits, wellness promoting, etc. I loved my team and I loved the type of work I did, just not the division between departments."
good,"Everything you would expect of a machine shop working conditions. Job offered continuous learning from senior personnel but lacked any formal learning.

The work force for the most part is full of great people, willing to help and offer suggestions of improvement."

In order to meet sales goals it was impossible to work less than 10 hrs a day. Some days I would put over 100 miles in driving to meet with prospective clients. It was difficult, but also had many rewards. The autonomy to work without micromanagement was wonderful. They allowed me to do all that I could, and constantly offered praise for my accomplishments.

good,The job could be stressful at times but I feel as long as I did everything possible to make sure all was good I did not have much to worry about. The lack of communication is one of the worse things trying to deal with when you don't see someone for a few day and they don't tell you everything that happened while you where on your off days it can be frustrating and becomes stressful.

Training is there if you ask and push for it, could be better. People there can be toxic and I blame supervision for that but I feel some changes will be made and this is something that can be ignored if you keep to yourself.  There is forced overtime often for production.  9 to 10 hour days and Saturdays as needed and rarely a Sunday but if worked Sunday you get paid double time.

I learned how a professional environment is conducted and increased my teamwork skills while working with my group. Each employee new what jobs they had to get done and finished by their deadline, and this was mainly due to excellent managers and their ability to be  maintain organization. The work environment was pretty laid back, and people would joke around with each other. If someone, including me, had a problem they would be willing to ask any other employee for help.

To move ahead, though, Corporate headquarters is not the place.  Very little room for growth and promotion.  An old company, still stuck in some old ways, but that is improving.  If you want to move quickly up the ladder, start at one of the ITW-owned businesses and work up.  If you want a really good job in a stable environment, but don't care about making VP some day, take a job at Corporate.  I've met some of the sharpest and pleasant people I know here.
