rating,review
bad,Centene Corp bought Health Net Inc and the culture has deteriorated ever since. Management is narrowly focused on specific company goals to the detriment of staff. Management is difficult and inept
bad,My job was temporary my assignment end. This was not a good site work because they don't take consideration your work. I will not recommend this job to any one trying grow.
bad,"Company management's decisions are based on what will create the most financial impact. They need to focus on employee morale and retention, high turnover in most departments."
bad,"Needing room to grow, better management and less relocating... they shut down more than one clinic and it was by surprise.. I dodnt Have the great experience at this company"
bad,It was not a fun workplace the supervisor was rude her language when speaking to me and would not explain what was needed for the job.  I was left with the feeling that the job was not for me and I had no interest in working for them.  I had obtained the position through an agency and they also did noting to resolve any questions I had as working.
bad,"This place is the worst place I have worked, you will hate it too. The training is a joke, they use intimidation tactics to scare you into thinking this place is a professional and  they hire anybody, I have an extensive background in the healthcare field, but don't worry you wont need it. I feel sorry for their members they are given the run around told yes but really its a NO and on a daily they are given incorrect info by the agents. The management is so terrible and no one communicates anything, nothing works, software unreliable , QA"
bad,No body knows what they're doing.  Promotions are not due to merit but who you know or related to.  Management does not observe the rules they themselves require of their employees.
bad,Very poor management which made very stressful work conditions. The lack of pay and the attendance policy is almost unbearable if you have a family they do not allow hardly any emergencies
bad,"Company sucks pay was terrible, MANAGEMENT was incapable of MANAGEMENT. Employer never connected or cared about employees. No job security, company was just concerned about the bottom line."
bad,"Was hired on as a temp with a training class of 40 people. We were told after about 3 months whoever past the 8 week training & was in good standing would be offered a permanent position along with a raise & benefits. That never happened. There is about 10 of us left (out of 40) & we have almost 7 months in & no offer or even talk of making us permanent. There is also NO help from managment in regards 2 claims, complaints,etc. They will leave people on hold that asks for a supervisor until they give up & hang up. The claims system is a joke & there is no tracking that works. Very strict on attendence 3 points & your out. Everyday the systems have problems. Some of us are working with half the systems we need."
bad,health net used to be a great place to work. until centene took over. they put ppl in management that are terrible .I've been with HN for 5 years. work days are stressful. supervisors positions were given to ppl who are terrible. do not recommend
bad,"I was a contract worker for what was supposed to be at least a four month assignment, but barely lasted only three months, and less than forty hours per week on average, through an agency who shall remain unnamed.  My department supervisor belligerently practiced age discrimination by giving projects to those contract workers younger than the four of us, and basically told us, indirectly, that we're stupid by using the statement ""that's too challenging for you"".  To my understanding, they have retained those younger workers and only let the older ones go.  Really?  I thought age discrimination was illegal.  Apparently not so!  I will never work for this company ever again, even if they paid fifty dollars per hour.  Also, requiring your badge to leave the building for breaks, lunch or for the day was absurdly ridiculous.  Good riddance!"
bad,"CENTENE is the real owner of this company and they are brutal with employees, the bottom line is the profits they make. They don't care about you as a member or as an employee."
bad,This company was very stressful but at the end of the day my job was to service the veteran and to make sure they were taken care of and to make sure they have a appointment as soon as possible.
bad,The manager that I was assigned to was not informative and did not make any effort to properly train persons for the job that was to be performed. Had rude attitude and was verbally abusive.
bad,Cluster _____ of redundant work and errors. Poorly run company with inept management and non-existent upper management. The location is awful but they will be moving to Natomas soon.
bad,Horrible ! Don’t apply! This is the last place you want to apply. Don’t waste your time please trust me. Crabs in a barrell for $15 an hour.  Horrible horrible
bad,"The worst most incompetent management and coworkers. This place is full of the good old boys club. They have brought this company, and the company that bought them, to ruins."
bad,"I cannot say that I would recommend this place to anyone looking for work, The workplace environment was thee absolute worst to deal with. The management team was very rude, disrespectful and went out their way to treat the employees like children rather than adults."
bad,The work is good but management is not very good or encouraging. Employer is not forth coming with information that needs to be known to do job. Management doesn't give heads up with your job performance.
bad,Didn't feel that it was a fair place to work. Management was selfish and played favorites. Worst place that I have ever worked. Run don't walk away if offered.
bad,it is horrible and very unorganized  need better staff manage meant or better hiring management. its a stressful environment no help when you need it or have questions you have to figure it out on your own
bad,"awful awful awful company happy to hear they were bought out  this place is the worst company every. hopfully management has changed "
bad,"Hired through Kelly Services. I was treated horribly. Management was horrible. The culture was nonexistent we were stuffed like sardines in a tiny room with almost 100 people. The hardest part was mandatory overtime 12hrs per day and forced to do OT on weekends more that 12hr OT per week.  The only thing that was enjoyable about that job is the fact that I had a job. If you were a temp pt. the permanent staff was very unkind. They told you it was a temp to hire position however, many staff were there over 4yr without becoming permanent. There was not communication at all. Very little training and very little to no management interaction."
bad,"They don't pay well ,  I would be more motivated to come to work if they paid well for all the rediculous workload they expect out of you , they don't offer flexible hours you'll be stuck there all day m-f so if you're ok with that go for it for me it's not worth the long drive and hard work for that ,,, plus low pay I thought retail was bad , but this is worse , maybe It's a good job for the beginner tech who has no retail experience and who are excited enough And happy with low pay ,  the environment is very depressing for some people who enjoy the sitting all day then it's a good fit for you , you  sit all day you in the depressing cube you'll def get fat and have back and wrist problems in no time.good luck."
bad,"They prefer speed and number of appointments over the quality of care for veterans.  The push the issue about making a certain number of appointments per day; therefore, the appointment setters are appointing the easy appointments, such as eye appointments or dental appointments, rather than the appointments that take weeks to appoint, such as veterans that need a doctor's appointment for cancer, etc.  "
bad,"A highly stressful place to work, and non promotional, too many mandated requests to work overtime. I did not enjoy this job at all."
bad,The company is unorganized. I understand that everyone need a job but they hire anyone. No skills nor qualifications. Its not about work ethic there its about who you know
bad,"With the slightest downturn in the economy Health Net tucked-tail and ran like cowards back to the west coast leaving a thousand career-oriented people without jobs. Moreover, they contrived ways to eliminate senior staff before officially closing so that they would not have to pay severance. Despicable."
bad,I you would prefer to work for a company like this then go for it. Hours very but the pay is somewhat descent.  The dress code is strictly enforced depending on the person.
bad,"Simply put, Health Net, now Cognizent, has little interest in it's employees. On a daily basis you see punishment rather than support, even if goals are met or exceeded. I have witnessed and been part of manager meetings where employees are berated because they are doing too well. Example: An employee has a 99% accuracy rate and 0 absences. Instead of praising her during her year end review they instead found it suspicious and didn't give her a raise. "
bad,"The company was and is poorly managed, failing to take advantage of vast east coast opportunity and at the first sign of trouble with the national economy they tucked-tail and ran back to the west coast putting 1,300 people out of work, but not before they vetted highest paid staff and fabricated reasons to terminate and not pay severance."
bad,Working here bring on many emotions from knowing you can be the one to save a Veterans life. Room to grow within the company and awesome work schedule M-F and 8-4:30.
bad,Worked for the company over 15 years ago and it's funny to read the current employees reviews and know that the company still sucks.  If the potlucks is why you want to work here then you are not ambitious and  have no work experience in the real world. The management at all levels is unprofessional!!! Good luck and get ready to be miserable👍
bad,I learned a lot in regards to claim processing coding and provider relations. My co-workers had low morale which caused poor production/ processing member inquiries and claims.
bad,Pay is too low.....do not apply!  No vacation time must be temp for 6 months and found the job to lack in any financial or professional gain. Better off working for waste management.
bad,"I was very excited when I first got hired, then it all spiraled down. Unfortunately this company has unrealistic goals. The work load they assign to one person is too much. Always short staffed, Employees in various departments are over worked and under paid."
bad,"Company was a diverse employer, had high standards, kept their employees informed of community, national, and company news.  Management was knowledgeable and always willing to mentor their employees.  Overall the company was a great place to work!"
bad,"The company has the potential to be a great place to be a part of. The company climate has grown stagnant with associates who have been there for many years with no team building training. Some associates have so much on their daily task to achieve while others have very little. Individuals are often working overtime without pay just to complete the work load they have. This is not a team oriented company, but could be with some much needed team building from top down."
bad,"A typical work day at Health Net, Inc./MHN was making myself available to receive Providers and patients call and to manage crisis situations."
bad,working at Health Net was a on the go duty I picked up work from the other building and I had to document all the checks received from the small business groups. I learned how to train others on how to use the spreadsheet on the computer. I liked over all working with my department we worked like a team. The hardest part of the job was meeting our quota for the month to receive our yearly bonus. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping small and large businesses with getting the correct health insurance for their companies.
bad,"I had hope to find a home here with growth but It was NOT for me! I hated going there everyday. Location sucks, traffic sucks, took me at least 1.5 hours to drive home to the east-bay everyday. No cafeteria and very few lunch options. Company is pretty cheap, was still using lotus notes for God's sake. Old tech, Old equipment. Morale was low and all the employees are like crabs in a bucket. I did like my manager, but that's about all. Won't take another job in the medical arena again! Petty, Clique culture, Uncertain about future of the company."
bad,Not a good place to work unless you're one of the favorites and likes to suck up to management. HR needs to clean house with management. Management frequently make racist omments like a monkey can do your job.
bad,"This company was very high paced, stressful,  a lot of times I had to worker all day and night. There were no benefits, the manager was disrespectful, and mean. I didn't like there so, I left."
bad,"The job was not horrible it was just management. I was hired on by a temp agency by the name of Able Force. Not only was a selected, by Health Net, to do the companies claims I was also selected to train as well as doing audits which I thought was a privilege. I looked at this as an opportunity to move up within the company unfortunately management has other plans. No job security."
bad,"Health Net was taken over by Centene.  The environment at Health Net was pretty good, but the corporate attitudes once taken over by Centene deteriorated rapidly to create an intolerable work environment."
bad,The work load and directives changed so often. Sometimes 2 and 3 times a day. The management was terrible. Management did what they want. Come and go as they pleased and did mass firing of employees regularly. Employee dedication was overlooked. Family emergencies are not acknowledged so if you have kids do not think about working here. They have a 2 strike and your out rule and anything is a strike. DO NOT WORK HERE
bad,"You will work more than 12 hrs a day. Be prepared to put up with political issues at the job site. Constant racial tension between supervisors and workers. There is definite favorites as evidenced by allowing co-workers time off, leaving early, etc. It was the worst job, constant struggles."
bad,I worked at health net for 3 years. At first it was a great place to work tell... They outsourced all the Documents and call center out. It was impossible to get any help within the company to help Costumers. Also the Management was just BAD they treated employs like little baby's. They never considered employs idea's to help and save the company time and money. They did everything backwards. The hardest part of the job was actually helping Costumers because Outsourced where poorly trained!!! They could never give you a straight answer..before it was outsourced a employ could simply go down stairs or the other building to find the answer.
bad,"Management was very poor. Very un-influential, non-motivating, poor communication, and company overall was very strict. Was trained for about a day and was left on my own to figure things out as I was currently replacing someone on maternity leave. Company was very strict on times in/out of the office, having your badge visible, and communicating with other coworkers, even if it was work related."
bad,"Very poor training and management. Lack of training resources for employees makes the job stressful and complicated. So when employee asked for help from Leads and supervisors often, they do not get the help they asked for and Leads would help with a bad attitudes."
bad,Processes do not help the Veteran get medical care because the staff making appointments are not educated enough to do this job.  They are ridiculous and veterans choice program will not succeed under their current level of managment
bad,"The people employed have been there for 10 years or longer and are in solid cliques like High School and behave in that manner. This is an insurance job dominated with old women. It is the most cut-throat environment full of people that are extremely unhappy and very dysfunctional. Management encourage cliques and immature cut-throat behavior, because they're like that, too. The long and short of it...they make a ton of money and are very bored and dysfunctional people. They also make you go through a ton of hoops and do a temp agency. Most of these people worked at another company previously in Dallas with a bad reputation, so it's not a wonder that they all migrated together to this company. They have too much time in between insurance calls and either gossip or watch movies on their cell phones. They are the most unhappy, dysfunctional group of bored people with too much time and money that I've ever met. People that work there all have mirrors on their desks, not because they want to make sure they don't have food in their teeth or makeup on....they're paranoid and constantly have to watch what they say and who they talk to. It's insane. Good luck!"
bad,Fun place to work if it wasn't for Middle Management. They have no college degrees just get jobs through their buddies.They tend to hire only their friends and discrimination and harassment is an every day occurrence to get you to quit to bring in their buddies.
bad,"so at first when you are hired you have the help you need. however when you are on the floor they get upset at you for asking for help, they get very cocky depending on what supervisor you have not calling out names. providers are always ignorant. I'm telling you it may have wonderful pay but your working your tail off with no hope of advancement opportunity and no future."
bad,"thankful for the line of business learned and eligible , claims , pre authorization, EOB's  , RA's , making medical group and physician changes, typical day receive and make decisions"
bad,No opportunity for advancement. Management allows for inappropriate behavior by supervisors including discrimination. Would not recommend. High turn around rate.
bad,Taught me a lot about time management and how to deal with multiple people in a closed office space froml all different cultural backgrounds. Management could be a little better with communication and more timing with actual training rather than sending emails on updates.
bad,"The pay is good, but that is the only good thing about working here. Just the worst possible management at every level. They will take advantage of you in every possible way unless you fight back."
bad,"This place is not  where anyone wants to work. If you have a family you can forget about spending time with them. The supervisor does nothing and lies to your agency if you are a temp. The training barely trains you, mandatory over time and youre punished for being 1 minute late even if you are at your cube in your seat on time. Systems are always down and the callers are always pushed aside so your calls are hardly ever pleasant."
bad,A lot of the supervisors micromanage everyone and they company complains about everything ...OMG!!!!!!! I'm currently just unhappy and I currently been unhappy
bad,"God forbid you have bad credit, you'll be allowed in the door and could get canned at any moment.  "
bad,"Vets not put 1st, metrics/numbers game.  Does not focus on retaining quality employees much less helping them advance in the company."
bad,"Great place to work, good co-workers and team, rewarding work, many interesting clients."
bad,"Most learn form their mistakes, some repeat them over and over"
bad,"A typical day at work was co-worker harassment. You have Napoleon types running around trying to make daily work miserable just for their own sport and advancement. Management doesn't do anything about it."
bad,"I was there as a contractor for a couple of weeks. As an Access Administrator, you got one round of training at high speed. Then after that it was provisioning accounts at a break-neck speed. I do not wish these conditions upon anyone."
bad,Very stressful. Some Managers are master delegators and tyrants. I would not personally recommend a friend or a loved one a job at HealthNet. But to each his own.
bad,The employees and management were easy to work for.  Training is extensive and trainers are very thorough. Not sure if policies and procedures have changed.
bad,not stable always lay offs don't bother. lack of communication . there is not enough govt. funding to keep employees thats why the entire call center is temps... only a few permanent employees
bad,"I thought this company would be a good place to work, boy was I wrong! I really wish I had listened to my gut instincts and other reviews here on Indeed before I accepted this position. Working here was one of the worst experiences in my life. The work is hard, boring and not at all rewarding. Seriously, this job is very difficult and they are strict about everything you do! The people here are not very nice and can be rude and nasty if you have a question or need help, especially the the leads and supervisors. I heard this company was bought out by another company, so I hope they go out of business. That is what they deserve because this company is terrible."
bad,I rather not say at this time. I'm currently an employee at this company. I do not feel comfortable discussing any issues with the company at this time.
bad,"Great Leadership of company from the VP's on up to the Chairman of the Board, most of whom I met several times. Lower level management is sub-par and there is no room for advancement. Directors and managers bring in friends to fill positions, rather than promote from within. Constant overtime is expected and your job depends on it. Compensation is average for most positions, but you will be stuck at the position for what you are hired. Layoffs are frequent and done by dismissing 1 or 2 employees at a time throughout the year, to avoid announcing ""layoffs."" Top level leadership of company is wonderful and the company has great core values, unfortunately it has hired the wrong people over the years to pursue them further."
bad,I invested decades with this company but was treated so poorly I’m now kicking myself over what I tolerated. Yes they promote from within but only if you’re in the inner circle or hand picked. Technology is far behind and now I’m playing catch up
bad,Company has been acquired by Centene and they are restructuring. They have been laying off employees over the past year as they are combining the corporate offices with St. Louis.
bad,"no much really to say. some of the employees are great. its just the manager that treat you low if you are not management."
bad,I worked for health net over 5 years during my employment i always felt un appreciated by management. management always play favorites card in particular to females.
bad,Very poor training and disorganized management. Very stressful. Management not concerned with employees grievances. Department was known for having people out on leave of absence on a regular basis. Office culture is horrible.
bad,Fast paced and never dull. Reviewing of all changes and repsonding to emails and phone calls. We have a great team and we all work together.
bad,"very slow culture, management not interested in developing people"
bad,Health Net was the contractor for Tricare North region for the military. They lost their bid for the contract in 2016  and all of us were let go.I liked the job.
bad,"A typical day at Health Net very busy, work was consistent because each staff  was assigned monthly goals. I learned how to navigate computers and the importance of working for veterans."
bad,This establishment is functioning off of it’s relationship with Medical recipients. It’s highly stressful and full of lots of unwanted pressures. The upside are the pay and benefits.
bad,Honestly didn't like my experience here. Things were all out of whack and departments were not up to date with each other on work instructions  and that would cause problems for the employees.
bad,"Not a good experience at this company."
bad,6 days a week for 10 hrs a day as a temp. no advancement to become perm.  Learned a lot about VA claims and how this company does business. Learned some better ways of keeping notes for changes that were always occurring.
bad,Corporates are not friends. More like foes. Constantly on employees for everything. No room to grow as a contract employer. They get rid you as as quick as they hire. Atmosphere vibe isn't great! Production production production. They work you as an animal not as a human. Your co workers are not friends more like a competition to get a perm position. 12 temps for 1 perm position. Goodluck
bad,Company slowly going down the drain. Employers does no care about the veteran only metrics and quotas. The worst company ever and wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy.
bad,Overworked and under payed. Used to be a good company but a cominbation of awful IT and bad management have made this company a nightmare to work for.
bad,Management and staff lacked understanding of process as company restructured responsibility in time of transition. Plagued with technology and equipment support issues.
bad,"Internal training is limited to introductory training and non-transferable skills. There are no advanced training courses. This is a for-profit insurance company, not a healthcare provider. The company focus is strictly limited to increasing the income of the Executive Branch (President/CEO and Board of Directors) while continuously increasing the workloads of the employees. There is relatively low career value for employees."
bad,"although I enjoyed working with the veterans, the company had a conflicting ethic of veterans first but make this many appointments not taking in the specialty you might get from the que."
bad,"Initially working wasn't too bad, the money was good and a lot of people were nice, but the longer I was there and the more the company changed, the more frustrated and annoyed I became with the job. I was brought on as a temp, so I had no benefits, no accrued sick or vacation time, nothing...but a check. Often, there were times that I was given a day or two notice that I would have to work a completely different shift and I would have to make adjustments, if I wanted to keep my job. The shifts that I was given, was never a daytime shift, it was always later than my normal schedule."
bad,Unless you were referred to work here by someone who knows and likes the right people you will not be advancing despite what you know
bad,"I have worked at Federal Health Net Services for 8 months. In that time there have been many many changes and at times it was hard to keep up and to remember the current way to process our phone calls. I have learned that there are many veterans not getting timely care and we are there trying to resolve that issue. While I don't always agree with the management, I have not been there that long to judge. I am glad to say that I have very nice co-workers. The hardest part of my job is to listen to veteran pleading to get them an appointment because they have been waiting a long time to see the doctor and the most enjoyable part would be when they are happy that we have called them with an appointment"
bad,I was disappointed with this company. The management wasn't supportive and didn't have great morals and work ethics. There was a lot of insubordination that wasn't addressed.
bad,"Great job experience. Fast paced, able to learn new job responsibilities. Lots of advancement. Pot lucks are always a nice touch. Being punctual is important at this call center."
bad,"Management is awful. None of them are on the same page. There is no communication with staff. Advancement is completely based on popularity. If your in the clique the world is at your fingertips. If your not part of that clique, you better have thick skin to make it thru the snide comments, rude looks, and overall mean girl attitudes."
bad,"Very poor training in how to actually do your job, senior staff (leads) are easily frustrated when asked questions,  some questions  aren't even answered.  Training dept and dept managers do not plan training together so u have trainers who don't do your job and management doesn't even want to answer their questions when they can't provide an answer during training. "
bad,My typical work day can be productive if the proper resources are available.  I've learned that even if you push your self and show that you go far and beyond it might not benefit you.  It depends on who you know to get moved up.
bad,"It was a job that paid pretty decently. The schedule was alright, no crazy hours. Management was poor, they really had no idea what was going on most of the time."
bad,"Management allows promotions and growth by 'who you know' and not by skills."
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,We were forced to work 10 hour days 6 days a week for months at a time. Management would have regular meetings about us getting coffee on the clock as we killed ourselves to meet their deadlines. It was an terrible working environment with no work/life balance.
bad,Not much to say as this company has merged with another company so many of us were laid off and our payout was not as Health Net had stated.  While that is going on there are several members of management and long term employees with vast knowledge of the product were cut lose and sent to the unemployment line.
bad,"Your work day is 10 hours long, if your a temp don't bother calling out or having a family. If you love to be threated left and right this is your place. Managers play favorites, if you miss high school drama this is your place. The hardest part of the job minding your own and lack of training. The pay is good when you start but then you soon realize that you rather be with your family. I would not recommend working for the federal divison its a mess."
bad,"Health Net was a great company, until bought out by Centene/Envolve. Terrible company. They do not care about their employees health and mental stability. They have one person do the jobs of three & do not compensate you for the additional responsibilities given to you. You can come in one day & your whole position & job description changed overnight. My own department has lost many hard working, smart, and valuable associates since the merger."
bad,"its only for those who can go out there and schedule appts all day The mangers and leads stare at you all day and constantly ask ""how many appts we at? one by one to each agent"" you feel good you're helping out the Veterans but at the same time they constantly throw out metrics and offer little pay and poor benefits"
bad,New company culture ignores life balance needs of the employees.  There are no opportunities for career advancement.  More communication between management and employees is needed by the company.
bad,"Very strict policies.  All managers do their own thing, not all on the same page. The hardest part was the research..  Employees had to find their way through procedures. no help support."
bad,This specific department is understaffed with tons of work. Thus employees have to work long hours everyday plus mandatory Saturdays.. the least hours worked per day is 12 hours and some work until midnight. There is no balance between personal life and work. They should hire more employees with the volume of work received or create a system that would simplify the work process.
bad,"I learned that I can handle multiple calls, navigate multiple applications, document important details and provide excellent pharmacy help desk solutions to medical providers, all at the same time."
bad,"Dealing with medi-cal members can be difficult, and if you do not have any education beyond high school, this may be a great job.  However, if you have any higher level of education, this job can be demeaning.  Customers and providers are upset with you all day, over situations you have no part in.  You get used to the attitudes and accusations, but my daily thoughts are ""I do not get paid enough for this"" and ""Why am I here when I have a Bachelor's?"".  I am grateful that I have a job, and I have some amazing co-workers, but after less than a year, I am fed up and ready to move on to the next step.  Management does not do very well with updating employees with new policies/procedures and are quick to show you where you went wrong in situations, neglecting to recognize what you did right.  Very frustrating."
bad,"Healthnet gets rid of their temps for the stupidest reasons. i was let go my 8th week because they accused me of cheating on their assessments, when i passed every single one of them. Another girl was let go because she was a distraction in her training class . This place is a complete joke."
bad,Great place for permanent works. Temps not so much. Training is different for everybody leads tell different answers.
bad,"come in check faxes that came in for my assigned accounts processed them and scanned them in, prepared daily reports for invoices to be printed at the end of the day.  I then helped process daily issues with clients.  The coworkers were all good people most were pretty knowledgeable about the different systems and issues that we dealt with daily.  The managers were also knowledgeable but past that weren't really good with dealing with their subordinates."
bad,"Inbound call center  for medical insures company "
bad,Atmosphere is stressful. Employees are over loaded with work due to outsourcing. Management rules by keeping direct reports in fear of loosing their job. Benefits are expensive with no choice of medical groups or pharmacies.
bad,"The department that I worked in was fine it was when Centene Corp took over HealthNet, poor communication and they don't understand California workers, culture or work laws. They handled a federal contract loss poorly with very minimal communication with the workers or management of the departments that were affected. They also promised a bonus but did not provide it."
bad,"Best thing is that Health Net pays great! Working hard is not ever a problem, when it is appreciated. It is not appreciated here. Upper managements favorite line to Sups with overworked and stressed teams is ""well then maybe this is not the place for them! Coach them out.""  Upper management wants yes men and has no compassion or respect for the time their team puts in. This company used to be a compassionate company that was trusted by providers. This is no longer the case. It is sad to see that poor upper management has completely trashed the culture of this company."
bad,This job was stressful. We had to schedule a certain number of appointments daily which was not able to be done  because many providers contacted did not want to work with them.
bad,"Great coworkers, amazing people to share a work space with. But systems never work and theres always payroll issues. They do nothing anymore to boost employee morale, hardly any reps because the job is so stressful that everyone is on medical leave for stress. "
bad,You come to work you will have a paycheck and more than likely catch a potluck. The metric the company uses to gauge whether your a good employee or not is not that fair.
bad,"Health Net was purchased by Centene, who immediately began eliminating jobs. The employees are nice but management is clueless and favoritism is rampant. Unless you are a ""chosen one"" you will NOT keep your job for any length of time."
bad,Health was a family oriented company.  It was bought out by Centene and the whole company changed.  There is no flexability at all.  The managers are no caring people who only look at there associates as machines. Management does not care about people with families.
bad,Early shifts with about 200 calls on a daily basis management is pretty lazy coworkers are chill independent working not too much to be supervised must have reliable transportation
bad,"Very limited training to do your job with constant changes in work processes without any explanation. Manager would tell you to just ask her if you had questions but if you did she would tell you to ask someone else on the team because she was busy or tell you to look it up in the P & P online. "
bad,"Work and life balance is very difficult, extensive mandatory OT with no regards to employee health and or family obligations. Not a good place to work for a single parent with a small child."
bad,taking phone calls. work is usually Monday through Friday. taking back to back calls and helping people with there health insurance problems. we are only an inbound call center.
bad,Management isn't the easiest to work with and ive had to deal with both verbal and physical harassment and nothing was ever done. Ive learned a lot though and met some great people
bad,I am currently employed.  But no guarantee for the future.  The company is being phased out by another company.  No future.
bad,I worked there 3 years and was treated like a piece of furniture like the empty cubicles my Department Manager Created. All of the people with FMLA issues were assigned to the general que of HNFS Enrollment and systemically let go due to crazy production goals that excluded 35% of the work.
bad,Okay place to work - pay was okay; training was good.  Wanted to much work for the pay. Other employees were not very friendly. Management was not very organized.
bad,too many hours - low pay - told us we were getting laid off but hire 25 more temps - unsure of job security - barely keep us in the know of what was happening with the layoffs - expected us to work overtime before and after regular hours as well as weekend
bad,If you weren't a favorite then you were ignored. moving up wasn't easy. management played favorite. Never once heard from the CEO. I have no idea who he is.
bad,I would not recommend to work here. The environment is not friendly . The company does not care about you at all. I had a very bad experience with working here
bad,"Majority of the hardest working people there are the least appreciated. Depending on the department you're in, the environment can be hostile. Management doesn't seem to listen to the people who report to them, who are full of great ideas of how to improve the overall environment and processes."
bad,"Overlooked, Not properly compensated for workload. Continued to grow within the company but overall culture was discouraging. found myself constantly looking for ways out. felt like i wasnt valued."
bad,Learned a lot about many different aspects of Operations. Had opportunities to work in different areas of the company.  Was given authority to make decisions.
bad,When they found out I had epilepsy they laid me off. No ethics. They would have to pay me a massive amount to return.  I was reporting to a member of executive leadership so I must conclude that such ethical flaws exist across the leadership team.
bad,Everyone is replaceable. Lack of communication between management and representatives. New job duties are given with very little training and no support afterwards.
bad,"After Health Net was bought out and our long-time management team fired, the environment became exceedingly toxic. Morale took a dive and employees started jumping ship or being let go to the point that nobody was comfortable that their jobs were secure."
bad,This company has good benefits and the associates are good to wok with. The hardest part of your job is giving your best and see that it's not recognized or appreciated. The most enjoyable parts are the benefits & paid time off.
bad,Changes to systems are made and implemented without fully testing those systems and with no training and little management direction.  It is back to back calls with no possibility to specialize to utilize a unique skill set.  There is no show of appreciation and other than my immediate supervisor who is wonderful....the rest of the management staff is unsupportive and very invisible.
bad,"Health educator for 3 years, it was fun to go to the senior centers and provide health education, exercise and hand out incentives on a monthly basis.  The contract ended so I lost my job."
bad,Not a lot of room for advancement. It's all about who you know and not based off your hard work. Leadership is childish and instead of leading they do alot of petty things to the rep's. Most supervisors and leads are not experienced enough to lead.
bad,"Before the merger with Centene Health Net cared about the Veteran."
bad,"Do not get noticed here. I am not kidding. You can quickly climb the totem pole and become a 'shining star' but don't be surprised when they quickly kick you off once they find someone ""better"" who won't necessarily be better at their job but rather in better cahoots with upper management than you."
bad,"You can make great money but you will work your butt off for it! Be ready to work weekends, nights, holidays and 12 hour shifts! They do offer plenty of ot"
bad,works employees too hard and pushes mandatory overtime.  pay is decent but there is no growth to employee; forces employees to work mandatory overtime but does not support their employees
bad,"I worked here a really long time ago."
bad,"Working a health net can often times be stressful because"
bad,"The people I worked with were excellent, but management showed favoritism.  I was there for almost 8 years and didn't advance much due to poor management.  They play favorites and you get promoted if you're someone they like."
bad,"When it was health net, it was a pretty good company to work for. You felt like you were working as a team. Ever since centene took ownership it has fallen apart. They make it sure you get fired if they dont personally like you. You dont get paid near what other companies get paid for the same position. They give you sick days separate from your pto but it still counts against you. If you miss 3 days in a small time period you get written up. They charge the employee a ridiculous amount of money for health coverage from their own company. I have almost $200 per check taken out just for myself and one child. The communication within the company suckz. You never know what's happening. You dont know when policies change but then get in trouble if you dont follow the new policy(keep in kind you dont know the policy even changed). They let management be in cliques and treat people however. The PTO accrual is so low,especially for parents."
bad,"Clickish, immature workers coaxed by inexperienced management and very lacking Human Resources. Decent pay but no advancement instituted internally and a lot of oversight on individual potential by management."
bad,Training is not so bad but it can be alot of overloaded information I felt like I was in college again. I like the work environment and some of the co-workers. However the leads and supervisors needs to have a retraining or revaluation on themselves and needs to work on their communications skills it's unprofessional how the talk to peoples some of then can be sarcastic and condescending. My experience there was ok but no all  that great. Postive side to it was that your helping peoples on the daily basis. Negative side was you have to alot of multitasking all the time everyday and too much job responsibilities for an average pay rate.
bad,This was a good place to have an initial career.  It was not a place I felt that had tremendous career advancement.  It's been over 10 years since I have worked here but I know that that financial solvency has always been in question.  I am happy to see that they are still here and part of Covered CA.
bad,"A typical day at work would be to review associates' daily performance complying with the company policies and guidelines.  I learned everything about the Medical industry which was all new to me but I learned quick, became effective in my job and was appointed to train other co-workers."
bad,Infrastructure and development functions outsourced. Company is looking to expand outsourcing relationships.  These relationships make it extremely difficult to implement projects successfully and in a timely manner.
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 years. Ever since they got acquired by Centene, the work environment has gone downhill. I was paid well and the benefits are good, but it wasn't worth the stress. I left before it permanently affected my health."
bad,"I previously worked at Centene/Health Net for over a decade.  During this time, I had steady upward growth; however, this was due to error after error within the ranks of the company that caused new job opening or new titles to appear.  In a decade, I saw the same mistakes being made over and over again for the sake of the ""shareholder"" and saving a buck."
bad,"Health Net is a good place to work for. There have been many changes within the company. They offer a onsite gym, day care and a eatery which is nice to have."
bad,only good thing about healthnet is meeting new people and the weekly pay. the management is not good at communicating with agents. the agents help eahcother on the floor instead of getting help from supervisors.
bad,"A company that is skilled in navigating the shifts in the healthcare/insurance market. For the young and ambitious, that can be a good thing. Some departments are are not good at offering opportunities for training and changing career paths. Older employees are frequently forced into 'early retirement'."
bad,"A typical day is taking calls from Vets, provider's offices & the Dept of Vet's Affairs employees with most ending unresolved. I've learned a great deal of patience & humility. Management has it's ups & downs, I luckily have had great supervisors. Hardest part of the job is making the unrealistic metrics. Most enjoyable part is being apart of a company that is there to help the Vets get the health care services that they are needing."
bad,Workplace was unprofessional and very stressful and hostile environment. Most Supervisors had no prior supervisory experience. It was very stressful trying to meet the daily requirements. Computer systems were down weekly.
bad,"Centene bought Health Net and since the acquisition the place spiraled downhill. Many managers have left and they have replaced great managers with incompetent, antisocial, conniving managers. If you like working in a great environment don't apply here."
bad,"Work day based on production.  Frequent, short notice mandatory overtime.  Orientation and staff training and support are lacking.  Colleaguial support and the ability to work from home made this company reasonable to work for."
bad,"Management in the behavioral health department (federal services - TRICARE) is ill-equipped and fosters an environment of hostility and fear. The sole focus is cutting costs and 'productivity numbers' at the expense of services rendered the customer and staff satisfaction. My experience is that management is very reluctant to accept alternative views in leadership style and improving the program and department as a whole. The result: high management turnover, high levels of stress, absenteeism and incident reports to OE (office of employee assistance/relations) regarding management-involved personnel issues. I would not recommend the behavioral heath department (federal services - TRICARE) as a healthy, productive place to work."
bad,Good benefits and great people to work with. But no room to growth.
bad,"Until Centene purchased HealthNet and it went to HellNet. Terrible new management. Cuts in benefits, raises, and PTO. Based on cronyism and nepotism. Age discrimination rampant, try to push out Senior level staff to cut compensation."
bad,It was fun and everyone worked together and then Centene came in and things started to change for the worse. RN’s were leaving as were management. The new management was clueless and tried to micromanage. The writing was on the wall.
bad,"When the Co. was Health Net, it was great.  Everyone knew each other and we were a work family.  Then Health Net got bought out by Centene Corp. and the work culture really changed. Very strange now.  Not really a fun place to work anymore."
bad,"I have learned a lot about the call center environment from being at HealthNet. I love the people I have met there."
bad,"When I was there it seemed like chaos.   No one really had an idea of what was going on and there was very little communication between management and staff.  This could have been a great company, but it was severely mismanaged and therefore went down."
bad,Every day you have an opportunity to positively impact people's lives and well being.  An extreme amount of changes along with mismanagement and communication of these changes makes for a very difficult journey on a daily basis.
bad,It was extremely exhausting and a very stressful work environment.  There was 4 hours mandatory daily overtime from October to March due to open enrollment periods.
bad,"Short staffing and frequent staff overturn in certain departments; long hours, but paid overtime. "
bad,"Nice lounge, take calls, de-escalate calls, first call resolution. Some leads are not super helpful or nice. Will need to socialize a bit more to know people so they can help you."
bad,Fragmented management that is dispursed throughout a wide geographical area. Friendly management that is nice to their employees. Difficult workplace due to lack of orientation and weak training.
bad,Company was going through major change at the time. Transitioning to cognizant and then Centene. This made it very unstable at the time. Otherwise seemed like it would be a good place to work
bad,"Opportunity to help others helped with  applying for medicaid, registered new and existing patients to register to be seen by the Dr's and called patients to confim appointments."
bad,"a dry, stale place to work. I honestly didnt like working there, there wasnt any room for growth. I didn't like the culture, or the pay. Not a fun place."
bad,"I do think that Health Net would benefit from listening to its call center agents. The people taking the calls on the front line have the most valuable information, but they do tend to listen tot he people higher up who do not always understand what is actually going on, or how their decisions can impact them. However, this company does have a higher compensation than most, and provides great benefits."
bad,This company is very competitive and has no job security. They are contracted by the VA and could be losing their contract soon. Work hard a hope they keep you. All employees are hired as temp
bad,very flixible while I was in school. managers are very helpful and easy to work with. fun work place. discounts on products.
bad,I worked for Health Net for ten years right after leaving school. The Pay and benefits were excellent and I left there with a set of skills I will use for the rest of my life.  However the work/life balance was horrible
bad,"Co-workers were very helpful. Management was approachable, Learned to do authorizations for medical procedures."
bad,I have worked for health net for over 5 years & I love my management team but the pay is garbage and not worth it. Looking at other jobs that is higher pay
good,"The experience I had in the DUIP program was mixed. The place was full of gossip and favoritism. I am glad I am not there anymore.Overall, the managers seemed to feel they needed to make their coworkers miserable. They were ""The Team."" So the rest of us needed to keep in check, as they (the team) were always looking for something wrong and could never seem to look for what was right. The team members all had a different way of completing a task, so that created problems, Over a few years you would see how different each supervisor and lead would do things. Thus creating more confusion."
good,"Great pay, but very strict work environment.  Managers micro manage the teams, the environment is very quiet as not allowed to talk to co-workers. and you have to be punctual down to the second meaning there is no grace period."
good,Management doesn't care about their employees. They only see you as a number and do not offer the proper guidance and training. Advancement will only happen if you know someone at a higher level than you.
good,HealthNet provided a nice break room. The management had an open door policy if we did run into a problem.  The training well prepared me for my role on the floor.
good,I left many years ago.  All I can say is. there is a lot of politics in this work env. as well as the pay is super low compared to other companies. No
good,Expect to never have any time off.  Even when you have time accrued the managers will not approve your time off.  They ride you every day and all throughout your day to produce more and more.  Mandatory overtime of at least 12 hours per week and a lot of mandatory saturdays.  Promotions are not to the best qualified but to the people who work all the time and do the managers work for them.  Morale is very bad and people quit all the time.  High stress environment and they will fire you for too many sick days.  The only good thing I can say is you get paid pretty well at16.97 hour and there are benefits for health etc.
good,"Hours from 7 am to 4:30 very difficult infrastructure to work under. Only seasonal work thru a contractor."
good,Worked here right after high school. Watched so great kids only problem was their parents
good,Company okay to work. Culture family oriented. No much advancement or pay raises. Hardest part was low funding to help clients with longer services. Work load average.
good,Company had some major setbacks legally that caused for a large cut of jobs in the Oregon region.  Pharmacy was cut from the Oregon location and moved to California.
good,"Healthnet is a decent company but the pay is very low. The training is out dated. Technology also outdated."
good,"Performed statistical data analysis. Developed, calculated and analyzed rates and provider contract terms. Completed various ad-hoc modeling, querying and analysis for valuation data"
good,"Overall, my experience with Health Net was knowledgeable. This was my first real job in a company where every day i learned something new. In my department which is membership, we always have something new to do and learn. With healthcare, procedures and guidelines change all the time, so it was us as workers to keep up with those changes. The most enjoyable part to me working here was how this job helped me grow up and mature. When I started here I was only 19, now i feel like i have a good grip of knowledge on healthcare and I have a better head on my shoulders in order to be a better asset to any company I work for in the future"
good,"Our typical day at work is to answer the phone and talk to the veteran and help them with what they need. It is a cold and not very friendly place to work, very indifferent to employees needs and concerns. My co-workers for the most part are nice. The hardest part of this job is to try to learn what you need to know without much training. It is mostly computer based knowledge that you must keep up with on a daily basis and it always changes on a daily basis. The best part of the job is to hear some hope in a  veterans voice that they have a doctors appointment and that they will be receiving the proper care."
good,Had fun with many of  my coworkers and made the work environment a great thing.
good,A typical day is very busy and fast paced. I have learned financial skills and web-i report writing skills. Management is lacking. The hardest part of the job is the management and there is no advancement.
good,A typical day at work starts off with caring about the outcome. The outcome is to ensure the customer has a positive outcome.
good,Location was great....co workers wonderful..but lacked competent supervisor
good,"A very busy environment, where the only constant you can count on is change. This brings challenge and excitement to the job. However, communication is very poor, the systems in use are not user friendly and upper management does not have enough information regarding the day to day work that the staff does and without that knowledge , the level of change that is implemented and the shortage of staff makes it very difficult to get the job done. Employees have to find a workaround to get the job done and after a while that becomes the norm, which is not productive."
good,I loved my job and the work I did for veterans.  The culture needed more work due to low morale.  I was able to learn from my peers as it relates to experiences they had positive or negative based on their tenure with the company.
good,working at health net could be stressful at times it would be back to back and he worst part about it is there is not much advancement with in company
good,Customer services based and on the phone handle customer's insurance issues. Great job if you like being on the phones and can handle being talked to not in the most pleasant manner
good,nothing really to add about the company this was a temp job thru a temp agency. its a stepping stone type of job. the work is fast pace with a really low pay
good,They don't care about you or what you have going on outside of work. Managers talk to any kind of way. Not professional. You never know when it will be your last day of work. Due to they will tell you come to there office. Next thing you laid off. due to budget cut or for no reason. They don't give you the things you come to work with. they pick through your things in your desk. They don't let you know anything. They had bedbugs
good,I've been with the company for almost 29 years now.  I have been in a few different departments which I has let me grow and learn a lot within the company.  I enjoy the fact that I get to interact with so many other departments.  I really would like a change and would love to work closer to home.
good,Long days and too much work in order and it is extremely hard to keep up with the amount of cases that you are required to complete
good,"I advanced my skills with scheduling patients. The environment was productivity driven. I tried to offer suggestions on ways to improve our processes. Some of my ideas were taken into consideration, so I advanced by my third month working,"
good,Not happy with what I do. I would not recommend this company and most departments are being bought out by a different company. No job security for those that will be under the new company.
good,"I answered Members health,dental, & vision insurance questions, over the phone.  I enjoyed clarifying their benefits, & explaining how the plans worked."
good,Stressful but very educational. Learned a lot about the medical field.
good,"• Participated in providing superior customer service through phone support • Provided essential information in an in-bound call center environment. • Inventoried information taken from callers into respective databases, ensuring accuracy for future reference."
good,"I reviewed Medical Records.  Last year management was so stressed and pushed employee’s to the max.  The work place was arranged so that everyone was in constant fear of someone breathing down your back, not to see your short comings in order to to help you, but to sanction you"
good,The typical day consisted of processing checks for the employers that use HealthNet.  I spoke to many representatives from those companies every day.  I enjoyed learning the new software.
good,Enjoyed managing my team. It was challenging and taught me a lot. I would like to see having more support by my management. I think they have improved since I was there.
good,I have been laid off from Health Net due to total department restructuring.  All personnel from the manager down to the lowest echelon have been let go.
good,"This is a great job for highly-motivated people. The management can be really great to work with but there are a lot of slow periods which can mean lay-offs. During busy season, they barely train you so it can be overwhelming if you're not the kind of person who asks a lot of questions or knows the right questions to ask. And it can be especially difficult because everyone is very busy and won't be particularly inclined to deal with training a new person. "
good,"Allot of downsizing going on and you never know who is next in line to be cut.  You are given an assignment without management checking to be sure your systems are working to produce the quality work in a timely fashion.  If you do not ask any questions, you will not know whether to go left or right. The company is diverse but not many Black American in management positions."
good,Very fast paced and extremely stressful. Management needs to do a better job of listening to the concerns of their employees and find ways to reduce work stress without compromising the company mission.
good,"100 Travel, little to no over site from management."
good,"Not bad if you like being attached to a phone for 8 hours a day. It's hard to get paid time off approved, even when it's requested months in advance. New benefits were incorporated that aren't as good as you'd think they would be for a federal job. It is satisfying to give back to military members and their families, that is definitely the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Enjoyed my time with Heath Net, Inc., However it was bought out, I still remain loyal to the heath care industry. Physicians and patients need caring advocates who will to go to bat for them not matter the issue."
good,"Typical day at work is fast pace, stressful. I have learned how to get things done within the organization, in order to get things done one has to have the primary contacts. Not management but the people who do the actual work. Co-workers are not very helpful most of the times but they try to the best of their ability. The difficult part of my job is to be patient with Management as not everyone is knowledgeable in the areas they oversee. I enjoy learning so everyday I learn something new makes my day."
good,"Not the easiest job culture to be in. Enjoyed the experience though of seeing projects from start to finish, and got to know some excellent people. Too often though noticed people were working way too many hours doing the job of at least three people. Was extremely busy from start to finish every day."
good,HN is an okay compnay but its employee ins is poor and too expensive
good,This job was very slow in training. They a person who was promoted to the position that I was going to be auditing and she was me more questuion than I was. I got a book and taught myself how to audit them. Management was impressedwith my iniative. My co-workers were great they helped me out a lot. The auditees would come and yell at you if you gave them an error. The day I left.
good,I was hired on during the transition to a new contract so my starting pay was less than those of the past. The temps are paid $4-$5 higher than those who are hired as permanent employees.
good,They don’t let you  acquire any paid time off they don’t take accept doctors notes you don’t receive any benefits no health dental or 401k options and they dont offer overtime! Once they give you a shift that is your permanent shift
good,Health net is a solid company and the pay and benefits are good. It just has no soul. They do not care about you as long as you meet the minimum that is it. People are not happy working there. I mean really not happy. No team work or friendship. Just cliques and back stabbing. No real advancement unless you know the right person. They post a job but the person who is the hiring mangers buddy gets it. So no real career advancement. So safe job but not a happy job.
good,"Was a good company to work for. However, there were little room for promotions unless you were member of the inner circle.  During merger management repeatedly said & promised that there would be no lay offs BUT after one (1) year, 90% of IT got laid off."
good,"Took this position three years ago to see ""different side"" of Marketing. I learned a lot about health care especially Medi-Cal side of the business.  "
good,Would not recommend a friend or family to apply. Fast paced stressful environment. Lack of dept manager follow through. Associates are pleasure to work with.
good,it's okay. a lot of room for advancement. flexible schedule. management is okay. needs better café. Should pay more when taking on additional tasks that's not part of your job.
good,"Worked at Health Net for 5 years, including a few years post-Centene merger. I had to learn just about everything in various positions for myself. Information was rarely shared. Management was almost non-existent. Mostly just friends of higher ups got promoted, spending time in each other's offices rather than supporting call center agents. Very little cooperation amongst colleagues and departments. Benefits progressively got worse year to year."
good,Must be able to juggle multiple tasks or you will fall behind.  Attendance is ranked above all other personal goals.  There are many folks on the management teams that do not have college degrees and it shows.
good,"Poor management."
good,Typical day at work is answering average 70 phone calls and providing excellent customer service & assisting providers. Management is ok. Shifts can vary
good,"Management is the worst, no adequate training and lots of jealousy in the work environment. Supervisor will scold you instead of being professional about it and come talk to you."
good,"No recognition for hard work.  Only the same people were asked for special projects, focus groups, etc.  "
good,Typical lab environment. Run and verify QC before running patient samples. Not a stressful environment. Would still be there if they didn't close location.
good,"I have been working here over a year, and still haven't had the opportunity or given the chance to advance into the next level."
good,"No work life balance.  The company- well the federal contract portion does not accept any form of Dr. notes for sickness.  If you don't have FMLA, you no longer have a job.  The benefits were great.  The Culture was not good at all.  Management was never around."
good,New age of technology to help the everyday chronic illness.  The ability to monitor from home instead of going to the hospital all the time.
good,Leader in Affordable Care Act support. Executives are approachable and well versed in health insurance industry trends.
good,"A typical day at work was usually very long hours, very high stress, inbound call center. Taking anywhere from 70 to 105 calls per day, inputting call information into internal system. Assisted with billing issues and system issues regarding health care for military members and there families. Processed over 40 to 50 web requests for materials, and medical cards and kept a spread sheet of all production that I had completed. Quality Checked other associates production for errors and made corrections. Designed bulletin board with department stats. I learned a lot from working at Health Net. Mostly that I can take a very upset person on the phone, and turn it around to having a very satisfied and loyal customer. The hardest part of the job, was knowing that our reserve members were getting ready to deploy to Iraq and having to pray that I didn't end up talking with a widow spouse later down the road. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was when the customer would go from wanting a supervisor, to thanking me for helping them with there problem and coming to a resolution to the problem. Weather it was explaining something they didn't understand, or researching the problem and going to the source and getting it corrected. Receiving flowers and balloons from high ranking military men thanking me for my services, or receiving a letter from a member thanking me for my assistance and outstanding customer service, was the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Training is poorly organized. I had someone shadowing me only a couple weeks after I was on the floor. Pay is okay, but nothing to write home about. Good job to have while your looking for something better. They are not flexible with the schedule, and they do not try to work with you or provide accomidation. It just becomes dull and repetitive very fast. I guess it’s just not for everyone. :/"
good,"The pay is ok but medical benefits was super high after centene took over and the whole commpany was disorganized. Loved my manager bc she was always consistent and I did have a few co workers that i really liked but otherwise, it paid the bills"
good,"the staff/collegues are very friendly and do make you feel like family, but when it comes to scheduling the inconsistency is not condusive to a person with a organized life schedule. I was changed a shift i bid for within 3 weeks to a shift that had me there at 11pm at night. we were told they do shift schedules by senority but I constantly knew employees hired after me that recieved shift times that didnt move so it came off as some favoritism within the company. My benefits were shockingly lower than expected given the fact Its a health care. Most importantly the pay rate of what the job inquires is low. This job requires constant work and non busy days are unlikley and if complaints is not something you deal with or can handle i wouldnt recommend this job"
good,At this time I am uncomfortable posting this information online as I'm no completely sure who will have access to it nor do I know how it will be used.
good,"improved data skills. passed a few actuarial exams. had chances to handle huge data base."
good,worked int he call center which was fast paced and at times stressful in answering client inquiries. the supervisor which i was placed with was not as supportive in helping inquiries so it fell onto his assistant supervisor.
good,"The working environment overall is positive and co-workers are great. However, management doesn't like to promote employees. They tend to hire their buddies from the previous company they worked for. Since Centene has taken over there is always threat of layoffs so job security always seems shaky and employees worry about their future."
good,"no place for moving up in company. raise doesn't equal cost of living. management team is great, just not really a lot of chances to move up in the  company"
good,I learned alot in the medical field that would be a great asset for the future jobs to come. The material that was learned will help me to further my career in many ways.
good,My job allows me the opportunity to interact with providers and everyday positive challenges while contracting and learning/exploring new way and innovative ways to perform my duties.
good,"When I first start working for HN, I was a temp and we were had flex shift. It was good. We had leads who were very helpful and supervisors had open doors for reps. I became permanent after a year. The work environment is chill and friendly. Hardest part of was keeping up with updates, at one point they were changing once a week. I enjoyed being able to ask for help from my peers and over time was always available."
good,Could be better. Yall should really had listen to the workers. Also need to do better on keeping the employees up to date on major events. I am not going to say...
good,It was a government contract that ended. It is scaring having this type of job with not knowing how long the job will last. Job security is very important.
good,I enjoy working for this company. I believed in the integrity of the company and I love helping members receive the health care that they need. Unfortunately it is time to move on.
good,Lots of changes since Centene buyout.  Layoffs and very strict management controls and expectations compared to before the it was taken over by Centene
good,"Do not come here!! Do not apply for a position here unless you plan on not having a life!’ They treat you like your stupid.  The employed in this dept are nice, but overworked. Trust me, go elsewhere.. oh and., the work is motinous."
good,"call center environment, space in cubicals, nice coworkers, horrible supervisor, inflexible hours, mandatory OT some days of the week by at least 1 hour, liked helping patients and providers when they called but due to new company takeover very unorganized place"
good,Company has OK benefits. Work is unnecessary onerous with bureaucratic redtape. It is very difficult to get anything done with management providing little or no direction.
good,"Health Net was a productive and effective workplace for my first year of employment. I was trained well and encouraged to ask questions to further my understanding. However, once they were purchased by a larger insurance company the culture changed for the negative. Questions and clarifications were discouraged; employees were poorly trained in a cursory manner leaving them ill prepared for the work required. Additionally, beacuse the parent company was unwilling to listen to those at Health Net that understood the California market there was a very difficult migration. In an effort to resolve the issues created by the migration California employees were asked to work mandatory OT for over 5 months, causing much stress and burning out many employees."
good,"Ever since Health Net was bought, the culture has changed. Management is driven by the dollar, not by a need to do right by our customers. What used to be a pleasant, family type atmosphere has turned into an atmosphere where everyone is out for themselves."
good,Really fun workplace and I would suggest it to anyone. It is a great place for someone who is looking for a job but not a career. I would recommend it to someone not looking for a career.
good,"A typical day consists of answering difficult questions, handling all escalated calls, monitor and coach agents to develop and achieve KPI goals. Review attendance and hold outliers accountable to policy. Fast paced with fun employees."
good,Enjoyed working at Health Net and had hoped to retire there but the changes won't allow me to do so. Gained friends and good working relationships developed.
good,"No one can predict what a ""typical"" day will be like at HNS other than it will be challenging, stressful, and unpredictable.I have learned how to be a better leader and how to communicate more effectively with those that have poor listening skills. The management style is not the type of style that I prefer and does not encourage most employees to work at their best and flourish. The hardest part of the job is the management style while the most enjoyable part is the challenges and problem solving that utilizes my analytical skills."
good,"Ambulatory care is provided by HealthNet Community Clinics for impoverished, underinsured patients. Patients without insurance are treated and apply for government funded medical insurance by onsite financial insurance service personnel. HealthNet community clinics are located all around the Indianapolis Marion County area.  People's Health Center (PHC) on the near East side of Indianapolis is recovering from a change in management over the past year. PHC has a Dental clinic, OB/GYN clinic, Pediatric clinic and Adult/Family Medical Practice clinic. Diagnostic exams and specialty practice referrals are out of network.  Mammograms, chest xrays and pelvic ultrasounds are provided within the HealthNet network of clinics.  Patient support is offered by Social Services and Psychiatric care.   Registered Nurses provide care by telephonic triage for patients."
good,I met a great group of people that are very supportive and willing to train and help. A good place to work and learn ideas in healthcare insurance. Unfotunately I was working at Healthnet thru Kelly Services as a long term assignment.
good,generating authorizations for requested procedures etc if guidelines met per policy. If guidelines not met requests were sent to the Medical Director.
good,"When I was hired by this company, they just lost 3 others who did the same job as me. Health Net expected me to take the responsibilities of my work and the 3 who left. The company had no intention on replacing the other lost jobs. Since I was salaried, I worked 7 days a week at 13-15 hours a day. This included working from home in middle of night. During my time there I had no other life but work. The company does not hire to replace in most jobs because it has financial problems; therefore, placing the burdon on the remaining employees. The managers and employees were very friendly, but the company places an enormous amount of work to make up for the lost jobs over the years. "
good,Staff was supportive of each other and interdepartment support was impressive.
good,Hardest part of the job is always meeting the required production goal when there's always system issues sometimes system issues happens everyday that makes it impossible to produce that all you could do is take a class online or process return mails and when job review comes they will tell you did not meet your production and using this as the reason is not acceptable.
good,constantly changing procedures and not guaranteed to keep your position. Recent lay-offs. Did have good benefits with PTO and sick paid time off. Management was helpful.
good,"The position was in a call center setting. A huge room with cubicles, no windows, high call volume inbound calls the entire shift. Short breaks, continuously micro manged."
good,"It was ok, lots of overtime while I was there back in 2015.I dont know how it is now but from what I hear, everything changed since Centene took over."
good,"A stressful and unorganized place to work. People are scared to speak up about anything. Not a fun place to work. After 15 yrs of giving my all and having only been written up once for something out of my control during that whole time and working while on chemotherapy, I was laid off to save money. There's no account for loyalty. It's just about the bottom dollar."
good,hardest part is trying to come back to work after having an incident that involves requiring a doctors note. Getting approval from company to come back to work is ridiculously long process. Time goes by fast because you are always working taking calls after the next.
good,Customer service rep - great job but definitely believe workers should be paid better. Fasted pace call center in health field. Gained experience in serval different lines of business
good,"Non-existent company culture - typically stale, drab cubicle arrangements. "
good,It was ok. Could have paid more or had some sort of incentive since a lot of the work was based off of numbers. The management was not very good. Days are we’re the best!
good,"Healthnet is an okay company to work for. Although they are very strict about attendance, break times, and micro managing it was okay. It could be a great company if your job was secured, but unfortunately there's no job security."
good,A typical day starts off logging into your systems and checking emails. followed by logging onto the phones and answering calls for service from Members and Providers.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job happened during my time working with brokers, employers and clients.  Personally I gained a lot of experience on customer services, resolving their concerns, and helping them on time.  It is a challenge place to work since the company is still on the process to merge with another company.  Rules and guidelines change all the time and management sometimes make this the hardest part of the job."
good,"Company culture is good, yet the different departments are unstable as far as longevity of job.  Jobs are adjusted and departments re-structured as the company/manager deems necessary.  Large portion of culture is spent on VP;s"
good,My position and team were unique at Health Net and I do not believe my experience to be representative.   I will say that my time there was mostly positive and I wish my team all the best.
good,"The company has change ownership and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on current conditions. I held a few positions while working there. I started as a Customer Service rep, moved to A&G then to the Denial Compliance Unit. I worked with a lot of great people who made lives better for so many of our clients. I'm not sure what the conditions are like now, but I wish everyone the best."
good,"Health Net was purchased by Centene a few years ago. The culture has drastically changed since then, not for the better.  One of the biggest perks for nurses at HN was telecommuting. This is largely being taken away.  This makes it extremely difficult to find qualified RNs to work here since the pay for health plans is significantly lower than at Hospitals/Health Systems like Kaiser/Mercy.  Many of the best RNs have left the company.  They are now advertising new positions for LVNs as well.  The company is extremely money and productivity focused.  Members and employees are secondary to this. Morale is unfortunately very low.  Everyone is stressed, from managers to staff."
good,"Health Net, Inc. used to be a company that cared about work-life balance. Since being acquired by Centene Corporation, Health Net, Inc. only cares about a work-work balance and no care about employees having a healthy life outside of the work. Additionally, management is horrible at communicating important changes with job functions, especially if their direct reports are spread throughout multiple offices."
good,tough job lots of hours. Poor communication . great pay and benefits little room for advancement in my department . jobs not hard just demanding. but if . would be great with better communication and care for emplyees
good,"Health Net was a great place to work, based on Salary.  However, there were many times where many hours were put in.  Some management lacks proper management skills and you may feel used and not given the recognition.  With recent changes the culture has changed for the worse in my opinion."
good,"The company had big ambitions.  However, they are no longer in existence. Pay and benefits were amazing and some of the hardest working people I know came out of this shop."
good,I have had some good and bad in my 16 years.  I have loved what I do.  Loved the people I work with.  With the outside vendors I have worked with.  Management has been hit and miss.  Some are great at what they do some have little experience as managers and need to go to training to learn how to relate to their employees.
good,Could be better. Not much room to choose schedule. It's whatever it is available. Management is constantly changing making for unsettling environment
good,"A usual work day is typically 10-12 hours. The coworkers are amazing to work with although the management is constantly changing, they are all pretty easy going and keep all coworkers up to date with any changes in the comapny or medical field. The best part of the job is the overtime, although it can become extremely tiring after a while, the easygoing environment and payoff is well worth it."
good,"The hardest part of being a Claims Examiner is learning and remembering all the edit codes."
good,I enjoyed my work at Health Net though I wasn't there for a very long time.  My management was good and new what was going on.  My peers were good worker and good people
good,"Health Net is a good place to work but systems are old.  There is room for advancement. There needs to be improvement in training area."
good,HealthNet has a lot of good people that work very hard.  Great teamwork in the Tempe office.
good,"The systems are outdated"
good,"-A high volume call with prior authorization department."
good,"Health Net was a good experience. I learned a lot about healthcare, enjoy special events (e.g. Heritage Day) and appreciated the help I received from my peers."
good,a very good company love the hours 8.430 an they offer overtime as needed
good,management often plays favorites and if you aren't your managers pet your job will suck
good,"•Managed and maintained daily schedules for Director of Medicare Sales and Vice President of Marketing"
good,"Health Net was a fun place to work, but overall was not for me."
good,There is not a lot of cross training in this company and each department looks out for itself. Having said that I want to stae that like all companies there are good and bad things here. The good is once you get the contacts in the other departments they are always willing to help you. The bad is getting those contacts in the beging. Not a lot of training in begining. Recieved training after Im already figured out system.
good,Professional Responsibilities:
good,"I like working with my peers and supervisor. If you get along with others well and love engaging with others/customers, this would be the job for you."
good,"Authorization and Appointing Rep -"
good,"ok place to work at, team was easy to work with and so are the managers. Benefits were good, the only think I didn't like was not enough PTO per pay period."
good,The day was so busy and some have to work over 10 hours and even weekend I still need to work. The workplaces is good and working culture is great. It is most enjoyable part of the job.
good,I really loved learned so much working at Health Net and it has helped me in my future endeavors.  I have been in the health care industry for over 15 years and have really enjoyed being in this industry.
good,"Due to the nature of the job duties, HNFS was a rewarding place to work at firs. Then they turned it in to competition similar to a commission base job."
good,"Lack of accountabilty and a bit too personal. Difficult work environment at times due too many personalities.Not being held accountable for their work contributions, responsibilties and ability to get along with co workers."
good,assist veterans Va personal and healthcare providers with scheduling and some claims concerns overall the review of the company was it paid the bills and I enjoyed paid Federal Holidays and the O/T when offered I enjoyed the co workers on the teams that I was assigned to and a had 3 wonderful supervisors thru the time I spent there as a employee
good,"Little or no advancement opportunities. Marginal management/leadership. Very few perks. Open communication, with little or no action taken as a result of that communication. Mediocre benefits for being an actual healthcare provider. A discount is offered on medical insurance; however, you must participate in a biometric exam. If you fail that, you must participate in coaching to receive discounted rate, Any new hiring: very little internal, more external candidates hired now, so you'd have a good chance coming in from the outside. Seeing allot of tenured people leaving because they have been passed up. Disappointing how things have changed; not so much for the good."
good,"This place uses to be fun and competitive, but when the company was taken over we lost all of our overtime and team spirit. A lot of the employees left and were replaced by people that are slow to learn. The new training methods are not helping either."
good,Temp contractor for Health Net's annual HEDIS reviews.  Great temporary and good way to hone chart reviewing skills.  Nice co-workers and well organized.
good,"Glad I'm not there, didn't like being attached to a phone all day & told when to go to break & lunch each day. Also had a script to say & was listened to all day long to make sure you said it properly."
good,"Very stressful job especially during AEP, all work and no play.  Numbers were overly stressed.  I had an awesome manager, but she was being made to micromanage."
good,"My typical day was focused on Installing new devices, moving workstation, add new devices to current workstations and processing users change requests."
good,"I was in a customer service oriented roll. Cal center type environment. Position was overall good, Pay was low, benefits were ok. Hours were fine. Co-workers were easy to get along with."
good,Good Company.  Great managers and caring people.  I enjoyed many of my experiences there.  there is a great deal of bureaucracy that slows down process development and execution.
good,"Not completely punctual, overall it was a good company the position was amazing. But there wasn’t much order within the company certain rules wasn’t being controlled."
good,"Was lucky enough to have a great manager who allowed me to learn a ton. Upper management seemed detached from was was actually happening. Numerous departmental inefficiencies, which ultimately caused the demise of the program and lack of contract renewal."
good,"Heavy favoritism driven, all supervisors play favorites. Each has their own rules that they choose to follow. Every department is inconsistent. Even when you're there without missing any days and are a top performer , when trying to move up, the position goes to the favorite, not the qualified hard worker."
good,"I was able to get a decent job here to get back into the workforce. I like my manager a lot. It seems like they never promote from within here, and we have lost many great people because of that. They will unfortunately lose me because that as well."
good,"When Health Net was Intergroup of Arizona, it was great.  When big corporations bought it. It gradually went down hill. That is az ll I am going to say."
good,Great company at beginning of my career.  Less so after contract ended with Government. Many upper level management changes in last 2 years which prevented cohesion.
good,"Overall an average place to work in, the coworkers are never excited to be at work but also they don't hate the place completely. The tasks are pretty easy, chain of command can get sort of confusing but works itself out."
good,I really enjoyed my interactions with the Veterans and their families. I would still be there had it not been for the manager that was so unfair in her treatment of me as an employee.
good,Healthnet was bought by another company and has had many layoffs. I am in the process of relocating to Portland Oregon for a change in life. It should be great.
good,Good company with great people. I worked in a department that everyone was very professional and knowledgeable about their work. Good opportunities for growth.
good,"Log into my systems, pull my workload from our data base, complete my work and assist other teams if needed.  Train new hires and keep up to date with training modules online."
good,Claim adjudication process 45 a day. Culture and event we come in. Offer to pay for transportation for get to work. Nice personal space to work in. New job
good,Decline to provide any information about a former employer. This is not ethical. This should not be included or pursued by any job site platform or company.
good,"Worked the Federal Services side of the company. Long term employees have much of the advancement opportunities. In transition right now with recent purchase of the company, systems are all in flux and changing; some of them not for the better. Management can tend to be disorganized and self serving; however, if you put your best in the ring each day, the work is good."
good,After making the decision to return to work after starting a family I went to Health Net Federal Services. It was a good opportunity to further develop my administrative and leadership skills.
good,"lack of communication between management and staff. micro managed. unstable due to contract work, low morale, treat people like children, could pay staff better, management is paid very well"
good,"Team environment is almost inexistent. Good pay and benefits (Medical, dental, 401K, vision, life insurance). Training program is weak and insufficient."
good,Health net works on a point system so if you call in more than 6 times in a year you could be let go. Health Net is contracted with the VA and if Health net as a company bids for another contract and does not get it you could lose your job. The pay is not very much to start and does not give but 50 a year for raises.
good,"I enjoyed working for Health Net, but after 4 yrs and a promotion only received about a 1.25 in raises. I have a family to provide for and with rising rent prices, I could no longer wait for a company to see my worth ....financially."
good,Constant management changes. No set direction. No career advancement opportunities. Company was gearing to be bought out. No job security. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
good,Typical call center! Helping military members is a plus! Good pay and professional work environment.  I would recommend this company to others. Tuition reimbursement.
good,Enjoyed working with the teams.  Program and project management expertise was in early stages of maturation.  IT was trying to catch up with the rest of the industry.
good,Health Net is a good Company and there are good people that work there. The only issue that arises is you have to be careful who you associate with because if you are around the wrong people you will be labeled so you have to be careful.
good,"The remote environment is managed ethically, the patients were always very grateful and enjoyable to assist in their care and that was the rewarding aspect of the job."
good,"work hard to get appointments. Very relaxed environment, huddles, potlocks, incentatives if youre doing a good job, Everyone knows each other from managers to employes."
good,Production standards must be met.  Pay is decent.  Raises are very big.  Lots of overtime - management sometimes expects 10 plus hours of OT.  Nice if you need the extra money.
good,"The job is okay. The learning process is fun, but once you learn how to process a claim, they job is just repetitive and boring. If you are a go getter and goal setter the job isn't really for you. I you just go to work for a paycheck, you have to opportunity to make good money."
good,"It was  a full-time job form 8:30 to 5 and some people worked until 5:30pm. There were things in the air about the location extending hours for people who want to work nights."
good,doing this job it was interesting. It was slow when it come to customers. The company was very supportive and a good place to work. It was long days though good work.
good,Learned how to multi-task using headset and PC. Taking calls consistent with the time requirements. Learned about Health and Human Services regarding setting up appointments for various doctor evaluations.
good,great group of people - knowledge of Healthcare strategy - great at contract negotiations - great support team - the recruiter is on the mark.  Great benefits.  Local to New England
good,"The place is good for the people that already out of graduated college or high school, is not good if you want to move forward to a career. The management is not good and fair"
good,"not the best company to work for "
good,My typical day as a Clinical Review Analyst was just to assist the agents with medical coding and medical terminology.  Unfortunately no real interaction with the agents.  They weren't able to talk with me other than by Instant message.  There were times when they would really needing to come to my cubicle to speak with me and discuss it than over a computer.  Management need a lot to be desired.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to communicate with the other staff members.
good,HealthNet was a great place to work and I enjoyed my time there. It was a great place to learn and advance your career. Many employees had been with the organization for 10+ years.
good,"Job was busy and always had work to do. The co workers were kinda ghetto, But as long as you kept to yourself no one bothered with you. Training class was very informative."
good,This was a great position however when it comes to managment understanding your concerns with how your performance is being rated; they do not seem have repor. I loved my job and helping customer; however there are things that I have no control over when it came to insurance claims and timely submission and respone. Most providers called because claims were denied and they want to know. It was job to explain it and I did just that. Also; calls centers have a tendency to try and dictate you call time; which is impossible because they are not on the phone and they have no idea what you are dealing with.
good,There is a lack of concern about employee work/life balance. There was not health insurance or short term disability. There was a lack of opportunity for self-care. Did not provide quality support to employees.
good,Fun place to work but no opportunity for growth since the company is so small. Dealing with phone calls from representatives of famous people was the best part.
good,"The main focus in word and deed is to provide quality health care to Veterans and Military Service Members and their families. With a management layer and working staff that include many military-connected employees, there is a strong culture of dedication, integrity, and follow-through. The health care recipients are not just customers or patients--they are comrades in arms, so the company  is strongly motivated to meet or exceed contract requirements and service levels. This culture pervades the company--it's a place where employees feel they can make a difference in the lives of those who protect us."
good,"While it's a solid place to work, there is a high degree of angst because of the unknowns regarding health care in the next four years, what with the change in administrations."
good,this is a good company. I learned a lot from healthnet. the most enjoyable part is I got to park in the president parking space for a month.
good,"Strong culture, but at times poor management in certain areas held back potential. Curious metrics for evaluating talent and performance. Passionate service to veterans."
good,"The company has a great benefits package. However, the leadership within certain departments are not very good at leading and keeping the moral high."
good,"A typical day is spent taking payments and answering members questions about their coverage, status and assist members in making changes. Also, working with other departments at times in finding resolutions.  "
good,"Currently working on program for Sales business unit which is both challenging and rewarding. Project are currently in UAT.  Work with Business, IT, UAT Management and Project team to resolve defects for smooth implementation."
good,"This company has great leadership in the administration portion.  They helped me developed new skills and promote continuation of training and education to perform your best, with none to minimal errors."
good,It was very satisfying when I was able to get a veteran scheduled and call them back with their appointment information. However when we were crazy busy we were not able to completely take care of veterans at once and this was dis-pleasing for the veterans and us the customer service representatives.
good,"Days are productive when you are meeting quota. Company has a strict attendance policy, which I believe in whole hardily. Training is not what I would have expected it to be, but rarely is with most companies. You learn your best skills once you hit the production floor. Overall I would rate the company around a 3.5."
good,"The hardest part of my job was not being able to help a veteran."
good,"It was great place to work, the people were great. I really like the staff and the clients as well. It was a very professional place to work and they made you feel very welcome."
good,There is always plenty to do and policies to learn. Something was changing everyday to improve the quality of production. Enjoyable environment.
good,"If you like being on the phone all day, this job is for you.  Little potential to advance career unless you have been there for several years."
good,wonderful people to work with. Felt very under appriciated for the hard work I put in. Although they did offer good benefits.
good,A good deal of information must be kept at the leadership level because it is publically held. Supervisors tend to come and go. Employee engagement has decreased over the last 10 years.
good,The company over all is very good however it is currently going thru changes . The pay for the amount of work we do could be better  in fact a lot better. I would give it an 8 rate.  And the system is not good at all  (omni)
good,"Call Center, answering calls in a orderly manner and providing great customer service to members and providers. Management took care of employees needs approched with profesionalism and with the intent to make emplyee feel needed at work. Provider calls and claim calls were a bit frustrating at times but overall always satisfied at the end of the phone call. Days seemed to go by fast due to the amount of calls every day. Every day was a new day to learn something new and receive updated information to pass on to members and providers."
good,A typical day at health net would be taking a high amount of inbound calls in a call center. My manager was great.The hardest part of the job was angry callers. I've learned patience is a virtue and most people just need to know that they've been listened to.
good,"Health Net gave me the opportunity to see many different aspects of the business. from Tricare, PDP, Medicare Gap Plans and Commercial lines of business. In any position I help the primary always was to support the Customer Service Representatives be the most efficient and effective on each call. I was heavily involved in process improvement and development of our process and procedures for the Medicare Part D program that started in2005."
good,"Working in the eligibility department for Affordable Care Act plans, a typical day consists of researching escalated and regulatory issues that require review of eligibility and accounting transactions as well as communicating updates to the vendor Covered CA via email and telephone inquiries."
good,Health Net is a great place to work. They require alot of production so the volume of work is high. Very competitive so you are require to do your best.
good,"okay place to work with. best part of my day is assisting the service members. it is an okay work environment. need more breaks, especially when dealing with a difficult person. Just be able to catch on quickly and a person will be fine."
good,This place didn't allow any work/life balance we worked 50 hour a week only day off was sunday.
good,"It was a great experience, I worked well with others. I like helping people and knowing that I can help break down statements to better their understanding."
good,"Good place to work in the beinning. I was hired to do Inside Sales; 3 months ago, we are now doing Customer Service Calls for the Medicaid program, which has cut our salary in half.   Uncertain if I would work her again."
good,"great working environment, can learn more in this company in healthcare domain"
good,"I am a temp at Health Net so i understand that the goal is to be a full time employee. None the less, this job has it moments of down time where you have literally no work to do and I am a type of worker that likes to be challenged."
good,"Responsible for processing claims electronically, follow-up on accounts, insurance verification, filing secondary claims with primary eobs attached, appeals. Researches claim overpayments and requests funds. Followed adjudication policies and procedures to make sure proper payment of claims. "
good,"This company does not exsist any more, the branch was shut down."
good,"This job was rewarding due to helping military & their dependents get adequate care!"
good,"My workday consisted of checking the company's database daily to ensure the applications received were complete. I then forwarded the applications to the Credentialing Specialists. I learned to better multi-task and manage my time most efficiently. The morale in the workplace was fair. I surrounded myself with positive people who worked hard and also completed their daily tasks. My supervisor was supportive, which made the workday enjoyable. My Supervisor ensured I stayed on task with my duties."
good,very hard work in sales Interesting work i learned a lot to talk different people to sales the product its very funny and intersting worked .
good,"I learned much about healthcare delivery and the importance of compliance with industry standards in order to maintain quality across all products. There were opportunities for advancement and learning across departments. The hardest days were those leading up to submission of documents to receive a renewed certification, and most enjoyable was working with colleagues."
good,"There was never a typical day at work, in Rafael Locke's retention unit.  You never really knew what task you could be assigned.  It could be based on anything from the workload, to how the weather was on the East Coast!  Definitely a dept where one could never get bored.  I learned so many systems- OmniI, CSI, ABS, MC100, API, MP/Citrix, Caremark, etc... The list goes on!  I'm happy to have obtained such a strong working knowledge of so many proprietary systems, for they had to be used on a daily basis for all of the regions our dept serviced (AZ, CA, OR/WA, PDP).  Management was always looking for ways to implement better working procedures, in order to expand our knowledge base as much as possible.  Co-workers were friendly, many had healthnet family members so it was always a family orientated atmosphere.  The most difficult part of the job was the constant switching of tasks at any given moment, which meant switching gears & systems all together.  I must say again that this is why you could never get bored!  The most enjoyable part of the job is what I mentioned above- the family orientated atmosphere.  Working with people that you know really care and want to help you in any way that they can."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of preparing manual and automated upload files and submitting them to management and account payable for posting. Interacting with brokers and internal customers on commission inquiries."
good,A typical day at my job would be assisting the elderly with there Health Net insurance inquires and complaints. Anything from claims all the way to benefits. I learned that there are many good things and bad things to having health insurance.
good,"A typical day at the office was like no other I have ever experienced in my 14 year professional career. The trainees and coworkers were fun to work with. The benefits and company programs were exceptional. The working environment was very nice. The campus was beautiful, however Management was very hard on the department and micromanaged everyone. Highly stressful and nerve wrecking when showing compassionate to our members which most of them were either SPD senior persons disabled or were going through Chemo and radiation and getting warned or threatened of being written up because you would spend too much time explaining and educating our members. Management expected everyone to show less compassion and move on to the next call. That was the hardest part of the job for me, cause I am very compassionate individual. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to make a difference in someones life with every incoming call. I am grateful and appreciative for what I learned and how much I grew. I feel now I have so much knowledge of the medical and insurance industry, I feel confident and I believe my ability to understand and then interpret the needs can be a significant benefit for any organization"
good,"My job experience has helped me grow mentally. I have grown with my companies and learned how to keep a business relationship within the company and outside of it. Working with different personalities has helped me learn how to deal with various situations, I really enjoy working with individuals and working on my own."
good,Employees working hard in a daunting environment to reduce medical trend.  
good,"High expectations for performance, solid govt. contractor, opportunity to learn; great people"
good,"The pay and benefits are great but most of the management needs to be replaced. They only care about the customer which don't get me wrong is important but if you are writing employees up for taking more than 5 min in the bathroom it can get kinda overwhelming. You can get full coverage health insurance that includes medical, vision and dental for around $40.00 a month no other company can beat that."
good,"Responsible for responding to telephone inquiries from members and employer groups to provide information and clarification on multiple products relating to eligibility, pharmacy computer systems, claims processing, provider services, provider transfers, correspondence, contracts and various health plan benefits and differences."
good,This was my introduction to sales and marketing in the health insurance business.
good,"Great place to work, enjoyed being on the phones. Only real downfall, difficult to schedule time off."
good,"Working for the company Health Net has taught me a lot. You have your good days and your bad, and your good bosses and your bad bosses. But over all Health Net is a great place to work with the right department."
good,"Businesses have access to many top ranked hospitals and providers for their employees, including the ability to save premium utilizing tailored networks in specific regions. A Southern California based company who is looking for competition in the Northern California market."
good,"HNFS administers different health plans every few years based on government contracts.Leadership and culture changes with each contract.  In 2019, TRICARE was the only major contract."
good,"Loved my job and working for HealthNet however my supervisor was terrible, had her favorites and absolutely did nothing to help us with our jobs but to sit and monitor you all day and then criticize without offering any help!"
good,I have learned a lot working here & continue to learn more daily. I enjoy my hours & feel that if you apply yourself you have room for growth here. I  look forward to coming everyday.
good,"It was an ok place to work ,I felt lilt we should have gotten paid more .The management could have been more hands on ,The management could not help you at all"
good,"in experienced managers . friends getting promoted to positions without proper qualifications, great work environment peers are pleasant to wok with. unfair promotions"
good,"great place to work if you are ok to sit at an a desk all day and not interact with anyone much. Great benefits, managers are cool, good amount of PTO given."
good,"Because they are government contracted, there were changes all the time. This was a stressful job especially at contract change time. Also the mandatory OT would burn people out."
good,Health Net is no longer in operation.  There was a lot of emphasis on contract work or assignments.  I do not have much more to say about Health Net other than it was an ok place to work.
good,Health Net was an excellent opportunity to gain corporate experience in the healthcare industry.  It paid a competitive salary and offered valuable experience that makes for employment marketability.  It was difficult to advance to upper-level positions due to their corporate and management structure.  The work load was heavy and it required working long hours.
good,"I got very well versed in multitasking, producing quality work and not missing deadlines all the cost of no breaks and overtime. Work was very stressful and I wasn't able to grow much. Opportunities for advancement were scarce but it was a great starter position in a large corporation.  Workplace culture was friendly but highly micromanaged. I enjoyed working with different teams to gain knowledge and expertise due to the smaller size company v. Anthem."
good,"Travel department was excellent operation until Centene Corporation bought Health Net.  Centene decided to stick with their outside travel agency, Egencia, rather than utilize the services of the in-house ARC accredited Health Net travel department.  Our department was eliminated and the employees laid off."
good,"Fast paced, review medical cases, internal and external customer service. Worked with Microsoft office. Educate prospective members and currently enrolled members."
good,Unless being on the phones is something you really enjoy there isn't much option for advancement. I have tried applying to other departments but no luck. Once they have you in the call center its hard to get out.
good,"It has filled a need and have had wonderful peers to work with. Management is terrible historically in the DM department. Ready, shoot, aim implementation style."
good,"Health Net is a good place to work. Management are great and the people who work here are great.   In the departments I've worked for, everyone were very helpful and professional."
good,"A typical day at work, I would arrive 10 minutes early and start a process, I had about two to tree to choose from, Also I could take breaks in between."
good,"Fast paced enviornment, Opportunities to grow within"
good,"most of the time I worked in office with HR officer to help him in recruitment,selection and keep the record of all the employee.I learned from the organization member when they interviews someone."
good,Healthnet has such a diverse background and is a good place to work at. I have learned much about the business aspect of contractual governmental projects and will take this knowledge with me in the future.
good,"As far as places to work, you couldn't ask for a more kick-back job the with Health Net. If you put your head down and just do what little is required of you on an hourly bases its not a bad place to be. Expect to stay in the position you start at though, advancement isn't always easy to come by."
good,"A typical day at work is helping out with the patients that are not feeling well and knowing that when they leave out of the clinic their day will start to get better. This has been the only company I have work for since becoming an MA, I have learned tremendous a lot and feel that I can achieve more in my life. The hardest part of the job may be knowing when there is not much you can do for a patient but pray and hope that it gets better."
good,"Grown middle age women acting like high schoolers. Management looks the other way and/or joins in. Management has favorites that can do no wrong. A lot of whispering, giggling, IM'ng, HR inappropriate behavior on a daily basis. If one isn't doing it that day then another one is. No-retaliation??? RIGHT! If you are not in the click and join the mentality then you are made the punching bag.  ""They"" can miss work, be late, leave for an hour or two, ignore guidelines and not be reprimanded....you will though. Glad to be gone."
good,"This is a very fast paced, demanding environment.  I manage my workload and help teammates when I can, especially at month end.  I have learned about the industry, but already had existing talents that I brought to this position.  I had multiple process improvements in my first year of employment."
good,"-data entry"
good,I've learned a lot about healthcare and Project Management. My co-workers are a pleasure to work with and my manager is top-notch.
good,The people are great to work with. Worked as a team to meet deadlines. Allowed to work from home in my position. Enjoyed working on my projects/proposals. Learned a lot from my boss.
good,"The position of Utilization Management Coordinator consisted of many fast paced & technical responsibilities. While working on dual monitors, in a live phone cue, eight different programs were being accessed at all times to enter prior authorizations, manage inpatient/outpatient services, and assist medical review/case management/utilization RN/MD. Our team worked well together communicating effectively to other departments, facilities, providers, and members. The most difficult part of the job was the numerous changes being made and we were not notified by upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job was to do my job well while bringing a positive attitude to everyone I had the pleasure to assist."
good,This is a fast paced environment with many projects and enhacements
good,The training was not consistant to learn the policies. Plus there are no windows in the building.
good,I enjoyed the experience. Peers and management were very nice and open. Training is a constant and support is key. All together I respect the organization.
good,"Good place to work for the time I was there. The company has since closed its doors. Some days were fun due to the friendly competition, while others were pressure filled with the threat of losing our contract towards the end."
good,"Good, large company to work for.  Time in and time outs are strict and registered on your computer.  Constant training and possible career advancement, are things I liked.  Direct supervisors are mostly competent and friendly.  But call center manager cancelled my contract the minute she got wind of my proposed 2 weeks notice so I can go work for another company, leaving me to figure out where to get 2 weeks worth of pay."
good,Each day was very busy and if there was slow day we would be able to assist other departments. Co-Workers are great to work with as we had multiple policy changes and we would help each other out by providing information and hard copies of the changes. The difficult part of working at Health Net was the work/life balance. Our department would work right up to a holiday and we would be made to work massive amounts of overtime while management took their holiday vacations. We would also be required to work weekends as our department was compliance driven. Pay was decent but the option to take an HMO for your health benefits was not given. You were only able to take PPO insurance which was not offered at a discount to their employees.
good,"slow but productive"
good,"Depending on departments, things are very unorganized and employees aren't kept up to date on the new changes that is going on. Temps tend to get paid the same as a perm, even if the perm tend to do more workload. It's a competitive work environment and stressful."
good,"HealthNet and IU Health used to be in a partnership.  They used to work well together.  Since they parted company, about two-three months ago, HealthNet has been understaffed and struggling to continue to provide good healthcare for their current patients.  I think the hardest part of the job is when your working on your day off or extra hours and patients take time to yell at you for the time it took them to get in touch with you."
good,"The hours are very flexible for the most part when you are not in management. In management I arrive anytime between 5am and 6am and work until 7 sometimes 8 at night with no break. It is really that much work that is bombarding management. No matter how late I work or how early I work, I can never answer all emails or respond and process all request."
good,"HealthNet Federal Services was a good place to work; however it was purchased by a much larger company, Centene, and the benefits, work culture, consideration for employees, all changed for the worse."
good,It is a good place to work.  It is very diverse and the people get along.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when management recognizes us for all of our hard work and in turn give us a pizza party.
good,"Much depends on what position you hold. Being on the phones in customer service is the hardest job ever. Even when they try to make things fun, we never get off the phones to enjoy the events of the day. The calls are non-stop often with not even a second in between calls. It is hard to get to know your co-workers too as there isn't much time for that."
good,"When I worked for Health Net, they were downsizing which meant that everyone was not only doing their own work, but also the work of the folks who has been ""downsized."" The work/life balance wasn't good, and unfortunately this was part of the culture there. I can only hope that this has improved in the intervening years since I was there."
good,"The salary and pay is very good. The environment is so relaxed. However, after the recent acquisition by Centene, job security has become a huge concern."
good,"A good company to work for.  Was bought by Centene.  Health Net has seen many changes over the years but the ""Centene culture"" has taken over.  I am no longer content in my position within the company."
good,"Training is vague yet many expectations to perform like a vet. Minimal contact with others processing claims is a plus. Inflexible in some areas, such as hours of operation, (possible change). Poor bonus incentives and almost no raise structure."
good,"Fun job to work at but not a place to get comfortable at, making it seem like Heathnet's contract is not going to last. Great benefits"
good,"This time of unprecedented change brings real challenges. But we believe, and we bet you do, too, that the opportunities will be far greater. "
good,"Unfortunately I was working as a temp for almost 6 years at this company. They never hired me and then talked about lay offs. I worked in a high cubicle, which was nice. But since I was not hired, I did not receive any benefits, which was a bummer. There was not a lot of turnover so everyone knew each other. The hardest part of working there was trying to keep my privacy. I liked to do my work without getting personal. I wasn't going anywhere as far as career, so it was nice that I was moving away."
good,"I feel as though the new group of coworkers took away from this corporations image of service and positive unity.  They went through my belongings to cost me about $400.00.  I believe that they grouped to make it their duty to treat me as the outsider because I am from and stay in Woodland, CA.  The trainer was not a better example for anyone at that place either.  Day in and day out of training she acted like calling me by another name was the most hilarious thing or she just kept forgetting."
good,Management was great. Was able to advance from claims processing to account payable responsibilities. Company allowed advancement from one department to another.
good,"Enjoyed the company in the beginning, although once out on the floor, realized quickly that the training needs to be reworked. What was learned in training was not helpful on the floor. The management slowly became very micromanaged and I felt as I was back in school and had to raise my hand to use the restroom. That is what I started to not like. Meeting quotas and assisting providers/ customers brought joy to the position, and is what I find happiness in doing."
good,Workplace culture is good is all mixed and coworkers are nice and treat you like family. Busy all the time with work but management I question on their lack of leadership sometimes.
good,"The managers were only worried about appointment numbers and not the quality of our work! I could've made 40 incorrect appointments and the managers would not care, they'd just be happy with the number. It is a relaxed job, loved the pay, loved the schedule."
good,"New changes and new employment opportunities. "
good,"Fast pace environment, strict management with little or no room for error. clean, well organized family oriented. Great Christmas Carnival Functions for Foster Kids across the state of California."
good,"Inbound calls from about 20-30 calls a day no time limit on the call, reading scripts discliamers, providing referrals, qouting benefits verifying eligiblity."
good,"Typical day involves interaction with Controller and CFO, as well as other functional executives."
good,It was great company just unorganized and they weren’t paying providers which made the job harder as they did not want to work with us and that made it harder for us to schedule services appointments for veterans.Seeservices.anappointment appointments dappointmentpan
good,"They provided training for at least a month before you were placed on the phone taking calls.  It could be a bit stressful in the begining being graded on your call time but overall if you like sitting at a desk and taking calls then it was a good place to work.  There's room for growth and management was friendly.  Time would go by fast at work becuase as an employee you will always be busy with changing providers, checking on claims, or assisting in other projects."
good,This Friday will be 13 years here. I started out at the bottom & have worked my way up. Over the year it has gotten very boring and way more strict with everything.
good,"A lot of Veterans needed help and I was honored to assist them.We worked as a team on all of our projects. As a unit we set and met our own goals for the day and the week. Had potluck and parties to get to know other employees, which is always a good thing."
good,"Prior to the merger with Centene, I feel that the work environment was much better. Its not a horrible place to work but its definitely not the best either. There is job security if you work on the federal side however very little room for advancement."
good,"Management is transparent  and fair to their employees."
good,The job is okay to work at. A typical day of work consist of a lot od Data Entry work. Management is all over the place sometimes and don't always communicate with each other but when they do they job runs more smoother. Co-workers are excellent and we love helping one another when we need help. The hardest part of the job is dealing with system issues and having to still try and make your numbers for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people I work with and helping Veteran get the services they need.
good,I worked in At&t repair call center.  It was nice place to be at the time when I worked there. We helped dispatch repairs to homes to supply customer needs.
good,"My manager and supervisors are amazing easy going  people, fun, creative, family oriented, understanding the 11yrs I been working along with them have never had any issues."
good,"Productive, relaxed place to work. The only downside was my job was only contract. Other then that i thoroughly enjiyed working for Health Net . My co-workers were awesome as well."
good,"Learned invaluable knowledge and skills when it comes to health insurance and the new healthcare reform. You do not take work home but they do not offer part time... so it would be hard if you were planning on going to school or pursuing anything else for that matter while working here. Pay is great and the benefits are good (It is a health insurance company after all). Co workers and management are easy to work and get along with. The hardest part about the job is being in such a high pace environment, if you cannot handle a great deal of multi-tasking while dealing with live member problems this would not be an ideal place to work. The most enjoyable part about the job would be the sense of satisfaction from offering reliable help when needed. I gave Job Security 2 stars because of the uncertainty of the company's future, they outsourced to Mexico and to the Philippines as well as cutting your benefits, job title, and comfortability by selling all the call centers to a behemoth outsourcing company."
good,I do not want to write a review on Health Net. I do not feel comfortable writing more information about my experience working for Health Net. I did enjoy the work itself and the people I came to call friends.
good,"The job was nice and comfortable but management sucked. i learned to be very courteous to the veterans in helping them with their appointments."
good,"fast learner always on time ,"
good,"Nice people, Nice place -nice set up as well as nice staffing, I am a temporary employee here, and temps do not get the same treatment as perm. including benefits."
good,"The office was great but there was no time for training. Constant marks against employees for small mistakes made. "
good,"The hours worked were overwhelming. Worked 80 hours a week and on weekends.  "
good,"Great place if you are a perm employee, but if you are not there are no benefits. The leads are not very helpful, actually they are very rude. Other then that no one really bothers you"
good,"The reason I am leaving is far from my house.it's fun-loving environment. benefits are low, no PTO. there is no job security and low salaries without benefits."
good,Health net Federal Services is a nice place to work. Serving active duty military service members and their families is very rewarding. Many different departments.
good,Work life balance not geared towards the employee. They are more concerned about getting work done and will sacrifice the employees time off to achieve goal.
good,There is a lot of favoritism and it is almost impossible if you want to move up and get a higher paying position without the help of someone already in a higher position than you.
good,Served as the primary point of contact providing direct support and guidance to military personnel and families seeking crucial information on medical benefits daily.
good,"In the beginning it was a new and exciting experience for me. The better we did, the greedier the company got. They push unreasonable goals upon their employees, push mandatory OT, they talk teamwork, but push for individuality. The management staff are incapable and incompetent. I love what I do, but I do not love who I do it for. The choice program is ending in September. We are losing our jobs, and they are not offering very many options to continue with our parent company Centene."
good,"I come in and log into a phone que. Then check my emails from to different mailboxes. Then process manual adjustment for small business account, send out nsf letters, sort thru mail. "
good,"This company is very supportive of work life balance.  However, certain regions lack opportunities for advancement.  Upper Management tends to provide ""lip service"" to employees, however, they don't have the follow through."
good,A typical day will not have dull moments. Learned the technical aspect of health insurance and government programs. Middle management can be improved and abstain from office politics. Culture is of a supportive team/staff.
good,The Health Net position was through Kelly Services. The management was not friendly. Workplace culture with other employee was friendly. Enjoyed learning and helping the customers.
good,"Working salary is a great thing because you can come into the office when you need to as long as you finish your work. There is a nice break room but no cafeteria on site. "
good,"High functioning operations, encourage creative thinking, management is open to flexible schedules, the culture is solution focused. The down side is no job security to certain lines of business. Received 3 pay increases and 2 bonuses in 2 years and made $1000 of employee stock."
good,"It is a Great place to work for, just hard to understand what happens if contracts end where your job goes. I do love my job it is just doesn't feel secure. At least on the Health net Federal service side but Commercial side is wonderful."
good,"Overall was treated fairly at Health Net and management were very attentive I thought.  When Centene took over Health Net, I noticed more tension and less acquired personal time off.  I think Flex time for family and personal time off for other reasons is extremely important."
good,HealthNet is a great organization to work for. Senior Leadership focuses on making sure all patients in the local community that seek their services are taken care of. It is encouraged that staff be involved in the decision making process and utilize their voice.
good,"While HN was managed by HN the company was good."
good,A Typical Day at work is coming into work with a positive attitude and a smile ready to work. Work hard no playing around. The most important thing to do is take care of as many veterans authorizations as accurately as possible in a day. When help is needed a lead or supervisor will assist. The Job is easy but daily changes makes it hard to meet production.
good,"Good place to work. Great employees.  Flex schedule,  When overtime is required they provide breakfast and/or lunch.  Monthly drawings for the top empoyee"
good,"Health Net is a great organization. If you work hard and show ambition you will find there are plenty of opportunities. However, nothing will be handed to you; you will have to earn everything and keep all bridges intact. Most in management are very helpful and willing to share their knowledge."
good,"Good Place to work, pay for gym membership. Culturally diversed."
good,I've learned various systems. Deals with a vast cultural group of folks. Ive learned to be a team player and multitasking is essential.
good,"Good place to work at. "
good,"In the initial interview management told me the position I was interviewing was guaranteed with a secured contract for 10 years.  However, 7 months into the program per management the entire program/position had been eliminated."
good,"Pretty good company to work for when under Health Net Banner. the pay was 15 hour, with benefits. benefits where not great but okay if you have a small family."
good,"Just started working here for a month and apparently before the end of training (which is a month long period) they were firing people left and right for really petty and unnecessary reasons. It is a good job with the best pay I have ever had in my entire life of working, but job security definitely isn't there, so if you are looking for a stable position or need to support yourself/family, I would look elsewhere that can guarantee you job security."
good,Health net was a great job I LOVED my coworkers they are all amazing supervisors leads and all. We had  TON of potlucks great bonus but the job is soooo unstable especially because you have to start as a temp and they keep extending contracts and never actually hire anyone so its just playing with fire. You never now if your contracts actually going to end and if you will be jobless. :(
good,Health Net has a fast paced work environment. Different departments have different rules which I don't believe is fair when everyone works for the same company.  Health Net offers career advancement opportunities. Flex time is offered which works great for working parents.  Dress code is relaxed.  Many of the Management team members have their favorite employees and they refuse to discipline them when they break the rules. Extensive on the job training is provided.
good,Typical day at work working on claims not everyday. You have your own cubicle and lots of space. Co workers sometimes bring in goodies for the staff and sometimes mgt it just depends. Supervisor will hand you claims for you to do on a daily basis but sometimes you might not get any.
good,Never had any issues with this company.  The teams and leadership were great and the work was very interesting.  I would recommend this company to all individuals.
good,"My dept is being separated from the company, there are positions that can be applied for from within, I have applied for 64, and keep getting same answer, someone is more qualified, what does that mean? I am jus as good as some, not as good as others, and better then a few, how does my qualifications not fit, when a temp agency is willing to hire me for positions within the company I keep getting rejected for....."
good,I learned credentialing with the Provider Services department and the Credentialing Department with Health Net.  I say working here helped with my career.
good,"Slow paced, last minute announcements about overtime over the week and weekend overtime. My pay dropped when I became a permanent worker by .50. Systems would not work most of the time."
good,"They give you in-depth training so you are fully prepared for your role.  Management is great, very supportive and engaging.  The only problem for me was the schedule I was stuck on and the distance from my home, which proved to be too difficult for me."
good,Enjoyable.lots of opportunity for advancement. Teaching and mentoring new representatives.very well organized. Overall a great place to work staff is very helpful.
good,"If you need something to help you progress in life and get you started this is a great place to start. The hours are fair and the pay is enough to get you where you want to go until you find the wanted job or you move up in the company. management is okay, I feel they can be a little worldly rather than professional and that conflicts with judgement as gossip becomes existent and what not but such is inevitable in any work space."
good,I enjoyed this job. I learned a lot and seen there is room to advance. I would enjoy returning to Health Net. The management was nice and helpful. The Manager was very knowledgeable.
good,Work at home position with approximately 90% travel to medical groups.  Annual audits of each group for UM processes and ongoing education and review.
good,"Everyone, managers and co-workers always friendly and helpful.  The training overall could have been more organized, but, then maybe because of the type of job position, it wasn't always possible.  The job duties could change daily, which increased the stress levels, which to me, the pay did not match the job functions required."
good,"Healthnet is a temporary job thru Kelly Services.  I would like to have a permanent job.  At times, things can be hectic.  There are some nice people that work there and I enjoy working with them."
good,"Decent place to work but not well paid and a place to move up in your career. There is a decent life balance.  Good place to work for workers that just want to do their time, but if you have ambition and want to move up, its not a good place to be."
good,It was a good dept to work for until there did so many changes in the upper management and brought in some people who were not really team players.  But this was so long ago that I'm sure things are so different now.
good,"It is a good starting point not enough to live on and a lot of work. The ppl make the job, there is favoritism displayed towards the people they like. Work ethic should speak for itself not always the case."
good,"I like the location and the benefits of working with this company.  I learned more from the team leaders, only because the manager of credentialing is inexperienced and micro-managers which makes working there a little toxic and stressful.  Other than that, good company with good benefits.   I would like to see the company get more in tuned with their associates and improve work-life day to day."
good,answering customer needs and assisting providers as needed to become a part of tricare insurance. management is very cooperative and understanding of scheduling needs.
good,"Great Company to work for and always ways to better your skills. In the various departments there is, there is so much growth happening everyday."
good,I have an awesome supervisor so my department is pretty good. Everyone is self-management so it makes the job easier. The best part is the potluck. Everyone in Quality Assurance Dept love good homemade food.
good,Foundation Health transitioned to the Health Net name back in 1999. As a result I have been working for health net through that beginning of change.
good,The best thing I have done professionally-as far as using my clinical skills to serve my country!  Our military is the greatest!
good,"Typical work day jump on the phones and calls coming in back to back, Fast paced work environment, learn new things everyday, Helpful team mates always coming together to figure out a solution to the customers problems."
good,"Health Net always had a scale issue so our budgets were alway tight. In spite of that the associates at Health Net made it a very successful company, especially during health care reform. Leadership was smart and inventive. "
good,Company is energetic and recently purchased by Centene. Centene is getting a lot of expertise and will benefit immensely.
good,"I presently serve as an operator in the Call Center as management wanted the referral person to be clinical. I answer 100 to 150 calls daily. I process calls from homeless, less fortunate clients in distress. I have an appreciation for management as they have shown me kindness due to my work ethics. I enjoy my co-workers as we work as a team.  The hardest part of my job is when I am unable to help patients due to lack of staffing. Helping patient receive the necessary medical care weather it is insurance processing, transferring a call, or making appointments. "
good,"if you work in the call center be prepared for a lot of changes from day to day and also to be able to take multiple calls in a day.  There are very few breaks so ensure you do your work while on the call to ensure less down/call work time.  management is ""ok"" it changes a lot so be be flexible.  sometimes the co-workers can be gossipy but that comes with being a call center job.  the hardest part of my job is trying to never get ""tired"" of it.  its a lot of the same thing over and over so be prepared."
good,A great place for someone with a lot of time and energy. Lots of mandatory overtime. Breakfast served most Saturdays and fun around the holidays. Hard work and decent pay.
good,"typical- talked to providers"
good,Great team to work with.  Learned what the insurance companies go through from paying a claim to retrieving money form an incorrectly paid claim.
good,"Continual change made it interesting, no two days were ever the same."
good,I enjoyed my job because I enjoyed the work I did. It was a fast paced busy medical office. I had a lot of great co workers that were fun and hard working. Hardest part of job was hunting down the paper charts when someone did not check them out properly.
good,"As stated in my resume, I was able to have alot of responsibility for my job. The hardest part of the job is to match the ever changing goals of the owner."
good,"Working with wonderful people"
good,"Health Net is a frugal, no-nonsense company that aggressively pursues new health insurance contracts for both government and commercial programs."
good,It was a fun and interesting place to work. I was just sad that my department was cut.
good,"I learned alot about health insurance."
good,I loved being a part of the Provider Services Dept. We worked as a team and my coworkers all respected each other and management. Everyone's input was considered and appreciated. 
good,Enjoyed working with the group at Healthnet great atmosphere.
good,processing 25 cases for health care services for Military Tricare Active duty service members and their families.
good,"Working at Health Net was a rewarding experience. Health Net, Inc as a company demanded your bring your A game to work with you everyday. Office was a fast paced environment which demanded 100 % to detail and multi tasking was a must."
good,Health Net was a great company to work for when it came to leadership and the teams. They did not always pay workers fairly and tend to overlook those who work there for a long time.
good,"I worked at Healthnet in 2012-2015 best years of my life bitter sweet ( since my mom passed away in 2013 while working at HN);  I regret leaving in 2015 , would probably still be there 😞😒"
good,This job was good because it offered opportunity for growth something that is often looked for in a career. I probably would have stayed in this position if I did not have to move.
good,I enjoy remote utilization review using the Inter Qual.  The associates were very team oriented.  The company was flexible with work life balance.  It was an enjoyable experience.
good,"The co-workers I worked with made the job fun and entertaining. The position I was in made it difficult for you to advance without having a degree. My original manager was fun, easy going and didn't micro-manage his employees."
good,"It was a pretty good job.  The pay was excellent for this area.  There was a merge or buy out of the company and a change in region pretty much at the same time.  It was horrible- programs didn't work right, information wasn't transferred.  It was really hard to have customers on hold for more than 1/2 hour or so and not be able to help them."
good,"i learned to schedule appointments for individuals who fought for our country. very friendly environment. super cool management, flexible with break times."
good,"Health Net is an autonomous workplace which is currently in a growing state will opportunities for growth. As a recently acquired company, there are many changes which proves to be favorable or many."
good,"I loved this job!! I started after being recruited by folks that I talked to from the previous job I held. It was an unbelievably beautiful office after having only worked in hospitals. I had my own cubicle with my name on it. That just blew me away after having been a clinical nurse for so long! So my first glimpse gave me a positive vibe. Then I was given a tour and introduced to the nurses there. Got lots of hugs from the ones I worked with over the phone. That impressed me greatly. Probably against EEOC but we were all females. And it was a long time ago. I was shown my desk by the atrium.  What an awesome thing to have my own cubicle with my name on it. Still have that name tag in front of me at this moment. Reminds me to ""slow down. It will work out. ""  The training I was given by the finest nurses. They gave me a headset that hooked into their phone system and I listened to calls and afterwards was asked what I thought of the call and what questions I had. This went on for about 2-3 wks. Then I had an excellent nurse sit with  me for a week while I took calls. It went well and I was given my wings to fly. I enjoyed it so much. Later I was promoted to a Catastrophic Case Manager, a much coveted job. I was very proficient at computers so I was also given the title of deputy director of IT for utilization management.  I did beta tests for any upgrades before teaching the staff via power point how to use the new upgrade and what the upgrade will do to the workload. I also took over some of the IT help desk functions for the dept since I was very good at getting computers"
good,This was a challenging position but also very rewarding working with veterans made it even more promising knowing that you are serving them for all the hard work they continue to do for us.
good,"Healthcare can be a rough industry to work in due to the competition out there, but Health Net never felt like that.  My time there afforded me many opportunities to meet so many different people with so many different knowledge sets, skills, and backgrounds.  I will always have a special place in my heart for the place that laid the foundation for my career."
good,I was happy to assist the veterans of this country in getting medical care that normally would take months. In this government program I felt as thought I was doing my part in saying thank you for putting your lives in danger to keep the us all safe.
good,Health Net is a prestigous company and fun working with.  Our job got out sourced and have to leave the company. With my 12 years at this company I receive a yearly appraisal increase due to my good performance.My peers acknowledge my help and assistance in work related and was awarded as the ITG Star of the month.
good,But have no time for my family and others who are the same level got earlier shifts than those who got promoted first and that is disheartening. Very hard to deal with someone who won't budge and promoted her besties.
good,"However there are employees forgetting we are to be providing services to our military veterans, NOT JUST GET A PAYCHECK.  The jobs we perform can sometimtes be life or death situations and that's nothing to play with."
good,Overall a decent company to work for. Some managers are more knowledgeable than others. Hard to get promoted. Some of the computer software was out dated.
good,I am employed at under HealthNet through Kelly Services. The job experience is one of a kind and the company has a lot of room for advancement. It is a place where you can grow and develop professionally.
good,Clock in with an enthusiastic smile. Find the value in lessons taught. There are some remarkable people there but be sure to stay clear of the one's who seem to have nothing constructive or uplifting to say. Day to day assigned task are simple if one has mastered basic key traits. Focus on solutions not problems.
good,"It is a great entrly level position. The staff and patients are enjoyable. The job duties are very standard medical office duites, but very busy office. There is not alot of room for advancement. Policies make it highly difficult to balance home life and work especially with young children at home."
good,"There is not a typical day in this role, everyday is different, from conference call, to field time to handling service issues. I learned a lot in this position from the product, to the competition. The hardest part of the job was time management the best part was my team and clients we served."
good,Typical day is arriving at work following up on emails. Dealing with high call volume.Very demanding regarding assisting current associates and de escalating calls. Allot of follow up work needed. Associates feel not very supported.
good,Loved everything about the position.  Unfortunatly I got very ill and had to step down so as not to impose a time constraint for the deadline.
good,"Great M,D,F benefits and 401k match, but always worrying about the next contract in Health Net Federal Services. You always worry about not having a job every 4 years due to the government contracting. Recently, merit increases were frozen due to budgeting issues with the strict government contract guidelines. The best part about working at health net is the Tuition Reimbursement program."
good,"typical day: confidential individual counseling with target audience., workshops related to deployment and dealing with life, briefing of troop, families and senior leadership"
good,"Work loads were fair. Management at the time did not seem well trained, but some stood out. Co-workers were great, with caution as most places. Working typically was pleasant."
good,Great learning experience. No room for advancement in company. Great to work hand in hand with great doctors and residents. Great opportunity to advance in learning skills.
good,"Employees and Managers are great to work with."
good,"hasmedical , dental ,vision  benefits , pay was good and  had a lot of overtime to make more income had a chance to be in 2 different depts and learned alot, can move throught out company"
good,"Health Net was a great company to work for I loved it , the environment was laid back but competitive management was very supportive, they company provided lunch for all employees when certain goals where met."
good,The hardest part of the job is the traveling to and from work daily. The cost of gas and wear and tear on my car. I do not feel that I an advance here.
good,I enjoyed working with many Vets that were also employees.  Most of all I loved being able to make appointments  with the providers and being able to call the Vet to assure they where receiving the car they needed
good,"A 5:30AM start to the work day starts with email and production outlines. From there on to quality review of Contact Center Associate member interactions prior to a 8AM Team Meeting to discus the days approach, trends and focal points.. After the meet the Team remains for an offline session to see everyone is on track and who my need some help with getting up to speed on quality reviews. The offline talks assures and reinforces team bonds.  Before turning things down for the day return to emails from management for any updates, policy changes and or amendments that will effect the following work day."
good,Learning new corporate culture with the acquition of Health Net. Change is sometimes difficult and finding your place in that change is a must. The culture at Health Net currently requires agility and a willingness to be able he driver of you own success.
good,"The company was in transition when I left employment and I do not feel I am able to give accurate review at this time.When I worked at Health Net Pharmaceutical, it was very nice place to work."
good,typical call center. I learned a lot since i started and i am now a new me thanks to all the challenges i ve faced here.it is amazing to work in a nice enviroment despite all the stress we have been through to achieve all our goals
good,"The A&G Department was a very professional and collaborative environment. The people I was hired with felt like family, and the team I was on was a great group of people to work with. I only left to relocate to another state. Would go back!"
good,"Managers walked around, trying to get people to work faster with less mistakes, very little interaction with other employees. No feedback from managers on production quality."
good,"Management was pretty good, they tend to show appreciation for hard work.  Work/Life balance is fairly good as PTO's are approved as long as it does not hinder production."
good,A typical day at work would include everyone working together for one purpose:  to ensure timely and convenient access to Medical care.  We all have the same goal and strive to maintain that goal on a daily basis.
good,Health Net is a good place to work.  The work is complicated but once learned it is very fulfilling. I enjoy working with a diverse group of representatives knowing that they are doing their best to help our veterans.
good,Work day would consist of developing claims and requesting information from providers over the phone and via fax. Would sent received info to medical review department for auth approval
good,"The work was fairly easy, even though it could changed at the drop of a dime. The only thing that I didn't like about it was since I was temporary, I wasn't able to get raises and didn't have vacation time."
good,I have been very happy with my career to date at Health Net.  Management is very supportive of the growth of their employees and promotes a strong work life balance.
good,Answer between 70 and 100 calls per day in a call center environment. Job duties include processing prior authorizations and referrals. Also enrollment activities such as plan and primary care provider changes.
good,"Great place to learn and perfect new skills."
good,All and all not a bad company to work for. I have veterans in my family so it was easy for me to take on the job knowing that I could help others and their families with their medical care.
good,"Since being purchased by Centene Corporation, a lot of the company is in flux.  From systems to constant reorganization of business area set up.  They say they are finished for now, but who knows if/when it will be done again."
good,"Overall, a good company to work for.  They weren't always willing to make changes to their processes or adopt different ways.  Good pay and benefits but very little promotion opportunities."
good,It was my first job right out of undergrad. My manager was the only highlight I had from my experience within HealthNet. She was thoughtful and honest about what to expect from my position. No growth unless I stayed for atleast 5 years. No thanks!
good,"I was laid off, and have no knowledge of the current work conditions or company culture.  I enjoyed worker for Health Net, and my coworkers."
good,Health Net is a very highly productive place to work. I enjoy my work. My management appreciate my hard work and very supportive. My co-worker are very friendly and supportive too. Within the last four months I have learned a lot while processing claims about prior authorization requirements. Unfortunately my work schedule is not working with my family as I hope prior taking this job. Hence I am looking for either part time or full time regular shift day job.
good,"The services provided to military personnel and their family members  is essential for assisting in productive communication, improved relationships and managing job stress.  Additionally, we provide psycho-educational presentations in support of command which cover topic's such as deployment, stress and anger management, parenting and marriage counseling.  Our services help military personnel and their families obtain the help they need on military installations when they do not fit the criteria for mental health services, however are in need of support services."
good,At Health Net the company is dedicated to ensure that the clients are beyond satisfied and that every request is met. The proper training is provided to the representatives to provide that service to it's clients.
good,Health Net is a solid company with excellent benefits.  Advancement opportunities prevail in most departments.  Communication between most departments is a plus.  Great work/life balance most of the time.
good,I was alone I would go to different post offices o drop off and icky up express mail. So did not have much interaction with other employees.
good,"Health Net has been a great place for me. I was able to start as a CSR1 taking calls assisting providers only and through the years have gained the needed information to become a trainer. "
good,This is a great company if it was not because they will start outsourcing I would retire from this company.
good,"Laid back, but yet productive at the office with Eligibility Rep. I learned alot about the Affordable Care Act, and HIPPA, Critical fields. I enjoyed being at my desk and doing my job, and Enrolling Subscribers, and deps for AZ Small Business Groups. I also enjoyed assisting the Accounting dept with IFP applications, and Credit Card information."
good,"Busy busy busy"
good,The objective was always clear and the team work  was always a plus.
good,"Avergae around 50 to 120 calls per day helping people understand their benefits, but it is a call center, and it can get repetitive. Learned about government policies on state medical programs, learned about medical field and medications. Learned the ins and outs of hospital administration and insurance pricing for services. It can get rather annoying dealing with the plethora of people with complaints, but every now and again you can actually make a difference in some ones life, seriously! As far as coworkers, its friendly, but everybody is work focused in cubicles but it is a steady paycheck and the provider internal training to help advance your career if you plan to grow with the company."
good,In comparison to some of the other jobs I have had it is definitly not as stressful. Not as many opportunities for advancement or increase in compensation but the pros definitly out weigh the cons. Very pleasant place to work. I would recommend it.
good,"The most wonderful thing about working at Health Net was the constant opportunity to fine tune your current skill set and develop new skills. There were many opportunities for advancement, until the company was bought out by another medical insurance carrier. I started as a phone rep for the special accounts division and by the time I left, I was an Account Service Coordinator, having made stops in the claim processing department on the way up. To this day I still actively use the knowledge I gained while working at Health Net."
good,My days were to answer incoming calls regarding insurance concerns. I learned that calls come back to back on a daily. Management overall was pleasant. Hardest part of job was to earn their system Most enjoyable talking to different people
good,"I was responsible for processing authoirzations for procedures and surgeries requested by physicians for their patients. I also answered phone inquiries from physicians and/or their staff about benefits, authorization process and requirements as well as inquiries made by members."
good,"Located in Shelton, Connecticut. It was a good place to work, but no job security."
good,Worked well with Supervisor who was well-approachable. Well organized and continous on process improvement for job performance.
good,"Health net was a great place to be employed at. It was like working in a family environment. Health net was my most loved job, because of my employees and the members."
good,Looking for the best qualified candidates. Training very detailed oriented so pay attention because you will learn at a fast pace. Working there was an experience of a different kind.
good,great company lots of opportunity for growth. Very stable company to work for. Hourly wage is fair. there is overtime available as well. Call center is 24/7 so weekend schedule is available as well.
good,This is a great place to work. I loved it because it was close to my home and the parking was free!  I got paid here every other week direct deposit which was a plus.  The workload at times could be stressful compared to most places.  I loved my co-workers and boss was great. I loved the fact that my manager was NOT a micromanager which seems a rarity in the healthcare industry. My only complaint is the strict requirements for say promotional positions. It is not friendly to someone who may have recently graduated with a particular degree. It seems that HN wants you to leave HN to get experience and come back. They make no attempts to retain their employees which is unfortunate.
good,"Loved my department and colleagues, Great place to work and location. The skills acquired from my last position will be an asset to  transition to a new company.  My position was contractual  and I am no longer with for the company."
good,"The company gave me the opportunity to grow, however with the organization migration the changes have  highly impacted the business in a negative way. The company isn’t doing as well as they thought and it’s impacting job security and benefits."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Health Net and would work there again if given the opportunity.  The culture was good and there was a good amount of flexibility to work remote when needed.  While most meetings were handled over the phone, I still felt as though things got done and issues addressed."
good,"Health Net was a good place to work with excellent people to work with and for. I started as a project manager and the beginning was painful. I had 5 different managers in one year. They organization was struggling to build a 'mature' PMO. Once a path forward was established, I came to thoroughly enjoy in. The work was hard and fast paced but fulfilling. I was able to advance in my career and finally do what I loved - managing and mentoring project managers."
good,"Independent position, able to work from home.  Great pay and PTO accrued hours. Communications regarding change in employee assignments poor as management in several states."
good,"No 2 days are alike. There are so many legislative and regulatory changes, the job keeps you on your toes.  This is a good thing. It makes you think and plan strategically.  It is rewarding and challenging work.  You will grow here!"
good,Overall the Great place to work! The people there are friendly and willing to help. You also get the satisfaction of helping active military members and their families with their benefits.
good,"Health Network America was a third party benefits administrator.   "
good,"Having been with the company a long time, I'v seen a lot of changes over the years.  After we were sold to Centene, the culture changed significantly. Changes are to be expected, but it's not the same.  Management style is much more old school, and micro-managed."
good,good place to work and has growth as long as you work hard at it and become good at what you are doing. Vacation time is accrued per bi weekly pay depending on how long been employed. Benefits are good but severance is tremendously reduced
good,Healthnet was in talks to be sold and on a hiring freeze. The manager was new and rude to temps. I worked hard in hopes of being hired permanently but then learned of the hiring freeze. I was transferred over to Risk Managment
good,"Health Net is a great place to gain experiences and move up quickly within the company. I went from data entry to processing claims, working on special projects, to a major project with the refunds team and into the congressional team working along side with my lead on high volume projects."
good,It was a good company to work for. At time of lay offs gave me an opportunity to move over to another position with Humana branch at an Army base doing authorizations.
good,"The position I had was mainly working with management  with reporting to make sure the phone staff was doing their job.  There was nothing exciting about going to work, it was a good job and was able to have a work life balance."
good,"Service center handling customer walk-ins with various Tri-care military health insurance concerns.  I learned to multi-task and handle multiple customers concerns back to back.  The immediate management was not very helpful for she felt she didn't need to be concerned with customer affairs and would not take on a customer complaint and would leave for you handle.  I became very strong and confident in my understanding of the program and was able to handle most customer complaints on my own, but this did not encourage the moral of the office.  My most enjoyable part of job was the two ladies I worked with and the bond we had since our manager wasn't that present, and I always enjoy helping the customers."
good,"Great place to learn about the business. Learning environment, not too much opportunity, team work, job security, nice people to work with. overall, it's a nice place"
good,Health Net was recently bought by a company named Centene. The culture is changing and it seems that Centene doesn't value constructive criticism or even just plain old good ideas like Health Net used to. Generally the people that work there are good people to work with. Only time will tell how Centene will change the culture.
good,Given many opportunities to learn and grow.  Board of directors were very supportive. Most staff were volunteers and truly dedicated to caring for those less fortunate.
good,"Very quiet and a great place to focus on work. The hardest part of the job was not being able to ask for help during certain times of the day, but did contribute to being able to concentrate on production."
good,"Great place to work. Senior Management/Tampa Location are disconnected with processes."
good,The management and supervisors were often on the same page but did occasionally butt heads. The atmosphere was usually enjoyable.
good,"Seems like you never really know what is going on publically with the company, and the CSR's are the ones who have to deal with it. You log in, and take phone calls, without any update with what may have happened the day beforehand or not. Training is a blast, and the workplace is what you make it. The hardest part of the job would be getting blindsided by rushes and 200+ calls in queue and being blamed for not being productive enough, yet the most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfying feeling of helping those truly in need of your help."
good,"Ive enjoyed working at HealthNet very much, unfortunatly they are going through some changes are not providing job security."
good,"A typical day at work would be signing into my computer, and then bringing up every program I have to use for that day. I would check my emails first to see what my assignments were, then work all day on my documents and add them to a production tracker so my supervisors can see the work i'm producing. The co workers, and management are great. They're very hands on and there for you if you need help with anything."
good,"Great group of people to work with (total of 10 at TRICARE Service Center) . Team oriented . I enjoyed working with the military, talking to them face to face and helping them with the health care needs."
good,"They mostly care about sales, sales, and more sales. They usually care about numbers and not so much work quality."
good,"I review claim after claim to make sure that they were processed correctly whether they are paid or denied. That they meet all compliances, policies and producures.  That the provider contracts were applied correctly. "
good,"Fun place to work, though getting raises is really tough. Many people have been leaving as of recent because HN is not willing to compensate their employees well enough. It's mutually beneficial I suppose: employees move on to higher paying jobs, HN hires people at a low cost. "
good,This company held a major federal contact and administered it for MFLCS in 50 states with efficiency. An excellent opportunity for me the entire time I worked the program from the first day it was implemented in Indiana until the contract ended.
good,"A good place to work due to the employees teamwork. Location is good, HIGH security, both digital and physical. We did a lot of good things for our troops through the TriCare programs."
good,"Work is cyclical, there are slow periods than periods of extremely heavy volume. Someone with project management skills is needed for the job I have. "
good,Streess to much on numbers and they seem to forget we are only human after all.  Management seems to have lost empathy.
good,"Working for this company had its stressful and busy days. It was a lot of phone calls and report writing. Everyone worked well together and as a team. If there was something you weren't sure about, they had no problems teaching you."
good,I like working close to home. I enjoy the challenge that each day brings with new problems to solve and intellegent people to work with.
good,"I looked forward to go to work every day- Loved my job and the people I worked with all around ( internally and externally) - Enjoyed leading the Account Management team, supporting the Sales Executives and providing excellent customer service to our Members and Clients."
good,"It was an excellent place to work, it was not just a job the we were a family, we were a team. Everyone worked together to create a positive experience for the customer. A typyical day at work was upbeat and energetic, never a dull moment, taking over 60 calls per day, each call would be a different experience. The hardest part of my day was when I had to inform a patient/parent that I could not resolve an issue or could not give a definitive answer for their question/issue, i.e. why is an authorization not approved for serv imperative services that they need rendered. The most enjoyable and satisfying part of my day was knowing that I resolved an issue for the customer on the other end of the line, from the simplest to the most complex issue at hand."
good,HNFS was a good place to work prior to the deep cuts and outsourcing.
good,I reconciled the billing for 1200+ accounts.
good,"On a daily basis will review what needs to be done via system queues,emails or scheduled itinerary.."
good,"Health Net (Centene Corp) is a high growth company with much opportunity for advancement.  The culture is a work in progress as they do many mergers and acquisitions and are still figuring out that piece.  If you are looking for a solid career and opportunities for career advancement, this is a great place to work."
good,"Our company has its challenges, but what we do for those who serve and protect our country is what makes it worthwhile. Now we are a subsidiary of Centene Corporation, the largest Medicaid company in the country. Having the backing of a Fortune 500 company (#61) is a benefit and it will only get better as we understand how to best integrate Centene's State Medicaid capabilities with our Federal Government health care contracts.  HNFS is the only Federal Government contracting."
good,Very fast pace work environment. Plenty of overtime. Able to advance with the company. The only downside is the pay is not suitable or fair with other health insurance companies.
good,"Realizar seguimiento continuo frente a las necesidades que presentan los diferentes clientes en la ciudad de Medellín, recordar al cliente la importancia de realizar los pagos oportunos según la propuesta acordada, velar por la entrega de las moléculas dentro de los tiempos de respuesta de la compañía, verificar constantemente el flujo de rotación de las moléculas en consignación y toma de inventarios."
good,Healthnet always offers overtime for everyone whether you are perm or temporary. Its a great company to have on your resume and you do learn a lot about insurance. I worked hard to make it to my management position today and anyone can do it if you work hard enough.
good,HealthNet is a good company to work for. The only downfall is when it's contract time you don't know what the outcome will be whether they will win the contract or any changes to to employment.
good,"I had a lot of fun, it was very close to home so that was definitely a plus. they had a great food truck/farmers market option on certain days of the week."
good,I worked with a lot of numbers it was a mentally stimulating job. Coworkers were always team players and willing to assist when possible. My experience there was a great one and recommend this job.
good,The annual bonus was nice.  I don't mind working at Health Net but the pay could be better.  Some departments are toxic due to old timers with a negative attitude that make the job harder for others around them.
good,A typical day on the phones always. Giving health benefits to military families. Enrollment in plans. Changing primary care doctors and searching for doctors.
good,"Employees are generally great. Managers are generally pretty cool, though strict. Driven to work hard by not always appreciated (or appreciated in minimalistic ways). Overall can feel like ""just another job."""
good,"The best part of the job was communicating with people and being able to solve their problems. Typically calls were supposed to be completed in as short a time as possible, but sometimes people needed to vent, so judgements had to be made. I learned that people love it when you put them first. It makes them feel valued. Management was very supportive always there to help when needed. "
good,"My immediate manager was a ROCK STAR.  The others, eh not so much.  Enjoyed my time with the company.  Unfortunately, the corporate headquarters wasn't as helpful, and bolluxed up the contract, which resulted in a closing of our facility and a layoff of all of the people... damned shame actually...."
good,"I have almost 20 years of work experience in finance/accounting.  These experiences has given me the skills and knowledge to work independently; while being a major contributor to team I work with and help the company meets it goals.  "
good,"Excellent company with many good benefits.Family oriented and excellent salary.Friendly atmosphere,with great working conditions.Good Leaders and managers."
good,"Overall, it's a good place to work at. I been with Health Net for 3 years and there was no room for advancement within the department. It was hard to transfer to a different department."
good,Excellent Manager. Several raises given in the short time I was there. Excellent salary and family time given for vacations and holidays. Advancement potential was not there due to contract end date.
good,"I enjoyed working with Health Net to reach the company goals.  I had a wonderful Director who was flexible, understood the home and work life balance, and was kind.   A lot of changes has taken place at Health Net since I left, so I could not give an updated status of the company as far as comparing it to when I left, however; I am sure it is still a good company, they continue to grow and do not have a big turnover.  I would be willing to go back as an employee with Health Net."
good,"Nice place to work.  Most managers and colleague are friendly and helpful.  The firewalls are annoying when trying to do your job, but at the same time happy they are in place to protect me and other members,"
good,"Lots of challenges, opportunities for growth. A rather intense place to work but if you can handle pressure well, personally and professionally rewarding."
good,"come in to work, and hop right into working assignments; calling providers, requesting medical records. processing, medical documents and attaching to the appropriate veterans authorization. meeting daily Quota of 18 documents a hour. I learned a lot about veterans and the need for care, and what I am doing makes a difference. makes the providers happy which makes the veterans happy and which makes the VA happy as well. The hardest part of the job is doing the mandatory OT of 12 hours a week on top of your 40 hours, and still trying to balance your home life with family and children. The most enjoyable part about the job is the peace of mind it brings. with a quiet and calm work place."
good,"Worked with amazing people who  made the job enjoyable.   Bosses were hit or miss - some were awesome, some were awful.   Bought out 2 years ago and the new company is laying off lots of people.   No job security."
good,Health Net had a great team of management and it was a lot of fun to work there.  There was a life and work balance.  The company allows for advancement and it does provide good compensation.
good,"Things are pretty much even keel here. The environment is professional, good-natured, and most people seem to have a sense of humor. Hard-work and determination are encouraged here and rewarded."
good,This place is as professional as can be. Management has its moments. The company is so big that if you are looking for advancement there is always another department.
good,I love my job but I am looking to promote within the company. I would recommend Health Net to anyone who is looking for a great career and to work for a company that is growing in the industry.
good,"insurance based job with production environment, flexible work hours with medical, dental and vision. independent work and lots of research to complete claims."
good,"Answering the incoming calls, preparing the reports, assisting the transition coordinators-RN.,LVN. Must work as a team player. I worked with little or no supervision.  Multi cultural work place. The hardest part of the job was trying to accomplish everything in 8 hours."
good,Working in health Net is fun get to meet new people and your co-workers will help you if you need help. sometimes the call can be stressful but learn new things about health insurance.
good,I have worked with health net for about a year now I can say that I am impressed with the level of commitment that Health net has towards its members and staff.
good,this is a good company to work for potlucks every week.. advancement after a year of working kinda sucks and every person hired after is getting paid more
good,This company is a very diverse work life oriented vibe. Its a great start for hard work and call center advancement. This company will show you things you never paid attention to before. These things can be used in more than one aspect in the work world.
good,I truly enjoyed working for Health Net. I felt the product they provided was a great product. Having my job taken to India was the only bad thing that happened.
good,"Typical day of work included mostly of being on the phones and helping beneficiaries with their insurance plans, assisting with authorizations and referrals, ports, primary dr changes, and escalated calls. This job has taught me how to deal with people when you are not face to face with them, how to adjust to a certain situation using the policies and procedures.  Management is good at making sure we have everything we need to do our jobs well, and leanding a personal touch to our daily routiene.  Because we work in a call center people tend to cluster in certain areas to find friends. It's never hard to be friendly but not the place for lasting small talk. The thing I enjoy most is being able to help a beneficiary in need with their proble, on the other had the hardest part of my job is to give bad news and tell people they can't do something or that it will not be covered."
good,my typical day at work was always utilizing my job skills acquired over the years in trying to accomplish one stop call resolutions with members and providers within the managed medical care health plan industry on a daily basis.  These tasks would entail updating primary care doctor changes for both members and providers along with updating medical groups.
good,Staying alert at all times and doing foot patrols. I learned a lot about this company. My co-workers were great. Hardest part of this job was trying to stay awake during grave yard shifts. The enjoyable part of this job was the small various and cultural events they had.
good,The workers and supervisors are fun and as helpful as they can be.  They have potlucks and competitive activities to make the job of call center rep. as bearable as possible for everyone.
good,Health Net has a very diverse work environment. I would recommend others to apply to this company. Managers and upper managements are very professional and are always willing to listen with the open door policy.
good,"This was my first exposure in medical field, I really learned a lot about how the whole health plan and related services coalesce."
good,"Processed and reviewed individual and business State Income Tax Returns using tax software to detect errors.  Processed suggested corrections and sent reports to audit review section for further action.  Helped taxpayers file personal income taxes via the telephone.  Responded to inquiries regarding income tax issues.  Typing, filing, and other duties as assigned."
good,The environment is relatively friendly except auditors are always on each rep's back listening and evaluating like crazily picking mistakes!
good,"Healthnet provides me a nice working environment"
good,"Really enjoyed working for Health Net Federal Services, they really treat their employees good.  Potential for growth was good."
good,"Typical work day was 7:30 -4 and 40 hrs a week. Learned about Military health benefits and how to administer and brief to ADSM, retirees and their families.

good,typical day is fast paced and productive. management organized and helps when you need them. coworkers always help each other and learn from one another. most enjoyable part is education members.
good,"Typical day can be answering member and provider calls, Researching members issues regarding billing, claims, prescriptions, etc. For the most part not many mangers micro manage. Which is a good thing to have a good work day. Typical employees. You have the gossipers, you have the noisy and you have the weirdos. If you keep to yourself and just do what your suppose to do  your good to go... Now healthnet is not the most organize company far as having their stuff togethere.  Competition totally beats Healthnet far as technology, training and having answers to problems right away.  Healthnet has many locations Glendale, Huntington Beach, Woodland Hills, Etc.

Certain tasks had to be completed every shift, but you never knew if after you did the daily narcotic count, and stocked the aircraft, if you would sit for 24 hours, or fly non-stop without bathroom or dinner breaks. I learned that when it was meal time if we were at station you ate, even if you weren't hungry. I learned to trust my instinct more, and my partner. My co-workers were the only people I had to run things by if I felt uncomfortable, or to ask for help when I was unsure of which medication to use, etc. The hardest part of the job was being completely independent and relying solely on my partner and state wide protocols. The best part of the job was the view in route to where ever we went. I had the opportunity to see most of the state of West Virginia and Ohio from the air."
good,Excellent call center that always tried to answer all calls on time and to provide good customer service
good,"A typical day at the service center was extremely busy. There was very little down time, and all issues were high priority. My service area was very large and as a result, I spent a good portion of the year traveling.  I was responsible for educating members regarding their health plan benefits as well as conducting educational seminars for medical providers and hospitals.  I was also responsible for researching complicated issues regarding claims, referrals, grievances, and contractual payment issues. I enjoyed working independently but was fortunate to work with a small team of people who genuinely cared about each other. Since we were all responsible for our own areas, there was never the competition you might see at other companies.  "

The managers are great, consistent and flexible. My coworkers are great and very supportive and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the day? Hum! It's hard to say. Too busy to determine. The most enjoyable part of the day would have to be knowing that I was able to get the members needs met, although every call is different and some members you can't do anything for them. Overall Health Net is a great place to work."
good,Awesome place to work and grow among various skilled consultant
good,"A typical day at work was processing and enrolling Active Duty Service Members and their families to their regional Primary Care Manager according to where the soldier was stationed and making sure their TRICARE insurance was current and up to date, which included their demographic information as well. My co-workers were a great team to work with. They were always willing to assist each other if one needed help.

good,"Great benefits package.  Diverse and inclusive workforce. Management believes in ""open door"" policy. Convenient office location with walking trail and bay views!"
good,"Expected to be very punctual and great attendance is expected. Training provided is good, overwhelming at first but great trainers. They do their best to prepare you for a regular day. Cafeteria is decent. Having security on site feels reassuring. Loved the team culture, especially on holidays / events, although sometimes you run into employees who have sour faces but for the most part everyone is nice. Always willing to lend a hand.. Always having lunch potlucks with your team or as a whole company. I regret not being able to continue, overall great place to work for those who are dedicated and learn to enjoy the job."

good,"Health Net was a great place to work. I had advanced  quickly into a new department after only be in my hired positioned for a year. Great people to work with, never had a problem going to management with issues. Since I left 4 years ago, another company Centene has taken over the Arizona portion of Health Net. I left before this happened so I am unable to give you that feedback.  I only left due to relocating to Texas."
good,"good place to work, great pay and benefits, good leadership, however my program is ending and now looking for another job, I would have stayed till retirement"

good,"You have to have a lot of patience as for any customer service jobs. "
good,"I left in 2015. and I was willing to go back, but cant seem to get my foot in the door. I left on good terms and was a dedicated employee. very reliable, and great customer service. I left the phones to take a claims examiner job, and was promoted."
good,My typical day was always fast paced and my management team was great. My team got along very well with each other and we always helped each other out.

If you needed time to get your work done you can get that time to get work done. In times of high volume everyone would help out and get the numbers where they needed to be."
good,This company is very fast paced and views goals as very important. I have learned how to manage my work quickly and efficiently. I have learned to handle stress in the work environment and use that to my advantage. What I find most enjoyable about my job is that I am actively working to help our veterans in any way I can.

good,I cash and verify insurance and register patients all day. co workers are amazing . I learn new things about my job everyday. The patients are always friendly and love the environment we provide while they are here.
good,"You are asked to do specific tasks, and you are usually left to do those tasks on a daily baisis. Each person has different abilities and duties. "
good,"The job is relatively easy if you are a patient individual. Take your calls, do your work and you're basically good to go. As long as your talk time is meeting goal you shouldn't have any problems. The benefits for permanent employees are substantial and job security for permanent employees is virtually guaranteed. Some of the people that have become permanent are questionable but I would understand why they were chosen. The hardest part of the job is the learning curve. There is so much information as a customer contact center representative that you are required to know that it can be overwhelming at times, but eventually you know things like the back of your hand, which is to be expected. Best part is probably the facility, the relative independence if you are doing a good job and the education you get. I say education because learning about the ins and outs of health insurance is something that will benefit you for the rest of your life."
good,"The work environment is nice. I could able to work with interest. Even working hard, There is no much recognition."

good,Fast paced call center environment that requires well developed computer skills. Critical thinking and problem solving environment as well as a excellent customer service skills.
good,Inbound call center for Military and Family members to provide hospital and prescription authorizations for care.
good,"My days at HealthNet were extremely busy with multiple tasks to accomplish everyday. Because I had such a large area to service, most of my day was spent interacting with medical providers and hospitals regarding payment issues, claims, contract inconsistencies, policies, procedures and education regarding correct billing practices. Although some of the issues were complex in nature, I enjoyed the research and working with my team to correct the problems at a systemic level to prevent future payment inconsistencies. I throughly enjoyed developing and maintaining positive working relationships with inside and outside customers, and felt that the providers in my service area could depend on me to do a good job. Because all issues crossing my desk where ""hot"" issues, it was sometimes difficult to determine which issue to focus on first.  I set a deadline for each issue and 90% of the time was able to achieve this goal.  "

good,I was blessed the 20 years I worked for HN. I worked for great management teams in all the positions I held. The work is challenging and stressful but I loved my job and colleagues. We were a great bunch and will always have fond memories. I am relocating to another state and am sad to leave my job & associates behind. :( HN is not perfect but they do strive to be a great company in the things they do for their employees. The only reason I do not give the company 5 stars is because I believe there is always room for improvement.
good,My role was a part of a contract that was created fairly quickly. Lots of changes occurred over the three years overall compensation was fair.  Work life balance was fair. Benefit package was really good. Insurance plan was affordable

They enabled me to participate in any workshops that was related to my work.  I am proud to say I endured the many changes in management and ownership from a non-profit to a for profit company."
good,Healthnet was set up to serve the medically undeserved. The medical staff was excellent and the team work was strong. The organization did all they could to help those that fell within the charter.
good,Health was an excellent place to wok.  I was allowed to do my job with min. supervision.  there were excellent benefits and compensation was reasonable.
good,Office was a place to enjoy yourself and have fun while getting the job done. The hardest part of the job was the long commute and feeling like you were away from your family a lot. During my long tenure there I had the opportunity to work with a lot of diverse people. Learned quite a bit while working there. You could say I grew up working for Health Net.
good,I was employed from 1998 until company closed in 2011. Employee benefits were great. Flexible work schedule was a advantage compared to other companies.

Enjoyable part of the job helping our military families succeed on understanding their benefits."
good,"A typical work day was 40-70 inbound calls, depending on the week day, from members regarding their health benefits.  Calls also included Providers checking on the status of claims."
good,"Except for the ""you can't get promoted if you don't know the right people"" this job was a great job. There were too many clicks of supervisors that favored certain people for promotion."
good,"Great Contract I worked on . Wish I could've stayed. I loved the people I worked with. There was always work to be done , however we all worked together to execute special projects that were presented as well .
