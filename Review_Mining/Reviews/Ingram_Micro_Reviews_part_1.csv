bad,They dont pay on time I had to wait 3 weeks before I got paid and its suck people aren't good and security team sucks that's why I got fired because they were racist.
bad,Great co-workers and other employees. Hard Working and knowledgeable. Terrible management across the board. Meat grinder feel from them and only employing temps so they can treat them like slaves and they know there will be another slave to replace you when you decide your fed up with the treatment.
bad,The Ops manager cares more about drama then he cares about his employees I would not recommend anyone for this job. Benefits are great. But the people there have real big issues.
bad,Worked there for a few years in Witney was great to start with then totally poor management and no care for long term workers who had put there all into the company the positive side was some of the workers who worked their.
bad,Everything is siloed at Ingram Micro. Programming on their web site has way too much overlap. Basically each page on the site is developed by a different team. Each does its own custom coding. Communication between teams is via one person touch points who are non-technical.
bad,"If you like being exploited, ingram is the place for you. A truly awful experience from start to finish. Would not suggest to anyone to get a job there."
bad,Unfair job practices low pay for work Substandard  management. Owed me back pay would not honor my claim. Revolving door workplace. Management does nothing to help you.
bad,"If you are NOT white don't think you are going to succeed in that company. Managers suck. The raciest place on Earth to work at. Poor planning, poor management. If you need something to get out of the hole it'll be a good place to stack your money up. But once you got it. RUN AWAY !! They will make your life miserable, and if you don't suck on your boss' toes, you ain't gonna make it"
bad,"Racist, Childish, And Rude. They Wrongly Fire People For Reason And They Let People Get Away With A Lot That's Not Black. It really sucks and they pay sucks"
bad,"A lot of workers there are nice, however management, office workers and security look down on warehouse workers. Talking to you rudely as if you had done something wrong. Unreliable work shifts, wouldn’t have work a lot of the time. Only one small canteen and about 3 toilets. A lot of workers so you always have to wait in line to use toilet. No where to sit in canteen. Overall wouldn’t work here again"
bad,"Chef ist ein idiot, labert ständig den selben Mist, die Mitarbeiter sind ständig schuld für alles , Pausen wurden gekürzt, er selbst stellt sich als unantasbar hin. BR arbeitet Hand i Hand mit der Geschäftsleitung. Teilweise wird unter den Mitarbeiter gelästert über andere, schlechtes Arbeitsklima , schlechte Bezahlung . Never ever"
bad,"Jag skulle aldrig rekommendera någon att jobba för ingram MICRO i Kungsängen/ Brunna."
bad,"It’s was always a mess no organisation what so ever, they don’t respect people I was told I was gonna get a full time job I worked there a year and they still didn’t offer me a contract. "
bad,This place does not care about the associates and their work life balance. They also do not care how long they leave you sit as a temp. The Management doesn't care if you have children they will tell you to stay 4 hours over 10 mins before you leave and then point you if you have to go. There is no communication between upper management and the associates.
bad,"Management is very unprofessional and unorganized. They make last minute decisions or changes and force employees to work fast without proper instructions. My supervisor English was very poor and I  was unable to understand her, and she was very rude. The worse thing about it is that the work you do, doesn't match the pay you get. DON'T WORK HERE!!!"
bad,"Work life... hhmmm yes that's all you will do is live at work. Management has no balance they attempt & are pulled back by supporting other departments which causes more issues within the company. You can forget about your family & life during 4th quarter, if you dont work Thanksgiving or Christmas you pretty much get fired or written up per points. Other companies have same compensation if not better! Job security hahaha plenty around especially since most just stand around and talk all day. Management thinks they have a clue & if that was true then why are the accounts leaving the company? The culture there is cut throat, if your not a managers puppet you get fired!"
bad,"When my son died, they rushed me back to work. I had a nervous breakdown, they fired me. The management doesnt care about problems at home,just processing books"
bad,"Too much favoritism in management DC. Managers were harassing women, coming drunk to work, substance abuse and were also stealing from the company. The director was trying to be friends with everyone. The culture of an organization is set at the top."
bad,"very difficult"
bad,"Quick Pace, Stressful, was responsible for assisting in purchasing of supplies and other items.  Did filling of records using excel and MS office and other programs."
bad,Terrible place. Impossible to get promoted unless you are a young cute girl. Pay is very low for the work you had to do.  Management is a joke and has no idea what they are doing.
bad,The worse place to work upper management was a joke and half they would squeez people out and when you ask to fix a machine they would take forever. To make it happen 👎👎👎👎
bad,Not fun to work there personal opinion I work there for close to 7 months and after that the agency call one day they don’t need u no longer that a waste of time I though the position was tem to hire
bad,Imgram is full of piers liers and under pay. I have waste my time working there 9 mouths in Mississauga. They keep people on contract for over 3 years.  They work you like dogs. Management and supervisors walk around like kings and treat employee like dogs you have 30 minutes lunch you have to run back to works like slaves. No Christmas breaks for yourself and family
bad,"The rate was much lower than the average for this role. Said they would see about changing it, but didn't; promised things but later reneged on them. Management did not take responsibility for problems. I did not perceive this as a place where there would be any career growth."
bad,This place was dirty and disgusting. The place was managed poorly and the hours sucked. the lack of time with family is what made me leave this place.
bad,"being trated rudely , fights in breakroom , company dont care about employees  manager lies employees two faced, many races diferant cultchers box city hardest part of job, best part of job getting off work"
bad,My Summary is Self Explanatory..... This company is below average to work for. Do yourself a favor and find a job elsewhere. Horrible work experience overall.
bad,Job is not what you as a person would wanna do  i hated the job wish i never wasted my time at that place management is terrible and the staff and leads are no good
bad,"This place is a horrible place to work for, they don’t care about if your kid is sick or  even if your family member is dying they want u there regardless and if your not there they lay u off, like they did me and then tell me I’m not allowed to use the bathroom but while everyone can I can’t it wasn’t fair and it was ALOT if FAVORTISM"
bad,"Ingram Micro is a horrible company to work for. Their management is rude, obnoxious and out of the loop. We have to work overtime at the last minute and I can't remember the last time I didn't have to work Thanksgiving or Christmas Eve."
bad,"No chance to advance , poor system , poor management , the pay sucks. I did not like the hours , we did not get permanent seats and the headsets were horrible did not work."
bad,you can have a really nice day with the people you work with. i have been successful in being a team leader for nearly a year now. The management are friendly and helpful.
bad,People come and go nobody knows much even the management don't stay long or have answers for you if they do then they miss lead you. Everyone has diffrent answers.
bad,"Not a good place to work. Too many mandatory work hours, with minimum notice. Not fully staffed, and could not keep staffing. Management always changing."
bad,"Senior leaders lack strategy, reward bad behavior by giving incremental responsibility to those that don't perform. The only strategy is to cut costs by cutting people, there are no plans for profitable growth."
bad,I loved working at Ingram Micro.  I enjoyed the team members and there wasn't one day that was the same.  Good company culture and the director really cares about the employees well being.
bad,Unfair and just do too much for little pay. while other do what every they want. u work hard everyday just to have ur manager talk to you unprof. and to watch others do nothing while u do everything cuz they get paid more.
bad,"Please don't work here, no one cares about your opinion and all management are all snakes. too many favoritism and not an equal opportunity employer , so many people are not treated equal from others."
bad,"The day was spend with mostly inbound calls which was great but felt I wanted to do more and started a family"
bad,"No work life balance,not recommended for freshers,bad code quality,"
bad,The only good thing about this place is leaving it. Period. No money even working 12 hour shifts..  No respect from management. Paid biweekly. Temp service for more than a year
bad,"The training I received was not for the periiod of time it should have been.  I was only trained for 2 weeks and then I got put on a bench of my own.  I still had questions about the assignments that I had to configure.  I was supposed to be on a 3 month ""probation period"" and I was told by the Supervisor I would be training during this period.  Obviously this did not happen!"
bad,horrible management they do not care about the wokers at all as well as we work 12 hour shift and on holiday pay only get paid for 8.. now you tell me where they do that at lol
bad,"I learned quite a bit at the company and made some amazing relationships.  The culture and organization has changed quite a bit over the years, in some positive ways and in others unfortunately not positive ways."
bad,This job is ok if your new to the field of warehousing but  Beyond that not a good place for evolution of any position.  Multiple managers controlling the same areas and employees leaving at a consistent rate.
bad,They don't know what they are doing. Managers comes from Taxes and all work stops.  Too many supervisors or acting supervisor that don't know what is going on.
bad,"Entreprise pour les jeunes diplômés, pour effectuer un stage ... Uniquement pour acquière de l'expérience.  "
bad,its a terrible place to work. Management lost. they will have you working every department in the building and don't want to pay nobody. Don't care about your personal life
bad,The only thing that was nice about the company were my colleagues who still tried hard to make the best out of a bad situation. The company was under constant cost saving and the whole department only one year after it starting up. Unrealistic expectations and targets of senior Global management.
bad,"You can get a point for every absence, so plan your off days a week in advance. Management can be describe as overseers, they care nothing about the people. Truly this one of the worst companies in Memphis"
bad,they are very unorganized  did not  have a lot of work very dirty and they higher just anybody and they shouldnt do that and barley have any work and didnt know where to place people
bad,"Was once a good company, now you are just a number.  Senior staff in vendor managment spiteful, don't promote, not knowledgeable.  They don't listen to employee's, they put their needs 1st."
bad,Not getting enough hours to pay for the bills I have. The people and work is nice but the distance is far away from where I live at now.
bad,"Sadly ...... it is not what it used to be. You'll meet great people, have fun at work but be expected to produce more than you're recognised or rewarded for."
bad,The day used to start with the leader assigning jobs and the employees taking RF guns with the targets. The job was easy and had fast-paced environment with time management skills. The teamwork was not visible at all.
bad,"Transction of repair parts and giving parts tp repair"
bad,As some items may seem interesting. The management will lie and avoid problem resolution.  Favortism of full time and temporary staff. While those who work hard feel the greatest scrutiny.
bad,"I can't really write a review  on this place because I have nothing to nice to say about Ingram Micro. They have absurd rules, low pay, unequal hours, management is inept."
bad,we go in get our lifts and then we would go to the desk to get the orders to pick then we picked the orders and put them on the line for shipment
bad,"On the first at work at Ingram Micro, It was very strange as I used to work  in  writing, but I had to be scanning , packing , labeling phones of different  categories. The management was decentralized according to department. The co workers are cooperative with collaborated work. The hardest part of the work is standing for along time, the most enjoyable part is seeing various mobiles phones at times in parts. This teaches me about recycle of phone and technology at work."
bad,"Ingram Micro is a very stressful place to work at and sales managers/executives are not qualified to manage the team well."
bad,"Overall rating is poor because:"
bad,"Everything was terrible at that job."
bad,The EVP and I decided that parting ways was the best thing for both.
bad,there isn't a work life balance. expected to work excessive amount of hours with limited training
bad,"Picked orders, for a computer warehouse, the co-workers were great the hardest part of the job was working 12 hours a day with little pay, I learned how to operate forklifts, side riders, cherry pickers."
bad,Cool environment but no job stability at all. One day your the man the next day your the man on unemployment. They seem like they have your back but everyone is out for themselves
bad,Absolutely unforgiving work environment. Upper leadership provides zero support and conflict between HR/Operations leadership ongoing on a daily basis. Associates take advantage of the aforementioned and use it to their advantage for reprisal.
bad,The vendor management is awful. The director is mean and spiteful and clearly has favorites. If you are not one of them then she makes your work stressful.
bad,"I have had the worse experience with the Hr team "
bad,"No work/life balance.  Bad pay.  Bad raises. No bonus if supervision."
bad,"No job security "
bad,There is no home/ work balance at Ingram. Managers do not care about their associates and HR doesn't either. You have a lot of managers that engage in inappropriate behavior with the associates as well as associates and nothing is done about it. The temps are treated even worst.
bad,"They literally broke the law and forced me and my coworkers work 7 days a week 11 hour shifts for almost 2 months. The management are too ""friendly"" with some of the coworkers and the management are too competitive with each other and abuse their workers in order to one up each other. They don't care about you having an outside life and will fire you if you're going to school or have an emergency and can't work the hours they require. Iphone season is the worse and their turn over rate is ridiculously high. They announce over time sometimes the next day at the end of the night and you are required to go."
bad,Undue pressure & partiality . No equitable work load. Slow decisions. Unethical practices followed overlooked by management. Hardly any increments year on year.
bad,They hire too many temps and then let them all go. The supervisors should not be supervisors because not only do they never know anything but are extremely rude. I have been harassed so many times at ingram. There is no way to advance and they will end your contract without notice.
bad,"Dort gab es keine Gleichberechtigung. "
bad,"The racism here is top-notch they hate you when you are human of color for no reason and the black people here can't move far because its a daily struggle to get your work done without being reminded how worthless and dumb you are and never appreciate any of your efforts"
bad,"Imagine 2 escalators. One going in and one going out of Ingram Micro.  The turnover rate is unbelievable. No a/c. 90 degrees indoors. Petty, duranged managers with disgusting, creepy mustaches. Mandatory overtime year round. They lie about hours going back down to 40/week. You must work 6 days a week and become their slave. My advice is to look somewhere ,anywhere else."
bad,"Upper mgmt has changed several times leading to more confusion and chaos. Every new Director wants to reinvent the wheel but does not learn processes. "
bad,Ingram micro is a horrible place to work. Many accidents occur. They often changed shifts last minute and expect you to live your life around their needs. Job security here is no existent. Working at ingram is just as bad as amazon
bad,"une misère, à peine de quoi gagner sa vie. conditions farfelues"
bad,"culture is horrible, management and HR have no intentions of fixing it, facility could be shutdown after contract runs out with existing customer, results have not meet customer expectations.   its a chop shop for labor that doesnt pay as well as competitors, so the turnover is abundant, therefore more mistakes and less productivity."
bad,"This place was a joke to work for. They fired me 3 days before christmas, for just cause reasons, after i had just put in weeks of over time to compensate for the christmas rush."
bad,Gelebtes Outsourcing von Personal nach Osteuropa. Jeder dort hat Angst um seinen Arbeitsplatz.
bad,There was opportunity to make a lot of money but you put in over 70+ hrs. When the work slowed they laid off 80% of the staff. no room for advancement. They also do not work with your schedule. It was 70+ hrs or nothing.
bad,"Great place to start out, not alot of promotions, constant lay offs, always having to do more with less.  Benifits were good and there is a gym, lots of gree lunches."
bad,You work  7 days a week -  10 + hours a day  even when there is no work.  Not many tools for every person . They promise us a pay raise but lied. The workers quit each day more and more. Not respect for employees.
bad,"process orders and quotes "
bad,"A poor working atmosphere, lack of training, favoritism, and excessively poor treatment of all employees,  especially temp workers.  Overall, a terrible experience, no appreciation of those that are hard workers."
bad,Company refused to staff properly during peak times. Also pushed too many projects at the same time. We would start a new one before finishing current project we were on.
bad,"The management team closely resembles the multiple managers in the movie ""Office Space"".  They will each come by to tell you what you're doing wrong without any real advice on how to fix it.  "
bad,The management has really no idea what's going on... they don't know how to value IT professionals.  The executives literally call them monkeys or will say that apes could do professional IT jobs.  There is no work life balance.  Your management will not support you.   It was truly awful place to work.  My manager was terrible.
bad,Tienen mucho problema no tanto de racismo como de diferencias de clases te sacan de tu trabajo sin ningún motivo solo porque no le agradas al jefe o que me digan a mi cuando cometí una falta cuando no trabaje hasta tiempo extra solo que no me dejo decir estúpido por nadie puedes ser el jefe pero no mi dueño si me respetan respeto
bad,supervisors will put blame on their workers for things that were their fault. They also grant you things then tell the manager that they did not to get rid of workers that work hard and not there to be friends with the supervisors. Have been known to drive 40 minutes to work to be sent home after an hr and a half
bad,The most miserable environment I ever worked in my life. I lost seven years of my life with this company. Disgusting management.
bad,"All aspects of the job are typically what you would expect, except for management."
bad,You were treated unfairly in my department if there was no work they expected you to make production.days was very stressful.Management was very poor.If he did not like you he would not listen to nothing you had to say.Trying to make production without the work to do it with
bad,"I work with Ingram micro for over a year in Plainfield IN, The racism I face is out of this world, They treat black people with outmost hate and never think you amount to anything."
bad,"Specific to IT in Irvine, there is absolutely no organization, or proper on-boarding. The pace is truly fast, however management is more concerned on their own ""CYA"" than create a  productive IT environment."
bad,Good for fast money during the winter since you'll be a slave doing 12 hour days. I worked here for 4 years 2 temp 2 company. They dont care about employees everything is about money
bad,"-Typical day is processing orders with absolutely no form of sales involved."
bad,"management is really not great. you get told different things from different people. hard workers seem to be the ones typically punished the most while lazier workers get the most praise. job was pretty easy and fun, otherwise. coworkers are great. just the management is awful, and almost anyone else in there would tell you the same."
bad,Co workers were ok to work with but management there is horrible especially 2nd shift. You will get no help from them and sometimes just walking around with a clipboard acting like there working and taking smoke breaks every 10 minutes. And they do not care about you here your just another number. Human resources is just as bad here stay away find something else.
bad,Alltag jeden Tag das gleiche an Arbeit brauche Abwechslung
bad,The senior management is racial and discriminatory. The company is mess with messy warehouse with same rotten people with the idea of 70's. Not an ideal place for millennials.
bad,No se percibe una cultura humanística en el Sales Service Center. No hay promociones de puestos relevantes. Existe el favoritismo.
bad,I was working in receiving and shipping department.Hardworking and honest employees but poor management and supervisor doesn’t respect you at all.probably he thinks he is superior  than anyonelse. I don’t expect him to be nice every day but also not rude and always yelled at us. I would not recommend anyone to go this company because you will not feel being like you were treated right even after completing you every task properly. Take care of your employees so they will takecare of your business. It’s all simple as that.
bad,This was the lowest paid entry level warehouse in the city. There were employees there that were unable to speak english. it made communication very hard.
bad,"The management. is horrible, they have absolutely no People Skills ,Non appreciative of your work Bad working conditions, if you complain or express  your opinion, you will get fired. Manager yells a lot. Its like a High School environment rather than a place of work. Very disrespectful Management that does not care about their Employees. You basically show up and happy to leave at the end of the shift!"
bad,"Ingram invest lot for new technology, however, there is no process in place. The project do not follow any process. The directors are not experienced. Leadership team neither have knowledge nor seek expert opinion. Most of the senior people are staying with the company because of their relationship with higher management. They are not worthy in their position. There is no audit mechanism. There are no software standards. There are lot of redundant codes in the application and do not follow industrial standards."
bad,"In the past year, my office has laid off more than 35% of the Finance and Accounting teams. We've had 4 presidents in the past 4 years. "
bad,"Good work place environment and culture. "
bad,call center is  a joke they dont care about anything but there self teamleads pick and choose who they talk to they are rude and careless very disrespectful
bad,"Inside sales - listening, speaking, reading, writing and technology"
bad,"I loved my job but my boss was clueless. Some people are born managers. She isn't one of them. I worked in Business Operations which was a very small group of 4, on the east coast, including me. We were over worked and under tons of pressure all the time. My coworkers and I would cry during the day from the stress. We had no support from our boss. No help at all. If the department had a better boss, I'd still be there."
bad,"Many of the supervisors are racist and show favoritism. They advance whom they want and fire when they choose. If you are looking for a fast paycheck I recommend, anything other than that I advise to keep it moving."
bad,"Over all it's a nice place to work,the management is poor on the second shift pay isn't good for what they have you doing the hours change without notice"
bad,Terrrible incompetent lack of leadership. Long hours dreadful hours.  The people are walking dead.  The leadership is worthless.  There was not any investments in creating a healthy workplace.
bad,This is the worst accounting dept I have seen in my life. There are way too many people touching the same accounts and way too many duplication errors. The management team leaders are very poor and unprofessional with a lot of favoritism which leaves the moral very low. And on occasion be prepared for random people to come yell at you in a very unacceptable work environment manner and management doesn't do anything about it. That should be grounds for them being fired. No one in other depts seem to know how to do their jobs or they are just all very lazy and so there is no support from other depts to resolve issues. Very poor working environment with people who don't care to help anyone else. No team work at all. Would not recommend anyone to work here!
bad,"The manangement at this company was very poor. I enjoyed the job itself and the team were great."
bad,"Went to work as s PM in what I thought was a supportive culture, found this is not true. The project review meetings are almost combative with the PM being attacked and held accountable for everything. The management is more interested in shorting the delivery date than doing it right the first time."
bad,My supervisor lied to cover his own back. I loved my job and loved what I did. I loved and worked hard for Ingram. Everything that was asked of me I did. I was a Marine for 26yrs and have always been a hard worker
bad,completely unorganized everyday I was there. internet went offline pickers carts were hooked up to internet and  crashed daily. system would break down. stood around hours on end.
bad,"A typical day at work is doing my work to the best of my ability and being able to learn new task on a daily basis."
bad,I was only there as a coop student. It is a good place to work  but there was no openings to hire when I finished my coop.
bad,"I have so much accomplishment with work experience, but I am puntual, teamplayer, be on time, communicate with other co-worker, independable, and get the job done! I have learned to do customer service assistance, cardboard ripper, meat wrapper, unloading trailers of merchandise, stack on pallets by numbers on pallets of merchandise, rf scanner control as a grocery picking, labeling packing, oder picking, bill boxes, tape boxes after packing, and sweep floors. I have education skills for tile setting vocational trade and high school diploma."
bad,Learned how to manage 100 associates and my department. Hardest part is during peak we have to have a lot of temps to help that don’t listen and run all over you. Then management does nothing about it and I never know when I’m getting off work. The most enjoyable is working with the regular associates.
bad,Terrible management you get treated like a slave. Must have big quoto everyday with no place to put product. Go through prison security. Small pay for working so hard.
bad,Management are all pawns and backstabbers... if u don't brown nose u wont get anywhere... also they put you on a PIP in NO Hope of you returning from it.. like setting you to fail from day one...no one seems to help out as they are busy all the dayum time...
bad,"I learned how to work as a team, understanding many cultures. learn how to do the hardest job, the most enjoyable part of the job. Ingram is a great company site to work.they have good essential resources   for researching for their next employer"
bad,great place to work if u like cheese> Takes time moving up.  Located in Vancouver.  If you want to learn about cheese.  Not to many employees.
bad,"My work is warehouse company we are working for T-mobile  we received phones the one peoples have insurance for it."
bad,"It is absolutely DISGUSTING that a yet ANOTHER ENTITLED MILLENNIAL is given a job in customer support without being remotely qualified let alone handed it BECAUSE of connections that most don't have and honestly apply with a resume and egerly Await the opportunity for an interview and should of had the interview for the Customer Service position in Williamville NY based on their qualifications not on who they knew and were not fairly given that opportunity!!! If that in its self is not disgusting then this is!!! not only was this unqualified individual hired but in Less then 2 and 1/2 weeks provided the opportunity to leave on a weeks vacation for Hawaii when experienced,  honest, dependable employees have been at your company for years and NOT GIVEN THAT LUXURY!!! UNBELIEVABLE AND DISGUSTING. GREAT JOB HR!! NOW HIDE THIS FROM THE THE PUBLIC VIEW - EVEN FURTHER DISGUSTING IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!!! AWESOME 👍"
bad,"Upper management manages DOWN. Meaning, Sr. Managers are doing supervisors job and supervisor is doing team lead job."
bad,I enjoyed my first year here but it slowly went downhill after that. Management are too busy being picky about breaks than supporting their employees. No room for progression unless you are a favourite.
bad,"Terrible management, terrible hours. Pay was also terrible. No room for moving up in the company at all. Terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible"
bad,"Maintenance Supervisor lacks people skills with anger issues at each and every task given to the department."
bad,"My name is maria mabena i wash i can have my business and i will work hand to get my company so that i can be successful in my life, life is good because i know what i want and i will work hand for my life,i will like to work for any company"
bad,Don't care about workers and there ideas.. Managers don't communicate with each other... They don't care if you work or not.. They yell at you for no reason.. The raise for every years is an average of 15 cents.
bad,It was an interesting individual experience while employed there but very short. So that's why I cannot say too much about. There is a company restaurant.
bad,"There is no typical day at work the only thing you know is what time you come in. Management waits until 5 minutes before you think it is time to go and tells you  have to work 12 hrs.not 8. There is nothing hard about this job, it just is not organized, all managers have their favorites who never do any work."
bad,"Nice co-workers, friendly environment."
bad,"I don't wish to expound on any reviews. not applicable"
bad,"There was one supervisor who understood how to work effectively, the rest of the new supervisors were only interested in clocking in and collect their paychecks. It was very unorganized. No chance for advancement or a raise."
bad,"Hired thru a temp agency. No benefits,  nothing stable. Once the holidays where over, the company didnt need anyone anymore... "
bad,"Took this job out of college to start to pay loans off. Bad idea. No career advancement, bad pay, and absolutely abysmal management. Keep looking, don't settle here."
bad,"Ich war viel zu lange in diesem Unternehmen! Jeden Tag Überstunden, von denen man bei Arbeitsbeginn erfährt. Auf die Mitarbeiter wird keinerlei Rücksicht genommen. Wer dort von einer Zeitarbeitsfirma kommt und wer der Deutschen Sprache nicht mächtig ist, ist klar im Vorteil. Als Mitarbeiter von Ingram oder Docdata ist man der letzte Büttel. Die Bezahlung ist etwas über dem Mindestlohn, was die Leute dort leisten wird daher überhaupt nicht monitär aber auch nicht menschlich anerkannt. Die Leitung hat ihren Namen nicht verdient. Leute, die anscheinend oft genug ""hier"" gerufen haben, bis sie den Job eines Schicht- oder Teamleiters hatten. Von Mitarbeiterführung haben die keine Ahnung. Spurt der Arbeitnehmer nicht, weil er vielleicht auch mal aus persönlichen Gründen keine Überstunden machen kann, hagelt es Abmahnungen. Man braucht sich nur mal die Jobbörsen im Internet anzuschauen und wie oft dort dieser Arbeitsgeber auftaucht. Das hat nicht unbedingt etwas damit zu tun, dass die wachsen und wachsen."
bad,"bad place to work had to work too many hrs with no idea of when its over,rarely ever hire on the fulltime employees treat you bad,the bosses treat you bad and the temps do all the work"
bad,Stressful.  Long hours.  No work-life balance.  Little to zero communication from superiors.  Lack of consistency in direction.  Too many initiatives causing none to succeed.
bad,"Not the best place to work, i strongly recommend that you look eslewhere. That make claims that are not true. zero work life balance. until they catch up to the modern era they will continue to have massive churn."
bad,"This is a business that has no strong local leadership & cannot match the other players in the market, a massive player but very slow to react, a follower than a trial blazer."
bad,i go in do what is asked and go home
bad,"Returns department, work you like a slave unrealistic targets ,rules change every day management is Clueless it's all zalando the boss yop is a bully fires people for no valid reason poor work ethics worked there October"
bad,Nothing to really complain about except for work and life balance. As longest you do your job you are in a good path of leaning toward rewards. Over may be called late.
bad,"Good for experience but for long career and growth its very poor."
bad,"Je bent een nummer, tenzij je de juiste Poolse vrienden hebt dan heb je in no time een vast contract of je bent leidinggevende."
bad,"Always worked 12 hours even if it was no work and wasn't peak seaon..Treated like a minion..lol..if you dont make production your fired, and that's crazy when theres no work or in another building and the forklift drivers dont want to bring it.. and even if you finish your work you have to help other departments and work 12 hours"
bad,I can only speak for the location I worked in. It was inconsistent the management team was unprofessional. the morale of the employees was low. Managers sleeping with employees.
bad,"Ze plannen je het liefst de hele week in. Terwijl je diverse keren aangegeven  hebt. Max 24 uur. Schooldag en beperking UWV, ze weten vlgs niet wat het is, je moet gewoon komen, anders exit. "
bad,"The only recommendation for anyone joining is to learn as much as possible and leave as soon as possible.                      "
bad,This is a place that has a terrible background check process.  While i was there myself and another person were sexually harassed by a former felon.  I've never been treated more like I didn't matter.
bad,"Don't be mislead by the perks you receive working here.  Nothing is actually provided by Ingram Micro itself, the perks all come from the vendors.  Ingram grossly under pays their sales staff compared to the amount of revenue that they bring in.  Consistently increase quotas or create new sales goals to reduce commissions that they pay out.  The actual people that work their are great, except for the majority of the managers who only care about themselves and the bottom line."
bad,"good job for just work, dont expect advancement.  Not a competence hierarchy, its a ""are you friends with your boss"" hierarchy.  Management is unresponsive to needs."
bad,"They will work you until you bleed between September and January.They will give you as many hours as allowed by law. Come January they offer you a 3 month contract, if you're lucky then tell you its slow and they have to reduce your hours to 5 or 6 from 8 until they can you at the end of the contract."
bad,In 2015 Ingram Micro purchased a number of startups and smaller high tech companies. After the acquisition we feel that our quality of work and life deteriorated.  Ingram's corporate culture feels impersonal and restrictive. There is not much communication going on between teams. Our benefits also degraded significantly.
bad,"No prosperity even if you work many years, chances to get a permanent contract, salary increases or respect are close to zero.Managers supervisors and line managers are elevated to another level and bullying is seen often as a form of encouragement and stimulation.Targets are good but huge lack of organisation leads to huge time wasting and frustration. fowasting..FaFAndforstration"
bad,"Une marche  perpétuelle lorsque l'on est intérimaire. Travail extrêmement répétitif. Ports de charges lourdes et ou encombrantes. Surveillance systématique des managers. Peu d'entraide entre collègues. Course permanente à la productivité.  Toutes les deux semaines, de nouvelles personnes sont formé à votre poste devant vos yeux. Aucune embauche possible."
bad,Nit enough pay for the work u do the pay only raises 25 cents a year and its hot they have their pick in people and its not likely u will have a chance to grow it pretty much a dead in job
bad,"Extremely difficult to get work done here. Very poor execution across the board. People do not show up for meetings. No accountability or integrity. Very poor culture. A lot of gossip, very toxic place. People are physically ill a lot and some management is very corrupt. There are some good people but they are either new or have been there for a long time. Very high turnover and a lot of layoffs."
bad,This company is more focused on their profit. Temp employees aren’t treated nicely that’s why they have problems recruiting people during peak season.
bad,"A company that ships out electronic devices with different areas to work like order picking, void fill, filling trucks and sometimes packing boxes and loading skids for orders in the shipping department."
bad,"There have been multiple changes within the management structure over the past few years resulting in a lack of direction, company culture, priorities, and a general unease when job security comes to the conversation."
bad,Need better manages and training. It's a very stressful environment only because the workers and mangers don't have good communication. But the pay is ok
bad,"Bad management in IT  department. Incompetent people promoted. some groups had real bad managers , surprising how these kinds of people were promoted."
bad,Mangers with 10+ years are cronies and only care about exec mgt not their employees. It is not about performance or innovation its about brown nosing them. They are dumb and stuck in the past.
bad,"Horarios muy agotadores y poca remuneración económica por ser parte del sector más de fábrica, responsabilidad y puntualidad, organización un poco deficiente, colegas divertidos y optimistas y soñadores, difícil acceso a las oportunidades de crecer en esa empresa, pronto pago por parte de la empresa."
bad,"Het leukste van de baan zijn de collega's ze komen uit heel Europa. De planning daarentegen is vreselijk. De ene dag werk je van 5.30 uur tot 15.15 uur, en de volgende van 15.30 uur tot 0.00 uur. Je krijgt op vrijdag het rooster van de komende week en nog veranderen ze dat gedurende de week."
bad,"People are nice, management not organized, salary is weak no chance of movement unless you are connected or a suck up. No training in place. just shadow and sink or swim after thta"
bad,At the time I worked there the data I worked on was very disorganized and based on estimates of estimates. It was very difficult to do my job correctly without real numbers.
bad,You are not able to grow and move up with in the company no matter how much experience you have and if you do not have a title with in the company other associates and new associates will not take you training seriously
bad,Ingram Micro is rather an inconsistent work place when it comes to time management. Communication between temp services and the actual company are inadequate as well. Some of the employees in their various positions are also not polite and talk down to other 'lower ranked' associates. Communication is not only insufficient  between temp and Ingram but also between temp and Corporate. Compensation for the amount of responsibilities that you will liable for are not acceptable. As far is as the work is concerned it is rather easy and quick to acquire.
bad,"overtime is mandatory which would be fine except you dont find out until your day is almost over. no time to find sitters for kids. they dont care if you are ill. they say if your sick dont come in, yet you will be written up if you do"
bad,"The work life balance is not a consideration for this company, this is a business and you will do what is best for the business. Currently there is a lot of restructuring."
bad,"Rien de plus à ajouter, si vous souhaitez évoluer, partez chez un éditeur ou un constructeur. Aucune stratégie, à part faire du fric par tous les moyens, au détriment de ses engagement constructeurs."
bad,Chaotisch und unorganisierte Arbeit.sehr seltsame Entscheidungen des Managementteams
bad,The company overall is an operations slave driver with very little recognition and poor salaries. Big talk from the execs with lots of lies. Employees are motivated to leave ingram. The few execs are motivated to keep salaries low and encourage poor performance to drive this initiative especially in operation and sales related roles.
bad,Ingram Micro is great for young people just starting out.  At first perks seem great but eventually physical prizes (like TVs and often times people will end up winning 5) and trips do not compensate for liquid cash that you can pay your bills with.  People there will do the same job there for 12 years to finally get promoted to do the same job with a slightly higher hourly pay and more of a cut on team spiffs.  If you a person who is in the middle of your career its not that great because you are waiting to get promoted behind people who have worked there for many years and want to get promoted after doing the same job for a long time.  Its very clicky and unless you are young and fun or well connected it's difficult to make your way through their clicks.  In sales with it being prize driven and prizes are determined by manufacturers people can become very vicious and undermining.  If I could have just done my job and I did it well I won Presidents club twice and if I could have just focused on the technology and opportunity without the nasty culture I would have stayed. I was at 100 % or more for my year over years sales goal with the exception of 1 year I came in at 97%. I am not sure if being good at my job caused resentment but the culture of Ingram unfortunately made working there unbearable.   Lets put it this way when I interviewed at Ingram a recruiter warned me that she didn't Iwould like it there and I tried it anyways.  It ended up being one of the worst decisions I've ever made and to this day I still regret it. Ingram does not deserve to be labeled the Best Place
bad,must be able to adapt to direction change and mixed signals due to constant change and lack of focus. long term goals are difficult to meet due to this.
bad,"For young professionals, Ingram is a good place to get a feel for corporate America.  Teaches the skills to take to other roles within or outside the company.  One of the problems with Ingram is they promote too much from within based on favoritism and not on merit.  Management does not pay to bring in quality from the outside that can provide an impact on the business as often as they should.  The people that work at Ingram are awesome, but many in management have never held a position outside the company and don't have a full understanding of what other quality organizations do to be leaders in their market."
bad,"Elke morgen houden wij die stand ups om de vorige dag door te nemen over wat ging goed en wat minder . Zo ook kijken we naar de ingezetten uren ten opzichte van de For Cast of te wel de aantal orders . "
bad,I was in Quality Control at Airtech for 6.5 years.  I did inspections in Cargo.  Lots of uneducated leadership and cronyism in operations.  I was under one supervisor who literally only had a GED.  It's very hard to move ahead with these people. Very strict environment and turn over is pretty high. No cell phones on the floor.  The pay was only $14.26 and hour and one had to know a lot to do the job.  You get a .40 cent raise per year. It's variable hours so you'll never know when you'll be home or if you'll have to give up your weekend.
bad,"J'était préparateur de commande à l’entrepôt il m'a fallu 3 ans d'interim full time avant d'avoir un contrat fixe."
bad,Ok place just need better management They don't pay enough for the work that your doing. The job security sucks. Its no  organization in the work place and they hire permanent they hire a lot of temporary workers
bad,"I worked at ingram Micro a few years, at the plant i worked, they had very poor management and extremely poor work conditions"
bad,"Working here hasn't been that bad.  The management staff need management training."
bad,Well for starters they work you like a machine and if you get hurt on probation well tough luck you're replaceable to them so goodluck.
bad,"It is a good place to begin a get some experience in areas such as production, shipping and receiving. Also, they train you on the forklifts."
bad,"I don't recommend this place, if you want to be treated like a humanbeing. Management shuts it's eyes on visible events of racism. In warehouse whole families are working, on different hierarchy which results in Institutional racism."
bad,"El trabajo es muy simple si uno se lo propone, a tolerar a todo tipo de personas y jefes, gerencia casi no esta presente por no decir nunca, el ambiente entre colaboradores es muy bueno, el tema cambia con los jefes, lo más difícil es quedar bien con todos sin verse afectado, lo que más me gusto fueron mis compañeros de área."
bad,Staff are amazing but pay below industry standard with unrealistic work loads and targets. do it for the experience but find an exit strategy within 2 years
bad,The workplace is not clean.There are spiders everywhere I mean everywhere. Lack of pest control will have anything from dogs cats rats snakes and lizards in the forklift operator area where you pick.I recommend you get a mask and gloves . The product literally sits in the shelves for years accumulating a black sort of toxic dust that makes you itch if you touch it .You will never have a set time 2 get off unless you are third shift .
bad,"The finance organization is very mismanaged.  Diversity is often discussed, however, actions from Executives said otherwise. Women, particular minority women have little growth opportunities at the executive level. The nepotism in which the Executives indulged is especially inexcusable. Leaders practiced nepotism from the outset by hiring and promoting their friends.  Human Resources often ignored all warning signs."
bad,bad manegment and bad treating workers and working hard but no equality in work zone and aplaying for position very hard to get and no team work always not good work inviroment .
bad,"ok to work for, however they are misguided in the direction they want to take the company.nothing else to say so take it as it is, and hopefully they get better."
bad,"Issues at Ingram Micro include:"
bad,"No senior manager support for new joinees. Managers are not interested in grooming new folks, and more concerned on their own performance. Appraisals are a joke."
bad,"I would not recommend working in this stressful organization.  Most unhealthy is the middle management who get pressure from upper management for daily reports that becomes everyones problem, with no focus on true business objectives, realistic goals and measurable successes."
bad,Work from home policy was lifted and commuting to Mississauga wore heavily. Very little collaboration between departments which created an environment with plenty of silos
bad,"In the Tennessee warehouse, it is bad paying job for all the work you are doing each day with a lot of overtime and other Ingram companies pay is better for the same job title"
bad,"I was a temp job and I lived far away, couldn't do it anymore so I had to quit but it wasn't a bad place to work at and ppl were really nice, always willing to help when needed"
bad,"There is no possibility to advance at Ingram Micro.  Additionally, we are not compensated as we were lead to believe we would be.  Management does not value the efforts of my  team."
bad,"During project only i have worked there i am contractual basis not know much about company top management."
bad,"As I was there twenty years the Company change and the supervisory associates did not get feed back and had to take on the managers role as well as there own tasks. Any good news was past on via the Manager (not very often)."
bad,"Very easy to work there, not physically demanding."
bad,this job just was a job. Paid good money though. I learned how to packed boxes.
bad,it was a good job but i will always be fighting with the store owners wife because she wasnt fair. they will pay us les then what minamum wage was.
bad,Very Busy Place.
bad,I responded to customer emails and phone calls in a call center environment.
bad,Loved working at this place. Very nice people although unfortunately got stuck with a horrible boss EA KATE WOOD.   Be careful of this woman biggest gaslighter in the world. Had to leave because of her.
bad,"Very political - you're either with the tight-knit crew who's been there for 25 years or you're feeling like you're back in high school. Even the parking lot situation is forced! You may get stuck in the one 20 minutes away but you still have to be there at the same time as someone who parks next door. "
bad,"There was the lowest moral I've ever experienced and everyone was preparing to leave when I arrived. The Southern California commute didnt help either. Needless to say, I quickly left"
bad,I never knew how many hours per day I would be working. This was the most difficult part of my job because it was hard on my home life.  Received conflicting instructions many times.  They did accommodate some of my requests if I was not comfortable in a department they would better utilize my talents in another department.  My last assignment was billing and I enjoyed the position.
bad,"working  6 days a week at least 8-12 hours depending on workload. "
bad,"Work is continual, with no downtime, for which you are underpaid and underappreciated. Management does not collaborate with each other, so there is little unity within a department, making things much more stressful."
bad,"some time pressure on employees, but not continuous."
bad,"No room for advancement, poor leadership, and major disconnect from the c-level suite to the general population. You need to be a favorite of a hire up to get recognized for anything. If you're not a favorite, good luck getting noticed."
bad,"This can be a high stress environment depending on your position/team."
bad,"If you are looking for a place to work that is insanely stressful in sales this is it. Your pay for the industry is low, and goals border on insane depending on department. Nothing you do is ever good enough, though you will get hollow praise for your efforts. If you are looking to get ahead and promoted do not worry about hard work or being good at your job. Just be someones buddy and play the game. They are more interested in garbage metrics than your actual success in your position. These is little to no help from management in setting you on the path for your career goals. "
bad,"The place used to be so good to work for and as it grew more mature and more aggressiveness takes over."
bad,I have health problems which i told then before i was hired. I would miss days and come on with a Doctor excuse AND STILL get pointed. There is no compassion for the sick here because any other day im here ontime and stay until im not needed anymore.
bad,Temporary position. Very fast paced enviroment. Picking orders. Worked 12 hours shifts every day. Very strenous and no air on certain levels. Managers were very tough
bad,Difficult to draw a balance between your job and private life. The job takes most of your time but there is no commensurate compensation. Job security is not also a guarantee. Very little or no chances of advancement.
bad,"Great place to work if you love high stress and low pay. The management is horrible, the training is done by other employees. They use the trickle down method and keep you out of the loop if something important is going on. I did not enjoy my time there, made a lot of new friends however, besides that, a horrible company to do technical support for. They will squeeze every moment of time you have out of you while you are at work."
bad,"I was a carpet roller at that company.I thought it would be a simple job,but it was the opposite.I had to lift heavy dusty rugs and carpets everyday and load them in a truck which is not that easy."
bad,"Although the people working there are great, this company has large amounts of technological blind spots when it comes to in-house software development. They are a technology reseller, not a software development firm and it shows from the lack of a modern technology stack, to the version control systems, to their lack of secured repo connections to even their lack of software development practices. They are great to get to know and great at what they are doing: reselling technology."
bad,"good place to work but management doesn't really choose well on who deserves to be kept and who's not. they obviously pick based on who they just personally like. they don't value people's hardwork. and as days go by, people are just becoming greedy at work and it becomes really toxic."
bad,Not a well structured place to work. Revolving leadership door. No stability with management. Long drive with tolls if you work in Louisville area. Do not recommend working here for a long period of time.
bad,"A typical day at work would be getting to work a doing your job until a meeting is called with out  some kind of drama starting among the employees that the general manager will address if it gets out of hand.The supervisor on the other hand has favorites and it shows everyday. Other employees sees that and they talk among themselves about not be able to trust the supervisor with confidential information without hearing back what you told in confidentiality thrown  back in to your face. The hardest part of the job is trying to do your job to the best of your ability and get low merit raise increases! That's the slap in the face because you know you are one of the main plugger,picker, shipper on the job that do more than enough on a daily basis.No employee appreciation. Just for ones that's been there longer than you have.The work place culture is horrible. The employee that work in the production area doesn't get recognition for anything.That's what sad about this company.It wasn't nothing hard about the job, it was very easy. The most enjoyable time is when the employees in production celebrate each other birthdays among each other.What I learned at this establishment,is to still do your best at any job you are at but don't stay if there's no career advancement, even though you were told yes after you asked ,""Will there be room for growth?"" Come to find out there isn't. Waste of time."
bad,management don't know how to work right they don't see the hard working people that get the job done and everyone get blame for not doing inufe work they overwork us the hard working people while other stand and talk
bad,"9-5 type job. Culture isn't very interactive. Very good company in total, but not the most interesting place to work out. A lot of the employees don't like their job there."
bad,"It is not a bad place but it depends on who you work for. Most of the people that work there are respectful, however, a few bad apples spoil the bunch in this case.  The good part of the job was that you get to work on a lot of different accounts."
bad,"busy"
bad,"too many layoffs, management says a lot but does too little on any level. Not enough safety in the warehouse and ignorant operation coordinators the don't help you when you need it . they rather you get hurt than help........"
bad,"Not that bad of a job, they give great hours, clean environment for a wharehouse, nice co workers, great pay."
bad,"I've been at Ingram Micro Logistics for 3 years now. I happen to work at the largest center that Ingram has in the world. With that being said, we also have the largest volume of orders per day. A typical day would include punching the time-clock in the morning and listening to the huddle (which was lead by our ""team leader"" or manger). In the huddle they would address existing company policies that have been recently violated, and changes at Ingram. Also they would tell us how long to expect to work for the day. Working at Ingram has taught me many things, for instance, how to use their in-house inventory program ""IM-First"" and many other order processing services. Management at this facility is a joke, we have switched site directors at least 4 times in a period of 2 years, and so called ""team-leaders"" are just over payed, under-educated, employees with a power trip. Management at this facility is in need of a MAJOR overhaul, all the way down to the operations coordinators. Fellow associates are probably the most enjoyable part of this job. You meet very diverse people, who are almost always friendly and kind. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the heat in the summer time. Temperatures can reach to 105 on the the third floor, and when compounded with the dust in the air, it makes for a nasty combination. In addition the long hour (often 10 to 12 hours) days can be quite straining on one's legs and back, since you do not get to sit down at all, except for breaks and lunch."
bad,LEs manager ont des méthodes archaïques et ne cherchent pas à avancer avec des outils modernes
bad,"pockets of capable and strategic thinking people, but the other 'lifers' quickly drag them down for fear of change or losing power. Terrible or non-existing policies and rigors of how things are done so everything is a firedrill."
bad,I wasnt very happy at Ingram. I didnt feel i was treated fair. Lots of clicks of people who worked there 10+ years. I was never invited. After 3 years a position above me was filled without my knowledge.
bad,"I would give the best ratings for benefits and compensation when they were actually paid out (sales commissions and goals were not always paid out & goals sometimes set after EOM). Management was not good at responding to questions, concerns, or requests for help. You would typically have to ""corner"" managers to get approvals on processes or answers to questions. Getting things done that had to involve management was by far the hardest part of the job. Also, there are annual layoffs. Some years would see layoffs in mass twice in a year."
bad,"The work environment at Ingram is very fast pace and at times very negative. If things are not executed perfectly, it is a blame game of whose fault instead of focusing on fixing issues right away as a team. The upper management follows this the most and leads with fear instead of inspiring employees to do better."
bad,"12 hr shifts, 7 days a week. No room for family or a life. They do not have funds to get folks the equipment to get the job completed. touching product too much to get out the door. folks standing around talking way too much. lied to on hours, there are times you are there 14-16 hours day. "
bad,"-  The good environment,"
bad,"Overall a gerat work/life balance. A typical day in sales consists of being on the phone quoting items that the customer knows they want, pushing customers to technical support or fixing order errors caused either by the warehouse or technical support or due to customer selection error. Advancement is the company is very difficult unless you chose to leave for a vendor and return a couple of years later. College education is also not weighted much within the company anymore so if you don't have one, it isn't an issue. It should be noted however that there are some perks such as breakfast served a few times per week and internal training opportunities that could be transferred to other organizations. Overall it's a great place to start working if you are new to corporate environments, but for the college educated professional looking to grow their career and be able to make a liveable wage for their family, this is the wrong place."
bad,The company hires temp workers at $10 an hour for non equipment workers and $11 for equipment workers  and when you become permanent you get an extra $1 to start and .40 or 50 cents every 6 months but this was implemented somewhat recently.The highest workers make $16-$18 per hour but they have been there 10+ years.Temp to hire depends on expected work and not performance.Overtime is told last minute so you cannot make plans during your work week. .The work is easy but the job is stressful due to late in the shift label releases that cause unneeded overtime.
bad,Fun place to work. It’s a very diverse place and very friendly people. Poor management and communication. Advancement promotions mostly by who you know than how you work. Need a total clean up like from the scratch to the Quality department and operation specially boses that had been there for a while because they will also pass on that bad culture to new management.
bad,If you are single and have no family or kids this is the perfect job for you. You will work 7 days a week want November comes thru the end of December due to holiday season. But have good medical insurance.
bad,"i work 8 hours a day sometimes we do somes overtimes wich rise the paycheck  , with two 15 minutes brakes,i work second shift from 4h30 pm to 1h00 am ,"
bad,Working here on a typical day is always busy and hot. I learned how to use a rf scanner and a pallet jack. The management was ok but not that good because of their lack of work. Some of the co-workers were friendly and did what it took to get the orders out in an orderly fashion. the hardest part was sometimes working in the heat and not being able to drink water when it was to hot. What i loved is learning what goes into each module.
bad,Great team of people to work with. Designing & Developing was a pleasure. Was not a big push for me in terms of learning and growing.
bad,"Call after call after call after call... There is no break in-between calls and you are required to be on the phones for an unreasonable amount of time per day. Formal training is minimal, mostly on-the-job by asking senior employees. I learned that cubicle, call-center jobs are tough and sitting in a chair all day in front of a computer monitor attached to a phone headset is disheartening. The hardest part of the job is not gaining 10 pounds in your first 6 weeks. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving at the end of the day."
bad,"leerde tijdens het werken praktische nederlandse taal te spreken, en gezellige collega's."
bad,There can be opportunities at this place of work. The benefits are really good here. They have some chance of advancement. They hire within at times and have referral bonuses. The leadership in the accounting department is minimal.
bad,The hours and work was okay. Just the not enough money. Management was okay. Peak season is where you make the most of the money. After peak season work is slow
bad,"Drukowanie rachunkow , rozdzielenie ludzi do pracy , uczenie osob nowych dobra jakosc pakowania,"
bad,"Worked in big company environment"
bad,The job itself was enjoyable as were my coworkers. Management didn't take their positions seriously and there was too much favoritism. Be prepared for retaliation should the manager find out you complained to HR.
bad,"a typical day at work, hard work place culture. i enjoy the work even though i didnt work too long there. over all i would like to say that it was a great experience"
bad,"Management and supervisory staff, not experienced in a warehouse environment, which would make any new hire nervous.  Furthermore, everyone seems to have their own way of running the business, with no uniformity.  So, there's always conflict.  Lastly, most people forget that their presence in the workplace is to do your job in a professional manner. And particularly, DO NOT use racial and derogatory comments to your colleagues.  I understand, it's African American-dominated environment, but hearing the N-word all throughout the day isn't my idea of the proper everyday workplace."
bad,No room for advancement and the training is sub par at best. Some of the management is good to work with while others are not by far.
bad,"Area of work Accounting, budget, finance, assurance, treasury, reporting"
bad,"Walking all day with a lap top on a cart, and scanning items. After that make boxes and pack items. The job does get very boring, and the pay isn't the best."
bad,RR Donnely was an interesting warehouse to work for because it had an upstairs and a downstairs. It reminded me of a gym because your were constantly on your feet moving around.
bad,"it has been so long since this company was worked for - possibly not in existence, I have not looked for this. do not know if owner is still in southern California."
bad,brain tasking and few fun. it could be boring sometimes because one has to be on particular spot for hours
bad,"Evrything looks good but team leader Carmen "
bad,"I worked as temp picker. One temp worker waited 1 and half year to become FT hired.  Even so, the pay is still barely above minimum wage.  The management did not care about the broken microwave in the breakroom.  It was an easy job with no rating per your hourly picking.  I could sing a song without approval from management."
bad,I worked there for 16 Years They start weeding us people with yearz in with stupid reasons. Didn't want to pay the money. Top out pay is now $14.50. They shafted alot of us.
bad,it was okay. the hardest part was working in a shop with no air circulation coming through. i learned how to weld a big trailer. the management wasnt very good. they were a new business starting up.
bad,"Ingram used to Brightpoint, which was a great place to work. However, ever since Brightpoint was bought out, the environment turned cold and all activity budgets were cut and it was only a JOB after that. It was a cold environment. Executive team kept pushing for more work yet they kept cutting everything for the employees. Now, Ingram has been bought out by a Chinese company and more people are being let go. It's just not what it used to be."
bad,In my department there can be a lot of stress. Coworkers are great but the company need to value us more and we definitely need more pay for the work we do.
bad,busy a lot of work  overtime.but with okay wage of 10 a hour and a lot of overtime. easy to apply with a two day training period. Many veteran to help you with your struggles.
bad,"the night shift was pretty cool, and laid back. If you're new to this field its ok but as the shift goes on its hard to find something to keep you busy til the end of shift."
bad,"bookin collection repairs and quotes , repair inspection,creating orders dispatching repair out to suppliers ,stores and the clients customer service repling to emails and answering calls"
bad,my boss was great it was a lot of people that were in leadership roles but was racist. It just was sometimes good team work . But you would have an lot of people that was childish and mean spirit be havior.
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, porém cultura antiga. Sistemas fracos de trabalhar."
good,It is good for the hard workers but for the seasonal period only they don't care about how hard you work for the company. They will give you overtime and everything in the season but they will not hire you and for some reason after the season will kick you making any reason that you made errors and your accuracy was not upto the mark etc.
good,Things could be run smoother with different management. Last minute changes with work schedules. No decent start time hours.  Never know when you will get off work. A lot of favoritism. Hard work does not get recognized.
good,Management could give less about you all they want is get product in so it comes be shipped .long hours no raises no bounses .branch huddles very few even if have one .need to get Union in .they cutback on Christmas party no summer picnic . It is all they want to do is more money in Ingram pockets I worked there for 17 years. Was a job and that's about it
good,"Clock in pick the orders, no room for growth, mechanical treat employees like robots. Co workers are mostly good people some act like they are still in high school trying to form clicks. Long hours and standing on your feet. Clocking out"
good,"A really messed up place, no chance for advancementmanagers two faced , no hours there when I got on they promised me 50 plus hours a week. Lmao, never saw that."
good,"It is a good place to work for job security, but not for pay or career advancement and men are definitely paid more than women.  There is very little in the way of promotion path."
good,"This place was cool for a while, but then things changed. I got a little bored of my job and it was a little too laid back. I wouldn't take my chances of going back, but some of the people there were cool. I'll never forget my experience here, it changed my life and outlook on things."
good,The point system is a way to get rid of good working people. Operators should be paid more. Managers don't listen to workers. Lay you off if you ask for time to take care of personal issues.
good,I enjoy the part of the job that I do and I like a lot of people that work there but there are several people that do nothing but cause drama and management does nothing about it. Management plays favorites and does not hold people accountable for their actions.
good,The supervisors don't know the product in the building. You don't see the managers on the floor as much as you should. When you need them their no where to be found. Bad communication skills.
good,"job was boring and labor intensive, good for temporary workers "
good,"At first when I started working for Ingram Micro it was okay. We were put into groups to work on large orders to be shipped for the holidays. This was were it was fast-paced. Once the project is completed and you are sent to pick products using your RF scanner (alone), it becomes more slow-paced. You are given a stack of orders to fill which wouldn't be so bad if they didn't have us walking back and forth from the front of the building to the back constantly. The only thing I did nkt like was the fact that even of there was no work you were mandated to stay (even if that meant walking around for 3-4 hours). All in all its not a horrible place to work but beware of supervisors, they rarely help you out since they have so much on their hands too. Its pretty confusing if you've never used an RF scanner so you will more than likely be trained by someone else in the facility who's nice enough to help (if you can find someone). It will more than likely be a coworker who's been there for about a month or so, but once you get the hang of it it isn't so bad."
good,"Pros : "
good,"Es una empresa quemada laboralmente, el personal no posee valores y los jefes tampoco motivan con el ejemplo, hay mucha cultura del cotilleo y envidias entre compañeros. Los jefes prometen ascensos que luego no se cumplen o bien son cubiertos por ETTs."
good,"Trevliga arbets kamrater god sammanhållning"
good,"Poor training provided, only given few days. Was told at the beginning that it would take a few weeks to get login details for software programs. Not actually shown step by step what you need to do and why you are doing it. Pay was alright not great. Was hired through an agency, but wasn't told what id be doing just phoned me up evening before and asked me to come in the next day at 9am to start training. I used to work here years ago and it was a lot better, friendlier environment and nicer people."
good,"Management inexistant, objectif impossible à atteindre donc pas de prime. Salaire médiocre."
good,"Lots of favortism its not about your performance its about who you can kiss up to the best, it also has a divide and no unity at all in my opinion its not what you know its who you know that can pull the steings for you."
good,Daje słabe 3 na 5 że względu na to że człowiek jest tam liczba. Obiecywane jest podpisywanie umów tylko po to aby na sam koniec wyprowadzić pracownika na godzinę przed końcem okresu próbnego. Praca jest lekka i łatwa w wykonaniu na samą pracę narzekać się nie da ale już na szefostwo a w szczególności na jego polska cześć już narzekać wręcz trzeba.
good,Not a bad place to work but as an american you are the minority because of all the different ethnic backgrounds at the facility. I'm not sure about other facilities but in Indiana  this is exactly what you have to look forward to working with.
good,Opportunity to explore the technology distribution industry and business models. Interesting opportunities to develop businesses with tech partners globaly
good,I worked with really great people but management was completely inconsistent and played favorites.  The rules changed between which facility you were located in and corporate had no idea how to manage a local location
good,"Hard working culture in general"
good,Working here first shift is challenging but learning about different pieces to cellular phones is cool.
good,Worked there for 2 years and was laid off. Constant layoffs but always under the radar.
good,creo que la gerencia podria mejorar los sueldos de los empleados y considerar la promocion de puestos.
good,There is no job security and you dont know when your end time is. Anything  after 8 hours should be considered as time and a half due to the fact we dont know when we get off. Were basically on the company's time as long as they want us
good,"Groot bedrijf, veel schijven, weinig coordinatie en onduidelijk over toekomst"
good,"journée de travail typique"
good,"Fairly okay for a start. But the pay was a bit small to keep a family up."
good,"It was a fun place to work, many people from many different cultures to meet and interact with. You can learn many things from different people that come from all over the world. But its also not that dependable of a job. There have been many days where you leave early or just get sent home because there is not enough work, that doesn't work too well if you're trying to make money from the place."
good,The company have more external activity to let staff reduce stress and release with some fun activity. They celebrate all staff birthday regardless the level of position.
good,fast paced work environment with big fluctuations in staffing depending on seasons and quarter ends. Upper management tends to make decisions with no other input and tends to constantly firefight instead of offering proactive solutions.
good,"Ingram micro was a place that you clocked in went through a metal detector, walk to your work station, collect your supplies for the day, sign in, and stretch. Boxes would come in you would open it , count the phones scan each barcode, put it back in the box and proceed to the next one. This job was very repetitive it would be the same thing till the shift was over."
good,"Very safety oriented which is good as it is a busy warehouse."
good,"As with most places, your experience will depend on your manager and department. There is room to move up and there are perks like company lunches and events."
good,"The salary as well as the work environment is good."
good,"buena empresa, salario bajo, inestable, horarios accesibles."
good,I would rather not comment in text I feel this is something that is better conveyed in person.........................................................
good,"Full time position but sometimes part time too"
good,my typical day at work was loading the ups trucks and what I learned was planning everything out so it would be easy. everyone is nice at work they greet to everyone.
good,Promocionar al personal crear politicas de linea de carrera.
good,I was pregnant at the time (casual employee) and they found it difficult to put me into an office position. Aparts from that good management and had a good team leader
good,Good company to work for if you are in the right department and working for the right  manager.  Too much micro management and lack of training.  Some managers are better than others.  I wish they all had similar style of training and work ethics.
good,pay is good. management is not. overall experience is fair. don't work here if you're not patient and cannot handle dominant personalities and constant change.
good,"Open to change, yet unorganized.  Laid back, yet a little of the blame game.  Small compension, yet paid lunches often.  Management fighting amongst themselves."
good,"Most days began with reading e-mails to obtain the priority for the day, as priorities frequently changed from day to day, then I would typically distribute the work load amongst employees.  I learned a lot at this opportunity, dealing with high pressure situations and handling others in order to meet the pressures of these situations.  Management was good but there were outside circumstances that created  an environment of disorder.  The hardest part of the job was the up and down  environment, constant work schedule changes and priority changes.  The  best part was the people, there are really good people out there!"
good,"Los colegas ,demasiada presión y mal compañerismo, no aprendí nada en ese trabajo, un día típico muy aburrido."
good,"we cost adjust manual invoices on a daily basis from emails that arrive in an email box, between 40 to 50 emails daily to three portals to which there can be over 90 cost adjustments waiting to be completed. we have an Hours SLA on each mail and i work in a team of two people."
good,"On a daily basis, I entered orders on Impulse system, checked order placements against reserve inventory, and the Back Orders. I also awaited verification of discounts, and while there, I learned about the IT industry and various forms of technology."
good,"When working at Ingram micro everyone that wasn’t Indian felt like we had to over work ourselves to keep our jobs. It wasn’t as diverse as they say during orientation seems like they catered to their race more than others. It was several races at this job include Black,Mexican,White,and Chinese. But the managers and hire ups would celebrate their holidays by letting them take the day off to celebrate the holiday. When it came around to Thanksgiving we were told that we would work early so we can get out before it started getting dark. Everyone agreed to come because they said we would be out by 6 pm to be with our families. Turned out that they changed the time as we were working the shift telling us that we had to stay late. Everyone was upset that they changed it and my boyfriend who was working at the time went to the managers and told them that they couldn’t keep us because no one brought food thinking we were getting out early and we also didn’t have lunch because of the same reason. In the end they let the people that wanted to leave go,I think it was a bad call to say that we were getting out early when they had no intention to"
good,need to add better benefits and comp plans. Can have a fun environment. Work life balance is non existent. Most jobs are 100% in the office all the time.
good,It was pretty much alot of work as well as long hours. U really didn't know what time u got off from work until you get there. Overall it was okay and pretty fair
good,Working for Ingram started as a temp position that I was on to long and expected to be full time sooner. The pros to the job is that it’s flexible. The cons are low pay and odd shifts.
good,"It was not a bad job, but a bad work environment. Management did not help in keeping it a professional workplace. I would have loved to grow within the company."
good,"Company lacks vision, communication, safety, follow through and consistency. A very run first culture with little to no problem solving or lean practices throughout. "
good,"FM houdt zicht bezig met het schoonhouden van de gebouwen (40.000 m2 (excl. de verdiepingsvloeren) In tegenstelling tot andere afdelingen mogen FM medewerkers overal in het gebouw komen en hebben daarmee en signalerende en rapporterende functie over de status van onderhoud en schoonmaak."
good,"Was part of a changing space at Ingram.  Many acquisitions at the same time created confusion and inability to provide services to customers.  The flux in the management did not provide a clear vision as to what was needed at the time, nor the ability to fully function in the job position.  Today the division I was part of is no longer in play."
good,The opportunity to learn and grow is amazing with great resources.  Depending on your superior you will have a great or bad experience. The people are great to work with.
good,"Ask the same question to management and get different answers, sometimes even on the same day.  Most likely this is because they are looking at the days projected revenue stream,  but this leads to an inconsistency in expectations and workflow, as well as overall quality. As well as just poor quality as Standard operating procedure are ignored and rarely implemented. Leading to confusion."
good,The hardest part of Job to make management understand about the market. and the most enjoyable part you can continue a monotonous job till the time you want with a lot of pressure even if that task is possible or not. People survive by blaming others and taking credit of other works.
good,"Its a ok place to work. The managers have peesonal agendas. Its best to learn as,much as u can and move on. Great place to learn some skills you could use at other places of employment."
good,"Ingram est une entreprise sympa en tant que jeune diplômé, pour se faire une première expérience . On a pas mal de responsabilités et d'autonomie, en revanche le salaire est vraiment scandaleux et les opportunités d'évolution très rares. Le CE n'organise rien.  Le service RH n'est pas des plus compétent, ils aiment enchaîner les CDD et annoncer à l'employé qu'il reste ou qu'il part le dernier jour de son contrat, ce n'est pas très respectueux . Malgré tout une bonne ambiance générale règne mais c'est surtout grâce aux animations financées par les fournisseurs. Restaurant d'entreprise pratique."
good,"At ingram, you have to be willing to do hard labor work. Over time is a mandatory thing for everyone. It was hard to balance your personal life with your work life because the hours pretty much took that person time away."
good,"Ingram is a good temporary job to get by. It pays well and is mostly just a Monday-Friday job. Its a little fast paced as far as work load goes, but a the team approach is nice. The management was a little all over the place at the time, but they were working to improve. Some people get hired on full time, but some do not. For me my temporary assignment ended, and I did not get hired on."
good,"Ingram has changed a lot even since 2015. Until you get to the executive mngt level there is a lot of mediocrity. Increasingly very young people being hired, quantity not quality."
good,good compensation. work life balance could be better.  current executive leadership is providing better overall direction.  Culture is not the best.  Job security is definitely not optimal.
good,"Upper management stated there were opportunities for growth within organization.  No such positions were available.  One person was responsible for all office duties, accounting, order and customer service.  No appreciation from management."
good,Great place to work. Make you feel like you can get help but when you try to you won't get it. Example you go tell a supervisor that you need help with a task they say they will help the next day they dont and keep butting it off on till you keep reminding them everyday. Also some departments always ask for help yet don't help back when they don't have work...
good,resume at work by 8am and close by 2pm because it was a part time job. co workers are mostly friendly and we work like a team. I left the job due to relocation and also to look for a full time job.
good,Most employees work an average between four and seven hours per day. Some work overtime. The company should do a better job managing resources.
good,Great company to work for. Needs a stronger leadership team that has a better understanding of the always changing trends in technology and plan and execute according to it.
good,Worked many long days particularly over the holidays.
good,working 8 hrs a week and on the weekend. Learned how to unload trucks. Management and Coworkers was very polite people.The hardest job was stocking shelves. The most enjoyable part of job was waiting on the customers.
good,It had alot of over time and pressing work levels but it was ok
good,"In general, a typical day at Ingram Micro is basically learn at your expense.They don't offer too much of training. You usually discover the objective of the job, by learning on your own. Overall, the work is not as hard to learn, but the work does not compensate for the pay that is given."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo es informal, muy orientado a resultados, ritmo de trabajo elevado.En general buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,Good benefits that's the only good thing. Pay raise forget about it. If you get a pay raise it will be so small that you want even see it. Working hard no advancements
good,I just glad I found a new job but I thank Ingram Micro for giving me a opportunity. I worked very hard their and I meet a lot of cool people over the years I spent their.
good,The work to pay ratio isn't great. It's a very high paced work environment. While working here I transferred from RF to Data Clerk but the advancements were extremely limited.
good,I appreciate the work experience but the people there are not right there is a bad race problem but i did learn alot from working there and how to deal with people
good,High volume distributor for e-commerce. expect to have long busy days with an extreme focus on quality. UPS/ FED-X loading is the highest demand in the company
good,Overall a Decent place to work
good,"Every year they do layoffs to try and stay profitable. Some of them make sense and others do not. The upper management says they care, but the actions speak otherwise. In engineering things are different, but in most other departments there is too much politics and drama. They say they want you to have a good work life balance but then you have so much work that you end of working late every night and weekends."
good,We did excercise and did lots  walking got along with most people meet lots of different people the staff is a rude most of the time I really don't have much else to say they will do what right for them
good,"My position changed from front desk to being locked behind doors in a little room with three other women all talking at once,  Then my position was eliminated because the level of phone calls decreased."
good,Great job start off a career with a big company but no real advancement. Pay rate isn't the greatest due to the competitive environment. Floor managers are easiest people to work with as you do your work and time they don't bug you however the upper management is something else. They're just hard to get a long with and don't listen to employees when they voice their opinions.
good,"On a daily basis I would take phone calls, process quotes/order and work my pipeline. I had focus accounts where I would provide white glove service to their account specially."
good,"High work pressure, high retention but the company invest a lot in technology so a good chance to work on new innovations."
good,Assisted the Sales Team in completing requests and making sales to our direct customers. Managed an exclusive E-Mail Inbox which dealt directly with hundreds of customer requests from various partnered corporations regarding sales and inquiries of different offered services. Responded promptly to customer E-Mails and provided extensive information and various options to best suit their specific needs.Management was very Hands-Off which at times caused issues due to problems remaining unaddressed. Work volume could sometimes be overwhelming.
good,"Highly competitive salaries, stock plans, 401k matching, high bonus potential."
good,Management lacks leadership and overall interest in employees advancement. Outside culture reigns over American companies cultures. Corporate employees are given preference over locals.
good,"Fast Paced job environment"
good,"Overall good place to work if you are looking for just that, a job.  I felt as though there was a conflict of values/direction concerning performance management.  Absolutely no advancement opportunities nor is there an effort to develop individual growth.  If all you are interested in is a ""9-5"" then I highly recommend IMM, but if you are in it for more I highly recommend that you continue searching.  Good luck!"
good,Not a happy place to work as the  management is not taking right decision to maintain associates work life balance. frequent decession being changed..
good,its a good opportunity to prove my talent and improve my skill and knowledge
good,my honest opinion is that the pay is good but not a good place to work if your family orientated.
good,typical 8 hour shift job. Many temps made the job harder. Was really confused on who was in charge
good,"company is only seasonal, but will work you great hours during season, after season dont want to keep you busy"
good,I like to diagnose the equipment that every body has problems with and finding new more efficient ways to repair equipment. I share my knowledge and experience to help the maintenance team. My typical day starts at 0500 a.m. I clock in and go to the forklift area where I log in to my computer and send out a status report of the forklift fleet then I assist in repairs on the conveyors and all other equipment in the facility. I interact with lead technician on daily status.
good,"• Prepared and edited correspondence, invoices, reports etc"
good,"This warehouse is a very big, hot warehouse. You have to work at a fast pace up and down stairs."
good,"Hay supervisores intocables, que son unos patanes sin valores."
good,"This environment welcomed a great deal of learning expernice it truly tested your orginzational skills and time managment skills. But as well your work life balance is affected deeply because you did not go home till the order were picked, packed and shipped"
good,Solo eres útil hasta que ellos te necesitan. Sabes a la hora que entras y no tienes hora fija de salida.
good,"I enjoyed my job duty and responsibility however colleagues and coworkers as well as management was not enjoyable. This place is not ideal to work as a temp as considering regardless how well you work, you will be released In January after peak season."
good,The company is fairly conventional considering they are an IT company. Politics is also still seen in the ranks. They attribute success only to the company's performance and not to the people which make tenure not really that important.
good,IMM should upgrade the standards for employment and abide by the appraisal and evaluation base on commitment and passion. They should not turned down qualified worker especially at the level of Masters degree.
good,If the managers weren't members of the good old boys club they would have been competent.  They had to redo everything every few months because they could never foresee obvious issues.  When areas ran well they screwed it up.  Played favorites with family to the companies and customers detriment.  Literally removed the actual manager for a figurehead manager and the work 7 people did suddenly took 18 people to fail at.  Don't forget the Racism and Sexism.  Not in the way you think.  Pretty girls got away with murder and survived cuts and minorities were untouchable with multiple reports of threatening and insubordinate behavior.
good,"I currently enjoy working at Ingram.  Associates have a lot of opportunities to grow and advance. Work/Life balance could be improved, but long hours are sometimes needed to support the business."
good,"Great people, good exposure to technology, higher than average staff turnover, interesting opportunities and so much more! Change is constant: the overall experience has been a positive."
good,"This company allowed me to bring in the expertise and skills I have obtained being in the BPO industry for 13 years now. There is a lot of room for improvement in terms of solidifying internal processes and creating new ones in the lack thereof. Needs a lot of improvement in terms of hiring and/or promoting the right leaders because people have become stagnant due to the lack of efficient leaders especially those that are home-grown. There is very little focus on developing talents that were internally promoted, and a culture of being satisfied with mediocrity."
good,Ingram Micro at the time I was there was a high energy environment in a dynamic industry. Since then it was acquired by a Chinese firm so I don't know what life is like there now.
good,"I'm grateful for the opportunity of having worked there but I have 2 cents I'd like to share. I hope it doesn't take away the fact that its an amazing organization to work for."
good,"it is a good place for a first job experience. not so good of a pay rate, but for the job to be not so stressful it is good. overall i give it a three stars."
good,Worked there during the dot com bust and things changed drastically.  Looked for other employment during that time because hours  had been cut. Great crew and management
good,Ingram Micro helps businesses fully realize the promise of technology.TM No other company delivers the full spectrum of global technology and supply chain services to businesses around the world. Start-up feeling at a large company. Building processes from the ground up.  Great People! Great support teams!
good,"There is a lot opportunity to grow. Co-workers are very friendly and supportive. The hardest part is on 4th quarter, employees has to work longer hours. Great place for people who enjoy a fast paste environment."
good,Iam still an employee of Ingram Micro and one thing never cahnges... we Are required to be here if there is work. No If's and's or buts... We continue to work 10 hour day's 6 day's a week... because our staffing is based off of forecast and not actual work... Its been a hard 8 years.. but the people i work for and with has alway's made it enjoyable.
good,"The 2016 increment letter day when boss give all associate appraisal letter, that day when my turn come boss has given me the letter with 0 %  then i asked why you do this to me boss says in 2014 i had given you 35 % percent that is why this year management decide those associate who taken promotion at the time off roll to on roll we have already given them 30-35 % that is why they does not give us any amount, that day i am so upset just because they did not inform us about that. that is why i want quit my this JOB."
good,The job it self wasn't bad it's how they worked 6 days to 7days a week. The supervisors where very rude. The company it's self isn't to bad the work you do is simple just the way you get treated makes you not want to work there.
good,Since Brightpoint became Ingram it has fallen way down hill.  My trust in superiors is gone and my expectations are buried.
good,"A good team supporting the Latin America Side however the operations will be transfer to another country."
good,"Entering account data by inputting alphabetic and numeric information on keyboard or optical scanner according to screen format. "
good,"You'll learn how to use RF Scanner, you learn how a basic warehouse works and this is a mediocre place to work the only people who work here are people who cant afford to quit except the manager and corporate people. also if you get hired by a recruiting agency please quit immediately and get directly hired by a company they'll be taking off your check more than taxes"
good,"The job at Ingram Micro was easy. The management was okay. The hardest part of the job was standing throughout the entire shift. A typical days work included picking, packing, and shipping customer orders."
good,Company never prepared you for layoffs.  You would see it on the news and press would be at the front door upon arriving at work which made it an uncomfortable environment to work at.
good,Every day at work was the same. We would go in and kit and assemble product. There really wasn't much learned at this job. I really didn't feel the management was very professional. The co-workers were very nice. The hardest part of the job was not having enough personal time to myself outside of the job. Especially not being able to spend time with my daughter.
good,"Siempre preocupados del desarrollo de cada empleador , "
good,This was a good job for young people.
good,travail typique : s’enrichit au fil de l'évolution dans la sctée
good,"Visiting Customers, selling programs, IT products and services."
good,"Very fragmented strategic leadership, conflicting priorities, many projects started and dropped halfway through. Legacy systems make it difficult to innovate at scale."
good,I was required to work no less than 11 hours a day 6-7 days a week during peak season. Always on my feet having to meet daily pick count. Started the day by clocking in and getting a headset to read me orders while I went to specified sections to pick and put in to a tote ready for delivery.
good,A typical day at work consists of preparation as a driver I have to stand in line for PIT and gather tools harness for lift truck safety equipment. I spend most of the day picking and labeling items for shipping.
good,The warehouse I worked at was nice and had a good culture.  But when things moved to the other warehouses they were very disorganized.  The job tends to have a lot of overtime as well.
good,"Ingram Micro is overall good place to work. They have a great security concern and work hard each day to improve employee's security as well as the production safety. Indeed, they need to improve a lot in some field such as the relation between the management and employees. The HR and whomever it may concern need to train Leads and Supervisors on how to talk to employee and treat them like they wanted to be treated."
good,It is a very fast paced job which keeps you engaged. The company is constantly being bought and sold so there are may changes which sometimes negatively impact employees. The workplace culture can make it hectic to work there because there is no accountability which really hurts the workplace morale especially for the good employees who give it their all.
good,It was A good job it was just management didn't keep up good with our hours. We received extra holiday pay and it was worth it but it took you away from your family.
good,It's a good place to work at for the money as well as opportunity to move around. No processes in place. Low margins on products they sell resulting in low bonuses and salary increases.
good,"The company has a lot going for it, but leadership has trouble defining a clear strategy and maintaining a clear direction so things seem disjointed.  There are a handful of very good managers who could represent positive examples for the rest of the organization to follow."
good,"Easy picking path the hours are crazy though"
good,Management turnover was very high which made things more complicated and difficult to accomplish goals.  Although Finance/Asset team was great as they were the only area with stability.
good,"I would work 8- 10 hours 2nd shift monday thru friday. During November to December is peek hours, where you would work 10-12 hours everyday until customer needs were met. Work was hard on O.P. forklift where they would keep track of your percentage. On pallet runner was less physical work, but had to make sure priority lane shipments were down at shipping. Benefits are very good, but pay a little on the low side. Management is better than it was, but need to address better communication and work hour fairness."
good,"best place to upgrade knowledge and latest IT technology. offering huge opportunity for technology hunger, fun environment with full activities and happiness"
good,Ingram Commercial and Lifecycle Services continues to grow into new business sectors an open new sites.  The company has been successful in rebranding itself and consolidating some of recent acquisitions in mobility and handsets.
good,"great place to work at. a fun friendly environment, however, lacked leadership."
good,in a typical day of work i come  in get my orders and head over to being my day in inbound or outbound duties. complete daily task and give hand off..
good,Healthy environment. Most of the employees has a positive attitude. That could be because they are enjoying their job and working for this company. Good management on our end since there are different process.
good,"So so place to work , close to home with good time (schedule) for myself and I like the shift that I am worked, but dues to not enough work or running out of work so we all let go by the company after more than 12 years."
good,"Ingram distributes product for companies such as Walmart, Amazon and Overstock.com. So, there is a variety of product being received and shipped. There is forklift operator positions(cherry picker, stand up reach, pallet jack), shipping , receiving, stocking, and order picking positions. It tops out at roughly $18 over 15 years or so."
good,"El aprendizaje que se obtiene en el área es enriquecedor. "
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is the ownership that we take, it all goes down how much you want to be responsible, day to day it is challenging and we can expect surprises how much planned to are since we work with discreet teams and systems."
good,Terrific place to work at.  Open forum to speak.  Currently synergising recent acquisitions and also being recently acquired.   Company and personnel will become more competitive with time.
good,Its not a bad place to work even though  u are on contract  which  really sucks u only have to have good luck  to get a permanent  position  there of course
good,"A typical day at work, I would come in early to get my area ready to count, so employees were not just standing around after our daily meeting. Hardest part was waiting around to count because orders were not completed and everything needed to be transacted  before we could count. This often happened when production worked over time.  "
good,Large global company competing in a very competitive distribution environment.  Very P&L focused with weekly reviews on performance vs plan. Recent global re-structuring has lost focus in some of the key strategic pillars of growth.  Company was just purchased by a large Chinese company.
good,"Typical day at workm first 2 hours organized you task. Call conference with stake holders, project managers and change managers and the whole team.I learned a lot in this company. the  pressure is always there and the squeezing of brain juices. The hardest part is when the project is near the deadline and the big chunk of it is undone. The enjoyable part is we get to travel."
good,Co-workers are amazing. Management is alright and they have a decent benefits package. Tools are ancient which is sad for an IT company.
good,"In response to the expulsive growth of the computer and technology information (IT) industry beginning in the early 1990’s, the company grew rapidly.  The competitive nature of the distribution business demanded constant changes in order to differentiate and take advantage of market share. The environment was challenging but also provided the opportunity personal development and career advancement. Management was very supportive of associate’s development through training and promotion."
good,"Good old way. Great people, great work. Great benefits. Treat associates well and everyone got along. One of a kind, sorry it had to go away."

good,Good people. Poor Managers in some areas. Corporate mentality in a smaller package.
good,A good place to do teamwork. is a good experience working there you learn too much that you can use a different place in the future that may be needed.
good,"We have been through a few HR Managers and HR Generalists and so far all have failed."
good,I believe there is a huge lack of communication gap in the workplace. Voices are not being heard and it leaves some employees feeling unappreciated and taken for granted. For some positions the pay does not reflect the effort put forth by the employee which only adds to the feeling of being underappreciated.
good,It’s a ok job when you need some where to get started take care of yourself and family I had a lot going on in my like where I could not juggle the job
good,It’s a ok place just very unorganized at time. People not knowing what to do when they get on the floor also training people different ways instead of the same
good,Ingram was a good company to work but they don't pay good. They was paying only $9 per hour for second shift. They job seem easy but they salary was not good.
good,"If you should choose to find another job, they will replace you with someone with little or no experience the next day and not think twice about it. They have 4 temp agencies on site with a number of employees needed for operation. Once hired full time, you are still just a number."
good,"Nice place to work, easy work and a great environment. free tea, coffee. security at check-in and they are always ready to assist. I will work here again if I have the chance"
good,"In my 1 year and 8 mos of working at Ingram Micro I have learned a lot especially with how the business works. It is my first time to have a job and still it gave me a chance to start my career. The only downside of it is I am working on a graveyard shift since my job post is supporting North America. Other than that, my whole experience was fun. I was able to meet a lot of people, engaging in day to day tasks and attending different work related functions and parties."
good,This was a contract job with no hope for permanent hire. Relued on extension of the contract to keep the job. These days its so hard to find a permanent job.
good,"Wonderful place to work, little disorganized when I was there.  Constant turnover not sure about now it has been a few years since I worked there.  Good place to start."

good,"⦁	Directed day-to-day operations focused on attainment of key business metrics"
good,"Ingram Micro was a great place to learn and grow. As a large company, sometimes they stifled themselves with their own policies. I had some of the best VP's I have ever been privileged to work with."
good,Ingram Micro acquired Shipwire in 2013.  Shipwire maintained it's start up culture for a while.  I learned a lot through the the transition as it was challenging.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the smart and talented people I work with.
good,Great place to work and see what is happening in the world and how we want to make things work.   now we must focus on who reports to who and what their focus should be.
good,great people and a overall good company to work for. I t has its ups and downs like any company. I guess you can say you can grow in the company or you can hate it.
good,It was a safe clean work environment and I like the work pace. They treat their employees with the up most respect. Nice laid-back environment to work in
good,"Lugar físico de trabajo cómodo bien ubicado, se trabaja mucho y no reconocen méritos."
good,The pay wasn't really all that for forklift drivers. and i didn't feel comfortable there anymore like I did at first. I learned that sometimes management didn't care about the employees and there wasn't really any team work.
good,Ingram is a world class technology distributor with passionate people and a very diverse portfolio of manufacturers and offerings. There is a growing focus on services and cloud offerings.
good,Management issues. Some departments have to d managers while others like to put way too much pressure on employees and do not talk respectful to temps.
good,Over all a good place to work equipment is up to date easy to pull orders fast pace work place. Lots of different departments to learn great break room
good,The job is satisfying work.  You will be on the road 2 to 3 days per week.  Compensation is adequate with overtime pay and per diem.  The communication lines are fuzzy at times.  You have to deal with a lot of little issues much of the time.
good,In the four quarter is the High season you need to work 7 days a weeak mandatory is the only season in the year you make good money. In my experience at receiving department people don't help each other and try to make you in trouble with supervisor all the time
good,"Ingram Micro is good company to work but most of the mid level Management are more 45+ years age persons. "
good,The employees are great to work with.  The company provided a good working relationship with its vendors.  The company offered safety training to all employees.

good,"The management is good and the people are friendly, it was a good experience for me. "
good,"Some days are busy and other days it can be slow."
good,"In the beginning Ingram micro was about its employees, but over time it began to focus too much on advancing its productivity requirements. we used to have department parties, sponsored company events. all of that went away, focus shifted and everybody felt the stress. the tighter they gripped the more mistakes were made and eventually we lost clients thus driving productivity standards even harder still. Some of the managers understood that we were headed in a bad direction, but there was nothing they, or any of us could do about it. I heard from some of my co-workers after i was let go that it only got worse. People left in droves either because they were made to like me, or because they simply couldn't stand it anymore. I loved ingram micro when i started. It's always sad when you see a place you think of as home die slowly around you with nothing you can do to stop it. I sincerely hope that some day the higher ups figure it out and take the company back to what we were."
good,"Over all a good company to work for"
good,"Overall a good place to work, however each year seems to bring about a new direction for the company. Worked in a couple roles that allowed me to see how many areas of the business operated."
good,Ingram Micro is a good stepping stone to start your career and move to a higher paying job to a reseller or vendor. Each department has their own views and follow their own criteria.
good,"During the time that I worked here.  I was just so happy to be working here, it was a good job to have at the time and plus it was close to where I lived at the time.  This was a good job to have and also a good experience, but it was a temp job only.  The job was not hard at all."
good,"There are times where in political is on for this company. But I loved my work here, the people in my department were very kind and helpful. This was my first job for a BPO industry and I tend to love it, but as time passes there things that is beyond your control and it tend to change."
good,I was responsible for scanning all the product that was shipping. Its was a fast paced job for the season of Christmas. You had to stand all day while scanning the items.
good,"I worked in the special pricing department , pricing computer software  for certain sellers. "
good,"Nice work culture ! The culture of the company is good. People I worked with were good. However, transitioned to another company with better pay and more career advancement opportunities."
good,"It was a short term job though the temporary company. My job was easy in my opinion but they keep me in that position because I was good at it, but I wanted to advance."
good,"it was very entertainig to work at ingram micro i learned a lot and the workplace culture, i met a lot of very hardworking people and really enjoy the job it was my first big job on a very large company."
good,"I am very appreciative to have been given the opportunity to work there for over 20 years and was fortunate enough to have been exposed to various departments and tools which was extremely helpful when when doing reporting and BI.  (360 degree view of the company!) The company was recently bought out by another company, so there are many changes currently in the works.  I am sure they will continue to thrive once things are settled."
good,It was a good place to work. I have no complaints. The cafeteria is honestly the best part. They have caterers every week or you can choose food that you want.
good,"Clean and structured place to work. Professional people working there and kind. Work environment was clean and orderly, security was good and not confining."
good,"learned team work , work under pressure , patinas and many more .,"
good,great job for emergencies but the pay is very low even with over time people have second jobs    they need to pay more in all departments and work better with peoples schedule the work is easy but the pay is horrible cannot survive with that bad pay
good,Lots of opportunities for improvement and learning. Environment can be stressful. Occasionally work long hours. Highly demanding but good benefits and salary.
good,it is a huge company with a lot of old processes. You can learn a lot if you just finished school. Great to start a career and learn from different perspectives. Ingram Micro protects their associates and gives the opportunity to change roles and learn from other areas. It is a very complex business and learning curve it is lower than other industries.
good,"Would recommend but does not pay enough. Pros"
good,lots of favoritism .employees are not rewarded for their hard work. nothing much to say about this place other than its just a job just like any other warehouse job.
good,medium level talent and only way to advance the business is to reduce opex in senior leadership view.  Company has done lots of acquisitions but has not invested in systems to leverage.  Very manual with a ton of administrative work.
good,"An open environment with offices only for VPs and above. On paper this increases collaboration, but I often felt isolated and out of place. The acquisition by a foreign conglomerate caused unrest."
good,"Work is not that hard"
good,"A typical day at Ingram was straight forward until the end of your shift. You may have a client's request at the last minute that would add an additional three plus hours to your eight hour shift; or your done for the day. Knowing how many hours one would work at the start of your day was always unpredictable. On the other hand the amount of experience one could gain was close to limitless. Ingram's clients always wanted what was current and trending therefore it kept its employee's current in the IT field. Management was always on deck and worked with its employees's from time to time. To insure all projects got out with high quality, and in a timely fashion. The hardest part of my position was my schedule. Knowing what time to be at work, but not knowing what time I would get off was truly a challenge. The most enjoyable part of my position was my work environment and the access I had to further my career."
good,I've learnt a lot of new things about computers and how to use them more effective. Also I have learnt a lot of useful things about customer support.
good,No cumplen con las 40 horas por semana lo que no posibilita una estancia adecuada con las necesidases previstas.

good,ingram is good.soimetimes there'e ups and dowm/ i don't like no specific time and mandatory over time. overtime should be voluntary request first before mandatory.pPeople should be respected
good,"Het team waarin ik werkte was gezellig. De sfeer was open en informeel. De druk lag daarintegen wel hoog. Voor mij was het werk te complex. Te veel uitzonderingen. Ik mis de diversiteit. Ik was de hele dag bezig met de status van zendingen controleren, de mailbox bijhouden en issues oplossen waar nodig. Ik heb uitdaging nodig en mis het contact met klanten / chauffeurs / leveranciers."
good,"typical warehouse environment, pay is a little low, not much opportunity for advancement.  would recommend for an entry level position slightly above minimum wage."
good,"Your role and responsibilities vary depending on the vendor line you cover. Some lines are more proactive and allow you to work the business side of the role, while others are more reactive and you barely have time to take a lunch it's so busy."
good,Company focused on low cost to their customers and that translates to how they treat their employees. Good work may sometimes be recognized but not rewarded properly.
good,I been here for almost a year now I've grown to this job like my home but I think it's time for me to advance to another job. My dislike about Ingram micro is that they over work you with little pay.

good,"it is a very challenging role with lot of learning involved. round the clock, work pressure and ability to deliver within the timelines makes the job enthusiastic."
good,This was a fun company back when the company was growing leaps and bounds.  The sales team had a chance to help customer and win a lot of gifts for selling a new vendor everyday.  Great place to learn about all the different vendors.
good,"Good place to work. Place is employee friendly. Good work life balance. Good hike percentage."
good,"Good one to start a corporate career"

good,Ingram is very proactive in educating their employees and training them. Management is positive in their day to day interaction with their employees.
good,"friendly staff nice environment management wasn't that good, but in general isn't bad place to work for if you starting career. Is huge company and very good on your resume"
good,"The people are fairly friendly but that is where it ends for me. Overtime was mandatory especially on weekends, I lasted as long as I did because of the people. Overall its not too bad."
good,"- Typical Day at work is order entry and answering calls"
good,"Ingram made me more active and increased my thought process, approach, learned a lot. Perfect place for freshers. Kept me engaged with work and updated in market"
good,"It is a productive place to work. I had been working 40 hours per a week in my over 3 years experiences. Each day at work, I start with energy and go home not completely out of energy. Also, I learned data entry skills there and became very efficient on the forklift operation. Moreover, my co-workers are good people to work with. There is no one day that we have blamed each other. If you did a mistake, you own it. And the hardest part of the job is being very mindful of every detail in data entry, missing even a small detail affect the company. The enjoyable part of my job is sitting at the table when entering the data on a computer. However, I have been working as a temp for over 3 years."
good,"Most days I get in early so I get emails done.  Check daily orders and get it done before going to work. If completed ahead of time,  I also extend assistance to my collagues who need extra help."
good,"Was certainly a different kind of company to work for. Security so tight, even employees struggled and/or didn't bother to go on breaks due to the fact, by the time you got through security check, break was over. Management behaviors with employees was not the greatest also was not fond of mass termination of staff on exactly the day healthcare would have begun."
good,Great experience to be had.   There are many opportunities to learn about a wide array of technology solutions.  The people come from many different backgrounds so there is plenty of experience to learn from.
good,"Work was quick to pick up on... A lot of movement so no need for the gym :) "
good,"The company grew in ten years from $250M to $2B in sales. That pace of grwoth created opportunities for personal development and career advancement. Overtime we lost the benefits of the intimacy of the small group to an expanse global corporate structure. That was not all bad because a lot of subject matter experts had the privilege to work in other countries to share their expertise and gain a wealth of knowledge from the other side."
good,"Typical day at work support 500 + users, trouble shoot daily issues, configuring servers, desktops and other equipment, I’ve learned  a lot and keep learning, other coworkers they have been good to me we have a good team."

I learned how to use an RF Scanner and a list to pick orders at this job. I also learned to use a ""popcorn machine"" to fill boxes to ensure damage is not done to product. Management was nice. Coworkers were fine, The hardest part was all the physical strain as you are constantly walking in steel-toed shoes. The best part was there was always something to do."

good,I was hired for third shift during peak season and stayed for awhile after and it was just slow. not enough work for everyone. lot of people doing notthing
good,Indeed is forcing me to comment on Ingram Micro.  I would prefer not because everyone has different experiences.  I learned much and worked many hours.
good,I just work there with my colleagues in a good relationship and enjoy the job. Watching out the safety rules as working in that busy warehouse is my first priority.  Thanks for the working opportunity that indeed gave me.
good,The management was good and made the job easier but you never knew when you were going to go home each day and the pay for the work was not fair! Some days your standing around looking for work and getting scolded about your productivity and others there so much work you go home in 10 to 11 hours and they don’t tell you until the last minute
good,Losse bedrijfscultuur wat echter niet altijd resulteert in optimale efficientie. Leuk bedrijf om voor te werken maar er is weinig coaching en/of sturing.
good,"This is very much a learning organization - consistently sending out surveys to employees for feedback and insight.  Information is searchable internally - you should be able to find answers to your own questions.  However, with that being said - you will appear to be an idiot if you don't know how to use all the tools at your fingertips. The interaction (million scheduled meetings/activities) between superiors and entry-level employees seem a bit robotic/forced.  This company still needs to find an authentic balance between our advanced tech-communications and our actual human resources/interactions."
good,Its a decent job if your looking to move up ingram is a hard place to do that the people are welcoming to all new employees. In the summer it is very hot in the winter it id very cold

The benefit package once you become full time is AWESOME REALLY REALLY GOOD !! The main  reason I stayed as long as I did oh and some of the managers and workers are really nice I miss them...... But my review is my opinion You  may have a better experience especially since it has new Management changes are being made for the better hopefully......
good,N/A for my position Nice work place too far to drive.  I like the staff but out sourcing is a high idea.  I completed all project assigned but travel distance is an issue.
good,Its decent. Not a bad place to work. I just require more things to do to better improve myself. I enjoy to learn new things all the time to add to my skill base.
good,Work days long . Learned bit about the organization. The management team was decent. The workplace culture was diverse. The hardest part was the long hours.

Attendace is based on points that are limited up to 3.5 for Teporary associates versus Full time associates whom are given up to 12 before equalling termanation.  They make sure you know the just of your area.  The only frustrating thing at this job is the question in which you will go home,  you never know."

good,This review is based on my experience with Ingram Micro back in 2004-2005.  There is a cafeteria but main buildings are very old-school with putty colored walls.  Not a real exciting place to work and management seems to hide behind closed doors.
good,Ingram Micro provides is a very prefessional and friendly environment to work at.
good,"You'll get an in-depth look at the machinery that runs international organizations at Ingram Micro. The experienced team and management will be valuable assets to anyone looking to learn and grow as a professional. I, specifically, garnered a detailed understanding of the developing cloud marketplace and its implications for the future of business. I enjoyed learning about what industry heavyweights like Amazon and IBM where doing to position themselves to deliver value to stakeholders and partners leveraging cloud technology. The abundance of employee perks and benefits serves, at least in part, to amend for the salaries that are, on average, slightly below market value for comparable positions. The career advancement and opportunity conversation also varies between departments and management staff rather than being a company-wide culture of employee development. Therefore, as should be the case regardless, you may need to take more ownership of your personal career path as in some cases no clear path is identified even when inquired about. All told, Ingram is a large company with many resources that can be a great place to start or build a career. All the tools and knowledge is present and available to make a position with the company a valuable and fulfilling one."

good,Start by logging in on a R.F scanner. Use scanner to scan label on customers orders which then tells you where item is located and how much minutes you have to generate that order.
good,Het is een prettig bedrijf om te werken.  Zeer productief en de leidinggevenden doen hun werk goed
good,If you're a crucial part of day to day operations in your building management will not let you move up to management if there's no one to replace you.
good,Nice company to work for with good security and work ethics in the job. Some departments have good managers while others like to put way too much pressure on employees and do not talk respectful.
good,A fun workplace with good teams and supportive manager. A learning environment altogether with a chance to learn something new everyday. Fun events happening every once in 2 months.
good,Some manager don't care about what you have going on in your personal life outside of work... But some problems like wrecking your car o. The way to work... They don't care you will get a point for that day an they still expect  u to come to work.... Then if you half awards or PTO  to use you need to stay on top of cause they  dont care to tell unless you asked to avoid getting fired or anything....

good,"Ingram Micro has such a diverse collection of operations under one roof that working in analytics exposes you to a great variety of applications, more so than you might get at a smaller or more industry focused firm.  The corporate culture is fantastic, though with the corporate office located in California and the main operations office in Buffalo, the upper management can be a bit disconnected from the rank and file."
good,very busy job. can go fro very slow to very busy so you must be prepared for all the changes that comes with that. i will recommend Ingram to anyone.
good,I enjoyed working here because I like the fast pace jobs. There was always someone there to help if there ever was a question or issue you had. The management was very nice and the co workers where great to work with as well. The hardest part of this job was not being able to get hired through the company because of how many temporary people they hired for seasonal work.
good,"I loved the fast paced environment and high energy.  The company also offered a lot of on site services which was very nice.  They did, however, seem to restructure every year or two and that typically led to RIF.  Job security was always in question."
good,"I supervise over 50 people on my shift. I have a Team Lead and great associates who work hard for me. I enjoy establishing relationships with my associates and helping them grow in the business and as individuals. The hardest part is the hours and a lack of up-to-date tools to keep up with the volume that we deal with throughout the year. I have learned how to manage people well, communicate to large groups effectively, branch out by being innovated with the processes that we use from day to day and making well-discerned decisions every day."
good,"Hardest part was the fluctuating hours! Not enough room for advancement, it's all based on your evaluation no matter how biased."
good,"it was a really hard job. i learned alot. how to wrap a skid, how to pick products. the management was nice."
good,"You get a lot of skills from working here. The community at work felt more like a family and we always had celebrations for days such as christmas, eid, and diwali."
good,"My job experience was good. My manager was very nice and understanding. My position in the company was good, just didn't like when work was slow. Lost a lot of money during the slow months. Over all was a good place to work."
good,"I was very unhappy with management at my location it doesn't generalize it as the entire company. Overall was a good-paying, Good Benefits, Nice people."
good,"You come in at 6:00am everyday without knowing when you are leaving. The earliest you can leave is 2:30pm however based on work it could be a 9,10,11 or 12 hour shift."
good,"fue una experiencia grandiosa. El área donde estaba era muy facil, solo recibiamos los equipos, los contabamos y ya una vez hecho todo esto los acomodabamos en su respectivo lugar. Pero la desventaja era que tenias que estar casi todo el dia para sacar un sueldo regular."
good,"Granted it has been 15 years since I worked at Ingram; however, I find my time to have been well spent and productive. Had a great mentor that was patient and showed me the ropes and vastly improved my skill set."
good,"Ingram Micro have a lot of facility arrow the world. Some place is maybe a excellent place to work at. But the one I work is a warehouse type, so in the warehouse we have no air conditioning at all, and a lot of noise too. That is why depend where do you work at. But I think Ingram Micro is a good company to work for."
good,"Over the past five years the management changed and began to outsource IT operations both on-shore and off-shore. This led to a feeling of never knowing if your co-worker or yourself would be next to be be replaced. Before the new IT management structure was installed the place was great. We would have team building events in the park, bowling alleys and other events. But now the place is devoid of happiness"
good,"it was fast paced, every one knew what they where doing and that's good. no one really had problems with anyone. if anyone was looking to work there i would definitely recommend you going ,yes its a lot of work but you get the job done."
good,"I had the best of work experience here that made me develop skills to multi-task and learn new things in minimum time. Sometimes the work may be overwhelming, but I had great team members that helped me improve. The management were very helpful that they always offered an open door assistance that I could rely on."
good,"A typical day at work was having 5-10 min meetings to update employees about the work flow of the day, informing us of mandatory overtime, and sign safety procedures logs expected at work. What I learned at Ingram Micro are the values which include innovation, integrity, accountability, teamwork, respect, learning and social responsibilities. Management at the company was very informative, respect their employees opinion, and showed dedication of improving the safety and concerns of employees. Management would hold 30 min meetings with all shifts maybe every 2 months to inform us of directions the company was taking and would ask us of our concerns regarding any issues we had. Work Place culture was very fast paced in regards to priority packages to reach the truck in time. We all worked together as a team, but also had fun when it came to holidays. Every one knew what their position were and executed their position as best and safe as possible. The hardest part of the job was the excessive overtime and working with new workers with strong opinions which did not co-exist with your own personal values and you had to maintain a professional manner by discussing your differences with a leader. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers genuinely did care about each other and we always had each others back."
good,"It is a great place to work at if money is not what you are looking for. The people are amazing and welcome you from day one. I learned how to prioritize, speak Spanish in a business setting, and a whole lot of tricks in Microsoft office."
good,"Management and colleagues encourage and foster a healthy environment for you to succeed, grow, and work cohesively together. "
good,"Working in a warehouse had to be the most wonderful jobs I have ever had. The experience was great, only because it was easy and good pace. It made it better because some of the other workers give lots of respect."
good,"We Have 9 hours to work everyday including 1 hour Lunch."
good,Zu vie Telesales. Ansonsten sehr interessanter Arbeitsort und sehr viel technologie.
good,Long hours and a lot of week end work. I have been able to talk to the management when I have problems and they listen.  I have some nice co workers.
good,"we were always busy. co workers always discussing of what to get and what not too i never care work is work i was there too give the best of me and never complain always learning different stuff how to pick the locations of the boxes etc.., i like my job when ididnt had to deal with co workers debating on the boxes."
good,Constant challenges and learning experiences keep the job from being dull. The company strives to keep employes happy as part of the culture and constantly looks for ways to improve.
good,Great place to work. Days aren't the same and you spend much of your time learning new things about the company it's so large. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting others and providing them the support needed to accomplish a simple task or a project.

good,It was a good job though there was busy time and challenges work culture for picking items working with scanner. The job was impound and outbound and also with wagon.
good,"It was a great place to work at , it was chill and kind of relaxing, the staff was nice the supervisors were nice , everything went good and everyone got along"
good,"Supervisors offer support and training, very friendly workplace. Not high rates, usually 40 hours per week, November and December more than 60 hours week."
good,"It is a big company but in my opinion they do not reward to hard workers enaugh. They pay less than other companies like that but if you need to book a day off, you can do it when you want and it is ok for them."
good,Excellent Forward thinking company which utilizes its employees to the utmost in deciding how to execute strategic objectives on a daily basis.  Great
good,"siemre entravamos en la noche"
good,No me quejo mucho del trabajo pero hay muchos jefes q quieren mandar y no son jefes pero por preferencias los permiten
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, I enjoyed the job that I was doing. Management changed and it became all about numbers and business. Not enough people to get jobs done in a timely manner, over worked some departments."
good,The most enjoyable thing about working at Ingram was the environment. They made coming into work enjoyable and found ways to keep us energized throughout the shift.
good,Great communication within the organization excellent place to learn sales and configuration regarding process great team of diverse team within the call  wnte inside sales team

good,"Cuando llega camion de la matriz hay mucho carga de trabajo y mucho extres"
good,this is good steady work place if you doing well but the bill is too high and if they still having with company moving in and out having problem not good.
good,"Stocking products with an RF scanner. Learning how to do inventory, pick, loading and unloading, and keeping work area neat and clean. Co-workers are competitive but at the same time it was fun. Hardest part about this  job is to hit more than 80% productivity and it was also fun at the same time."
good,As with all jobs you have pros and cons. No Job Is Perfect. With that being said I enjoyed my job but what made it the best was my coworkers. We were like family for the most part. But we did have problem employees. When you get my age you learn to live with the bad as well as the good. 👍
good,"Una buena empresa para la calidad y excelencia del trabajo, la puntualidad es muy importante y la innovación"
good,"My onboarding experience was horrible thus I did not last long at IM, however, I liked their culture, the work-life balance and my manager.    Goals and expectations were not clear.  My on-boarding consisted of searching the LMS site to teach myself what I thought I needed to learn, telling my mentor what I didn't know so he could train me and talking to co-workers to find out what they do so I could figure out my role."
good,"Any typical days i didn't mind because my best friend was working there also and i could get through the day with her plus i lovw money . I've learned how and repair , type all in one job , my manager was cool but then he got moved to another spot so i got another manager and he was a not fair , my co- workers kept me motivated and happy all the time . The hardest part of my job honestly was looking and searching for the small damages , I Really enjoyed my job because i was sitting down and getting oaid 8.50/hr."
good,"Wasn't fantastic, but it was job.  Long shifts, short on people in my area. Had good hours, pay just wasn't worth it in the end.  Friendly environment."
good,The agency postition at the time of empolyment was long term. I am not aware if the direct hire benifits are good or not.
good,You are paid well but be prepared to sacrifice your personal time. You are either excited or gets exited during Town Hall meeting. Manage your time well and you will survive there.
good,"the job was ok,you learn a lot but management are so unprofessional ,no respect for woman , if you don't give them what they want you are not going nowhere ,,that's why I quite ,HR doesn't care"
good,Lots of job opportunities however management runs the company like everyone is a high school student.   Very much a call center mentality and not very professional.   Company has been sold to a Chinese company so there is an issue with that.
good,"It was productive work place. depending on how many orders they had to ship, Work can sometimes be fast paste and really slow. I just really didn't like the pay."
good,This job requires you to be on your feet all day and you are competing against your fellow workers for job advancement. Fast pace work environment.
good,At this job you will be in a warehouse where you will have to bundle up during peak season because it's not controlled temperature well mostly because the doors are constantly open as a delivery for inventory or a delivery to be sent off.
good,"Didn't really like it. Too many hours not enough growth potential. Hours always unknown whether its 10, 12 or 16. They had issues with employees coming to work which affects your schedule"
good,This place is definitely a great place to advance in ypur career and learn the most about computers the management is great and supervisor are easy going

good,"It was a good job, pays good, the schedule is not stable but overall good for a summer job for a college student. Easy orientation and easy to do overall"
good,Ingram Micro is about you and how far you want to take your career.  If you work hard and follow corporate direction you can have a long and productive career
good,"learn a lot - great people work there and it's a collaborative environment.  As we are in distribution, profit is thin so you are asked to do more with less"
good,A good organisation though some managers just don't know what they are supposed to do and that propagates to the team. Work environment differs from team to team and mostly depends on who is department head.
good,"Was looking after , West zone Service Support for HP & IBM business, RMA transaction, "
good,This company is currently reorging thier IT dept. So there is very little stability or clear vision here. If you are a sales person it works well enough.
good,I really enjoyed working here until the transferred all of the AP work over to the Shared Service Center.  Then it became just a babysitting job.  This has been
good,"this place is okay but stays hot they do not try to cool this building down at all. i had to bring my own fans and they gave our department 4 and all the doors stay closed. work is easy but the computers are a pain they are really cheap and have horrible PC's that are from like 2002. Blue IQ is horrible and has many stupid steps that are not ideal for a warehouse environment. you scan item, check item, check costumer comments and then see if it's true,bag item and every individual piece,box it then go thru the 20 plus steps of blue IQ then fill out a paper called a traveler that is just redoing what you did on computer."
good,"Productive workplace, very fast paced. Work is required on most holidays and weekends."
good,Igram Mciro is a company that needs further consolidation of policies and procedures. It would be beneficail for it to fully look at the operations and make key strategic moves to streamline process which holds the company back.
good,"definitiv unterbezahlt"
good,"there is fun work place"
good,"Ingram Micro has become an environment where process improvements are considered to be of the up most value to achieving success. "
good,"dés l'arrivé chaque personne rejoindre son équipe, ils sont sépare par zone,il y a des petits formations qui son donnés aux travailleurs pour pouvoir évoluer  en tant que magasinier;les collaborateurs sont très sympas et compréhensif, si on aime le travail on ne peut pas trouver d'aspect négatives."

good,"Long hours of work 12 hoours, you have to be quick and accurate when working with orders. "
good,"Enjoyed working there, but was only seasonal work. Management was helpful and nice."
good,I had a supportive manager and great team who were willing to teach and allowed me to adapt quickly. Though my tenure was short I would love to go back for another opportunity in the future if provided the chance.
good,"Easy and simple work, management wasn't very helpful due to not speaking English very well. Targets were very unrealistic and they would have a go at you for not hitting your targets when you have only just started"
good,"The day starts  at 6am  having two fifteen minutes br "
good,"I don't directly work for Ingram Micro so I don't have a inside track with the inner workings of the company, what I rated on was the managers and supervisors I worked with on the many projects they allowed me the change to complete on their behalf with there collaborative assistance."
good,"The expectations are impossible to obtain no matter how hard you try.  They care more about numbers instead of quality! "
good,Work and work play is balanced at Ingram Micro.  There are many team oriented activities.  It is expected to bring talent to every job but at Ingram Micro they allow you to also bring some of your personality.  The work can pile up but there are great people to help get you through it.
good,"Worked here both in the factory repairing phones and in the call center, wasn't a bad job to be honest. Pretty fun work but pay isn't great. Getting paid weekly and consistent 40hrs a week makes up for that slightly."
good,Good company to work for with room for advancement.  Friendly and professional management staff including upper management. They practice a lot of Lean Methods. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with contract negotiations every few years and deal with the possibility of lay offs because of the industry.
good,compensation and advancement were limited. everyone did the same thing - job description changed over time - great place to work if you just want a job
good,Ingram Micro worldwide is a company that you should be proud to add in your CV however the middle east model is not as professional as the global firm trying to position itself.
good,"The most that I like with working at Ingram Micro was the flex time. As long as you work 8 hours a day, it does not matter what time you check-in at work.  "
good,"Ingram is the perfect place to get on your feet. but the schedules can interfere with your kids and outside life. The people are awesome and the management could be a whole lot better. Your coworkers make the job go by a whole lot faster and are very friendly. Ive learned that job security is important, but family matters more so if you don't like being away from home a lot then I wouldn't refer it."
good,"nice working there,i had a good time being there though production was low,also i had to go back to school and make my career worthwhile....i met few people i cannot forget in the life i have lived and i hope those people just remain the way they were...."

good,Ingram Micro was an awesome experience to meet different cultures. Great work environment with possible advancements.
good,"Great people, interesting work. The industry is very dynamic and it is a great place to start a career. Most days are administrative tasks but sometimes there are legislative tasks to be completed."
good,"Company is good at hiring being unemployed. They have new executive management that SUCKS - Ingramis NOT the nice, same company use to be. Many layoffs (yearly) HR not compassionate to associates only to Exec's."
good,First thing in the morning checking all production reports. Looking at total team units per hour along with cost per unit. checking what is in the pipeline to be completed for the day. Evaluate the number of associates needed to meet goals. Report to director if forecasting overtime. Check in with all other managers in relation to their needs to meet goals in other departments. I learned about how to manage cost throughout the day to meet the companies expectation. Management has got to be a solid team that looks out for the greater cause of success on a daily basis. the hardest part of the job was getting capitol expenses approved for upgraded equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job was coaching associates to their fullest potential...

good,"no hay buena comunicacion, cambios a ultimo minutos"
good,"The best thing about Ingram Micro is the people. The building is nice, the people are friendly, the work never stops. It's interesting being in a bi-coastal work environment where you don't see your entire team but maybe once a year."
good,Its a good job .. Its up to the person if they like it.. I seen people come and go.. Its a good company.. I think communication need to be better.. And no one have got injury.. Thats q good a+
good,Aprendemos coisas novas todos os dias. Uma grande empresa...
good,Great place to work. Plenty of opportunity to advance your career if you take the right steps and have some patience. Culture is good. Great people within the company help make it better.
good,"A typical day at work would be quickly identifying what was a good selling product and moving this into the market. Management were very business minded but may have neglected their obligation to interact with the staff on a human level, Hardest part of the job was agreeing when to share stock whilst you have a large order incoming meaning your numbers will be affected."
good,Ingram Micro gives everyone cross train in different department. It's a diversity company. It is too far from my house. The gives bonus and gives everyone a choice to help donate to the charity.
good,"Great place to work "
good,"People at this company is very pleasant to work with. "
good,"It was a great paying job, long hours, pretty simple workflow. I would recommend one to work here if they enjoy warehouse work. The job in places in a decent area where parking isn't to bad to park."

good,Ingram micro was a very fun working place. In 8 years i had a very good learning experience with entire team. Also i got promotion according to my skill and move to different  department for further work. it was a great opportunity working in Ingram micro.
good,"Inconsistent training across departments. Ineffective, disrespectful management still hanging around in many departments. Widely known HR will not protect you in any situation. Lowest paying in the industry. Charges way too much for an embarrassing level of service. Bones are good but way too big for its britches and arrogant."
good,Over the past 2 years the company has gone through multiple layoffs. Unfortunately the employee development opportunities are not that great. Wish they took the time to keep and develop good employees.
good,My time at Ingram Micro was a good experience overall. I learned what I am capable of in a new environment and new work setting than I have been accustomed to.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was that the work culture was very stimulating and social.  The ability to move up and obtain a promotion was the most difficult part of the job due to high volume of employees.
good,Ambiance de travail intense mais passionnante. Il faut le vivre pour comprendre.
good,I really enjoyed working there. The people were nice and even though we worked long hours it was still worth it. I wouldn't mind working there again if given the chance.
good,"In the beginning of my work career at the warehouse hours were not normal but when company became bigger work hours were pretty fair as years went by the company grew even bigger got really busy in and around fourth quarter they seemed at sometimes not to have enough workers they then added temp force employees and they really were not trained well and we had a lot of over shipments and short shipments and late shipments witch hurt our bonuses and had a lot of in house damage that was not called for , that's about all I got to say besides that I didn't like when they blacked us out for about 6 weeks and nobody could have off . And it was always the fall time of year hunting season !!! I just don't think that's fair and we worked at one point 12hrs a day 7 days a week  good money but people where making a lot of mistakes"
good,"Ingram Micro is a fast pace environment with opportunity to acquire knowledge and experience in the logistic/distributions world.It is constantly focusing on lean processes; the firm is constantly changing and keeping its position on the top IT distribution industry."
good,"nice work atmosphere"
good,"Ingram's going through a lot of transition currently after being acquired by Chinese conglomerate CNN.  It's also trying to development into a tech company from it's roots in electronics distribution.  Too early to know if that will be successful.  Due to it's size and transition, much is in flux and its difficult to keep your bearings."
good,"Working at IM is one of  the greatest experience i had in my life time."
good,"Boring job that doesn't offer much of a career path.  This is a good opportunity to get some experience, but then move on to something more progressive."
good,Learned a lot about IT Hardware & Software products. The best part of the job is every year i get the promotion with position hikes. Fabulous management and supportive co mates.. friendly environment to work.
good,"A typical day at ingram Micro for me would be standing in one spot all day, but i had two jobs at ingram micro. I also tapped and unfolded boxes, and i was really good at the and it kept me moving around and not standing in one space. one thing that i did learn was that working in a warehouse is not as easy as it sounds. the hardest park for the job for me was doing maintenance, and having to stand in the same spot for 8hrs. the most enjoyable part about the job was getting to know new people."
good,The people make this company a great place to work and I feel the work I do everyday contributes to the overall success of this company.  There is a great work/life balance also.
good,Ingram Micro Mobility is a fun workplace where one can learn the aspects of the business. i recommend everyone to work for this company.

good,"Equipe dedicada e motivada, bons gestores e grandes desafios no dia a dia."
good,"I worked in two different departments while I was there. The first one was tough as it started at 6:30am. Basically what we did everyday was packaging items to be shipped out to different retail stores. The job was easy, but very monotonous and repetitive, but someone has to do it, right? The second department was more relaxed as the work was less labour intensive and easier in general. I picked orders to be placed in boxes that were to be shipped out directly to the customers. Every now and then I would help out in different departments if they had a heavy day and we had a light day."
good,"Preparing monthly sales forecast by entering, formatting and validating data for various vendors and assisted in preparation of accruals."
good,Nice environment but lengthy drive. You definitely are an activate participant in what goes on in the warehouse while in Operations.

good,"I enjoyed challenging myself, learning new maintenance tips and techniques to perform this job at the best of my abilities. Management was firm, precise, and consistent in order to maintain a high standard of production and safety. The larger percentile of my coworkers were reliable and dedicated to their jobs. The hardest part of my job was time management of repairs around the production schedule because it often changed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the completion of vital priority situations and the satisfaction it gave me when completed before or on time with success."
good,I worked night shifts. I learned how to work with pallets and other different machines to stock up boxes. My co-workers were amazing. Hardest part of the job was unloading the boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure everything was correct and in place before it ships out to their locations.
good,"J'ai apprécié le travail d'équipe du service logistique, par contre travail trop répétitif pour moi"

After that, the next step is heading out to the work place after walking through the metal detectors and going to your position.

The co-workers are all great workers and good people to be around, they help those who need help as well as teach those who are having a harder time then others.

I'm pretty much experienced with everything in the work place as far as using the RF gun, wrapping, labeling, and also driving every power equipment they have in the wear-house. I'm also familiar with much more so I'm pretty much multi-tasked."
good,Ingram is dedicated to growing the business while meeting shareholder expectations.  There has been a lot of ups and down with the overall senior leadership  which has caused concerns in the associates that work there and lack of direction in general.  This organization is not going anywhere given its sheer size and will keep humming along.  The many changing directions of the company took a toll on its team members but appears to be settling back into a better path forward.

Our team was larger with approximately 25 people on it so there was never a dull moment. All of our team members also provided great opportunities to learn new things and new aspects of the job. The training however that I received was not nearly as sufficient as it could have been. I'm the type of person who loves to learn new things and challenge myself in all aspects of my career, but I also need to adequately learn those methods first. If the training had been a bit more structured my experience could have been a much different one."

good,"I worked remotely, so I full control over managing my time. Which though advantageous due to the flexibility, I ended up working extremely long to compensate for that flexibility. Job required constantly updating certifications which could become stressful. Up 60% travel required which happened to be a good deal. Managers were very supportive to as far as they were allowed. The most difficult part is when a course version changed and you had a very short time to update and prepare for teaching. But then you could also exhaust yourself you had a period of downtime. The most regrettable part is that I was dedicated to the company and turned down multiple job offers only to have my job position eliminated. I was hoping to build an enterprise level lab which could also be rented and would have been an additional source of revenue, however the upper management apparently was unconvinced this was important enough to allocate funds. It would have completely paid for itself in 2 years or less and then it would be free money after that. The most important take away is that you must balance your needs for stability and success over loyalty. It may not be in the reverse. That said, I really enjoyed working at Ingram Micro and enjoyed every stressful moment and every exciting fun activities! I attended, baseball games, foot ball and basket games among other activities."

good,"All'interno di quest'azienda sono cresciuto in tutto per tutto. Quando entrai nel lontano 2002 ero poco più che un ventenne con poca esperienza lavorativa, negli anni trascorsi son cresciuto mentalmente fisicamente e soprattutto a livello lavorativo. le giornate passavano velocemente grazie al mio responsabile che riuscì a mettere su un grosso team di qualità, ricordo che a volte nei numerosi fine mese per festeggiare la riuscita dell'obbiettivo si stava li a bere e mangiare fino a tarda sera e nella bella stagione ogni genere di riunione veniva svolta all'aria aperta. insomma era quasi come una grande famiglia. con la scomparsa di un paio di colleghi dopo una cena aziendale molte cose cambiarono il mio responsabile non digerì questa cosa e col tempo cambiò tanto da rassegnare le sue dimissioni e  un po' alla volta ci siamo persi di vista tutti, io passai negli uffici e tre anni dopo per provare a far fortuna negli States rassegnai le dimissioni  e di quelli che erano i miei colleghi, amici e una bella famiglia  ne è rimasto solo un bel ricordo....  Negli anni a seguire ho svolto altri lavori ma niente a che vedere con quello che facevamo all'Ingram Micro."
