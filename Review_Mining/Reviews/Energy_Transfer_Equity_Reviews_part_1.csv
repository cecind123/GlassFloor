rating,review
bad,I wouldn’t follow the management team in a well lit ally in the middle of the day. Micromanagement at it’s finest. This is the worst company on the planet.
bad,"the company has no money you worry every pay if you will receive one or not  the place is filthy ,hot and they make you do stupid jobs and stab you in the back if you say anything."
bad,"This company has a reputation of being wonderful to get you in, but mangers soon throw you under a bus to save themselves or pass blame to anyone else."
bad,"No growth almost everyone in the company is a temp minus management. So much work, always changing softwares always changing policies. good thing is theres training for all the constant changes"
bad,Job culture is not great. Sometimes they give people options to explore new ideas. Employee opinion is given great importance.
bad,"The company promoted me as an ""Associate Accountant"" so they could pay me less.  I was the sole point-person for Regency Energy, based out of Dallas and this was the biggest account as my 1st Accounting job.  I came early each day, stayed late each day, and came up to the office EVERY SINGLE WEEK END (including Christmas Day).  I was paid ZERO overtime, and instead of helping me on a few things, they just watched me struggle ALL THE TIME"
bad,"Get ready to be treated like a dirty dog, yelled at 24/7 and asked to accomplish goals that aren’t achievable.  Pay at all levels is well behind industry average and behind closed doors upper management does not care about safety, despite what they publicly preach.  If you’re wanting a good work-life balance, this isn’t the place for you."
bad,the management at my location is terrible and there is no availability for advancement.  the benefits are terrible.  the managers do not help you and only treat those better who work ridiculous amounts of overtime.  no raises for this location for 3 years.
bad,Make promises they will not keep company is backed by gas and oil revenue from fathers land purchases. Very young and irresponsible president and vice president (brothers).
bad,"The place is very old and dirty. no pay raises ,and you get put down and treated like dirt all day and nothing is ever done about it. when it comes time to get hired in you just get the runaround. And if you say anything you get fired."
bad,"My department had a very poor work and life balance. I worked for Energy Transfer at the San Antonio, Texas location,"
bad,"This job at Energy Transfer has been posted several times in 5yrs, this job could possible be a decent job but until Upper Mgmt remove that one older female manager supervising this position is removed there is zero chance of being successful there."
bad,It was not a good experience. It started off being a great company in the beginning but as I was able to work I saw what the company was really about.
bad,"Bad management didn’t assist in family matters, fired me when I was on leave for my wife’s death and worded it so I could not draw unemployment. Management stated out nice but soon only wanted employees to work they’re butt off but not to have a life outside of work"
bad,"Mid level management was superb; often hearing and applying new suggested concepts.  HR department leaves a negative impression on everyone from field personnel to executive management.  Often, employee issues are never reconciled and those who are the work horses are often managed by less driven and less enthusiastic managers.  The overall concept of trying to create a relaxed friendly  work culture can be seen but there are too many older employees remaining from 16+ years ago who negatively influence those of us newer employees and directly impact our drive and work capability. Too many instances of upper management engaging in personal relationships with administrative staff."
bad,"Busy put not overwhelming, caring co-workers, doing work that is helps make a change and help keeping people safe. "
bad,Great job all in all. Good benefits. Good work/home separation. Management was the worst I have ever seen. Good ole boy network is defiantly in play. Glad to leave.
bad,Management picks and chooses when to follow standards and regulations. Very unprofessional workplace. Management ignored complaints of racist remarks.
bad,Just like any other oilfield company in west Texas. It will eventually be going through drivers like no other. Pay is good management is very poor. Need more hours!
bad,"The company itself is not a bad company to work for. A typical day of work consisted of doing rounds, helping crafts and handling contractors. I was able to learn how to operate different equipment from what I was familiar with and some new equipment that I had no experience with. The workplace culture seemed outdated, but it worked most of the time. The hardest part of the job was getting a feel for what was the priority due to constant shifts in priorities. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a feeling of accomplishment after a long day of work."
bad,Benefits are not that great. People who work here do not take responsibility of there actions. Do not give you the tools needed to complete job. HR does not respond when needed.
bad,"The management makes this a terrible place to work in the IT department. If they had good management, this would be an awesome job."
bad,"Low pay "
bad,"Good pay, but poisonous work atmosphere. Production above safety. Despite personnel cuts, as much or more production was expected. This led to an atmosphere where people worked past exhaustion."
good,Networking group has a great team. Flexible hours as long as work is done. No real frills just another work office. As a contractor I never felt like I belonged and was not around long enough to really get to know the people well.
good,"Although I LOVE my supervisor, the upper management takes away all incentive to do a good job. I love my work and my supervisor, but Upper management leaves no desire or morale for the lowly employee. And they use fracking technology and I don't agree with fracking. I think it is harmful to the planet."
good,The management needs t to be a  lot better increase the pay really needs better benefits it is always rush rush rush they never plan out anything but it is a job for now
good,"Energy Transfer is a very stressful place to work. The owners have a very religious tone and it is pushed upon all employees."
good,"Antiquated rules like requiring logging in for work, out for lunch, back in after lunch and out for the end of the day."
good,good place to work  I was a pipe line inspector. and did not get to know the people that work full time for E.T.C  so I cant answer all these questions
good,"First years are great learning experience from great managers but room for advancement are limited. Bonus are mediocre, raises are not base on performance but who you know."
good,The over all job is very enjoyable until you bring in the managment.  I have seen plant managers and area supervisors come and go.  They all end up listening to the gossip from their favorites.
good,"Had good people to work with, always made the day better knowing that. Had good support with our people and we took care of each other. Its to bad that the company grew so fast. It lost what was really important to a lot of people."
good,Extremely stressful work environment. Very little management commitment to employee career development. Core work group is good to get along with on the day to day workload.
good,"Energy Transfer bought Southern Union in March 2012. This has been my first job and I am currently working there. I personally feel that the environment of the company should be great to enjoy your job. Before the merger I would say the environment was great and it deteriorated after the merger. I have learnt a lot in 5 years. I have gained experience in Fixed Asset Accounting, Financial Accounting, Revenue Accounting and Financial Planning."
good,"Good company, but advancement opportunities limited to who you know and how young you are. Older employees not offered advancement on their knowledge and skills. Management good in some areas and oblivious to others. Pay and benefits are good, but pay scale not equal."
good,Company grows fast and compensation is at the high-end for the area.  Job security is great.  Workload is significantly higher than usual and planning/organization needs improvement.  Management tends to be flighty and somewhat unreliable.
good,Rating has changed in the last year due to poor management at the C-Level and culture change.
good,Overall a good place to be.  Work life balance is generally good.  Casual dress code.  Friendly environment.  Location is good but the construction is creating a lot of traffic.
good,"This is a great company to work for. I regret leaving the company. "
good,Overall excellent work environment with adequate compensation at most positions. Upward progression is slow however and attention to detail is often less than optimum.
good,a typical day as a Gas Controller at Energy Transfer was very high pace. Monitoring and controlling the daily flow operations of natural gas on the Energy Transfer pipeline system was a tedious job. But the workplace culture inspired the employees to provide the best product (gas transportation) as possible. Also to provide the best product by following Federal (PHMSA) and State (Railroad Commission) regulations. Management did an overall great job by monitoring employees but also allowing employees to have the needed freedom to complete the job tasks with their own special experience and knowledge levels. I definitely can say I learned to be a great team worker after working at Energy Transfer.
good,"I would have stayed there if it I could have been hired on full-time. I was there for a  year and never got an offer but I needed benefits for my fiance and my step-son. They had nothing to offer so I joined the military, but I did like it there overall."
good,Energy Transfer was a good place to further my experience within the Oil and Gas areana with regards to IT contracting and procurement.  It allowed me to learn the process and be an integral part of changing the process for the better.
good,"Good job for the area not so great if you live out of town. Good entry pay bit no pay raises in the last 3 years .  Plant still set in their old ways, no future changes"
good,There are constant projects that keep you busy a lot of the time. The company is evolving and that means constant changes. This keeps everyone pretty busy.
good,It's a fast paced environment. It's a great company to work for.  The workplace culture is phenomenal.  It's employee friendly environment and the relationships you develop will last a lifetime.
good,I worked here for 4 years. It was a good place to work with supportive management. They are keen on expanding and there is always a merger or acquisition taking place. Busy work.
good,It's not a bad company to work for but the management is lacking a lot. There is no direction nor a foundation. I can only speak for the GIS Department. My 2 cents.
good,"Easy going work place, Employee activities frequently planned. They understand your personal needs. "
good,I enjoyed working there until my boss decided that i had finished what i was doing there.  So that she could hire and ex employee of hers that was recentaly layed off from another company.
good,"I was a contractor for Energy Transfer. However, my experience was wonderful. When the project was completed I was invited to find a permanent place at the company."
good,A typical day is to keep up with the maintenance of the plant. Monitor gauges and computers to make sure the plant was operating correctly. Bringing back up the plant when it would go down due to weather and other problems. Being on call and being prepared to come in at a moments notice. Be willing to help out other plants when they were short handed.
good,"Good company to work for, a bigger focus on employee development would be more beneficial to the younger employees future."
good,"Energy Transfer is fair to the employees but falls short of the treatment from sunoco. As companies grow, the personal treatment is diminished.  Energy Transfer is a good place to work and a great career is possible but lacks the warm feeling of sunoco."
good,Working in the factory doing general tasks. Most positions are easy to pick up. Managment offered friendly training and worked with you to become better at given jobs.
good,"Working with energy transfer was fun and stressfull all at the same time, for me there was no advancement and little to no help regarding housing or travel even though they knowingly hired me working and living 4 hours apart and made promises to compensate me for my travel and living."
good,Family owned and operated factory.  Not a bad place to work . The management is in over their head but it always seem to work out in crunch time. I would recommend working here.
good,"Typical day at Energy transfer was repairing and installing electrical control systems including Plc's, transmitters, vfd Drives. Also maintain inventory for all electrical systems"
good,I was a contractor to Energy Transfer Partners through a large consulting firm for a short term contract. The work consisted primarily of requirements gathering exercises and client workshops.
good,"learned a lot from this company however the oil and gas industry "
good,Working at energy transfer allowed me to learn a lot of new skills. Operating new machines as well as learning a little bit about thermodynamics and how their products work for their customers.
good,"There is always something to do but not very many perks working here. Don't host many events and when they do, usually you need to pay out of pocket to attend."
good,"i began working at energy transfer with little to no experience and i was thrown into the job expected to know everything with hardly any training. a typical day on the job involved getting there really early, putting returns together with little interaction, and staying until the work is finished. the environment is very clique-ish and based on favorites, but the tax group definitely knows how to have a good time (lots of happy hours and paid lunches)."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of building and rebuilding large caterpillar engines for the use of pipeline gas compressors and generators for electricity at the pipeline stations. I enjoyed this work was interesting and rewarding, had a lot of great co-workers and great times working together. the hard hardest part about this job it called for long hours and a lot of out of state travel for weeks at a time and it was hard on my son and being away from him."
good,"I liked working in Energy transfer the people I worked with made it fun to come to work, I enjoyed doing my job duties, learned about what my strengths are, worked hard to try to advance in a higher level position."
good,"It is important to get to know who you will be working with at ET, As every manager has very different style of handling their team. I would suggest to negotiate the benefits up front as after you get hired it is a slow process to get raise."
good,"I was there as a contractor and got to travel a lot, meet great people, and learn new skills. Would have loved to have stayed on full-tme but got a great opportunity with another company."
good,Enjoyed working in the San Antonio office. Co-workers made the day enjoyable.  I learned about the oil and gas industry in my seven years with the company.
good,Fast-paced job with a company that was growing annually.  I thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the thousands of retirees that I supported n a daily basis.  Every day there were different challenges.
good,"Great pay and benefits, but will take you from your family quite a bit. Constant weekend and on-call work. Company definitely spends the money to make sure they get employees everything they need."
good,The most enjoyable part is interacting with coworkers on a daily basis.  
good,Unique experience working with and for Energy Transfer--worked remotely from a paid sponsored project to aid in understanding mitigation of land disturbance.
good,Great company to work for and have great benefits. Atmosphere is laid back and professional. Workload is very productive.  Coworkers are fun to work with.
good,The work is varied and interesting. Everyone has a professional attitude and an inclusive philosophy that embraces all employees. Opportunity for some travel.
good,All in all I am learning the stabilizer processing systems that are being used at the plant. The people I am working with are very helpful to my learning the process.The pay per hour could be better to compensate for the fuel and meal expenses.The insurance coverage is very good and the 7on7off is a great shift to work when you are 7hrs away from home.
good,A typical day involved monitoring multiple corporate owned stored via video monitoring as well as a phone system.  Documented emergencies and notified the proper officials. Handled internet and corporate securities.
good,I worked part- time as a contractor. Not really applicable to a full time person who wants to work there. But for the people who are there full time they seem to have a good experience
good,I have been employed since Sept. 2017 in Monahans. I have enjoyed my time here and plan on staying. As I have told my current manager that I am looking for advancement and hope to advance in the department I am currently working in. It is a great job and at times fast paces.
good,This company is a good company with the pay and benefits . Work requires no less 10 hour days and you must be enclined to adventure to unknown locations for crude oil pickup's. I thought management  was good and relaxed maybe too relaxed. You will be  up against the weather elementals and the traffic on a daily basic. I liked being able to come home every night although you will be required to work out of town once in a great while.
good,"Job lasts as until project is complete.  Meeting and working with new people, learning new things.  Experiencing life in other parts of the country is awesome."
good,"productive , great employees and excellent management ."
good,"Overall, Energy Transfer is a good place to work.  I'm considering leaving because my new boss is not supportive.  However, my previous boss was pretty good, and I like the people there for the most part."
good,"Go in check emails, answer calls, talk to pumpers, drivers and managers everyday. Management is really good, always looking out  to grow each individual."
good,This place is one of a kind. My manager works with my kids school since they start at two different times. The CEO lets us out early the weekends of holidays if work load permits. They buy us lunch at month end close which is great because it helps us to meet our work deadlines. Pay is more than I have ever made before which is awesome that they pay at least at market value. I have moved up from a staff to a lead so advancement is possible.

good,Walked around 80ft pieces of pipe in a pipe yard for about 10 hours a day 6 days a week.  If pipe wasn't coming into the yard we would check in materials and pieces of equipment for Right-of-Way projects.  Great place to work with great co-workers and management.
good,Energy Transfer is a company that will treat you as a part of the team.  They growing and willing to help you move on to the next part of your career there are plenty of opportunities to be promoted.
good,"The training mainly consisted of working on active tickets for customers at company-owned convenience stores. Senior co-workers were always busy, but available to help and point me in the right direction. The documentation consists of a basic training guide plus numerous wiki articles . I learned how to resolve daily closing issues, and how three different point-of-sale systems (Commander, Passport, and Radiant) installed at various locations interface with the financial software. End-users generally appreciated the help provided by our team."

With this company I've learned how to have an administrative role in group project management, conduct meetings, and have a key role to project directions. I Guide the group to set own personal goals as well as assist in team work facilitation. My co-workers are excellent at communicating any issues and finding fast solutions. They have great determination and are good spirited. The hardest part of my job will be waiting on a solution to a problem, I like to take action as soon as the opportunity is available to resolve any issues. the most enjoyable part would be the positive feedback and group interaction. Learning new things daily, and most of all having an amazing supervisor and team to work with."

good,"Inbound calls, Remedy ticketing system,"
good,"ETC is a good company to work for. They have a very specific way to do each task and  very good standards for documentation. The only problem I really had was the Construction Manager was not a nice person, but he was 3rd party as well, but they hand picked him, so then there is that!"

good,"Was a fill-in IT regional contractor. Great stable environment, work in the area of field support were always happening no matter where with day to day operations or project execution. I was the person to take care all of region so it got a bit lonely for IT work/social communication. The only thing I did not enjoy were the drives out to field sites of offices and plants. But when work got going it was always interesting and exciting to encounter something new in the Oil and gas industry. Employees were patient and great to work with. It was a work family environment that were there to see you grow and help everyone grow."
good,"Great Team and Management."
good,"A typical day was very busy and could change very quickly, depending on the needs of our internal customers. "
