good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Worked here for over 2 years and by far they have changed me and not for the better I used to be happy coming into work but then I noticed I hated coming in to work because no matter what you do there’s always an issue they don’t care about their employees at all they don’t  respect you and what’s going on in your life they really just couldn’t careless about you they choose who they’re nice to they have favorites and if you aren’t one of them you aren’t getting hours and you get treated so badly they definitely don’t treat everyone the same here especially if you’re black
bad,Management is horrible and ran by a bunch of children. They don’t care about their associates or customers just being number one in the company. Management will have you do anything to achieve their goal of being number one; even break corporate rules without you even knowing costing you your job.
bad,"I worked at DSG for only a few months. I couldn’t stand working that the Burnsville, MN one. The store manager was never there to discuss things, so we had to go to the next manager below him. She was so rude and would only talk to the people who have worked there for while. They favor people so much. Don’t expect time off when you want it because the department leads get all their time off approved first because “they deserve it more because they work harder” and if you have kids don’t Apple because if you ever call in because they are sick you will get told “if this is gonna be an ongoing thing then don’t count on having a job for ceiling”"
bad,Horrible company to work for management on all levels are the worst. They pre judge individuals that come in the store who they believe my be shoplifting with no evidence. Back stock rooms are hazardous to save money. Instead of getting a bigger building for over flow of freight management have employees fixtures to get to product or store extra product.
bad,"Constantly scheduled out of availability"
bad,"I worked at Dicks for almost two years as a Customer Service Specialist and only received a 5 cent raise from $10.45 to $10.50. Managers don't really care about employees. Black people were profiled all the time in the store, and there was always a ton of work to do, especially around holidays around back to school. Front end staff can't leave for the night until managers are satisfied with all departments. recommend work here."
bad,"Worked for this company for 4.5 years as an assistant manager. Tuition reimbursement was great and is the best benefit they gave me. Company like all has great and bad bosses, however I rated them a 1 because their business strategy and structure is outdated. Management is not healthy and the company doesn’t support diversity and inclusion."
bad,Dicks Sporting goods was a company that looked to hire from within. I watched countless people come in from other companies when their were several people who were completely capable of doing what was expected.
bad,"this place is awful, the people are mean and there is discrimination if your not american! There is no training ether and the people who work there make fun of you when you ask questions! toxic environment"
bad,Do not work here if you want something long term. They never schedule you enough hours. The pay is poor. The turn over rate is ridiculous. A typical day at work consist of only being there 4-5 hours. The management is the only full time positions and they dont care for you.
bad,They are way to disorganized and disrespectful. The management staff is sub par and not helpful. And no one knows their exact job or is trained correctly.
bad,"I do not recommend working here, especially in Loss Prevention. You will work 60+ hours per week, every week, and you will get phone calls at all hours of the day and night. You will also work every Thanksgiving and every Black Friday. Even though you don't technically report to the DM, you'll be at his/her every whim - including asking you do your expenses and other admin tasks. And when you refuse, you'll be black-balled."
bad,"I understood that I had a walk-on interview and they hired me on the spot. However afterwards it took them a week and a half to get my schedule together. There is absolutely no communication between the manager's, assistant managers,  or anybody. The administrative assistant will directly lie to you to deter you from going to the right person about something. Very hostile and hateful environment. I would not recommend this job for my worst enemy."
bad,It was a horrible toxic place to work  and everyone hated being there and it was overall a horrible place to stay at and don’t recommend anyone working at that same location since it’s falling apart
bad,"Horrible business, management is not great.  There is no follow through and nobody is held accountable.  People are stretched to the max and expected to do more, with no direction."
bad,"The company could care less about customer service. They make it hard to help customers."
bad,Don’t work here management was real pain work here if you hate yourself.Only upside were the coworkers and even then some of them were rude. Like I said don’t stress over working here
bad,Management constantly changes. People hired and fired weekly. Very strict on attendance. Co-workers are usually fun. Most departments understaffed and everyone underpaid.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,If you happen to be a solider in the reserve or national guard. You should avoid this company at all costs because they will violate USERRA the first chance they get.
bad,"I beg you, please never work at Dick’s Sporting Goods in Roosevelt Field Mall. 1, they have mice and expect you to work behind the registers with that terrible smell. 2, the keyboards and pin pads at the register were missing buttons for months, making the cashier look stupid in front of the customer when they have to find alternatives. 3, for every 5 hours, you are allowed a 15 minute break, it’s the law, but for some reason, if you ask to take one, it’s a problem. They literally will never tell you to take your break. 4, I was part time and they had me working full time hours with no benefits. 5, they use printer/copy paper to fold EVERY SINGLE shirt. They are literally killing our environment. Why not just use a folding board? Because you know what they do with the paper after the customer purchases a shirt? They throw it out. Plastic bags that are supposed to be recycled? They put them in a bin behind the register then throw them out. 6, they are ALWAYS understaffed and you will spend hours after your shift is over fixing the store. 7, there are times when there is only one cashier closing and no one will help you. 8, the store manager has no idea how to lead or speak with people. She has no people skills and needs a training on how to communicate effectively with people who work for her. The managers won’t say anything to her, but as an ex employee, I can tell you that they feel the same and just won’t say it to her because they fear losing their job."
bad,"Absolutely poor management and can never keep a good staff. Most people quit due to the general manager. If you don’t mind being appreciated, by all means!"
bad,"They want people with  little to no experience to pay then three least they can and with them until they can't take it any longer. "
bad,"I was excited to work at dicks sporting goods first but after a month the management was very rude except for two managers. They make you work when you can't, They don't care about there employees and they are one of the worst managed places I've ever worked at."
bad,"This company doesn’t care about workers safety all they care about getting production and they don’t care about people being able to take care of their families with decent pay, they literally just started base pay at 14.00 and that’s still not enough for the work that you do and the amount of trauma your body goes through"
bad,"Working at dicks sporting goods was the worst experience by far. There was barely any hours for employees. I was a full time lead and I was lucky to get 32 hours per pay period. Also being a lead I had to complete tasks and projects with minimal hours and no help. Trying to complete a project was pretty much impossible, because while I was trying to complete the project, I had to tend to customers and help backup the registers"
bad,"all managers and most customers were rude , managers wouldnt accommodate my 1st jobs schedule and double scheduled me . Unkind staff and I didnt appreciate only just standing there with no work besides cashiering . little on the job training"
bad,Dicks sporting goods warehouse is not a place for a woman to work at and the type of money they are paying is not worth the problems that you have up there.
bad,It was the worst place ever so disorganized they had favorites at the company the district manager was an idiot and so was the store manager they didn’t care about you
bad,"Management team doesnt work together, OPS manager doesnt respect employees schedule restrictions, company as a whole doesnt follow through on employee complaints, ignores reports about managers inappropriate treatment of employees (name calling, insults, degrading speech). Store is usually understaffed, yet employees expected to do the work of full staff."
bad,"Screw working there."
bad,"could be one of the worst run companies around, everyone is a VP with NO help at store level they move stuff just to move it (busy work). DM promote their boys that they hang out with not the ones that make the difference"
bad,"Managers are horrible, they give blame but take credit when they have nothing to do with a solution. Absolutely the worst job I have ever worked at, very hypocritical, they say care about employees but all they care about is money."
bad,Dicks sporting goods is a terrible place to work.   With massive budget cuts from corporate there just isn’t enough staff to handle the busy crowds.   Employees are overworked and underpaid.   I would not recommend this place to anyone
bad,"My interview with a ""Team Lead"" aka shift manager was essentially him calling the entire department that I was getting hired for lazy. Not the greatest start. Then the general manager introduced himself by saying, ""Hi, I'm ____. Everyone here works for me."" Um... ok. Then, at a later date the general manager told me I wasn't allowed to take breaks. Illegal much? Then he blocked my exit from the break room, which was super creepy. I told him that blocking my exit made me uncomfortable to which he quickly denied doing so. Then, after that incident he conveniently scheduled me only while I was unavailable, forcing me to either resign or be fired. I resigned. This place is a delusional joke with no effort or communication from management. I tried being upfront about my availability and it's like I was talking to a brick wall. I feel it was malicious."
bad,"The management is incompetent.  Treats employees like children. "
bad,Management created and spread multiple rumors about employees. They would gossip with every employee and then use that gossip to create problems between them.
bad,"Will never even shop there. Will not even set foot in the door, the management is bad, the work is one person for 4 departments and there is a lack of help from others"
bad,"awful culture, awful management, terrible choices made. the company only wants Yes men. they will tell you that your experience doesnt meet their requirements...then immediately turn around and give the same position to a fresh faced 20 year old. i cannot rate this company poorly enough. certainly not low enough for the particular location im at. i have met some decent people here, but this is not a place for anyone to consider."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,The managers would pick on and belittle employees. Sometimes even sexually harrass employees and the HR never would do anything about it. The only good thing about this place is the regular employees are pretty friendly.
bad,Very bad place to work. Mangers are awful and do not care about employees. Very rude to me after I left. Very unprofessional work environment. Poor salary and they don’t care if you need time off or not.
bad,"Dishonest management. Leads would incorrectly input info into the computer programs using associates id's that work under them, This is a very dishonest action."
bad,They have terrible training. Terrible work life balance. I felt bad for the employees because there schedules would sometimes get changed several times a week. They have a point system for attendance which treats a sick child equal to a flat tire. The district manager micromanages and then gives no advice on how to improve. You are always understaffed because no one wants to work with the ridiculous expectations It’s the worse company I have ever worked at.
bad,"By far the worst company to work for, they don’t nearly pay enough for everything they make you do. Bad management and also awful work environment. Other associates don’t care and the company itself and values are terrible. DO NOT WORK FOR DICKS IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY."
bad,"I worked less than 12 hours a week.  They hired a bunch of new people and they got most of the hours. Previous to this, I was working about 38 hours per week.  They were also hired at a higher hourly rate than those of us that worked there for over 2 years.  The higher pay rate happened because the then store manager hired a bunch of her friends from her other career before working for Dicks.  But the hours thing was because Dicks is a horrible place to work for.  Upper management decided that everyone should be part time except management and they should ALL get no more than 12 hours a week.  Cant pay the bills with this type of mentality going on.  Dicks sporting goods is the worst place I have ever worked in all my 35 years working."
bad,"I have worked in a couple states for them and they’ve treated me the same. They act like you’re doing good then, they tell you that you don’t know anything."
bad,"Terrible management, extremely low wages for the amount of work we were doing and bs we were put through, poor working conditions. Would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"I really enjoyed working at Dick's even though the pay wasn't great. But towards the end of working there in 2018, management was terrible. The good managers no longer work their and the current managers treat their employees terribly."
bad,minimum wage is about all a teenager can ask for. The Ann Arbor MICHIGAN Dicks sporing goods lives up to their first part of their name and thats about it. Have a highschool summer there and that's about all.
bad,Management was awful. Treated poorly unless you were a favorite. NO HOURS. Barely a discount. Poor work environment. Management never wanted to listen to anything employees had to say. Poor pay. I would never recommend anyone work here.
bad,They pay people to come in and do absolutely nothing while the new employees and temps do all of the work. Favoritism is very popular there. They do not handle serious issues in a timely manor.
bad,"Bad management. Hired for full time. However, they would ""book"" so many hours for the store for a week and guess what, Overbooked. So everyone on certain days would be forced to leave early"
bad,"I think this could be a great place to work, if you stop hiring people with personality disorders or going through mid-life crises. The work model is solid, but it is not followed."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Unless you want a hostile work environment and a ton of stress, do not work here. The managers belittle you and treat you like dirt only for their numbers. no recognition at all."
bad,"Very unorganized, no training, no help, Staff causing drama ,mangers not professional at all no customer service skills ,not giving proper hours ,store is very disorganized."
bad,"•Huge lack of diversity"
bad,"Management played favorites, played other workers out of promotions, offered promotions to people who did not deserve it but people who worked hard got treated poorly and harrassed"
bad,Management is the worst part of this company. They don’t care about associates but rather getting their bonus each quarter. I have made many friends with associates at dicks but management is what made me leave.
bad,Watch your back don’t drink to much water you can only go to the rest room on break not before management always  harassing  You all the time they watch your every move like you a kid out of the whole wearhouse processing department get it bad they get paid less but do more work stay getting hurt pushing off them  boxes
bad,"Worked for too long there.  New corporate executives are killing employees and the business.  The spin is that they increase the workload, decrease the payroll and say that everyone should be trained in other departments. Plus make customers highly satisfied all the time with no associates on sales floor.  It’s going down in a big way.  Closing stores is just the beginning of the end."
bad,"Management is so fake. They do not care about the employees, you are just another number to them. They only work you part time and at"
bad,"Management is a mess. Most managers were rude and gave no respect. Coworkers were wonderful people, fun, polite, and overall enjoyable to be around..."
bad,Employees are rude and not helpful. Management was a joke. Was promised full time but was not given full time. Was lucky to get 12 hours a week for 8.10 an hour. Had to go on a medical leave and when it was time to come back was treated poorly by management and yelled at constantly because of work restrictions form my dr.
bad,I was there for almost 2 years and was treated like garbage by management they would not work with you on scheduling at all they would just make a schedule and if it wasnt within your availability then you had to deal with it and find someone to take your shift. Also no room to move up unless you kiss up to the management constantly. Pay is alright but it isnt enough to live on and certainly isnt what you deserve for dealing with all that you have to.
bad,"Management was out of control, very biased towards certain employees. No consideration for better ideas, and proven processes. Never seen a place run the way that store was managed."
bad,"No matter how often you ask for help from managers, being a part-time, you'll never get anywhere. Every department is understaffed (especially during crazy busy times) because the company is full of people trying to save a few pennies. Managers have no regards for issues in departments; a monkey could make a schedule better than the managers and they totally disregard your availability. If you change your availability, good luck getting scheduled more than 2 days a week. The place is 100% a Trainwreck and it's incredible it hasn't burned down yet. The managers make promises they NEVER keep, and are seriously two-faced. I wouldn't wish this place on anyone. Pay sucks, hours suck. And managers just throw you in random departments for the fun of it without training. Training is all in videos, and you're thrown into the wolves. Kiss up to the managers if you want to make it anywhere in the company."
bad,"No safety for back office workers. Sneaky LP staff who will try to set you up to meet quotas."
bad,Never told you are doing a good job. Violated multiple labor laws to save pennies. Store manager belittled his direct reports for his poor job performance
bad,"With the low pay and stressful work environment created, i do not see any opportunity of growth in this company. There is a high turnover rate, Good workers get fired, while ones who should be let go still remain. Also a musical chairs of managers take place as the DM switches managers of stores in what seems like a yearly basis."
bad,Basic retail that really is nothing spectacular. I wish management  would actually listen to associates and department leads to promote monetary growth within the store/company.
bad,"a typical day consists of picking up peoples trash in the store. Dick makes tasks harder than they need to be. The culture at Dicks is blame the employee for everything, assume they are lying thieves."
bad,Managers will throw you under the bus to save their own skin. Its always how you can help them but they are never willing to help you. Very Stressful work environment.
bad,"I enjoyed working there, but it was not fulfilling enough. I want a job where i have the opportunity to move up. I enjoy answering phones, chart work, and helping people. I would love to be receptionist."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Manager was never at store. Always calling me and other employees at all hours of day and night. very stressful, manager would harass and make fun of other employees. Promoted outside of store only."
bad,starts off okay but there is no oppurtunity for advancement all they do is teach you many things and have you learn every department and keep you at the same horrible pay very highschool type atmosphere and the store manager is horrible i guess its a good job for short term i say that loosely but for long term no way
bad,Management is the worst. Company built on favoritism. Barely any advancement taken place. Management dates their employees. Literally only one good manager there.
bad,Managers treat you as a means to an end. They will completely ruin your work life balance and ignore your stated availability. I cannot recommend working for this company
bad,it was a bad experience working for a place that does not care about it's workers of color and they continuously showed favoritism to employees who were white.
bad,"They WILL abuse your time any way they can. They WILL make you do things with no training and not supposed to do according to corporate. By the way, good luck seeing your break because they do not exist."
bad,"I was hired to help set up a new store. The dress code was pretty bad, we were to wear gym clothes, which is alright, but some girls over did it by wearing almost see thru leggings and what not. This made them become the favorites to the managers and were the ones that got the most hours. A day at work was to open boxes of merchandise, take the clothes out and either hang it up or fold it, apply sensors and take it to the department where it belonged. The hardest part of the this job is that they expected for us to be to perfect with the folding of the clothes."
bad,"I would not get a job here. The general manager is good, but the rest are awful. My manager was extremely rude, not helpful, and was never there. Another manager discussed religion to us and basically bashed on what others believe because she doesn’t agree with it. The employees are extremely rude to new employees and make you feel dumb for not knowing how to do something even though you’re new. They make you work long days but you only get a 10 minute break. The pay is extremely low and all the employees do is make fun of others or gossip. The only reason i got a job here was because I am an athlete and love sports and what Dick’s sells, but I regret it 100%. I will not he returning to this location to shop & will seriously have to consider if I will go to another one because a company that hires people like this is not necessarily one I want to support, but maybe they hid that side of them when hired. Who knows. But unless this is your ONLY option, do not work here."
bad,"I worked as an apparel sales associate for DICKS for one year.  It was a good job until corporate reduced hours for all stores.  Then I was responsible for every piece of clothing in the store and all fitting rooms by myself.  I was never given the opportunity to work a morning shift, they gave those to the long time employees.  Opening associates were given two associates to open, and the closing staff was one person responsible for fitting rooms, keeping the store clean, and returns.  The typical day began at 4pm and coming into a messy store and a z rail full of returns that needed to be put away.  Managers at this store stressed the importance of keeping an eye out for theft.  I do not know how they expected employees to do this when most departments were staffed with one employee.  Golf, bikes and exercise, apparel, and team sports were all staffed with one employee.  It was very stressful keeping the store as clean as possible, trying your best to keep all shirts folded and nothing on the floor and then next time you come in having the store manager tell you that the store did not look good.  Associates are only scheduled for around 15 hours per week.  The most enjoyable part of the job was your coworkers.  If you do decide to work at DICKS, work in the footwear department, they have the easiest job in the whole store.  They are always full staffed and have up to 5 employees in at a time.  The leader of the shoe department will always complain to management about the lack of staff, even though they are the most staffed in the store.  The lead of footwear will also let"
bad,"I worked here one full day and knew it was a horrible job. I was hired to be a ""cashier"". Not only did they enforce me trying to sell ""warranties"" even on items that nobody would ever need a warranty for (a backpack, for example! i dojnt need a warranty on a bag!) they made it a requirement and demanded us do stupid things like this. I also was required to stand at the door during winter and stop customers as they entered the store trying to get them to sign up for a credit card. I dont know about you but i would never go back to a store if they followed me as i entered trying to get me to sign up for their store card. And for all that BS, they wanted to only let me have a 15 minute break for an 8 hour shift. No way jose! i left and never went back not even to pick up the horrible check they were gonna try to give me!"
bad,"You constantly feel the pressure to perform and exceed expectations. You never get positive feedback, only negative. When I asked them about the possibility of moving up or even around the building; I was met with nothing that turned out to be false optimism. Nothing actually happened. I was fooled into working hard without any extra compensation."
bad,"Singled out, worked hard but since someone didn't like me they liked to the manager and said I wasn't working and that's when I ended up leaving. Everyone here is rude. The discount isn't really enough, since all their items are overpriced. Long work days with maybe a 10 minute break. No one harldy came in the store while I was here and that hopefully means they will be out of business soon at least this location. Pay is well below the pay scale for this region I only went here because I like sports...but that didn't help."
bad,"It's a very unprofessional company, really poor management. This company does not care about their employees at all. There's really no room for growth. And even if you're full-time, your hours can get cut."
bad,"At the beginning, this job was fun and I enjoyed my coworkers / managers, but as time went on and half the management left, due to frustration, it became a very unfriendly job. There's a lot of drama between everyone, always a lack of hours so lack of coverage which makes it hard to do good for the customer. Overall working there has not been a good experience."
bad,One of the worst working experiences i've ever had in my life. My supervisor lacked empathy of any kind. Treated his workers badly . I would never work for this company again.
bad,Everyone is a child. Would not recommend unless you want a discount on products. The management is very dull and moral was very low. 10 out of 10 would not recommend.
bad,"They bought out my old location names Chicks sporting goods and then told us we were losing our commision and bonuses and all of our vacation time they were trying to have me go from 15 and hour plus 10% commission, to 10 dollars an hour I quit immediately."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,they wasn't really flexible with scheduling and they didn't really help you develop your skills even more to be better at your job and they didn't really pay you good.
bad,"Absolutely terrible place of work. Management does not take the time to fully invest in the employees they have under them and when something goes wrong it is never the managers fault. Also, when something goes wrong that the manager could have avoided but instead they put the blame on an hourly associate that usually leads to this associate being fired. This company only looks out for the higher ups in the company and could not care less for the hourly employees, which are the ones that keep these stores running."
bad,"It really is a bad place to work. You get paid minimum wage and they work your a** off and never give you credit for anything, they just keep complaining. They try and keep people under 40 hours so they don't have to pay for a workers insurance. Horrible, horrible job!"
bad,Mostly you'd just hang up clothes and fold messy tables. It's typically very slow. Theres a lot fixing to do around the store. Which can be very boring. Makes you feel like you're just walking in circles doing the same thing all day.
bad,"Management always degraded employees.  Was never good enough .  Store managers were not qualified to be managers.  No education in management."
bad,"Talk about a company that will use and abuse their employees. When you're doing great, to them its just ""okay"", make one mistake and you'll get yelled at for hours instead of just being told how to not make that mistake again in the future. I wouldn't recommend working here to my worst enemy."
bad,Everyone I worked with had a horrible attitude. You shouldn't dare ask any questions or else they would talk down to you or get an attitude. Once they found out I was pregnant they cut my hours (as if they worked me anyway) to maybe 1 day a week for only 4 hours. I wrote out my 2 weeks notice and threw it away because I needed the work and couldn't afford to quit and they obviously went through the trash because asked why I wasn't on the schedule for the next 2 weeks I was told I put in my 2 weeks notice. Multiple people had already quit because of poor management prior to when I did.
bad,I enjoyed my time working at Dick's. My co workers and managers were helpful and nice. I learned alot about providing good customer service and how to make a workplace run smoothly.
bad,Our raises were only a .24 cent raise. The managers are not professional at all and do not know how to have relationships with employees. The breaks are horrible especially if you have a 6 hour shift they expect you to eat your food in 10 minutes. The scheduling is flexible and respected. They have a rotation of departments closing task and some departments have to clean the restrooms because they have not hired a cleaning crew. It is also very hard to move up positions.
bad,What can I say... its not an organization that you would want to work with for any period of time. Yes...they sell cool things..but they treat people horribly. Most people go to work there because of the merchandise...but soon find out that its actually WalMart in Nikes.
bad,Store manager is horrible! He makes you feel like your nothing and if you go over your hours the AA will put in that you took a lunch when you didnt so that means they takes 30 min. from your time that you did work and put it in the system and the merchandise manager is a a**hole she'll literally curse you out if you ask too many questions!!
bad,The managers were horrible they over scheduled didn't handle issues and handed off work to everyone. The took naps in the back while the employees worked and did what they were supposed to do. They over scheduled over a dozen times and didn't respect time requested off for school events or prior commitments(sports).
bad,"this place is the worst.  All of the GM's are middle aged men going through their mid life crisis and have no idea how to properly manage people.  They scream at employees, that barely make any money and take advantage of salary managers forcing them to work 15 hour days."
bad,No Not at all nope never i do not want to type this i do not have the time i am trying to find a job and mandatory surveys do not help with finding a job
bad,Working for this company proves that a good work ethnic can and will go unnoticed due to sonority in the work place. I was promised a higher job position but never got it.
bad,"thought it would be a great place to work. SO SO wrong."
bad,this company sucks. will not recommend anyone to work for them. they don't compensate or promote great employees on time and its a nightmare to move up with this company.
bad,"do not work here.  management are overrated supervisors.  no training, or guidance.  retail is dying and they are doing everything to survive including cutting earned vacation time from associates."
bad,i love golfing but management was never there and i hated how every time i did worked they would never tell me to check inventory they never fought to keep employees
bad,The managers are very impatient with people with disabilities. They are not accommodating at all. It is very fast paced and overwhelming.  If you do not do it right they just let you go
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Made use clean restrooms for 8.25$ if is was you i would look for a job some where else. the stuff they sale is a joke and is way over priced for what you get.
bad,Had poor management and did alot of favoritong people as well as they didn't have anything consistent as well as had problems being short all the time or people not showing up.
bad,Once new management took over it has not been the same.  Everyone is overworked and underpaid.  Doesn't matter what your position is you are expected to work like a manager.
bad,I hated working here it was an utter disaster with barely any hours to work. My credit almost got ruined working here because i couldnt even get enough money to pay my minimum payments. Management horrible and they treat you like dirt. Just don't.
bad,"Besides the fact that its a dying company, the management is pretty unforgiving in the sense that they hire some terrible managers. I know my job was to move heavy stuff every day because of my department, but when you as me to move 30 units of 200lb fitness equipment myself when I'm 5 ft 4 in 120lbs, then there's a problem."
bad,Unprofessional. They don't have your back if anything goes wrong. As long as you get good metrics they look the other way. Ghetto environment too. Something needs to change.
bad,Working at Dick's Sporting Goods was a productive and fun work environment because it enjoyed all the people I worked with. Another reason is that I got to meet a lot of customers and talk to them.
bad,"It was really fun in the beginning when we first opened, but as time went on it was very stressful. It was upsetting that the boss really didn't care but oh well."
bad,You are treated with disrespect. You are not trained on almost anything and you are shoved into different departments on random days depending on the staff. Don't bother.
bad,"Dick's is undoubtedly one of the worst places I've ever worked. Every department is a mess and the vast majority of the blame falls on the main manager and the culture she's established. She is unbelievably rude and disrespectful to her employees yet oblivious to their obvious disdain for her. She actively schedules them against their availability and scoffs at their questions or concerns. Very spiteful and antagonistic as well. And that's just management. The men's bathroom was a complete disaster. There was no hand soap the entire time I worked there but there was a sign stating ""employees must wash hands', garbage constantly overflowing, toilet paper everywhere, missing urinal cakes, etc. I went in with high hopes and expectations but was sorely disappointed. It does however, explain their outrageous turnover rate. Would not recommend."
bad,"do not work there! save yourself the hassle, terrible pay and hours, management has no idea what they are doing, no room for growth. worst job o ever worked at"
bad,Poorly managed lack of care for employees. From district management down nobody communicated properly with each other from management down to part time
bad,youre expected to sell things and not make commission which in turns makes the customers think that you dont have their best interest in mind. i left due to this
bad,"Treated like a piece of meat with no benefits, terrible management all the way from the bottom to the top. Nobody knows what they're doing directions to pour that's why they will be going out of business I'm sure in the future"
bad,Horrible workplace.  Horrible pay and hours.  No advancement was ever made for me.  We were always shorthanded.   Their inventory management has little organization
bad,I have worked at two locations in the last year. my first location I worked there for 11 months and the second location I only worked there two months because I could not take it. They overwork you and expect you to stay for a 15hr shift if someone called off. They pressure you to sell credit cards and belittle you if you do not. The hours are inconsistent and if you want a set schedule they will give you 15-25 hours a week only.
bad,"The managers are awful, they will sit there and talk about you behind your back. They don't do anything. You couldn't pay me enough to work here again. Not to mention you could guess which managers are sleeping with who, sleeping with employees, and what not. Constantly giving you demands while they sit in the office and talk bad about employees. They do not know how to do their job and if they have something going on in their personal life, you better be ready to have it taken out on you when you start your shift. This is your warning, DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,Running register all shift was a typical day. Did returns and sold gift cards. Help do some stocking. I leaned how to fold shirts and sweatshirts for sale. Management hardly came when called. I could never get my lunch break when needed and I am diabetic on insulin. My sugar would be dropping and I had no backup on the register. There was no enjoyable part of this job
bad,"seasonal job"
bad,this job is just as bad as my job at the grand lux cafe. I do not enjoy working here and always felt i was being underpaid for my work. I am looking for new employment.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"I'm glad its over,,they want you to do everything ,,the pay simply not enough, unless you wanna be a manager straight out of college.. this job is a mess man,,only stayed cause there is literally no descent job out here willing to pay...smh..(such is life)"
bad,"working hours are terrible they scheduled you when they felt was right not by your availability, managers have favorites, co-workers where nice to work with"
bad,"Dick's Sporting Goods retail stores is not a position I would recommend to anyone.  Very low pay, short breaks, unrealistic expectations for minimum wage."
bad,"They got upset with I told them I was looking for another job and then quit the next Monday. They started cutting peoples hours because of budget quota's were not met, but continued to hire new people."
bad,as a manager you do not have any work life balance.  you will work 50-60 hours a week and sometime will have to pull overnight shifts and then go right back in the next day for another 10-12 hours.  poor upper management.
bad,I dislike working at Dicks. Their management is one of the poorest I have ever had to work. They try to work their staff fill time with part time hours. There is simply not enough time to accomplish all they want to do with the hours provided.
bad,The management at my Dicks sporting goods location did not do a good job. A reason fro this was the extremely high turnover rate for managers at my location. During my very time there i had 8 different managers.
bad,Rude management. Very stiff environment. Unenjoyable place to work due to harsh management and rude customers. Hard for upward advancement. Unorganized.
bad,Didnt even bother telling me i was seasonal and just took me of the schedule. The managers were horrible and only cared about themselves. Horrible!!!!
bad,"Like a most retail jobs, you are left on your own to be a leader. Skills are not taught and its all trial by fire. No real active leadership at that location."
bad,Bad leadership and employees were not given the alloted break times. Also poor use of supplies and utilities at the location. Company standards are held to a very liberal view and is a joke for a sporting goods store.
bad,"Poor management, unorganized scheduling, no one is on the same page. Store is a mess. No team work, no team environment. Safety issues, no followthrough with workman's comp."
bad,Management is horrible and does nothing to help with there employees until they absolutely have to. Terrible place to work. They do not promote people based off performance.
bad,"They loved to preach about being happy and nice to the customer's but the store manager never looked happy. I was never fully trained. When the lines are backed up, instead of helping they just stare at the cashiers and call for backup from someone in a whole other department.those people aren't trained on registers. None of the managers were welcoming and they all were complete smart aliacs. I wouldn't suggest working there unless your young and in dyer need of a job."
bad,Worked for the company for over two years only to have the new store manager take over and hire on new associates that she places first and foremost in her mind. The management treats all the senior associates very poorly and plays favorites based on who talks to them and is their friend at work.
bad,Had to clean feces off of bathroom walls. Had to sit and listen to the constant high school Drama while trying to complete my work. High turnover and constant hour cuts. Typical retail during the recession
bad,"Dicks would have been a great job if it wasn't for the managers. My fellow employees were all very friendly and I enjoyed the work I was doing. However, I did not enjoy only working 10-15 hours a week and the frequent schedule changes throughout that would occur without notice in the middle of the week."
bad,Refuse to promote people who have been there but they hire people for the higher job right off the street. extremely understaffed so you would work 8+ hours by yourself. Managers are inconsiderate
bad,"This company does not pay their employees enough. It is a billion dollar company and they only worry about paying their DMs, CEOS, and store managers. For full time employees they are not fairly compensated."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"When I was first hired, it was an incredible place to work. However, I've sadly come to realize that I need to leave the company. There is a major problem with the management under-paying and under-staffing. HR does nothing to assist those that are mistreated. Definitely DO NOT recommend!"
bad,Not my favorite job! when i worked there management was horrible and district managers were the worst! lack of help and communication was ridiculous. Would not recommend for a career!
bad,lacked complete leadership pay was low and no hours to work even if you had open availability terrible coworkers no sense of team work of drive to better their workers
bad,"The management hierarchy allowed drama to go uncheck and unchallenged, causing many others to either quit, resign or fired for non sense. I resigned myself for malarkey that a manager caused and they put me on investigation and accusing me of so much. My hands were forced, I wasn't going to be crucified because one manager hired me and it was a conflict of interest and it backfired on him."
bad,One of the worst companies to work for. The management of the store and districts played favorites. Major HR issues happened at the store I was working at and nothing ever came of it even after it was mentioned to the DM
bad,This place only exists because it is the only one of its kind in this city. Management is a bunch of tenured vets who don't care about anything but clocking in and out for the day.
bad,This was not a good place to work. The trainers encouraged the use of dummy score cards and setting people up for rewards accounts they dont want. I didnt like my time there at all.
bad,"The managers did not make you feel welcome. It was very cut-throat and I dreaded showing up to work everyday. There was little to no encouragement for achievements. The other associates were kind and more helpful than management was. However, not all management was useless."
bad,"This company gives very little, while expecting A LOT from its employees. There is limited mobility within the company yet they make it seem as though anyone can be the next VP."
bad,a very unorganized business to work for. would consist of multiple tasks that were thrown at you and not explained. would not recommend working for this comapny. imo
bad,"Dicks was a fun place to work if you are an avid sports fan, but retail itself is not fun (for me it was only a part time job to get through school), but it can be stressful if customers dont get what they want. Management and company policies were questionable."
bad,The people I worked with were terrible and going there everyday made me feel awful. Terrible place to work I would never in my life tell anybody they should work there.
bad,"Poor place to work. Bad management. Very few hours offered, then additional cutting of hours. Forced to do multiple jobs and understaffed at all times. Encouraged to not take your required break."
bad,"management was either  friends of friends,corrupt ,bullied,unfair workspace. workers were belittled everyday managers made workers feel depressed little hours."
bad,"GM is completely unprofessional who displays favoritism while belittling other associates. I worked there for a year and saw how they claimed to be a team, but they were incohesive."
bad,Thy hired way too many people so they had to cut everyone's hours in half if not more. The store is very poorly managed. The people that work there are mostly college aged kids who are more worried about each other than doing a good job at their job
bad,management lazy...too much delegation for amount of pay...often had to do work of upper managers in the store while they sat in office and looked at the internet
bad,"The store manager was extremely sexist. She treated everyone terribly but the women there got the worst of it. HR does nothing because she has too much juice there. The entire company is unprofessional. Be prepared for long hours, working in departments that is not your because they keep the store as short staffed as possible, and very little reward. The raises are a joke. They will do anything so you won't hit over time."
bad,"Mgmt horrible don't know anything"
bad,"I was over worked consistently due to management having no structure or discipline. They seemed more fearful of employees than managers, Lack of accountability on training or commitment from team. No support in my department, managers wouldn't train other departments on register to help out. my team was often kept on registers when their job was apparel leaving apparel departments unattended or unable to assist customers as well as falling behind on visual projects, this caused me to stay over 50 hours a week doing the work myself. Due to managers defying company policies and throwing each other under the bus we had continuous corporate visits resulting in Mangers being fired. Still new management struggled to turn the store around. There was still a lot of drama and unethical behaviors not being addressed. The amazing employees were over worked and being spun against one another by management. It was physically and emotionally exhausting after over a year I decided to search for a company that values their employees as human beings."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,I dragged my feet to work. I was led without proper training and to find the answers on my own. There is a lack of accountability and the managers expect you to know what to do without proper training.
bad,"taken advantage of in every possible aspect of the job by management, manipulated into working 12 hour days with little to no break, hours often cut because head manager likes to call in extra hands when its his turn to close during the week, little to no raise if you even get one, only way to advance is to dedicate your whole life to a part time position and/or sleep with management."
bad,"Working here was alright, nothing special. The cashier's job is taken too intense. The managers aren't very helpful, there are a lot of things to learn with the coupons but you aren't really taught so you get yelled at when things are done right."
bad,This is easily most boring fun job ever. You constantly do the same things over and over but the environment is what keeps you going. You have several departments that are awesome and will keep you going with the people that work there. staff is a mixture of young and older people
bad,It was good until their attendance policy. After that policy everything started going downhill. I saw good employees getting fired 24/7. The managers don't really care if you have an emergency and are upto your last point. You will be fired. Don't work here if you have a problem with being on time.
bad,"Terrible management, they dont care about there employees, no work/life balance, and no room for advancement they will lie to you."
bad,i was a cashier. i checked people out when they were done choosing what they were going to buy. i answered the phone when customers would call and would direct them to certain departments.
bad,you are disposable and treated that way by management. Management does not care about you and typically the feeling is mutual. Horrible pay and horrible hours. Don't expect to have a social life because they will make you work every weekend and all evenings.
bad,You cannot get any goals set here because they top people in corporate are always cutting hours so they can get a raise. When you bring this issue up they fire you. They also fire employees for using coupons that managers tell the cashiers to use. Even though most of the stolen items are from customers allowed to walk out the door with duffel bags filled with merchandise.
bad,"Horrible rude managers, extremely unreliable and not understanding want everything handed to them don't like to help out. Argumentative and disrespectful wouldnt recommend to anybody."
bad,Beware......Dicks Sporting Goods doesn’t take S harrasment seriously!!! They sweep it under the rug. You have to be groped apparently in order for it to even be S harrasment. They allow co-workers to say S things to you and about you and you are supposed to be alright with it.
bad,Please dont work for this company they do not treat you well at all and is not a good work environment i went in wanting to work there cause i liked sports and now that im gone from that company im really happy im gone!
bad,DONT work here if you can avoid it. This place has a bad management and the culture of a team is a funny notion . With the way they behave this as about as nice or polite i can be about it.
bad,"Dick's is a fun environment where you are friends with your coworkers and if you love sports this is the place to be. The Arden location has terrible management and horrible customer relations. You are expected to do 3 different jobs at once and get in trouble when you can't preform them all to managements wishes. The store manager is egotistical and rude, as well as judgement and prejudice. He wants his employees to know how to do things they were never trained for and expect far too much. I worked as the Admin Assistant and had to converse with him on a daily basis and no matter what there was always something wrong. He would praise those who were attractive and shun those who actually did their jobs and it causes them to constantly be understaffed. This store is the worst in the district and may be closing soon if things don't change."
bad,"MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO BE OVERHAULED AND REDONE. Management needs to support customer service environment. The customers are the reason we have our jobs. If a customer has an expired coupon, just accept it to provide great customer service. Also you need to be flexible with availability requirements. We do have a life outside of DSG you know. Especially those of us who are in school. The best part of the job was the Customers, hands down. I have learned to stay away from DSG for all reasons and purposes."
bad,I would defiantly recommend people to work at a beauty salon. It's a good experience! Just make sure you be careful what beauty salon you choose to work at.
bad,Did not get good training at all hour less then a hour and then they expected me to know what i was doing at all. The managers were very rude to you  they were nice at first then after getting hired they changed
bad,Terrible. No HOURS. low pay. and rude management team. I would not recommend to anyone. Rude employees. Very little training.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Long work hours, busy schedule, very male oriented company.  Fun and hard working associates.  I was able to learn more about sports and the technical aspects that go along with a lot of them."
bad,Big box retail is dying and the employees take all the heat over it. Be prepared to work in an understaffed store and you will most likely have poor management.
bad,"they are a horrible company, they work you for no pay, in 2 weeks you can make a whopping $300+ some of the people other then the managers aren't to bad. and the only fun thing about that job I could think of was being able to hit golf balls inside....."
bad,I have been with the company for some time now.  It is a company that does adapt to trends.  No real passion for their employees.
bad,"I have had a lot of jobs over the course of my life but this one was by far the worst. The management is completely incompetent and managers are always fighting with each other. There are over 5 managers and none of them know what they are in charge of which isn't surprising because they constantly change locations and departments. Hopefully you don't plan on taking any breaks or eating any lunch because it won't happen. They have to tell you that you're allowed to take breaks because it's against the law to not allow that, however, if you do decide to take a break or eat lunch you will very quickly be talked about and forfeit any chance you had at advancing. However, there is absolutely zero room for advancement or raises anyway. The only way you will even get any hours to work is if you are okay with having an extremely sporadic schedule and you won't know what days or hours you work until a few days before you're scheduled (if they even tell you at all). When I first started I was never told if I had been hired or when my hours would be and got a verbal warning when I didn't show up for my shift...on my first day.....when I wasn't even told I was hired!!! I do not recommend anybody working here. I do not know about other locations but this one is definitely something I would stay far away from."
bad,"I started at Memphis Polo Grounds Dick's as a sales associate. First day they put me directly on the floor without any training. I worked 9 hours without a break or a lunch. Nobody simply approached me with this information! The next day - same thing: 9 hours without a lunch, but with 10 min break. Third day I didn't go there at all. They work people to death there. Low pay and poor management. They try to save money on being under-stuffed. Don't recommend to anyone."
bad,"I worked part time at Dick's Sporting Goods while I am a student in college, to help pay for rent and school. Starting off, it was a really good part time job, and it payed the bills! But when I got hired, I was told there would be a training session, and there was not. They stuck me on the register on the first day by myself. I had no clue what I was doing, and they knew this was my first retail job. I also have a hearing disorder, and they did not accommodate this very well. I was unable to wear a headset for the radio and was told to keep the radio turned all the way down until i needed something. Because of this, I missed it whenever someone needed me, or called me over the radio, did the reports, or anything. I was also told when they hired me that the accommodate for a college students schedule as well as Doctor visits... This was found to be untrue. I was put on the schedule for our Thanksgiving break (first time seeing my family in a very long time, living hours away), when I asked off MONTHS in advance, and guess what? I was scheduled on the days I had Doctor Appointments, and they were informed about it. Since I was unable to get off to go to the doctor, I had no other choice but to call out, and it counted against me even though I brought proper notation from the Doctors themselves. The same thing happened during Christmas break. "
bad,"Bosses were rediculous, employees were spiteful and hated their job, overall moral was just negative.  My scheduling was not consistent, I did shipping and recieving when I was hired on as a cashier.  Too much big brother corporate mentality and it left nothing else for you to do.  You had to demand for a break.  Just a bad job."
bad,"When you say you are hired, you think it's a good thing but be careful. They don't care about you at all. They will put you on a computer and make you watch video after video, and ask you to take tests that you have to score 100%. Meanwhile the employees are talking SO LOUD you can't even concentrate. The management is completely ridiculous."
bad,Pretty much is a place of who can kiss the uppers butt more. New store manager is a jerk and practically puts on a fake nice when people that matter are around.
bad,I worked there for a while and management went down hill fast. besides the management it was an ok place to work. a lot of nice coworkers
bad,It's a very fast paced environment.  The manager's have so much tasks and not enough associate to delegate the work load.  As manager's you are forced to harass the associate and treat them like a prisoner.  I felt like a prison guard instead of being a manager.  There's a lot of wonderful associates but they are way overwork for the little pay.  There's associates that has been there for 6 years and get paid only 8.50 and hour.  I totally disagreed with this amount.
bad,"Very rude employees, no moral work ethics and work like a dog without compensation or recognition when promoted. Very high turn over rate for a company, does not take care of it's employees."
bad,I got this job in the summer and by time school started in September I was one of the longest active workers the turn over for any position is high.
bad,Retail is aweful. The ever changing management and the ever changing employee turnover make it an environment that you do not want to go to. I dreded every day going in to work there and was a long waste of two years of my life.
bad,Dicks sporting goods was a good seasonal job to learn about different company's and the way they operate. It helped me learn about scanning and coding as well as other different positions.
bad,"I went to an interview in Binghamton, NY at an industrial park where they returned all the damaged goods from all the stores in the country and where the first store started and they told me the most I could get was 37 hours because they had a study that proved employees were basically worthless after that point. They said the owner or largest shareholder was the son of the founder and he was on drugs and alcohol every day in a small town upstate."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"handled firearms, and the sale of firearms. order products and stock shelves. assisted customers with any outdoor questions that they had that pertained to hunting, fishing, camping, archery, and water sports."
bad,"My position with this company limits my potential and my skills. However I do have some great co-workers, the associates in the store are the people who make it a fun environment to work in. They are the people that make this place and deserve credit where credit is due!"
bad,"If you enjoy sporting goods and outdoors, this is the place. Otherwise long hours, inconsiderate lunches, harsh management, all for entry level easily disposable positions."
bad,"Dick's was quite possibly the worst place I have ever worked. Store manager ruled by fear and intimidation. Daily metrics were crammed down your throat and we were always pressured to improve them but were not given proper time to train.  Scheduling was mostly inflexible, unless that is, you were a Store Manager favorite."
bad,It was fun at first but then the store manager went over the budget and started to lay off associates. Many promises were also made but none were delivered.
bad,its horrible good luck moving up cause the people who are there aren't going any where and if you don't plan on making dicks sporting goods your career good luck getting enough hours or the respect from the managers they choose favorites and can careless if people take shifts without giving you a shift back without you knowing horrible work enviroment its borderline suicidal
bad,"I used to enjoy my time working for Dick's Sporting Goods.  They started to get rid of many departments, managers and positions which started to make the place fall apart.  They don't promote from within which is not appealing for someone that is wanting to make a career out of it.  They don't care about customer service only metrics.  The training, oh wait they don't train their employees they just stick them out there and expect you to learn on the fly."
bad,"Fun place to work but that's it. Managers are idiots who favor the kids that work there. Very childish behavior and lazy people. Managers lie to you about hours. Tell you during interview that you can have as many hours you want, then give you 16 hours a week. Than when you complain, they tell you too bad, go some where else, you can be replaced. They don't care about anyone, just sale numbers. I could sell a $1000 worth of stuff and get no praise, but if some kid sells a pair of shoes, they act like they sold $10,000 worth of stuff. Oh and how do they reward people for doing a good job? Money? Gift card? NO! They give you ""wow"" stickers!! Happy faces next to your name on a board!! What a joke!!"
bad,"I was hired by district manager, store manager felt that my salary was to high. She felt the same way about the golf pro, so she got ride of him.  Company was sued in a class action law suit, not paying employees for time spent in store after 10pm."
bad,"My managers wreaked of nicotine, drank with their underaged subordinates, and you get paid minimum wage to do a physically demanding job."
bad,"By far the worst company I have ever worked for.  Terrible management, terrible pay, stressful work environment.  Long hours, very tedious, disorganized company,"
bad,they dont give 2 s**** about there employees. you gonna work hard for them and eventually their gonna fire you just cuz they feel like it I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT WORKING HERE!!!
bad,"Management could careless about things going on in your life, let alone how you are doing at work. I do not recommend working here."
bad,"co-workers work well together, learned a lot about different tasks in a variety of departments. some poor management. like being able to interact with the public."
bad,if you like to work retail this is the job for you....bad management
bad,"•	Examined contents and compared with records to verify accuracy of incoming shipment"
bad,I didn't like working here and the management was terrible. the company does not value its employees and even talk bad about them
bad,this company is absolute garbage!  they treat you like garbage especially if you are in management.  The talent acquisition team is a bunch of whiney crybaby do nothing idiots!  They all think that having their associates degrees in liberal arts (because they are too stupid to get a real degree)  makes them cool!
bad,"I would never work here another day in my life. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT, they mess with your pay for months and months and don't compensate for missed pay. You get told one thing and then another and get in trouble when you don't get some thing done. Horrible place to work no matter what age you are."
bad,Don't have anything good to say about working here. Looking forward to finding something better.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,I loved working in the fishing and hunting department it was great. the management team wasnt good at all never helped out in the department. the yearly raise was so rediculous i told them to keep it.
bad,"Don't waste your time with this company, unrealistic expectations from corporate. Prices are too high. Discount sucks."
bad,"The worst job I ever had. The store manager being unfriendly and not giving me merit for a job well done, to the work environment being hateful and snobbish, I would not recommend this job to no one, Very traumatic. I was never trained. They expected you to perform your functions of the job like  they wanted it or you were verbally abused.Happy customers were my lifesaver."
bad,"This company is Not a professional company. They show a lot of favoritism to select employees. Hours are very little on average,benefits are minimal,managers are stressed,lazy,and uneducated.Since i have worked there managers and lead positions have been given to outside applicants rather than in house employees that have been dedicated and working hard. This has been done at times when raises were to be given out.They would terminate tenured employees and replace them with outside applicants and pay them lower hourly wages! The turnover with management was the absolute worst that i have EVER seen in any workplace. This company is the absolute Worst.....and i was a Supervisor at this company for 13months!.....take my word for it on this review and do not waste your time or money here!!!"
bad,"The corporate center is an absolutely horrible environment to work in. They placate their employees with ""amenities"" like the gym, etc. at the workplace but treat them terribly. You are a cog in a machine at the corporate center. The discrimination is obvious throughout the workforce. I worked in Human Resources and had to watch obvious acts of discrimination occur daily. I couldn't wait to get another job. There is no room for advancement unless you fit a prototype."
bad,Never met a company less in touch with the employees that actually do the work. Terrible company. Probably the worst one in the history of companies.
bad,"Although the store is new and most of the employees are excited to be there, the management sucks! The general manager talks down to the employees and expects perfection from new employees. They don't train or help you improve or give any direction whatsoever, but if you mess up, you get punished. They pick favorites and bully the rest. I have never hated going to work more than while working here. And the company doesn't treat their customers well either."
bad,"Having been recently terminated by Dicks, I am not objective about the company, but after working there 8 years, I was shown no consideration.  They are a lousy company to work for because they don't care about their employees, and never advance employees to better positions.  They look outside the company to hire managers and do not promote from within."
bad,This company is in trouble and won't last - notice how low the reviews are and the number -
bad,"no matter how hard you work your job is threatened each day. I was always on time, did what was asked, provided excellent customer service and it wasn't good enough."
bad,Rules do not apply to upper management that the rest of the staff is expected to abide by. 
bad,"Management is very uncaring as far as working schedule .Most nights you are required to work well beyond scheduled time of end of shift.Folding clothes is main focus .Duties include cleaning of store ,mark downs, signage .Dont recommend this place to anyone who absolutely doesnt need a job. High turn over of employees because of this."
bad,"Specific managers have their ""little click"" and if you're not in it you get treated like nothing!. The store is poorly ran depending on the manager working at that moment! Too many of the associates and managers behavior towards each other are unmoral, unforgiving, and inappropriate!It's a bunch of mess!!!! It's all SMOKE AND MIRRORS!!!! Please don't apply unless this is your last result as a job!"
bad,Unethical management who has since been fired for gross misconduct.
bad,"One of the worst Companies I ever worked for. No job security, appreciation, and full of deceit and lies."
bad,I learned that at DSG that unless you are friends with someone who is in a corporate position that you get no where. Working your way up from the bottom gets you no where you are still treated like garbage and they never care about how much you get done because it is never enough. Take it from someone who has been there for many years that DSG is a place that will get you no where but out the door for all your hard work dedication and missing important events in your life.
bad,"I went for an interview and the person doing the interview asked if I am involved presently with any sport activities. She said that my answer would not reflect being hired for the position. I told her no and the interview continued. Well, 2 weeks have passed and I know the reason she did not hire me..MY AGE! I have more than enough experience for a cashier, when I was called to come in, she said she was very interested in my resume...Go figure..think twice before applying for any job at Dicks. Thye want only YOUNGER people!"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Worst place I have ever worked! All about Score Cards & Dick's Credit Cards. Management does not care about anything else. I hated the work environment.
bad,"I really enjoyed the work environment. But I didn't like management, I think the place was very unprofessional which is sad because Dick's Sporting Goods is such a great company, but the Clearwater store is ruining that for them. I would love to see different managers and coworkers throughout the store..who fairly distribute hours"
bad,Iwas called into an interview and what I thought went good was all bs. I was sent an e-mail to my phone at 1:30 i the morning to my phone waking me up just to tell me I was not going to be hired because they found some one whos back ground and skills better matched bs I have 14+ years working on bike and just the same with customer service. I feel that that is not true but was graded solely on some computer ran assement. Bs dont wast yor time they dont care about your experiance more the less who they know.
bad,I only worked a few hours at a time and wasnt a fan of the way people would talk to me and eachother.
bad,"Uneducated, incompetent, unorganized, irresponsible, and immature management. Treat employees like children, schedule never completed on time, and when it is don't count on getting out at the time your scheduled to, you'll get out hours later. If you work in a two story store be prepared to be watched daily by manager on duty pacing like a prison guard and whispering bs into your headset all day randomly. Overall MANAGEMENT was ridiculous. This "" job"" is a joke and I'm 100% sure this company knows it and does not care as they'll just hire the next five people who are interviewed daily."
bad,"From the District Manager down, it's all a LIE...I was promised a full time position at our newest location we've been open since September 2012 & so far I'm down to 4 hours a week & no new position is even on the horizon...Very Sad.."
bad,A true corporation that is only for them selves and offer no flexibility nor security!
bad,"Sporting Goods cared more about their stock holders than their employees. While I worked there, the management were concerned about their job security which in turn created stress to those that worked under them. Change was an every day part of the job. Instead of trying to keep the culture they consistently changed items, often for the worse."
bad,"The employees are overworked and underpaid. The company does not offer any incentives for employees. I operated a cash register, maintained sales floor cleanliness and unloaded incoming freight."
bad,"Was hired at minimum wage. 2 years later only received a 60 cent increase in pay! Terrible, cheap company. Stay away."
bad,I worked as a cashier and was there for about a year until I was fired unexpectedly. The truth? I was harassed sexually by the Golf Lead and threatened to turn him in to HR. 3 weeks later I was fired
bad,"sold shoes, bad management. some times you were expected to work two floors by your self with lots of customers it was an overwhelming experiance"
bad,It is a place that does not promote with in. Also employee's do not receive proper breaks and lunch breaks. They just lost a law suit in which they were sued for improper treatment of employee's regarding lunch breaks. They pay very poorly.
bad,this company treats their employees very poorly. They train their managers to be very disrespectful towards hourly associates
bad,"I was the one that just quit this position. This store would have been fun to work in and I would have stayed if it weren't for the awful manager. He does not do his job and deligates all his work onto others. He is rude, he screamed at me on multiple occasions, because his personal life was not going his way. He cursed me on multiple occasions. So if you take this job get ready! I am not the only one he did this to, he did it to all the girls that work there."
bad,"Got referred for my fantastic customer service and manager experience, quickly realized it was a bad move. First off the training process is a joke, it doesn’t matter what department you’re designated to. Be prepared to be used and abused by management that doesn’t care about your goals or outside life. This company treats the employees that have passion the worst and caters to part timers that do the bare minimum because they’re easier to deal with. Don’t get stuck here, because you’ll become miserable and any skills you possess going into this job will digress due to hectic work days and overall stress."
bad,Honestly since I was in high school I always wanted to work at Dick Sporting Goods but in the end I’ll have to say I wouldn’t recommend anyone to this job while working there I fitness a deal of disrespect and even managers taking up for disrespectful associates because of seniority organization could be a lot better and communication I’ve seen people that have been qualified to be promoted but instead someone less experienced got it over them needless to say I’m  glad to wash my hands with the company
bad,management was horrible/ enviourment. Lack of respect for employees from managers. GM lies to your face more then doesn't as long as it means making money.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,This job is decent if you are part time looking to work 10-20 hours a week. Once advancing to lead the pay is slightly better but does not line up with the increased workload. There is no need to advance because once you become management you are expected to work no less than 50 hours a week on salary. I could easily make more than assistant managers working as an hourly lead. Management and corporate are completely out of touch and don’t hold themselves or any employees accountable except for a select few.
bad,"Every body wants to be in charge.  Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Staff creating problems upper staff members.  Too many micro managers! A lot of nepotism within the company, so if you need help with a issues  you had no safe place to discuss."
bad,This company prides itself on understaffing and promotion of under qualified people out of desperation. I was a Soft Lines Manager and on a weekly basis was required to do 60+ hours of work in a “40-45 hour workweek” if you want to meet deadlines and keep bosses off your back plan on working 60+ hours to complete your task with no overtime pay.
bad,"Managers were jerks. They moved the only good one to another location against her will. Bad company, horrible management. No encouragment, no advancement, no respect."
bad,"I'm a military Veteran who decided to change careers out of IT into Film/Entertainment. I also have a Bachelors degree. I took a job at Dicks to keep me busy between film jobs. The pay isn't the best, because it's retail.  The store managers and assistant managers make bank. (Between 70K & 90K)  For the current area, I live in my pay is decent, only because I was hired on in CA and eventually transferred. I was making more than an employee who had been with the company for over three years. I recently turned down the Lodge Lead position because I don't want to spend more time there when I can be looking for more Film opportunities."
bad,Good job if you dont have kids or have family. If you do you better suck up to the boss or be management. They don't care about doctors notes. You still nees to come in or you get written up. Even if your kids are sick. You still need to come in.  You get store discounts but the stuff is expensive as heck.
bad,"Hmm is on power trip/ so was lost prevention! Terrible company to work for ! Show partiality do not recommend to anyone looking for a job, no hours unless it is their convienence"
bad,"I was there almost 2 years, worked my butt off, never got talked to about a promotion, other people there for like 2 months got opportunities but didnt do half as good a job as me or some other people that were there longer, management when I started there was amazing, cared about the staff, were easy to talk to, gave hours based on your work and work ethic, not based off of if they like you or not, but when I left, management was horrible, treated lower positions like dirt, played favorites, cut hours for no reason, horrible communication, changed the setup in departments how they wanted not how it was supposed to be. Was left alone on the sales floor multiple times because manager was in back with other associates just goofing off eating pizza when they were not on break."
bad,Raises are normally 60 cents yearly. And 60 cents is the most I’ve ever seen also. Want you to do a lot for a little. Very poor leadership in the company from the top down.
bad,"Made a big mistake investing my time with this company. No training, very undependable company. Management not stable. No support from HR, management has no time to properly train. Expectations are held high with absolutely no support. I feel management needs more training them selves. My rights we're violated and treated like a criminal."
bad,"The management is horrible, they don’t take care or take the time to listen to their employees, sometimes you don’t get a break, they don’t have their priorities straight, they’re rude and mark you up for simply asking a question, and you don’t really get a life if you’re full time. Having health issues they won’t let you go to the bathroom except on break IF you get a break. The managers play favorites. They nitpick every single thing you do and get annoyed when you ask for help."
bad,Probably one of the worst places I’ve ever worked. In the DFW area they are so rude. They DO NOT focus on customer service. You can work 8 hours a day and do nothing productive to further your “career”  and whatever the manger says that day. Absolutely NOT a fun environment! Run from this place! The turnover rate is terrible. Oh and don’t even THINK about working full time they’ll be so rude to you and want you to work alllll day long and they don’t care if you’re sick or anything. Stupid stupid place.. everyone complains as soon as they’re there for a month or so.
bad,"A typical day at work is watching your back. Very few managers know or have any idea of what they're doing. A cutthroat work place, example, Mgr; why is this set up like this? Employee; because yesterday you told us to set it up like this!"
bad,Every thing I learned in this company I had to take it upon myself to learn. I had little to no training. I learned multiple departments in hopes help improve my in company resume. I was told upon hiring that I was one of the first employees to receive a full time position. I have been there over a year now and have seen full time positions that I have told management I wanted to be considered for and was not interviewed for three out of the four opportunities. In fact not interviews were done for the other positions.
bad,"Management is unfair when scheduling hours. Managers have selected favorites who get special treatment. Those who are not favorites, do not get special treatment and get treated poorly. Management tried to guilt you and make you feel bad if you got sick and had to call out, when you had called out maybe once within the past year while those who are favorites and call out multiple times in a year, get away with it. Unfair advantages to those of specific culture and color of skin."
bad,Awful work environment. Managers never manage. Just sit in the back office ripping emails all day on the computer everything put on the leads who basically run the store on a daily basis.
bad,They treat the employees like trash!! I absolutely hated working there. I had coworkers talk bad about me. I only worked there for 3 months and I hated it!! Never working there again.
bad,"I've learned working for Dick's there's no way for you to grow within a company when you hire outside instead of in house. Loved the customers but management was awful,the manager stayed in the office more than anything."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,They told me I would get 30 plus hours but that never happened. Some weeks I would only get 8 hours a week. Currently I am getting 0 hours. I don't think they are a good company to work for.
bad,"check out customers in timely manner. Always left alone up at customer service, with lines and no help. Angry customers due to this. Lack of schedules and poor management."
bad,The pay and hours at Dick's sporting Good is not worth the time nor the money that they offer to work for this company. Great coworkers that I work with but other than that not something to grow or advance in.
bad,"The company forces you to sign up people for a rewards card. Your performance on selling cards is based on whether you get hours or not. Very misogynistic, not willing to listen to employees about change."
bad,"Most of the negatives of the store are not down to the store management or personnel; it is trickle-down effect from ineffective Corporate policies and decisions. There is a culture of neglect that makes for an extremely stressful work experience. Associates are expected to perform miracles in customer service, but the store payroll hours are constantly being cut by the corporate office, even though the store is one of the highest grossing stores in its district, especially since the demise of it's major competitor, Sports Authority; their closing raised store traffic and sales 35-40%, yet payroll was actually slashed by 20%, so now there is more customer traffic and less employees to deal with it. Yet associates are taken to task by corporate officers for the state of the store, freight not being put out in a timely manner, etc., even though this is all a direct result of the lack of payroll resulting in not enough manpower to accomplish the needed tasks. The management team is great in some areas, pretty unprofessional in others, although the Store Manager is amazing and in my top five of favorite bosses. Overall, the store itself is not a bad experience; but I would tell anyone I actually liked to NEVER work there, because the company as a whole is very badly managed on several levels. If they ever experienced any true competition from another sporting goods store, I would expect the entire company to go under in less than a decade due to mismanagement."
bad,"I worked there for 2 days, A manager for 2nd shift went off on me for stating my opinion on how I feel like he should respect me. He walked off from me, and then started following me, yelled at me in front of people 2 times, and followed me talking crazy making a scene. I never in my life been so disrespected. The killer part is no one cares to reach out to ask me what happened. They do not train you, maybe like 10 mins and they disappear from you... they tell you to get your numbers up, but there's no training or tools to do your job effectively. DC in East point can not keep people due to lack of respect! I was with Addeco temp service"
bad,The job was a total nightmare from the management all the way to the culture and attitude of customers and workers. It was very unprofessional and the environment was toxic at best.
bad,"Each day i would have a schedule that was made by the manager, but it was never the hours i worked, there was always some reason to send me home early and came in hours early the next day, the products were very heavy and there was no lifting help provided"
bad,"When I was hired, it was like they promised you the world. Then once you are in, it's like being fed to the sharks. You are trained ONE day and then put on your own.  When you work in the other departments, you have at least 2 people closing with you...not apparel...which is 90% of the store. 1 person..yes 1 person closing that whole department. Then you get told 'you need to prioritize' because your are not getting things done how they want it done. Made me feel like I was going too slow. Customer service is my top priority and that is what I did. But by the end of the night, you are so dead tired from running all around...being pulled in different directions. Personal things had come up after I was hired and I had put them first and I was told that work came first and it was an 'obligation' and that I needed to pick between personal and work. I would not recommend this place for employment"
bad,I've worker at DSG for almost a year and I'm already over it. The pay is terrible and the management is even worse! They really try to take advantage of you or don't. Majority of the leads get bored and start to gossip like its high school. I've been Associate of the Month for 5 months and I only get 10 hours a week. HOW FUN.
bad,Management is not the best at all when it comes to making decisions. They don't care about the employees at all. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"I worked their for five months and had multiple people quit around me, I also quit because it was a terrible place to work and they also expect way to much out of you for less then $9.00 an hour. As you can see the Casper, Wy store is hiring all positions... Don't work here. Oh and the managers loved to put you on a guilt trip for calling in. My grandfather passed away and I called a day in advance of my next shift to tell them I wouldn't be in and the manager on duty said ""okay I will try to find someone."" So as a responsible human being I called the next morning to see if they had covered my shift and they said that they hadn't yet and had the guts to ask me if there was any way I could still come in. The main store manage was very cocky and thought he was hot stuff and talked down to all the employees when they did wrong."
bad,"This job only cares about their managers. Workers are drones that are easily replaced, and its a revolving door of workers."
bad,"Most mornings start off at a good pace, however it is always an oppurtunity to learn something new.  I have learned how to phone screen potenial hires and set up interviews for other managers.  The co-workers are hardworking great employees.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with my employer; he has a personality that I have never encountered in my life.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when I have completed my work and I leave for the day."
bad,"I worked at Dick's over one summer, and hated it. The management was either vicious toward employees or completely impotent. The culture was obsessed with sales and money, which being a retail store I understand, but Dick's took it to an unreasonable extreme. Employees are treated like disposable garbage. The training is virtually nonexistent and employees are expected to be perfect at their jobs despite the laughable lack of preparation. Awful place to work; I would recommend it to no one."
bad,"Management style - bullying.  Bullying seems to be a corporate culture since it transverses several levels of management, different time frames and several different managers.  The excellent employees leave at the first chance.  There is blatant favoritism by management.  Do not go to work here.  The environment and culture drain a normally conscientious employee of any desire to excel."
bad,"sell merchandise"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,The Store Manager was very unprofessional. You could work hard for the company and the hard work and dedication that you put in was unappreciated.. 
bad,"I was an employee at dicks sporting goods in orlando, fl at the millennia location. It was the worst place in the world to work and I would not recommend it to any one. The management does not provide opportunities to anyone for advancement and they lie about benefits. The managers do not know how to run a simple store. Almost all of the associates received bad reviews from customers and customers walk out very angry on a daily basis. Customers have also complained about rats in the store."
bad,They promise you the world and back guarantee to you great hours and do neither. The top manager is very rude to staff and customers and should not be a manager. All i can say is there was not one thing about this job that i liked be a athletic person and the manager ruined that for me and wasted my time!
bad,"A busy under staffed operation. I did learn great customer service skills. Management did an excellent job of training employees in customer service, but not too well on staffing. Co-workers were very supportive. Dealing with working in the back room stocking shelves and working the floor at once. Making the customer smile."
bad,A typical day at work- Dealing with stressful customers. Doing other employee's job including the managers. Not being able to get your own duties done because of the high volumn of people. They don't schedule enough people for truck days every week so they are short handed in every department.
bad,"At first, there were many promises that my experience would benefit this particular location. But by the end of the first two weeks, the GM that hired me quit, leaving the store to the inept ability of a sales manager with supposed experience. Favoritism is an understatement. Claiming to be a fair manager, I personally witnessed and was a victim of missed lunches, longer than usual hours...12-16 hour days for weeks at a time, and overall, said sales managers inability to gain respect of the crew. All the while, the DM, HR, and LP managers defended her actions...to the point of letting me go illegally. I am filing paperwork as I write this."
bad,"You are just a number, that's it. They will pay no attention to your scheduling needs (although you write down your availability) then will be punished by losing hours/ shifts if you say, don't agree to skip a class to work. No coherent communication or message from management, lots of back stabbing, politics, and people playing the blame game. You will be straight out lied to. You will be understaffed, and given way too much to do even if you don't help customers at all. Benefits are only for full time, and those are the leads, no one else. a full 60% of weekly payroll goes to 5 of the 30+ employees! All in all, i would rather drive nails thru my hand all day than work there anymore"
bad,This position is a joke and not worth the $8.50/hr they pay...I could go on...and just may in a later review
bad,"Worked at Dicks for 9 years. Store was always ranked in the top 3 for sales in company. Used to be a great place to work, awesome co-workers and in the past great managers. Now being a associate with no staff or payroll and constant unnecessary pressure from management is a nightmare! Would not wish this job on my worst enemy. You cannot get a fraction of what is piled upon you done let alone help customers. I felt sorry for the customers and honestly was embarrassed to work there. Never enough staff or payroll, and this was one of their most profitable stores! I am surprised by the number of positive reviews. Dicks cares absolutely nothing for its employees. Only its profits."
bad,Fun staff. Not enough hours and schedule never comes out in a timely manner
bad,High turnover with high stress and bad management
bad,"Since i have been there the store has gone down hill. The store manager was only there a few months when i was hired and now 8 months later the whole store is feeling the effects. Not saying that That is reason, however, talking to other associates the scheduling and the overall attitude in the store is not where where is should be. The people are very knowledgeable in their departments which makes it a little better. Can be a fun place to work but some major changes need to be made."
bad,"I completely hated working here after 4 months of being there and everyone in it . Management was absolutely horrible and i've been disrespected a few times by one employee who still currently works there . Also, after putting in my two weeks, I was completely taken off the schedule before I could even finish the two week time period."
bad,"I only worked here one day and that's all I needed to know that this place was a bad place to work for. The person who was suppose to be training me didn't really seem to care to show me anything, For example whenever she had to go get something from the back of the store she told me to wait in the front instead of showing me where things were. Also, when she went on break they had me greet guests when they walked in and when guests had questions about where things were in the store I didn't know where anything was because I didn't get a tour of the store. Another reason is because it was my first day and I was ringing slow because I'm new and not sure how all the tag removals worked and they person watching me got annoyed and said I was going too slow and decided just to take over what I was doing. So I told the manger everything and left."
bad,"I worked there and was able to work at all the departments except lodge and golf. You’re able to be at different departments, but they don’t want to pay you for it. They are unprofessional and unorganized. Some of the keyholders were awesome though."
bad,"The company does a point system for anytime you call out, or show up late. It’s unfair."
bad,"The Watertown NY store needs serious overhaul of supervisors& managers. They are poster children of how NOT to act as a person in charge.I have never seen a more unprofessional bunch of adults in my life.  They are impossible to please & talk down to employees, play favorites. They act like bullies on a playground"
bad,Overall not the place I would want anyone to work in.  Company is made of cover ups and unrealistic expectations.  Everything is by checking the box vs an actual process.   Too many priorities with changes monthly to company vision.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Poor store manager. He hides in the office all day. Managers in general couldn't run a donkey show! They spend their day in the office watching cameras in stead of being a representative of the company. The people who care are about their job are over looked and mistreated but those who are late or no shows without calling in mind you are given a pass. Pretty young work force there
bad,"While in a new hire benefits meeting people behind me were talking about how they couldn’t believe how good the pay was for not having a degree.  That certainly wasn’t the case for my salary."
bad,"Upper management is terrible with changing their minds ""to meet current business needs"" that they mess with costumer service because of the lack of payroll to meet the needs of the main reason that your there.  Taking care of the customer!!!!"
bad,treated like absolute children just because we were lower titles than some management. they kept us way past the times on our schedule and were always understaffed. even when we reached the time requirements for a legal lunch break they did not abide by that. worked 8+ hours and only got a 20 min break. got paid less than every other person doing the same exact job as me just because i was younger
bad,"Working at Dicks in Boca Raton was a not friendly work environment."
bad,"At first it was a nice environment working there, but as time went on it became a place if you weren't ""buddy buddy"" with the right mangers you weren't getting an increase in pay, you weren't getting promoted, and you never got off when you requested off, even if its more than 2 months in advance. While working there it was becoming clear that young females that were in shape were the ones getting the raises and time off when requested over anyone working there. Working hours were never consistent, one week you would work 20-30hrs the following week maybe 10-14hrs. It was impossible to work there and afford a place to live on my own let alone pay my bills because of how low the pay was working there. You could work there for years and make less than $10.50 an hour and a new hire shows up straight out of high school and they make $13-$14 an hour. The only plus side of working there was the discount, I suggest this place to work at if you have a full time job and you are looking for a side job to make extra money on the side."
bad,I worked at the Glendale Galleria location for about a year and what I can say is that that job is complete BS. Mind you the assistant managers were kind a cool the employees were cool it’s just how the store is ran AND  store manager. Store manager was known to down talk employees and I didn’t believe it until it happened.
bad,It was awful. The management was the worst I’ve ever seen. Played a lot of favorites as well. I worked hard but they didn’t appreciate it. Don’t work here.
bad,"Management was very poor at communicating, as well as prejudiced. Let's you know how much they don't need you a lot. Part-time employees get no benefits, and the only good thing about the job were the coworkers, and some more than most because everyone was lazy and nasty. Hours were inconsistent and cut back and forth, little to no training (literally had to train myself by staying overtime and working other departments) rather hire new employees than give existing employees more hours. You'd even hear coworkers or management talking poorly on other associates. I do not recommend this store."
bad,"Management is slow to help on sales-floor, and the work environment was not very team efficient or collaborative. Managers also competed  about running the store more so then helping employees."
bad,"Store managers  are disorganized causing extreme stress among employees. Stressful environment, This company has very little compassion for employees. A lot of which come into the company with positive attitudes and within days turn negative because of the way they are treated. This is not a company that cares about its employees. Turn over rate is through the roof."
bad,"A typical day at work was dealing with caddy people who would sell you out to save their own collective butts.  I learned nothing from this company except what not to want from the next employer.  Management came up through the ranks, but were never shown how to be leaders.  Again, the environment was cut throat, but for no reason.  Communication was nonexistent."
bad,I was security and it was 12 n hour and manager was conceited and very immature. The pay was terrible. And it was unarmed even when the company would bring in armed police when there were threats made.
bad,"Working at DSG has been one of the worst experiences. The management is very rude - they tell you to do multiple things at once and get upset when it’s not done quickly while trying to take care of customers. They’ll call you an hour before a shift you’re not working is supposed to start asking you to work, because they’re so short staffed. They rarely give a break unless you remember to ask for it. They have a point system for if you call out - 8 points and you’re fired (which isn’t fair for things like snow, bad driving conditions, etc.). I’ve experienced 5 managers since I’ve been working. I’ve seen employees leave within 2 weeks before. DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE."
bad,"Not a great work place for women in management."
bad,"Working here was a nightmare. They hired me for a certain position and then on my very first day decided they ""changed their mind"" and put me into a different department. When I later brought it up to them they threatened to fire me on the spot. The managers are extremely judgmental. There is a lot of negative talk over the employee radios and always finger pointing. Everyone working there hates their jobs and looks miserable and aren't afraid to tell you that."
bad,"Drama filled life, similer to if you were working with peers in high school. No one has an agreeable work schedule...ever. The work is hard and often petty, just like everyones attitudes. There was to much expected travel, and little to no guidence or feedback for work on a daily/weekly basis. This is definitely a Corporation and not a family owned business which has many draw backs, and everyone is a dispensible cog in the huge coorporation machine. Also their values as a company are not solid or unwavering, but change quickly as the opinion of the ""public"" does because they are so scared of offending any of their customer base. They bring all of their employees in on their petty rivalries with other retail companies,  and love to attempt to brainwash or overpower the opions of their own employees about such things. Definitely not a long term place to work for, this place is best for part time workers still in school who just need some income."
bad,The job itself is extremely boring as the store is never busy. They want you to always stay busy but there is nothing to do. You have to push credit cards onto customers until they get mad at you or management will chew you out every single day. You have so many sales numbers to meet that it becomes stressful for a minimum wage job. Management was definitly the worst part of the job. The store manager is one of the worst people I have ever worked for
bad,"working there was like any other retail job; customers were a**holes but the management was alright, but there were no benefits really if you were a part-time worker and you were expected to do more than what was expected from your position but you were not probably paid for doing the work of other departments."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Worked here part time and it sucked, management was terrible and none of your associates are friendly or helpful. You are overworked for a not enough pay."
bad,"Insufficient training, inconsistent application of policies/procedures, and COMPLETE and TOTAL disrespect for co-workers. Management has no problem humiliating and shaming an employee based on 3rd party hear-say. They suck."
bad,"The work flow was unpredictable, and the hours were weak. When I was hired I was promised 30-40 hours a week, but only got around 20 for the first few months then my last month was cut down to 2-5 hours a week until I had no choice but to quit. I was thrown in to to footwear my first day with no actual training on black-Friday. Management completely ignored employees request and the schedule was very unorganized always. I always got called to come in on short notice all the time  but my shifts or weekly hours never increased no matter how efficient and reliable I was. We were not paid commission in the time I worked here. Lack of help and information given to me in the beginning of my time working here left many customers disappointed."
bad,"When I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods, it was like the leads wanted to take over your personal life. The way that schedule was made was awful. If you gave them a date you couldn't do because of school, they wouldn't care at all. I was a high school student at the time and they worked me to the core. When it was time for me to go home, they would give me more tasks knowing that my shift had ended. Of course I felt like I couldn't just leave. The people there make you feel so bad about yourself and didn't try to get to know me at all. It was all so unhealthy. Talking about unhealthy, in the break room there were ants. I would try to clean it up even though it wasn't my job to do. They kept coming back and no matter how many times I told someone, they wouldn't do anything about it. So I just let their colony build. Overall, the job itself was simple, but the people who I worked with made it hard. I can honestly say never again."
bad,"I took a golf club tech job, but got to do very little  club repair.  Since Dicks is always short staffed and doesnt hire a cleaning crew, i spent half my time as a checker, and the other half unboxing merch and cleaning the store.  I had to clean toilets and mop floors - noble work, but not what I signed up for."
bad,"Terrible pay, ended up doing the work of 2 to 3 other people. other associates could not care less about what they had to do. management also was as useless as a bag of air"
bad,"terrible place to work, management was awful. severely understaffed. i left because there was only two of us in the apparel department. hates the aparaparel department just wanted to cashier."
bad,Working with the customer and giving them the best customer service they need is great. But you are unable to balance your work life with your personal life.
bad,cameras everywhere. they watch you all day long. don't stop to blow your nose or your fired!favortism runs rampid in the company treating the stronger workers with a slap to the face by throwing all the heavy lifting at them while catering to the weak
bad,I worked there for 10 years and all they do is put too much on your plate and reduce payroll to make it even harder. They never say nice job or give support to management staffs!!
bad,"Management doesn't care about anyone or anything.  Schedules are always wrong.  People are rude and mean and the favorites get away with whatever they want.  Management doesn't know what they're doing.  It is the worst place I have ever worked.  Looking for another job and as soon as I can get one, I will be leaving. "
bad,"Very weird place to work with many weird people. I don't suggest anyone work for this company. The prices are so high at their stores, that the employee discount really doesn't even make a dent"
bad,I've had my fair share of retail but this is probably one of the worst retail stores I have worked for. Managers constantly cursed customers and other employees behind closed doors and had no respect for anyone but themselves. No on the job training. It was basically fend for yourself or get punished for it. The few employees scheduled to work had mountains of tasks to finish before the shift ended while the store manager sat in his office complaining about customers. A very very unprofessional workplace and made me fear for my job constantly. Confidential information about employees was yelled across rooms to other managers without caring who heard. I've heard everything from who quit and why they quit or even who they preferred to hire. Managers constantly complained about employees and no information behind closed doors is ever kept secret. I wish I could do more for the poor people that left because of certain reasons instead of typing a review but I hope that people who are considering working for this particular store will understand what goes on! I would not recommend shopping at this store or even working there!
bad,"This company faces many challenges to its success. The lack of technology and payroll structure are the two greatest hindrances."
bad,The managers are rude and unfair and they treat their customers horrible. Honestly will never return there to work or shop and I was a frequent shopper
bad,"Not the best place to work if you live in NC, and work in va. They take out double taxes and if you're working for minimum wage, that's about your whole check."
bad,"I left my previous job in hopes from what I was told ( consistent hours and pay). Aside from that management happen to lose my first paycheck which I never received. "
bad,Always severely understaffed. Management does not  care about anyone but themselves. Management doesn't look at availability before making a schedule.
bad,"A typical day at Dick's Sporting Goods includes the basic retail experience. The main focus for DSG is pushing Customer Service, and Sales. The leadership that the management shows is very poor, as there is very little training, and little-to no experience in upper management. Co-workers are at the usual retail level of education (high school, some college). The most enjoyable part of the job, is the end of the day, as most employees are treated without respect & compassion."
bad,NC location was by far the worst place I have ever worked. NC job location showed too much favoritism.Rather not say No comment worst experience ever.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Horrible!!"
bad,This was a horrible employer. There was bare minimum training provided. Each manager was on a different page and didn't agree upon anything. There was never anything consistent from day to day. I was giving a promotion because I am motivated and a hard worker.
bad,"6 years ago this was a very promising employer, now with the founding CEO retired, the rapid expansion idea has taken over... quality is replaced with profit driven mentality... hourly jobs are minimum wage and hours are sparse. full time hourly exist, but should completely be eliminated by 2014."
bad,Don't waste your time working for this company. They lie in the interview telling you its full time and cut your hours every week!
bad,"This particular store is a disaster. They fire employees who have been faithfulo and hardworking for absolutely nothing. The management, especially the front end manager is completely inept, and borderline train wreck stupid. This company gives away money to customers who ask, and couldnt manage its way out of a paper bag"
bad,management will stand on second floor and yell at you so that the customers can hear there power will not help you just continue yelling will only give you the min amount of hours they can but will still bring more people into the store
bad,"all training is done by computer, don't ask questions unless you want to feel stupid (they are good at that), no advancement for people with learning disabilities. constantly pushed to acquire customers personal info"
bad,This was by far the worst job I've ever had. They pay well but take advantage of their workers. They have horrible managers and don't provide a positive working environment. My coworkers are very nice. When someone doesn't agree to come in on their day off she cuts ur hours to working everyday to once a week. They expect you to come in at the snap of their fingers. When I did come into work early they don't even appreciate it.
bad,"If you’re a student, do not work here. You never leave when you’re scheduled to leave as a closer. I would stay at the store until 12:30 AM on school nights on certain days and would literally never leave at the time I was scheduled to leave... NEVER. If you decide to work at Dick’s, especially as a student, consider the fact that you won’t have a life outside of work. You’ll probably have nightmares about it. The management could do more to help. They overwork their employees and hardly want to give you a 10 minute break during a 6 hour shift. Managers throw too many tasks at you at once. They practically give money away to please customers. Also customers here are some of the most entitled ignorant people I’ve ever come across. One of the managers made me cry because he was so mean to me! Do not work here!!! Do yourself a favor and don’t make the same mistake I made."
bad,"The company itself wasn't bad but the management was very poor, while i was there people who had been hired 3 months after me were being promoted to my supervisor even though i worked harder and had been there longer and knew how to do more things than them. A typical work day i'd get there and was almost always put at the back register because i was the fastest person at processing merchandise, sometimes i would get there and the cashier a head of me would have left me 3 carts overflowing of clothes that i would have to process. i would end up processing 6+ carts of clothes in a 7 hour shift. The training was horrible, they had me shadow a supervisor for 30 mins then had me get on the register and that was the full extent of my training, i ultimately had to train myself on a lot of stuff and also had to help new hires who hadn't been thoroughly trained either even though i wasn't a supervisor. the hardest part had to be the processing because if you fell behind you'd get overwhelmed and you could have 6+ carts at the back register to hang up and censor. There was lots of drama and some of the managers and supervisors would step out of the store whenever they wanted for a smoke break and not count that as their lunch break so they could take up to 5 smoke breaks a shift plus a lunch. Some of my coworkers were fun to work with but that was the only enjoyable part of this job. So i would ultimately encourage you to steer clear of this place unless its your last option"
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked, to be quite honest, and that's mainly because of the management by the store manager and the hostile environment it creates."
bad,I would highly recommend NOT working here. The store manager is the biggest micro manager i've ever come across. Highly disrespectful and treats his employees like robots. They value trying to get high numbers than treating their employees good. Very stressful with high workloads expected to be completed while chasing customers around the store. Save yourself the time and look to work elsewhere.
bad,"This was an awful place to work the employees are only seen as bodies filling positions to support the stores needs. Employees aren’t shown even the smallest bit of human decency, truly awful"
bad,"store manager lacks ethics. store is flexible with scheduling your hours. Its a typical retail store. Nothing enjoyable & ""fun"" about working here. Most enjoyable part of my job is clocking out,"
bad,"Dicks is simple and easy. Only thing is the management at Hunt valley store in Maryland are terrible. Which will make your experience dreadful. wouldn't recommend this particular store, but the dicks sporting goods company in general I would !"
bad,"The job was easy but I was hired to be a part time team sports associate and I never got moved off the register after countless times of asking after the holiday season. The manager also had a problem with me working 2 jobs and would routinely schedule me during the hours I worked my second job after requesting off for those specific hours and he expected me to come in.  Upon leaving to pursue growth in my second job, I was told ""I should have never hired you"" in reference to me leaving for my other job."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"It's hard to see past the store level as an entry-level employee, my experience could all trickle down from the awful store manager - but from where I'm standing, this is the most unprofessional company I've ever worked for. "
bad,">Treated very bad unless you're male"
bad,When I worked there they were literally giving people 8 hours a week. So it would be 4 hours Tuesday and 4 hours Thursday for me. A co worker of mines was scheduled 7 hours a week once. I lasted a month and quit because it was just gas money in my opinion and I don't want to work for free. My manager seemed to get upset when I quit but I don't get it. If you can only five people like 8-17 hours a week then why keep hiring more and more people? People had been working there for years and still didn't get part time hours. I did not like the experience at all. They even put me on the floor by myself like 4 days without teaching me everything and the whole time I'd been there and still hadn't got a name tag.
bad,"if you need something temporary, or your just looking for something to do."
bad,"if i was able to score a zero the values section would have it. the general manager in my store is a heartless jerk. when the one girl's father had a heart attack and she tried to call off, he said ""there was nothing she could do about it"" and wouldn't ""accept"" her call off. needless to say she did not show up and he still reported her. on top of the lack of humanity in this company there is no hope of advancement, they hire new managers instead of promoting the already qualified people, and if  you're depending on good hours. go somewhere else my last month has led to 12 hour work weeks. that's not getting me through college."
bad,"I have been with Dick's Sporting Goods for 18 months. Over that time I have received pay raises due to my performance. However, during months where business is slow my hours get cut because I cost to much against the pay roll budget. We are always told the company revolves around the customer. I have a hard time buying into that when I have experience working in numerous departments/ I am also one of two people who can handle working in the bike department but still my hours get cut based on my hourly pay. If the business was about having the best people around to take care of the customer I would be scheduled more than most people at that store. Dick's shows no loyalty to it's customers or it's employees."
bad,"The job feels like high school 90% of the time the employees talk about customers on the walks and each other all the time. it was always really slow in there, the sales where horrible even on Black Friday 20% they do that throughout the year with their credit cards."
bad,"it’s not worth it, some managers are cool but some customers are rude, you get rushed by management and it’s just all around not a good job. I wouldn’t work here."
bad,"If your right out of school and looking for Revit and Autocad experience, this is the place for you.  It will give you a great experience on your resume.  Do not expect to be hired full time, their culture is to bring people in through recruiters for a few months then let them go.  DSG don’t pay benefits and they get buy this with recruiters.  I was one of the people that left this department without a new job to land on because this particular department, store planning, was a joke and a colossal waste of time.  They hired 15 or more people and let them go after a few months, if they stayed that long.  It was a terrible experience."
bad,"terribly run building.  poor pay and work environment.  the employees had little to no say about working improvements,  advancement was based on wiliness to move shifts instead of quality of the employee."
bad,"this company is a terrible place to work where it regularly allows the associates to be taken advantage of, where turnover is the absolute highest, and management is the worst i have ever experienced"
bad,I did not like working and Dicks Sporting Goods. The management was poor and they did not consider availability while scheduling employees. Other co-workers are fun to work with.
bad,We're perpetually understaffed. It is an exceptionally difficult retailer to work for. They are continually cutting payroll to make the bottom line look good even though sales are flat
bad,From experience who you have for a management team makes a big difference. Having a terrible management team to work with causes lots of turn over. You would invest time with a new teammate just to have another member of your management team treat them very poorly and they end up leaving. Some managers are so burnt out that they come in with the worst attitudes day in and day out and you really end up hating it there.
bad,I’m always Very busy and am always on the go. I love customer service and retail however I’m ready to start something new. I learned different ways of dealing with customer service issues and employee conflict. I also learned great communication skills and how important they are in every area of a business. I love all the different personality’s I encounter everyday and love learning new ways on how to lead. I enjoy teaching and molding people into knowledgeable confident people
bad,"The focus of the company has to shift a little. Employees must feel wanted and cared for. The company lacks consistency and the pay is terrible.  In the beginning, all is well and then once new employees settle in, they are able up experience what current employees are experiencing."
bad,"The management at this location was absolutely horrible. Management would aim to motivate their team but would do the exact opposite. In the end my reward for leaving an environment I felt I could not grow in and thrive has left me with being called by management “disappointing, unreliable, and ungrateful”. In this store I worked extremely hard and even offered myself to be transferred  to a department managers felt mainly guys should work and even after rising to the occasion, coming in while sick, taking on roles that were not in my job description, doing two jobs at once, and even being harassed by another co-worker who thought he was management who was always negative and judgmental trust me, I handled as much as I could. If you want to work for this company, I suggest you work at any other location where you are appreciated, valued, and respected. By all means continue to shop there and spend money however you please but from a former employee for this location, unless you already work there, don’t apply to that location. I’m saving you from the headaches and toxic environment."
bad,Overall this place had no culture and was just flat out boring. no benefits or advancement at all for part timers. Good thing they gave us a half hour lunch because hours were terrible.
bad,"The managers are ridiculously unprofessional. They speak poorly of their employees to other employees. The pay is so low here. Also, they deny requests off and shift swaps if they do not like the worker. (Mainly just the main manager) and she’s completely rude and doesn’t deserve her title whatsoever. If she doesn’t like you, she will not give you any hours at all. THE HUGEST PROBLEM OF ALL is the FAVORITISM. everything has truly gotten out of hand and something needs to be done about it. New management is very much needed."
bad,"I was interviewed for a FFL  ( freight flow lead) position in Receiving... "
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,DSG is a company that does not care for its employees. Management is absolutely terrible and upper management is even worse. There is a huge disillusion between management and associates and a widespread misunderstanding of simple procedures. Training and promotion are non existent although they will promise you the world.
bad,"This job should be part time. As they do not have enough work to put in 40 hours a week. The every other week pay is hard to get use to, and the pay is low with only one low raise per year. The place is ran by drama all the time."
bad,I have never said anything negative about a company until now. My treatment with Dicks Sporting Goods was terrible. Their treatment of associates was far worse.  I will leave it at that!
bad,Okay place to work for no salary. Poor pay and schedule. Worked on the sales floor and operations. Poor hours and lack of leadership.  Need better pay and hours.
bad,"This job started out good but soon went downhill. I was there about 8 months. I was enjoying it but as we all know true colors show sooner or later. Let’s start with pay, it was okay but i did get a raise and got promoted within the short amount of time i was there. We always seemed to be understaffed and the turn over rate was very high there. Most coworkers were cool but some of the girls there were very catty and rude , high school like environment just very immature and a lot of drama. There were 4 mangers all together. I would say two of them were good and really hard workers and the other two just were terrible.  Training was horrible for the new associates. You got like 2-3 days of computer training and then literally thrown out of the floor alone with barely any help, i felt so bad watching all the newbies struggle. We wore headsets so you could hear then frantically asking for help. Also there didn’t seem to be any full time openings ever at this location. There was a few full timers and you could tell they all were very comfortable and not going anywhere. No Benefits for part time but you did get an employee discount. Also some of the guys were creepy there and there was a male employee that made a sexual comment to a manager about me and of course nothing was done. Most days it was a pretty easy job. On tax free weekend or Black Friday it was crazy but other than that it was usually just busy on Sunday’s and holidays p. In the end i just couldn’t take the poor management any longer and decided to leave. Not a bad short term job but definelty not a long term job or"
bad,"Have to work an entire department by yourself, because hours for very profitable stores are cut. Corporate interference leads to massive employee loss. Wages are abysmal for ""competitive"" pay compared to  other related stores. Fellow employees are mostly easy to befriend, and make days go well on occasions."
bad,"All you will hear working for DSG is metrics, you will be expected to sell credit cards and protection plans with every sale and will be chastised if you do not."
bad,management horrible staff lazy there are people there like it is a dating pool. they overwork you and don't want to give you time off the only good they pay you well to break your back.
bad,"Work is easy, pay is horrific, management has no idea about customer service or ability to work with people. Everyone wants to micromanage, and they hire some really uneducated associates."
bad,"This job is good temporary, as far as management just seems like a handful of people who don’t know what they’re doing . Oh and if you have a degree they offer you $10 to start and won’t budge on that ."
bad,"Retail with little caring, customers are fleeced as much as possible while being on hold for long periods of time. Sadly the credit card sales are more important than the actual customer!"
bad,Team Sports manager was awful. Nothing was ever good enough. Were scheduled til 10 amd didn't leave til midnight. Managers belittled employees and never lead bu example. Always micromanaged
bad,The store level was very stressful due to lack of management the store manager does nothing sits in office all day. No-one want to work and there is no communication.
bad,Not many perks to this job. Also the company is not financially stable so avoid this company at all costs. Management typically makes poor decisions and is not very helpful.
bad,"I was hired out of college by DSG and was ""promoted"" multiple times within the organization. "
bad,Hours were cut regularly increasing on hourly associates creating an unbalanced unreasonable work load on salary associates.  Store manager was incompetent and not focused.  A terrible place to work.  Avoid!!
bad,Honestly there were some good managers but they were constantly behind . Never fully fulfilled there duties due to always playing catch up but i ultimately blame the store manager and the higher ups for my bad experience . I accept my faults but all in all could of been avoided if i would of gotten my training on time and efficiently.
bad,"Just bad all together. Low pay, high pressure, only good thing is the discount. The managers and higher ups could not care any less about you. Also high turnover. Not many people last a year."
bad,"The managers are a joke and cannot be trusted with anything. There is no closed door conversations. One thing gets said to a manager the next day everyone in the store knows your business. "
bad,The pay is far lower than typical entry level jobs. The customer service is placed at a very high priority and the managers are easy to get along with for help.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"In the corporate office, it was very clique-y and while many of the staff are very NICE, no one really makes an effort to be welcoming to new staff members. Our department was questionably run, there was very little actual training in place - you just kinda have to figure it out for yourself and try not to get fired. And trying to figure out how their hiring/promotion practices work is a full-time job in itself. These people are the masters of wasting time & money, which is fine until it's YOUR time that's being wasted working on something that is BOUND to change 2 days later. I have never felt more excluded and treated so questionable by a company in my life."
bad,"If you're a creative--a designer, writer, manager--you will want to look elsewhere. A stiffling and toxic environment, Marketing is rife with sycophants and bodystackers. You will only advance if you're willing to lick boots and betray co-workers. As for creativity, there is none. You will tow the outside agency's line or you will be systematically disregarded and let go. HR is beholden to upper management in a way that makes it impossible to advance if you are a talented yet decent person. Good luck if you end up working here. You'll need it."
bad,"The management sucked and they enjoyed picking little things to fire people over. The people I worked with were good and the overall job as a cashier wasn't hard. My schedule was never as I asked considering I was a full time student (IE. Would schedule me during my classes, even when I filled out numerous availability sheets). Pay wasn't terrible but wasn't worth what you had to deal with considering the managers didn't care about anyone but themselves."
bad,"No training programs in place for new associates and there is limited to no communication between departments. Expect low pay, empty promises, and limited hours."
bad,"Now don't get me wrong I have worked for worse places. and the overall history and culture of the company is a Great thing. but the management staff ratio is just the most horrible experience of have every come across. The SM is highly unprofessional and has tremendous ill regard for there staff. They address individuals in an open forum and speak in a very demeaning tone. The OM is generally a nice person but he has a fear of the SM that is unbecoming of his position also highly unorganized and over worked. The rest of the staff is highly unprofessional mainly due to their age/treatment/ and work history. As far as the position I worked it is miscatorgized I was hired as ""Maintenance"" Not ""Janitorial"" believe it or not they are two different entities. Nevertheless I had no problem preforming my daily duties, However when my duties are suspended to take on task that are not my position but still be publicly disciplined for not finishing my responsibilities. Now I am a big boy and have been working my life so this is more outside observation and not a past employee complaining about a past employer. To conclude the particular atmosphere Vs. the company goal/outline is way off which is having dire effects on the entire location as a whole."
bad,It's a decent job. Don't too much for the managers. They think you can get task down while trying to always be there for the customer. It's not a realistic standard
bad,That is pretty much the only thing that is great about this company. I would recommend working in the actual retail store versus the distribution center.
bad,"I worked here for about 5 months, the first month was okay. After working there I found the management to be horrible, first off as a cashier you have to keep the score card amount up above a specific amount. The managers focused so hard on that to where they didn't care about the customers, employees or the customer service. All they wanted was you to keep the score cards up. Some managers even cheated to do so by signing customers up without there permission, even if they said no they don't want one and don't have one they would begin the enrollment and ask them for phone number email and address and more. They pushed it so hard that if they gave there name an zip they would pull up an account and even if it didn't belong to them or there family they would use that account for that customer anyways. They would get really upset if you didn't make the quota and would publicly make it known by announcing the lowest scorer on the radios. Also they would schedule you for times you clearly placed you weren't available for even after placing that in the system online. They also were very under staffed and unorganized. They also clearly chose favorites among the staff and most cashiers walked away and disappeared for a while leaving one cashier in front."
bad,was not a good experience. Not quality management. Wastes money. Reactive and not proactive. High turnover in leadership.
bad,"Solid company structure, as long as you can get in to the management program. Otherwise, it is nearly impossible to advance from a part-time associate."
bad,Dont work there. the management there is bad. there are only a few good ppl
bad,Culture was not a good fit for my professional and personal style.
bad,"The pay was decent; however, the management is extremely unreliable and unstable."
bad,Minimal staff with high expectations that were close to impossible to complete. I would work anywhere from the back of the store to the cashier up front.
bad,The first the had me do online training. But they never floor trained me. They had me on the floor on my 3rd day with no-one else in my department to help.
bad,"Management is on a power trip. They'll find petty things to write you up on, blame you for stuff you didn't do and still write you up even after you did them! They won't admit they're short staffed, won't schedule according to the work load, have unrealistic workload expectations during a shift, and then blame you why things didn't get done. Training is minimal. Management doesn't have any technical background and are clueless on timeframes and are the one's delegating work. Customers constantly add to your workload, bikes sell faster than you can build them and you're the only technical person in the store that's capable of working on them. You'll be working on online orders, repairs, assembling new bikes, helping customers and pricing. If you're doing one thing, there's no time to do the other and you're blamed for not doing it! They expect you to be in two places at once. They'll have untrained staff, like in apparel, assembling bikes, bc they won't hire more people, make a fulltime position or have the resources to handle the workload. Mgmt has no common sense, make you're job more difficult and then wonder why things aren't getting done. The shop is in the middle of the storage isle where everyone throws stuff, but you're responsible for it! I'd never thought I'd say this, but the customers are actually easier to deal with. My advice is DON'T DO IT, unless you're not the only tech!"
bad,"Management is terrible. Multiple people in power that go on power trips everyday and throw tantrums when things don't get done their way or in an unrealistic amount of time or the environment is not right for a project. Went through 3 store managers because of the terrible ASM(s) and other rude managers. If that doesn't say something, I don't know what does. Company discount is really low but that's expected for ""high end sporting equipment."" I was only PT but they consistently scheduled me 40 hours but then will drop your hours unexpectedly so you don't have an annual average of full time hours."
bad,Terrible place to work.  Poor upper managers.  Unrealistic work loads and way to lean on payroll hours.  Barely can staff departments and the place has no solid plan in place for dealing with daily theft.
bad,"My time at Dicks Sporting Goods he’s been very short-lived. I’ve worked there for about 2 months along with another friend of mine. He and I are both quitting due to poor management, being overworked, and being treated poorly. While doing my job, I was ridiculed and told I wasn’t doing enough, but I worked very hard and helped out in all departments. The management doesn’t care about your well-being and only sees you as a “work machine”. The points system is completely ridiculous and makes the environment seem competitive. If you decide to work here I wish you the best of luck and I hope you have a better experience than I did."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"A really terrible place to work.  The turnover is crazy high because they pay low and treat their workers poorly. I've never worked somewhere where employees call out as frequently as they do here. And nothing ever happens to them. I'm not actually sure if you can get fired from DSG unless you just stop showing up to work. From the top of corporate down they have an attitude of the customer is always right. This screws over employees and managers who try to follow the policy. A customer comes in with something beyond the already generous 60 day return policy, policy says you deny the return. But if you follow policy and deny the return you'll get in trouble for not taking care of the customer. A customer misreads a sign and think something is 50% off when it's not, you better honor the price or get in trouble. Not even a product that is mis-signed, but literally a customer can say the sign looked like it was pointing to a product and get a cheaper price. Thus nobody wants to make a call because they know the person above them will just overrule them. The pay is terrible and there's little opportunity for raises or advancement. It doesn't matter if you've been there for three months or three years, good luck getting more than a 40 cent raise a year. They constantly push employees to sell sell sell even when it's not in the best interest of the customer. Know it's not the product they need? Sell it anyway. Know there's a better and cheaper product that will work for the customer, keep your mouth shut and sell the higher priced item. Know the customer is eligible for a discount,"
bad,The company is not organized at all! Came from other big box retail companies and found Dicks to not have a clue on how to run a store. They have made it to where they are by accident. Go to target. Go to Walmart. Go to TJMaxx. Go anywhere but Dicks.
bad,"Manager told me that he would aim to give me a minimum of 22 hours per weeks, even after Christmas.  I received zero hours after Christmas ended.  The explanation as to why was with regards to the hours allocated to the regional store.  The manager evaded directly answering my question."
bad,All you will work is closing shifts. They will make you close the store pretty much any time they put you on the schedule and you'll never get a raise
bad,Place is horrible co workers are great but mgt is horrible very fast pace understaffed have to cover other departments while co workers go on break don't waste your time with this place
bad,"Long hours although I was a full-time student. Little leeway in negotiating hours. Management was not understanding in other activities, especially education."
bad,Some of the customers were just mean. Some made me cry because they said some hateful things. But working for the company wasn't that bad but the breaks were okay and the health benefits sucks.
bad,"Honestly, the customers are usually fine. Employees cool. But the corporate side sucks, big time. They have terrible and cheap products. They rarely have things in stock. They make it hard for you to excel at your job. The pay is god awful. Ive been with the company for 6 years, I have never gotten more than 40 cents in my annual raises. That is with pretty good ratings also. You can not live of off this salary unless you are the store manager. So dont plan on working your way to the top unless you are 16 years old, Oh yeah we dont hire unless you are 18. I have been Very unhappy with my decision to leave my old job for Dicks Sporting Goods."
bad,"This place is so disappointing. I LOVE sports and was so excited to work here. Unfortunately I learned that the company doesn't care anything at all about you as an employee and/or sports. They just sell sporting equipment, but it's ALL about numbers. NO common sense in the company. They expect a million things to be done with absolute minimum staffing. Stretch people in 5 different directions constantly, so no one can ever get anything accomplished. I hate this job. Only work here because I can't find anything better at the moment in this terrible job market."
bad,This was a good company to work for. But the only side affect is that they show a lot of favoritism. I enjoyed working there the people were friendly and easy to work with.
bad,Worked as a GM for almost 10 years.  Started out the first 5 years as a great company.  The company has gone through some major changes and has lost its people loyalty.  They expect a grand open store everyday but don't alot the payroll to run a building that way.  The corporate office is beautiful but there is no money spent on labor in the stores.  If you have a choice work somewhere else
bad,"This was my first job it was a horrible experience, wouldn't recommend any one waste their time with this company, they only look out for themselves!"
bad,The store does not staff enough to help customer demands and tasks that need to completed. This makes for a very hostile work environment at times.
bad,"It was okay. Management wasn't great, there was no room for advancement and the pay was horrible."
bad,"Management has no idea what happens on the floor or if they don't care. HR Manger can hire who they want and fire whoever they want. They have a review board for some things when terminated, but the panel is slighted with supervisors and managers and a couple associates. The supervisors and managers won't vote to keep your job and the associates know that if they do, they will be next. If you are a favorite then your safe other wise walk on egg shells. They say all the right things, but it's just talk. You have no one to complain too.. you can call the ethics line, but it goes to HR..lol Do yourself a favor and find another job, & when you do, get me one."
bad,I do not like Dicks as a company. I thought that the hours weren't bad although the never offered overtime. I didn't like how the managers would treat all employees.
bad,"Not worth the headache PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF NOW DONT NOT WORK THERE ONLY SHOP THERE !!!!!! Management is horrible, no one follows the store policy and you are overworked and under paid."
bad,"Crackheads all the time. "
bad,"The pay is not good for what they expect you to do."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"At the time I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods, the management was poor. My schedule was not flexible at all. I asked in advance to have less hours the week of school finals and the weekend before and in turn I was scheduled extra hours. Since my last day at Dick's, they have new management that I did not work for so things could have totally turned around."
bad,"As past reviews state, the store manager is the problem with this location. The workplace is stressful as numbers are the only thing that is cared about, you could get away with murder, as long as you have a high scorecard percentage. Faking numbers is common because it is felt it is needed to keep your job. Coworkers and assistant managers are all great. The difference in moral is day and night depending on which manager is on duty. This store would thrive with a change of management, yet sadly it doesn’t seem like anything is changing soon."
bad,"Not allowed to call in sick ever , menotenous, boring, good job for a teenager but they don't hire under 18. Not worth your time lalslalalalalalalalal"
bad,"Was hired for apparel and the team leader literally gave me 3 minutes of training and ditched me leaving me to figure everything out myself. "
bad,Favoritism is a HUGE problem. And management does nothing about it after I acknowledged the issue. I was exited to work here until I saw it for myself. The job it’s self was fun and simple after you figured it out. But the people just 110% ruin the experience atleast at my location.
bad,This job is very relaxed and slow paced. The hours are very inconsistent. Management was good to work with. Very hard to advance in this company. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Dicks only cares about the bottom line. The employees are 2nd if not 5th or 6th inline. You are better off investing with them than trying to work for them.  You are tasked with an impossible amount of tasks. With little to now composition neither financially or even verbally.   The harder you work the more work you are given with no componsation.  They TAKE ADVANTAGE of people. They don't even give a decent discount
bad,Being a mother with two small children. My manager was always very flexible with my scheduling. my coworkers where very nice people. Management was horrible there was no consistence.
bad,"i have worked here for almost 3 years, and the people I work with are amazing. the location is great for most people, very convenient.the hardest part of my job is always being asked to do something else when i am trying to do my job. the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet so many people a day and have familiar faces come in and ask for my help personally."
bad,"Owner is very caring of each of his employees. "
bad,"Im a supervisor with Dicks and let me tell you, you dont want to work for most of the stores. Very few stores have good store managers, and the district managers are horrible. The west covina store is the worst. Stay for away from west covina store."
bad,Typical retail environment. Management was disorganized and continuously had issues scheduling around previously given college class schedule. Management makes sure employees understand how replaceable a retail employee is.
bad,"busy, friendly co-workers, learn a lot about sports and sports equipment"
bad,"Worst retail job I've ever had. Worked two retail jobs for 6 years and this was by far the worst. Poor management, poor training, low compensation for the work load...the only thing good was some of the people I worked with. I would not refer anyone to work for this company. Also you never work what you are scheduled its crazy."
bad,"Coworkers are enjoyable to work with and get along, I've learned to become a Team Leader,build Displays, Read Planograms,and Provide Excellent Customer Service,. The hardest part of the jobs is completing tasks when they ask you to work in different departments consequence of low staff in the store.Most enjoyable part of the job is talking with customers and helping them find the right product they require for their athletic activities."
bad,Horrible culture top to bottom. They want to push treating every customer great yet do not give employees tools to do so. Good pay compared to most retail stores. But the company just is flat out horrible. Ive spent 8 years in 3 different locations and the management is just flat out horrible.
bad,"They offer temporary positions during seasonal holidays. If you're sick or pregnant, the management will mistreat you and take you off of the schedule completely. You may not know you were let-off until you demand why you have no hours."
bad,"I enjoyed working here , it was hard to keep a balance between life and work because of the hours i worked."
bad,Horrible management with decent benefits. Never made you feel like you’re important. They don’t care about your personal life. It’s a retail job at the end of the day.
bad,"Overall it's not a very great place to work. While there are many perks (gym, cafeteria, ping pong tables, soccer field, baseball field, tennis courts, freebies from vendors) Those are the only real reasons to stay and those are also what attracts poor talent who only work there to take advantage of those perks."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Dick’s Sporting Goods the management very lackluster and snobby, I don’t recommend this place to anybody and they offer no pros to working there"
bad,"Terrible management with zero opportunity for advancement or pay raises. Store managers pretend to care but realistically they want to just get that GM job. Short breaks. Terrible point system for being late. Throw new hires out to the wolves during holiday season by giving them no time to actually learn. They give them a shift or two and expect them to know everything for a holiday. Terrible scheduling. Hour cuts are crucial. There will be weeks you get 0-6 hours because pay roll will be low in one department, so they steal hours from another and leave the people in that department with none. They want to make you learn how to do everything in the store and be cross trained, but still pay you minimum wage. Some managers barely even know how some departments are run."
bad,This place was a lot of fun to work at & had a great team work environment but then all our managers were replaced & it went completely downhill. We now have rude managers that are unprofessional & inappropriate with associates and customers. Due to this the happy team work type environment has turned to a hateful grumpy environment where the managers do nothing but sit in the office talking bad about all the employees who are on the sales floor busting their butt.
bad,"In the beginning of my time at dicks it was amazing. My manger was really nice and always open to promoting and helping people advance. After a few years he left and another manger came, she mad the store an awful place to work. She was very rude and talked down to many employees. She was the reason i left dicks sporting goods. I  told her i planned on going back to school and she made me step down out of my position that i worked 7 years to get into.she also took my pay down tremendously which caused me to leave the company after so long,"
bad,"It is very dirty, and not very safe."
bad,Worked opening new stores across the country and ended up as manager in Miami. Company is great outside of Miami district. DM is an idiot and brought all of his guys from sports authority in and pushed out everyone he didn't know previously. Company is great just stay away from the Miami district
bad,"Teamwork is equated with cliques, that are not quite behaving in the best interest of anyone but those involved in the cliques. If you are a single person or a person who is independent in thinking, this is not the place for you. Management is built around effectiveness at dictatorship and the monitoring is adopted from the sop of correctional facilities. That is how the one i worked at is managed, like a correctional facility. If you complain, report or attempt to engage in changing the format, you are targeted as the problem."
bad,Management was very poor and lacked communicating with the employee. They do not give you hours and the pay is very low and there is not a great amount of room to move up in company
bad,"Not able to maintain a home balance due to inconsistent changes in schedule.  And mandatory extra time spent due to lack of management and staffing needs.   In the Denver district, too much support is given to other stores that should be managed better."
bad,During my time at Dicks Sporting Goods I was a full time cashier with a average of 38 hours a week. My typical day was spent providing customers with excellent customer service by checking them out and helping them find specific items in the store as requested.
bad,The first year working at Dick's was actually fun and enjoyable with the management team at the time. However the current management team is incredibly asinine. They create difficult goals to achieve so that they look better and can get good raises. Even when you perform to their standard your work is not appreciated. They want you to give your life to the company or you will be iced out.
bad,"I ended up leaving dicks because at the end of the day, they just didn't care about there employees.  It felt like from the management on down that it was everybody for themselves."
bad,This place isn’t to make a life for yourself. No full time bad benefits and management has no ambition to change things. Honestly pry my worst experience working for a company.
bad,Management is fine and so are the people I worked with. I personally just did not enjoy the job I had. Some people love the job but I hated being there so late every night.
bad,If you want to work your butt off and get no recognition from anyone while the managers get all the benefits from what someone else did. I also was covering up to 4 areas by myself and was expected to know and sell. And once they found out I was leaving the last two week the store manager wouldnt let me use my discount.
bad,Poor management. Would overwork employees as much as needed. Managers were not friendly. Did not stand up or help employees if being harassed by customers.
bad,"Ideal candidates possess excellent customer service skills and basic computation skills. Primary job duties include completing money transactions, providing change, and answering questions about products, services, and policies. Training includes basic operation of a cash register and pricing guide as well as policy and protocol orientation."
bad,"Not a good place to work there, barely anyone cares about lunches especially the managers supposed to get coverage to send someone out to lunch but they don't. Security guard ( loss prevention managers need to improve their performance, it's not a school."
bad,"I work envirnment was okay. There was a lack of cummunication, from the managers to the staff. And when there was communication  I feel as though it could have been said better."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Was constantly asked to work with a sense of urgency and even though I was consistently one of the top performers in the store it never seemed to be enough.
bad,The management is horrible.  They have zero respect for anybody that works there.  They never allow for overtime to make up for low pay.  They have zero forms of training and just expect you to know what to do without any training and then point fingers rather then fixing the issue.
bad,"Dick's will get rid of people for absolutely no reason. You could be the #1 person in your department for YEARS, and then you come in one day and they decide they don't need you anymore. I may be a peon, but you have a horrible business model. I had an awesome manager, but he got let go for no reason too."
bad,Always interacting with customers. Trying to always make a sale. All customers are different so you have to be able to adapt to their actions. Have to be able to have knowledge towards the product you are selling. Also have to have a mindset of style to make sure what you have on display is attracting your consumers.
bad,The name pretty much sums it up. I had a hard time communicating with management at the time. I felt like I was just ignored.
bad,Management was horrible. They made me work after clocking out a couple times. There was also a harassment lawsuit filed against the store manager by a female employee.
bad,Great job and I learned a lot there. I loved the work environment. Management and my coworkers were nice people. I loved the customers.
bad,The management is horrible!!! This job could be a little bit more organized and a lot more hands on with their employees.
bad,"Starts off good just like a marriage or a honeymoon. Then Bamm.  No leadership,unorganized, all about the numbers and could care less about you the employee.. I'm sure other DICKS might not have this problem but management sucked. Mainly g.m"
bad,"training was terrible pay is terrible"
bad,"A great  place to work at, and I would go back. You was always learning new things."
bad,"it was a good experience"
bad,"Alot of Standing Around, if your a fan of all sports then being a cashier is for you since sportscenter is always on"
bad,I reported a fellow co-worker for sexual harasment and nothing was done. I will never even shop at Dick's Sporting Goods again.
bad,Not very challenging at all. I have learned about selling and handling firearms. There is nothing at all hard about out my job. There is also nothing enjoyable about it.
bad,"This is a horrible horrible place to work. You always have five million things to do but with no payroll. You have claims, truck freight, and other things t that comes along manager come up with things so you can stay busy but those customers come first but how an they when you have so much to do. They cut our breaks but then grib about payroll. Management in the store is fair but the upper management needs work. We have to push AOS but customers can do the same deal at home. This company needs to start treating the people better. If so then customer service would be better. Duh!"
bad,Would have stayed but they dont hire full-time. They can't keep good management because of this problem. Benifits suck unless at management level as well.
bad,"I enjoyed the job and the atmosphere in general. I quit because management was horrible and no opportunity for advancement unless you are best friends with your manager, and that's not what work is about."
bad,"I started there in 2011. There were amazing supervisors and management. Overtime, supervisors and associates were coming in just as fast as they were quitting. They lost some really good people. The store has gone downhill. Customer service has gone down also. They play favoritism at this location. There have also been investigors come there."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"I really didn’t like this job reason why is because they wouldn’t let me move up in status I always asked to do more and each time got rejected, also the pay was not perfect."
bad,"Management was terrible, doesn’t want to pay much but wants you to carry the load of the whole team, very high turnover, racist work environment, no room for growth for people of color"
bad,"Boring, no opportunity for advancement and management is complacent and doesn't harbor an environment for success. "
bad,"They are all condescending and rude. The work environment here is stressful, they expect way too much for what little they pay. They put people against each other for small time positions. Between all of the people in charge, you will never have a straight answer. Expect to redo anything you attempt to do at least 2-3 times."
bad,"While portraying itself as a locally run FAMILY company, it is actually run by the number crunchers and analysts from the Hedge Funds that DICKS borrowed hundreds of millions from. (Laughably, the plant manager agreed with this assessment)!!   Ed Stack is a figure head that just cuts ribbons. He visited the plant on a day we had a major forklift accident, and I was ordered NOT to mention anything. Low paying, and intolerant, the turnover is massive at the Conklin Distribution Center. Security is not real, its more of a psychological ploy to get employees not to steal. I was searched on my way IN, and forced to remove my boots twice a day. (The eyelets set off the metal detector- on the boots I bought at DICKS). DICKS is unsafe, and routinely ridiculed us to do things, that we had received training for -that explicitly warned us AGAINST doing!!! Except for DICKS, I have never in my career had to stop work in MAINTENANCE for lack of a drill bit. I was constantly told there was no money for even BASIC tools and parts. They routinely lie to employees- saying after- they ""promised nothing"". They divide supervisory power between so many people that NO ONE has the authority to do anything. They have almost no paid holidays (and they change these at whim) And they always schedule overtime- only to cancel it. This stops you from making plans, and allows them to fire you- if you refuse to work any ""scheduled"" overtime. I was extremely disappointed, after having great hopes for this job. I learned 2 things while here though. DICKS is full of it, and shopping at DICKS is like shopping in"
bad,"My current overall experience and opinion of this company has changed, They do not compensate employees for the amount of labor they require from us. I do not enjoy working here anymore because the workplace environment isn't healthy. The management team expects so much from us and do not compensate for the labor and time we give to this company, The hardest part about working here is having to over exert yourself because there isn't any team effort. I do enjoy the good customers that come into the store. I also believe the company should increase the employee discount percentage."
bad,"This job literally made me miserable. There is no work-life balance what so ever. The company saves money by not hiring associates and working the current ones until they are mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted. The management is non-existent. Store manager catered to certain associates and constantly talked about his “leaders” in the building to other associates. If you’re not a favorite, you will never advance in the company. Management lied about open positions and never promoted deserving people from within. Mistreatment of associates was constantly reported but nothing was ever resolved. There was no praise for accomplishments and hard work. Overall, the work environment was toxic and overwhelming."
bad,Management refused to adjust my hours to be more flexiable around my school week which affected my grades. Do to that reason alone I had to quit to focus on school
bad,"Fun work environment lots of people to work with they gave to nice discounts they gave you a 30 min  lunch break I enjoyed working there until I got fired for calling off for the first time due to being sick because I worked a 12 hour shift on Black Friday woke up the next morning I was supposed to work on Saturday, but was to sick with Morning sickness due to pregnancy I called in and  got told that I could come to work and stand with a trashcan by my side to throw up in but if I didn’t come in then I was going to be fired so I got fired because I couldn’t make it in because I was in the bath room all morning."
bad,They have complete control over your schedule and do not compensate very well. They threaten your position if you don't give them open availability. HR is not helpful in helping you get issues resolved. If you are a lead or keyholder you are not compensated and are expected to act as manager when they are not there. Managers only work during the opening shifts and all other are expected to close.
bad,"Management works with you when they want too."
bad,"the management is rude, unconsiderate - they will NOT work with you. they do not advance. the customers are RUDE and greedy, nobody is willing to help you to keep the job running smoothly"
bad,"they lie about the hours they will give you, they forget that most of the workers are college students and want you to live there. worst company to work for! not to mention the pay sucks!"
bad,"Coworkers weren’t always inclusive, nice, nor helpful. Same goes for management, they were always rude & at times bullied employees. Working there was the worst job experience i’ve ever had. If you’re thinking of working there, don’t!!"
bad,"if you are desperate for a job, no advancement , to much turn around with management, pay doesnt equal the work. If you are 1 minute late you get written up."
bad,Store orders are placed remotely and store needs play no part in what you are getting.  If you are not “one of the boys club” you will not be taken seriously.  Avg week was almost 80 hours and store payroll didn’t support the business but customer surveys were the most important thing they cared about.  Advancement opportunities do not exist and turnover in the management teams is constant.
bad,"not the best management and gave out the worst schedules. did not accommodate to anyone and the managers favorited their long term employees.. my co-workers were nice though, we all had a mutual hate for the management"
bad,"They say you get paid commission on credit cards but I never saw proof of it.  Very poor communication.  Every time I showed iniciative that I wanted to learn how to work in another department, they would coral me back to the golf department by asking me to "" size"" the underarmour pad.  All department moving and cross training is frowned upon.  Every time I would do a training module about management or another department, they would keep me off task by telling me to do a useless task.  The manager get paid decently and they don't want competition.  Prepare to be held down and be made ignorant.  The management tells you nothing even if you ask.  It is an easy job and they don't want people giving them competition for their own jobs.  Very poor collaboration and communication."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"I was really happy with this company at the beginning. Unfortunately with the increase of demand for work and the complete lack of staffing I worked myself into the ground every day. I did overnights, worked overtime and it turned out to be all for nothing. The appreciation wasn't there, we worked understaffed beyond belief for years and upper management did nothing to support the hard-working employees. My direct manager was amazing but the head of the store was severely lacking and we were down a few managers for prolonged periods of time. It was unrealistic, the amount of work, for so few people, I'm surprised the store is managing at all to stay afloat."
bad,"I worked for over a year and a half. I was paid up to 3 dollars less an hour than the male employees because ""They don't work here anymore."" Heavily male white republican population among management and employees. I quit, was begged to stay because I was the only one who knew how to run my department, and then terminated for making a complaint to corporate about the store manager for the sexist, racist, and homophobic comments made on a daily basis."
bad,"I worked at dicks for a few months but the hours were poor , there isn’t no overtime nor will they allow you to get any . There always getting robbed because they don’t take action"
bad,"Just disappointed a waste of my time and effort...let alot of foolery go on..."
bad,"I started working at Dick's as a cashier over the holiday season and then moved to the Lodge department where I was promised to get a raise to $10.50/hr (I started at $9.50/hr). Even after continuously pestering them about my raise over months I was never given one. Meanwhile, newly hired kids were starting at $10.50-$11/hr. Also you end up staying up to 2 hours past your shift when closing. It was horrible during the holidays especially because I am a currently enrolled student with a lot of school work. I remember getting out sometimes at 1am. Managers wouldn't care about your personal life at all, even during Finals. You left when they left. Definitely would not recommend working for them."
bad,"I was a golf technician, only meant to work on golf clubs. My manager decided that wasn't enough and I became his personal stock boy, even though I have a bad back. They have no regard for the floor staff and do not listen to the needs of it employees."
bad,The store that I was working at was taking a nose-dive during my time there. The hours I was scheduled for became less and less as upper management continued to cut all available hours for part time employees as much as possible. I left once I realized it wasn't getting any better.
bad,"They advertise benefits, including a 401K plan.  After you have so many weeks of full time employment, you are eligible for benefits.  After you get close, they only need you part time for a while.  This is something I experienced and was told my other employees that they went through the same thing for year."
bad,Certain rules only apply to certain employees. Lousy place to work. No development for employees looking to move up. Pay raises are awful and are predetermined by a points system.  No consistency to scheduling even for full time employees.
bad,"Was not impressed with the attitude from the managers, never organized when it came to cashiers on duty. You will have to work hard than what you are paid. The average day is listening to mangers complain on the headset, moving returned items from one place to another, may have to clean .. hardest part none and the culture is is filled with great co workers... but no one liked tammy."
bad,On a typical day at dick's you see will people come and go. The management there could be a lot better. They don't really care about there employees. The pay there is not enough.
bad,"not likely to move up in company unless you are a suck up, if you get hurt on the job they are very biased towards you and treat you with disrespect as  if you intended to get hurt"
bad,GM of the store is not someone you want to work with. He is rude and degrading. He expects you to understand and know everything with no training. Expect you to come to him with questions (which is understandable) HOWEVER he is never available to answer questions.
bad,Management wants everything but isn't willing to do anything. Stores are run as a skeleton and no help is offered to make sure the stores run the way they should.
bad,"poor management, not professional, supervisor were not the best and they play favorites, can not take serious, put in a lot of work and not likely to move up or exceed"
bad,"This job was stressful and awful, maybe because it was my first retail job but I worked retail after this and it was nowhere near as bad. The customers were okay but the other employees were rude and oddly competitive. This job didn't matter about competitiveness, you didn't get raises or anything."
bad,The managers there are pretty cool and good at what they do.  Its the store manager that is garbage.  Doesn't show up to work and when he does he expect to boss everyone around like he as done something around the store.  Doesn't do his job and lack of employment acknowledgement. More focus on the negatives then the positive.  No raises and hours are horrible.  Can't even take your sick time because they won't let you.  Good for a student who is looking for a day or two out of the week job.  Everyone is fighting for hours. Horrible establishment.
bad,"Upper management has unrealistic expectations within the allotted payroll budgets. In order to succeed, Salaried mangers must work 50+ hours/ week, including days off, although the job title/descriptions says it is a 40 hour/week position. Training is extremely poor. Direction and expectations change so often, it is not possible to get in to a routine to achieve success."
bad,They wouldn't work me any more than 25 hours a week and then I've worked every weekend for 3 months. They don't care about their employees! Customers are worse than some of the managers though.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Depending on the store you work at management sucks. Management didn't care about there employees at all very disrespectful. Other than them I loved everyone else I worked with. Just such as the employee who has to deal with the return policy the most that they would actually go by it.
bad,"I have worked for Dick's Sporting Good's for a year and I honestly don't know how I've lasted that long. The only pro for this job is that I have become good friends with some of my co-workers, everything else is one big con. Pay is very poor and so are the hours."
bad,"poor communication and ineffective training program, i enjoyed helping to tag/ sensor everything and organizing the whole store for the grand opening."
bad,"Unpredictable scheduling, low wages. They were horrible at training. I was moved from apparel to shoes and expected to be a running specialist. I tried my best to self teach in my free time, but it was not enough."
bad,Low pay and little appreciation for time and work. Should be getting paid much more for amount of responsibility. Not worth getting this job unless you only need a little extra money. DOES NOT PROMOTE FROM WITHIN!!!!!!!!! WHICH MAKES NO SENSE!
bad,"I've worked for them for some time now. It really sucks. Advancement is made available only for friends of management regardless of ability. Doing a good job and getting positive customer feedback is only acknowledged if the managers like you. Work is basically mindless and doesn't require any higher thinking abilities. Suggestions for improvement and efficiency are ignored and generally frowned upon. They say customer satisfaction come first but will advise you to drop or ignore customers to get a sideline project done. Safety issues are ignored, ""they are only suggestions"" as we are told. I've seen managers put employees safety in question and was reprimanded for pointing it out. Pay is mediocre and never increases since employees are no more than tissue paper to them, use them and throw them away when you're done. Calling HR is a joke, you're basically told to live with it or quit."
bad,Enter payroll. Print out job applicants. Order supplies. Print out sales signs. Help out in the warehouse. Schedule departments.
bad,"Worked here for a few months, not a great place to work, Managment is biased, very unorganized, your not really trained, and most of the time management will ask you to cover a department you clearly know nothing about. I honestly can say the best part was my hours they stayed consistent, but his job isn't promising. Already I'm not going anywhere with this company even though I would like to but Managment has screwed me other several times and not just me I've seen it happen to several co workers. I've never had a job where I needed to know HR number but it is saved on my phone for the constant complains of the integrity this store doesn't have"
bad,Worst retail experience of my career.  Will never go back as a manager.  The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  I am glad to be away from there. Horrible hours...no accountability...Zero training.
bad,"It became tough dealing with both the awful managers and the awful customers. Managers wouldn't let you talk to the rest of your ""team"". No chemistry was had unless you broke the rules and got to know your fellow workers. Overall it was the same thing every day and it was a nightmare when you had to work with certain managers."
bad,"On a typical day here I would start off at the cash register. Sometimes they would assign me to door greeter or helping with stock, but I was for the most part always cashier. The management was not on the same page which was stressful. The co workers were nice and helpful which did make it a little easier."
bad,This company has no clue how long it takes to do anything and they expect the same productivity after they cut your department hours in half. Management is rarely on the same page and don't understand what takes priority.
bad,"Lots of employees come and go so you don't interact with the same people often, also causing information flow between employees to be deterred."
bad,While I worked at Dick's there were some problems with the management that made it difficult to do the job correctly.
bad,they would work around my school schedule but could never remember the schedule i wrote out for them explaining my availability.
bad,They barely give you any hours and the managers are aways on your back. If you're trying to make money this isn't the place to work.
bad,When I first started with this company it was all about taking care of the customer. Then some corporate big wigs came up with useless programs and marketing ideas that cost the company millions of dollars which they decided to make up for it by cutting back on payroll which kills all customer service by taking all employees time with tasks. There is no such thing as a full time job at this company. I am considered full time and one of the most knowledgeable employees my store has and my hours have slowly dropped to under 30 per week. Other full timers have dropped to almost 20. The pay is not very good as you start just over minimum wage unless you have a decent amount of experience but the raises only come once a year and the most you can get is 5 percent but the store average across the board has to be 3 percent so your if you work really hard at $10 an hour you may get a $.40 raise. My stores management is great and has great people to work with but with corporate people sitting in a cubicle having never step foot in a store controlling everything you do and expecting you to perform miracles it's not fun anymore. This job is great for someone needing a part time job to work around school but don't make a career out of it.
bad,"I worked here for 13 years in management. It used to be a place where you trusted your superiors. As time went by all that changed. They never practiced what they preached, making for a stressful and polarized work environment. Absolutely no life work balance and actually postponing and canceling planned vacations was more common than following through with a vacation. Should have been a good team environment to work in but everyone was out for themselves, from store management to regional management."
bad,"load/unload trucks, scan product into the system. Co workers were fun, management was management. The job was not hard and the enjoyable part was going home."
bad,Don’t do it. Management only promotes favorites or people who suck up. Worked there for over 2 years with no raise or promotion. I put in more work than anyone and i get nothing. Don’t wast you’re time.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Worked here as my first job starting when I was 16. Worked there for 3 years. Honestly I had some pretty cool coworkers but besides that it was a horrible job. Horrible pay, rude customers, shortage of hours, incompetent managers, and an overall lack of quaility in just about every aspect."
bad,If it's a long term career you are looking for....look elsewhere! You can work your tail off and never get promoted. They try too sell you on the internal promotions being high...it's not. I've worked there for 2 years and have seen some real shady things happen. It's too bad to being that they are from Broome County. The Conklin DC is very toxic. I would not recommend it.
bad,Overall experience at Dicks sporting goods as an employee was very poor. The lack of advancement and poor management made a large impact on leaving the company. The lack of organization of staff to allow us to be a more productive workforce was evident with no direction of leadership or culture.
bad,"It is not bad if you're in school looking for a part time job.  However they constantly have to cut hours to make payroll, and the management team is not the greatest."
bad,"The job is boring. Full time act like they own the place and always had horrible attitudes, which management never fixed. Some upper management people also had a huge chip on their shoulder all the time. You can still be a great role model but also be respectful at the same time, and a lot of people lacked that. Don’t expect to make a career out of this place. It’s usually teenagers running the show."
bad,"My Time working at dicks Sporting Goods lasted as long as it did for the customers they made my day, by letting me know how I could help them. I loved interacting with the customers. I will say the workers would be all over the place and kind of messy which was more than what a work place should be."
bad,"Poor work environment. Bad, lazy management. Can be abusive sometimes. Inconsistent hours. Lazy co workers in my department. Because of that I was over worked a lot."
bad,"Hey, when you work at this company, expect to be treated like a slave and watch like a hawk by management.  This is the first time in my life I ever worked for a company that in all departments within the building, management is very aggressive towards there subordinates.  You can tell they have very little to no respect for there employees and it shows when they address you at their infamous tier one meetings.  This company works so darn hard to watch its associates while they are working and when I mean by watching they literal spy on us for just about everything.  From how long it take you to complete an task to how long it take you to come back from the rest room.  This company is also very unorganized also, you get blamed for everything that goes wrong and upper level management will never accept any form of responsiblity for the problems."
bad,"It was bad working there. someday's its a 10hr shift another week you only work 10-15 hrs. Management was terrible, they cut peoples shifts. Customers where confused, the whole store was a mess"
bad,"Dicks recently switched more to an operations style store after last years quarterly report that was much lower than expectations. Changes started to take place to try and move DSG to a more profitable company. They began to implement store managers to meet certain numbers expected in their operations that to corporate means making a profit. In turn the management became stressed with meeting certain quotas that led poor management of workers. With the low pay and stressful work environment created, i do not see any opportunity of growth in this company. There is a high turnover rate, Good workers get fired, while ones who should be let go still remain. Also a musical chairs of managers take place as the DM switches managers of stores in what seems like a yearly basis."
bad,I felt like I never fit in with my co workers. I folded clothes all day and helped customers. The manager did not care about my school schedule or giving me afternoon shifts. I always wanted to cry and felt like I was constantly being judged.
bad,"There is constant dealing with customers stealing or trying to, plus non stop work drama created by immature employees. Very dull and boring. Long hours/days. Poor management at every dicks. Difficult customers."
bad,"I went from working 35 hours a week to working 4 hours a week. Managers were constantly fired, employees constantly released, and the atmosphere within the store was not welcoming as it should have been. I was beyond excited when I was first hired to work for this company, but every day I work, I see how dysfunctional the entire store can be."
bad,"Store managers and district managers target associates by race and whether they like the associate themselves. Gave false points forged signatures. I saw this all as being an operations manager. Not sure if the whole company like that, but San Diego district is very much so. Plus HR doesn’t do anything for you"
bad,"This isn't horrible with certain managers.  They will not give you  hours, and it is a struggle every week to get more hours, but will call you in always. Seniority ,means nothing in this company."
bad,"I worked in the lodge department so every day was pretty slow. Everyone treated the department as if it was not even a part of the store. If a fellow employee needed the help of another employee, the managers would say ""just make that kid from lodge do it, you are working hard and deserve a break."" I was rarely allowed to take breaks and was forced to stay sometimes up to an hour after my shift ended."
bad,The place wasn’t fun it seemed like people stayed to themselves but talked about everyone. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell credit cards because people typically don’t want to get into that.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,It’s great as a college student I’ll say it’s fair pay and hours but once you get sucked in and star moving up you realize you aren’t getting paid enough for what is asked of you.
bad,Management was all over the place. Had multiple managers telling me multiple things. Hardest part of the job was dealing with managers. Only enjoyable thing was some of the time I was left alone to just work by myself and knock out building.
bad,The work was as quick paced and well kept together as any other job but the management team was always rude to me and always talked down to me in a condescending manner that always made me feel like I was worthless.
bad,"When i started at Dick's it was an awesome place to work at and i made many friends there. However, management sucked and over worked anyone they could. When i started there, they promised advancement but while working there i didn't not see one person get promoted higher than Lead. Being a lead myself and also going to school was very stressful all along with them calling me every time someone called in for a shift. Because our store was the ""training"" store, my two years working there, we went through four different store managers and countless supervisors. The best part of working there was the cool people you got to work with, customers not so much."
bad,"Management is always in a shambles, they promise you advancement even after interviewing with and being cleared by your district manager.  It will just keep getting pushed off and off and off, into oblivion.  Micromanagement is awful.  KPIs set by corporate are unachievable, including the hours a store has to work with which means poor service, poor metrics, and everyone wonders why stores aren't performing or aren't getting recovered.  There are no hours to give employees to actually complete store tasks."
bad,"I enjoyed the ability to work at customer service and assist customers before anyone else had the opportunity. It gave me the chance to make someone's day before they even expected a greeting.However, the workplace is not very pleasant, the managers aren't very reasonable and enjoy taking advantage of the young workers."
bad,Dealt with coworkers whom didn't want to work. Management that gave up on employees. Tense culture. The most enjoyable part was providing customers with the right product for what they need.
bad,"Low-pay seasonal retail job, no benefits, my manager was always in a bad mood, kind of a depressing work enviornment to be honest. At least the time went by pretty fast."
bad,Managers do not stay on top of stuff. Standing behind a register all day is what you do. Very tiring and repetitive. People get cranky when they don't get what they want.
bad,Managers dating associates in their departments. People go making rumors to get people fired. The management was terrible. The culture was horrible. Hardest part of my job was going in. Nothing about it was enjoyable.
bad,"I have worked both 1st and 2nd shifts. I am currently on 1st. We work four (4) ten (10) hour days, which is hard on the body. Also, we have a 3rd shift which was put in on weekends so 1st and 2nd shift would no longer have to work overtime. Well guess what we still do."
bad,It's an amazing job but the people I worked around made it worst than it really was. Management was going downhill after another manager took another job at a different location
bad,"The managers were mean and they would make people cry. Never leave on time. Training isnt that great, managers do not have a positive attitude towards workers."
bad,Cool things to buy for friends and family but some things are a little over priced in the stores. Not enough pay for the work that's being done. Cool place though
bad,"horrible management and very rude, they ahve favorites who they will always give their shifts too and leave with you with nothing sometimes we would be there till 3 hours after closing on school nights when 90% of us were college students"
bad,"Not really the best place to work. Employees treat it like a High School with your typical cliques, gossip, backstabbing, snide remarks, and not typically friendly depending on the specific employee. Management doesn't seem to care about employees unless they're friends on a personal level, Customer base is extremely rude and careless to any kind of help given, Rarely ever acknowledged for high achievement, Minimal raises that may boost you up by a few cents no matter how hardworking you may be, and depending on your personal stance with the management will determine whether there's personal growth for you at the store or not."
bad,"Their always under staffed but won't give hours to the ones that want them. People are always late but get rewarded for it like it's not a big deal. Management is terrible, they'll tell you one that then scream at you for doing it. Really close to quitting and I wouldn't advise getting a job here"
bad,"management was horrible, to much feelings carried in a work place and not enough work getting done because people were always clashing"
bad,The store I worked at treated me like a number and not an employee. they didnt teach jack squat and are very poor at getting your schedule done in advance.
bad,"I worked in the Lodge department at the Scottsdale, Arizona store.  I was one of the initial hires that helped to stock and open the new Scottsdale store. Those first few months was hard work, but it was fun and we had a great team and management seemed to be dedicated to the success of the associates, but within several months the whole experience turned toxic for many of us.  The management began to show its true colors as good people left, power hungry inexperienced people began to get promoted or were brought in from other stores who had worked with the manager previously.  Cliques began to form and store moral among the conscientious and dedicated associates began to decline.  I wouldn't recommend employment there to anyone.  The company wide policy is to hire lots of part time people to make sure the stores have coverage, but the results are low hours.  The Scottsdale store is so understaffed that the theft and shrinkage is high.  Dick's Sporting Good's, as a company, has bizarre business policies.  I would suggest looking else where for opportunity, because you will not find it there.  Hard work and very low pay!"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"the management was poorly staffed, also there were minimal hours available for both the size of the store and number of employees"
bad,"When you are hired you get a very little amount of training on anything. Once ""trained"" you are expected to know how to do everything in your department and are talked down to if you do not understand how to do your job after having been explained the procedures only once."
bad,Worked for Dicks for 3.5 years. Very unprofessional place to work. Went through 16 managers in 3.5 years. None every resolved issues professionally and only 3 that I remember were always on the sales floor. The other 13 would always hide out back. I worked in the Operations and Freight Flow Department. Very rarely had help unloading freight trucks. A very discouraging and degrading place to work.
bad,"I come to work and get told to do a list of things outside my job scope I then take the list and go to my department and and start doing work (within the scope of my job) this is the day to day life of a bike tech at dicks"
bad,I was hired as a part time worker. They would post our days and hours on the bulletin board on Sundays but usually by Monday they changed your hours and cut days. I would have loved working there but I needed more than 20 hours a week.
bad,"Analyze business category sales and strategically allocate merchandise"
bad,Low wages hard work dangerous environment. pallet jacks run over bullets striking employees. Leads in position for over 10 years.
bad,This place was good to work for at first. I started out as a part time sales associate then went from full time lead to key carrying apparel lead.  It was great until i went on maternity leave and my job and keys were giving to someone else. They wouldn't work with me on my new schedule i needed nor would give me my keys or position back. They promised me advancement and never recieved any feedback. Went through  3 store managers in just a short period. I don't recommend this store for any job opportunities what so ever.
bad,I started working there for $8.00 an hour unloading trucks from 3am - 11am.  After 2 years I had only been gotten a pay raise of 42 cents.  Before the healthcare act I was able to get 40 hrs a week but after that I was lucky to get 20.  Meanwhile they hired other people to work in my section and started them off making at least $9 an hour.  I hurt my back there and they ignored my drs restrictions for 5 months until it became so bad that I had to have surgery.  I would not reccommend anyone to work for them.
bad,"A typical day was usually good, most of the coworkers got along very well but the management did not take responsibility for their actions and never abided by the rules/regulations they are supposed to when they ""suspend"" someone.  They are very disappointing as a management team because they do not all make sure that they all have a say in everything (i.e., schedules, etc).  My coworkers were all fine but there was way too much favoritism and secrets.  Hardest part of the job was accepting the moral conduct of each and every one of the managers.  The most enjoyable was when I got scheduled for part-time as I was listed on my application process and not every 2 weeks."
bad,"Getting there and finishing whatever your previous worker didn't finish. I learned to interact with customers and to calmly talk down customers upset about not finding what they were looking for and finding a solution that works best for them. Managment was poor, None of the managers communicated with each other and couldn't agree on any one thing that was told to employees on the floor. My co-workers were all over the place. Some were favored more then others and it showed in their work load as well as their days off and daily shifts. The hardest part of the job was working to close the store and then being up at 6 a.m to open. the most enjoyable part was the friends that were made while learing my job."
bad,"Narrow minded, self serving, management. This is a problem with the past few store managers at dick's in colorado springs. The practice of hiring mannagers with a degree in business only, seems to be the problem. They need to hire a manager with a psych or social degree. But they never will."
bad,"This place seemed like a fun place to work at. When the store first opened the whole team was willing to work hard and help eachother. However, managment started to cut hours and require a miracle from everyone. I had no problem working 110%, the problem was the lack of appreciation. There is also favoritism; some asscoiates are seen more valuable than others. If you dont help them keep their numbers up, or come in whenever they want; they could care less about you :( Overall its not as fun working at this place as it looks. Would definately not recommend!"
bad,"When new management was brought in, it got VERY confusing. One manager would schedule people for one shift, and the other manager would change the schedule. The problem with that was, when the schedules were changed, the employees were not notified causing MASSIVE confusion and many irate phone calls."
bad,"Not a friendly place to work for, they don’t have good manager service. Dicks sporting goods never schedules me to work, when the managers at the knoxville locations notifies me that they will be putting me on the schedule to work a few days around my college schedule that week."
bad,When working at Dicks Sporting Goods i was always on the move and there really was no time for stopping. I worked at one of the biggest stroes on the northshore so we had a lot to do in a short amount of time so it was always on the go.
bad,Work environment used to be amazing until new mangers came in and changed everything and work environment is trash now. The mangers y’all down on associations
bad,"I worked here for a while and with all of the rude people you have to put up with, it's not worth it. Definitely well-suited for students, but hours are not good."
bad,"Overall not the best place to work. The store manager is rude, disrespectful and way too cocky and arrogant and creepy.  He refuses all good ideas unless they are his own and flirts with anything younger than himself. He is beyond selfish and doesn’t trust his associates as far as he can see them. Employees feel entitled and complain when asked to do any small task that’s out of the norm. The company itself refuses to get rid of bad employees unless they come up on points, which you get based on bad attendance."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,It was fun and i love messing around with displays and i loved how i could help customers get what they needed for there trip they were gonna have and overall good place to work at
bad,Stressful not paying enough for what you have to do. Management is terrible due to upper management. They really only care about the work not the employees
bad,I hated working at Dicks Sporting Goods. The management there is the worst and there seems to be little opportunity for advancement. They seem to not care about their workers social life as well as I had to come in on days that I was off many times and they made you feel like this was mandatory.
bad,Small circle of people in supervision and management roles. Advancement based on what people think of you not what they know. Many of the supervisors and management are related.  Friends of these people seem to be more easily promoted than other not in the circle.
bad,Im sure some dicks sporting goods stores are fun to work at but mine specifically was not. Our management staff was extremely rude and demeaning to its workers. Which made the whole environment of the store not an enjoyable experience. However i am grateful that I had the opportunity to try a new side of retail and got to experience a new pool of customers and got to expand my knowledge of how to deal with different situations. And learn more of the fashion side of selling instead of just shoes.
bad,manager engaged in quid pro quo with associate. led to very bad work environment. it was obvious and nothing was done about it. very sad and demoralizing for employees who worked hard.
bad,"When first getting the job at Dick's I was very much excited. It al changed after a couple of weeks when I noticed that at MOST i got 4 and a half hours of work a day. I never had a set schedule that I could rely on to keep consistent and instead was given different days and times week to week and was never able to see when I scheduled until a couple days before. At times I would only work 2 times a week as if there was no point of going to work. We lost so many employees due to this and were constantly trying to bring in new employees and would have to spend time training them. There was never enough help on the sales floor and it could get overwhelming at times. Overall this place really sucked to work at, The employees were nice and never had a problem with my coworkers and some mangers were great but some others had favorites and did not really care much for other employees."
bad,"This is a BAD company....not a career for most."
bad,"Current store manager and current district manager have no clue how to keep this company above water. Their priorities are really mixed up when it comes to visuals versus customer service. Employees are not taken care of and management is hypocritical about everything they tell you not to do (they turn around and do it). You are not supported in a lead role or any other role and no matter how hard you think you are working, it's never enough."
bad,"At a new store in Raleigh, the workers were all great together, and the managers were fine during orientation. They kept saying we one big happy family, but that turned around quickly 3 months into the new store and customers are saying that the Store manager is horrible. Managers are very mouthy, no one cares about outside life. PLEASE DO NOT fall for the trap of Dicks, they will tear you down and make you very upset with how they treat you. IT SUCKS  many college students had to work on Thanksgiving day and miss family. And no one showed any remorse they ONLY CARE ABOUT THE MONEY ."
bad,"The store was constantly under staffed and the department associates were always being called up to the front to run the registers instead of taking care of the customers in their area.  This caused many problems in regards to theft and staff exhaustion.  "
bad,"Lack of mangment.the whole time I worked there my check was low every week that's why I quit they owe me over 3,500 still .they under paid for jobs I did they were very in professional"
bad,"I worked at this location at a time when the store was first opening up. I, along with many other associates, helped build the place from the ground up. The main issue that I had with working here is the fact that at the time of my interview, I was told that my position wasn't seasonal. I was scheduled for my last day, and out of nowhere, I wasn't being scheduled to work for a month. I ended up calling them to find out what was going on. I had to find out from a lead (not any of the numerous managers or the store manager) that I wasn't being scheduled for work due to being seasonal. It didn't sit right with me at all and I struggled financially for several months because of this, so I contacted their HR about this. I called numerous times, left a couple voicemails and I was never contacted by them. I felt wronged by them for what they did to me, someone that worked just hard, and at times harder, than my peers and was recognized by the customers for the hard work and exceptional customer service that I provided for them. Even if things have changed since I've been there, I couldn't recommend anyone to work there. The only reason why I'm giving this place a 2-star rating is because what made working here bearable was the great people I had the pleasure of working with, including the leads that were so nice to me, helpful, and genuinely wanted me to do my best (as well as my peers)."
bad,There are too many expectations placed upon the employees and we are not compensated for the work that is done. Huge headache working for this company
bad,"While the people that you worked with and job you were supposed to do were great, the constant need of more hours gave people less opportunity to complete tasks assigned to them and consistently took people away from their specialties."
bad,"job security is not as wonderful as they would like you to think. management is inconsistent, most times unreliable and untrained or incompetent. pay lower than usual standards."
bad,"Management needs a lot to be desired, no advancement , your opinion is not accepted to better inhance the store, they put people into management who don't belong there, its Dicks way or no way, the people who work there for the most part (associates) are great, ee discount is ok,"
bad,management is a mess. hours are not spread evenly. people not doing there job like they are supposed to from managers to associates. no watchful eyes.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,No room for advancement. Full time benefits well below other retailers. Management team under qualified and corporate has way too much involvement in day to day operations.
bad,"Associates were fun, I made a lot of friends there. But the management as a whole was nothing special. Don't pay deserving associates well. New associates make more than old and old associates have to train the higher paid new associates. Just not a very fair work place"
bad,"With the district I worked in, it was an everyday sense of chaos.  That particular district manager lost over 15 managers whether it was voluntary or involuntary, within less than a year and a half.  There was no consistent, clear direction of the company or what upper management wanted.  I traveled and trained associates across the west coast for this company, no matter the store I was in I never experienced a positive morale.  This worst part about this issue is that the company is aware of the issue, but just lacks the will to address it."
bad,"I believe that it could be a good job for someone who don't really need a job, but management is unfair and have favorites. they over work you but don't want to give you the hours. if you have a family I woudnt recommend you to work there."
bad,"The metrics they force you to try to get are pointless, the managers don't care about reasons for anything and get mad about whatever happens and you earn no credit for your accomplishments. They tell you that they're going to move you up but after 2 years you still don't see anything about it."
bad,"I would work my scheduled hours and more. Give it my all at work to be efficient and let my team see me lead by example. I love working with my team! There was nothing I would ask of them that I myself would not do. I would watch as store management came into the company (or already existing) and how their work ethic was to sit in the office and play games on their phone, make lewd gestures at customers, leave early, etc., yet, these individuals would make significantly more than myself and get promoted. I would work hard and be 'genuine', yet fear for my job every day! On the other hand, watch as others would 'play the game' and get promoted. These observations of Dick's and how they functioned as a company just about crushed my spirit in regards to my core belief that working hard is the way to success."
bad,"The company is not interested in updating their systems, nor are they open to making the required changes to support sustainability and drive innovation. The culture is unforgiving and revolves around individuals and not around teamwork."
bad,"Everyone thinks Dick's is this amazing place to work. While most of the staff one works with is amazing, management is questionable, doesn't listen & is promoted in some nepotism-esque manner. I have seen SO many people treated unfairly in our department to the point where multiple people have resigned and didn't even have new positions. They would rather be JOBLESS than work for those people. Amazing. Work/Life balance was awful. Yes, please work 70 hrs/wk while we pay you for 40. No thanks!"
bad,No respect for associates! It seems like they simply want you to overwork for the company but not receive any benefits. They do give a bunch of hours but the pay isn't worth it.
bad,while working for the company for a short period i had four different managers. once we finally had a manager on staff he was never at the location to assist with the store.
bad,"The company started out as a good experience but as more work hours were asked, request was denied and rate of pay was unfair for things asked to do as a worker."
bad,"Dick's sporting goods is the largest sports and outdoor industry out there. They are a great place to work if you are a single person with no family because they will put you to work. However, staff is undervalued and over worked. The pay and benefits are the only positive thing about working for this company."
bad,I really loathed my time at Dick's Sporting goods. I would not suggest working there and going to school and trying to have a social life. The management is horrible.
bad,The store I was at wasn't ran well. They made a lot of money but the management was poor and the leads in my department shouldn't have been put in the position. Pay was low and hours were low.
bad,Management stinks.  My manager sat in the office most of the time and used cameras and a walkie to micromanage while sitting on her butt.  Company charges too much for their merchandise and you only got a 10 percent discount.
bad,"Very disorganized and poor support from management. There is employee cohesion and support. However, the environment felt unsafe with all of the smash and grab behavior, even during working hours."
bad,"Hard to motivate young adults when hrs are low, starting pay is 8.50 and there are few opportunities to move up in the company"
bad,"The people that worked there on hourly wages are top notch people and a blast to be around. Out of the five mangers we had only 2 of them cared for the staff and wanted us to do good. the other three only cared about us getting the numbers for the day to make them look good and they would treat you like flat out C*** right in front of the customers. Lets say you got super busy and didn't have time to put away the 12 items of clothes that got returned you would get yelled at for helping the customer first and not doing your returns. "
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"I was offered a job after doing several follow-ups with them about the job. They had me wait 2 weeks to pass a background check, they said they called me 3 times for orientation, but my phone never rang. Finally I got them to let me come in so we could meet. They liked me and offered me $9.00 hourly pay, part-time work. Here's the issue. They paid me at $8.00 pay rate according to my check. I didn't fill out any paperwork. They just threw me on the floor, not shadowing anyone like you normally would. I did great my first night alone. Then one manager tells me to come in on 2 days during the week. I called on my way to work to let them know I was coming and I'm not on the schedule?! This happened every week! I was hired over a month ago and only have worked 3 days. They never put me on the schedule. I asked what the deal was and I'm told retail is seasonal? What?! That's ridiculous. They hired 2 people same time as me and they were there every two days. Poor management at Alabaster location. Too many hands in the cookie jar. You got 4 different managers telling you differently and the girl that makes the schedule never puts you on there? The Manager can't add you? Just make sure they do what they say before you get our hopes up."
bad,"A typical day at work would mainly consist of greeting customers then checking out the items they were purchasing, then making sure the front end was organized."
bad,"Management is only concerned with your scorecard being above 60% every hour"
bad,"Aside from the co-workers, everything was horrible. Very unorganized, inexperienced management."
bad,"Upper management is mute to the support of lower management & hourly employees,the pay is not on the same level as hours given per week,and store management is non supportive to the company guidelines requirement."
bad,"was a cashier for a year. They don't allow breaks and you have to stay at your register and call for a bathroom break but sometimes there's not enough people on the floor so you could be waiting up to 30min. Also, they don't allow drinks at the register. I worked 8 hour shifts and only got a 30min. lunch. It was rough at times. On the bright side the discount was good. Employees got 25% off merchandise."
bad,"A company which sells ""frivolous sporting goods equipment"" lacks the fun atmosphere for employees it tries to sell to customers."
bad,"They show a lot of favoritism to certain employees. Unfair management. Pay isn't very good. Scheduling is terrible. No hours to give. I feel that the place is going out of business. I work part time and last week I got 0 hours. Now this week I have 5 hours. It is very unfair scheduling. It's all about favoritism, if they ""like"" you, you get hours and move up in the company."
bad,Typical day at work was uneventful and dull. I didn't meet any in other departments and I barley knew who I worked with at the job. I learned about price adjustments and development of a single department in store. Also learned how to take ownership of a role that someone isn't fulfilling. The hardest part was work with a leader that was lazy and the most enjoyable was the opportunity to learn are feet and how shoes effects them.
bad,"I see Dick's is still looking for part-time people. They held interviews and I moved from one person to another and finally to the store manager - I have grey hair. Although I have advanced education, a and retail experience with Cabelas I was rejected. I can't prove my statement about them not hiring older people - but you can see for yourself. The pay is low, the management looks down on their ""cheap-labor"", they only want young people who will work cheap, part-time, and like a dog."
bad,"Most of the employees and managers were great to work with, but the overall management of our individual store was very unorganized.  There is almost no upward mobility in this company in my experience."
bad,Had alot of fun working with sporting equipment and helping people with their questions. Management was never on the same page as far as what each expected of employees.
bad,"My experience here was short but had too many culture issues in the company to deal with. The district manager would act unethical and cheat scores being service or inventory and it was deep in their culture. Overall, the customer part of it was fun and I deeply enjoyed interacting with the team and customers."
bad,"I worked there for 2 and a half years and I liked the place at first.  However I soon learned they do not care about you and only business. I was scheduled on days I said I could not work and they said this was because ""They don't have to approve availabilities if its not in the companies best interest."" They severely underpay 90% of the workers and the only way to move up is to get buddy buddy with the mangers and suck up to them. The leads in the departments vary from awesome to terrible. I have had a mix of both. Leave stuff up on the white board and tell me what to do when they know very well that they could do it themselves.  I would not suggest this place to anyone."
bad,"I worked for dicks for less than a year.  In that time we had 3 different general managers.  Every manager did things different.  Often times, we would have to undo what we just did for another manager.  They seldom schedule adequate help.  The final general manager was very unprofessional.  After several weeks, he only spoke to me once.  I consistently got positive feedback from my immediate manager and helped when help was needed due to call offs.  Upon giving my 2 weeks notice, the manager erased me from the schedule.  He did not even give me the professional courtesy of telling me after I was courteous enough to give him notice.  Managers only care about metrics so they get richer on the backs of associates.  Pay is pathetic.  There are some good assistants who get used and abused also."
bad,"This job had friendly co-workers, management was ok but could have been better and not many work hours."
bad,"Received as little as less than 10 hours a week...No breaks, even for the bathroom."
bad,"I've been with Dick's Sporting Good for almost three years now, I have the position title of a Customer Service Specialist (Cashier Shift Leader) for almost the entire time I've worked with the company. I've wanted to move to a different department for quite some time now, mostly because I want a full time position. I've had two separate interviews for two different full time position and every time I sit down with the store manager they tell me that they can't move me to a different department because they wont be able to find someone to take my position, both interviews were done a separate stores, so it is impossible for me to move up in the company, let alone get a full time position."
bad,This job involved me trying to sell shoes and meet any needs the customers had.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"A typical work day is easy, yet pretty monotonous. Putting out new freight in my department and putting back returns is mostly what I am responsible for. The monotony is tolerable, given that most of the people I work with are pleasant. It is a little cliquey at this location, but because I'm not planning on working here for any significant length of time, becoming best friends with everyone I work with isn't a priority for me."
bad,"Work was predictable, nothing extreme was ever thrown at you. Not exciting , but you were able to at least grow comfortable in your position. Career advancement was limited at best. Education and experience was not a factor in advancement."
bad,"Starting there i helped set the store up before the grand opening and all was good, worked hard and got plenty of overtime but soon after the hours where cut so much some of us only got 8hr a week but I stuck to it with the sales pitch that we will be getting more hour soon but instead they hired more people in my department. Selling guns was the easy part since they pritty much, sells them self but what they don't tell you is that anything can get you fired. even though i know my guns, we got very mediocre training with other procedures we had to learn as we go. The managers where even worse when it came to helping you resolve problems because none of, them own or, knew anything about guns so they where of little help and when it came to a problem that arouse the management will throw you under the bus and start all over then to resolve the problem they only care about them selfs. Even if your there best employee at obtaining credit card and verbatums"
bad,"Stand for days, the management is a bit uneasy to find people to cover for you right on time."
bad,"Always on your feet and busy usually 1 other person with you, upper management sucks if you make a mistake or have a problem you are instantly fired no chance for any probation Alot of responsibilty on you for only $8.00 an hour"
bad,"The coworkers and uniform are great along with store hours but the manager at my location is horrible. With open availability he believes 1 can live off of 10hrs a week at 10/hour, wants you to be the top in everything and disciplines you if ur customer doesnt apply for a credit card or protection plan or makes a donation."
bad,"The typical day of working at Dick's is monotonous. They pay minimum wage and expect exemplary work, I even once heard a manager tout how well we're paid. Not long ago I requested more hours at work, with very open availability, and the manager told me he'd ""see what he could do"". MY hours never improved, and they continued to hire more people to cover the hours THEY needed. The managers are spineless and give in to any customer complaint, even when the customer is objectively wrong and abusive towards employees. I could give countless examples, but overall, they don't care for their employees as they would make it seem, and they're very disingenuous. They only positive I have is a lax dress code and casual environment."
bad,If you’re looking to make your way up the chain towards management think again. This isn’t the company that promotes that. They mostly care about competing against other stores and being the top store. Cashiers are more like salesman since management wants you to push protection plans and credit card applications. Other employees are super sweet and friendly but this isn’t a good long term job. It’s nice if you’re looking for something to do on the side or during college. Other than that it’s a typical place to work.
bad,"The store manager is insufferable and takes advantage of his workers. The turnover rate is terribly high and the morale is low. No one is happy to be there besides lodge upstairs and the customers need to be waited on hand and foot. The employees are nice people, but the store manager treats them awfully and threatens to fire them or cut their hours often. It was always understaffed and Sunday's were the worst days due to tireless customers who were not understanding of the situation. The store manager does not care about you, only the numbers and surveys. Please, do not work here."
bad,Store manager there is a clown he tries to please everyone. And won’t force people to actually do their job which put more unnecessary work on me.  He said he would talk to the higher management about a raise and every time he saw he told never got the chance too. He thought that I would eventually forget about it but you don’t lie about stuff like that.
bad,"Dick's sporting goods is an ok at home job, however there are tons of information to remember ad it can be very overwhelming. I like interaction of the cx and my direct supervisor"
bad,"This job was a joke. After working there almost a year when it was time for raises/bonuses, managers took most. The largest raise was .40cents. Yes you read that right. We worked LONG hours. Put in loads of hard work. Holidays, 12-16 hour shifts. Compensation was not nearly what I and MANY employees deserved. Managers behaved like adolescents. Honest reviews, the employees that worked the hardest, not only got .08 cent raises, but new hires with LESS experience and straight out of high school received 13.75 and sometimes higher for STARTING pays. They constantly have to hire more employees because after a few months its decided that compensation doest amount to work put in. Unloading truck shipments at 3am getting paid only 12 an hour. 5+ Pallets filled with boxes unloaded before 9am."
bad,"If you like working every weekend and only having weekdays off this job is for you. Management can be spotty, HR will never have your back. Good concept but terrible execution"
bad,"Great place to work if you like taking and executing conflicting instruction from management - always daily, often hourly. If you would like to form your own thoughts and express them, do not bother. Benefits are sub-par to industry."
bad,It’s never good enough always working 6-14 days straight sucky mangment can’t relate to  associates no training no hours over working no planning no  Communication
bad,"I was always uncomfortable coming in, one of the managers was very unprofessional, everyone left me out, they made me go from loving my job to hating it."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Poor management. Poor pay. Managers often brought their personal problems to the workplace. Great job for those looking to make some cash without having the stress of a high-paced job.
bad,bad management good workers. never shown the appreciation for going above and beyond with your duties. very unorganized and not the best place to have your first job
bad,Company mainly cares about its bottom line at the cost of very skilled employees. turnover is high and moral is low. They where very good at getting the invested employees to preform at a high level by promises of opportunities that will never take place.
bad,The managers are terrible and don't care about a single employee. They punish employees for being sick by cutting hours or forcing them to do tasks they are not trained to do and do not offer any help.
bad,Management never recognized and job well done or offered proper training.  Criticized but never recognized. The harder you worked there was no approval ever.
bad,"Most hired in employees are fun to work with.  Managers are sometimes not as experienced in their fields as would be desired."
bad,"Working the front end as a cashier, the pace was usually pretty slow, offering opportunities get other tasks done. Management is often times difficult to work with. They lack communication and pace. I enjoyed the variety of customers I got to work with."
bad,"Little room for advancement, little pay for work load, few hours, no benefits. Responsible for hunting department, fishing, firearms, camping, etc. Almost impossible to have extra help during a typical shift."
bad,"Working at Dick’s Sporting Goods has no benefits besides receiving a slight discount. The pay is ridiculous, they do not give anything but maybe a couple cent yearly raise. There is no room for advancement within the company.  They are always understaffed and do not know how to write a schedule. Breaks were never on time and we were not given the appropriate amount of break time written in the employee handbook. They would schedule workers in departments that were not their own, causing for more chaos. The management is AWFUL. My store had about a 70% turnover rate. Just awful. On a positive note the coworkers were wonderful and made the job bearable. It was nice to see all the new clothing and equipment that came out each month."
bad,"Would not recommend. Management doesn't care about their store it associates. Hours get cut frequently, but they expect you to stay more than you're scheduled. No respect."
bad,"There were too many managers to come and leave or get fired and we had so many different managers from different stores come in. When we finally got a steady manager, he left out of nowhere and was not good at managing. It wasn't all bad, met some great people. And did learn a lot about sales."
bad,"Will get rid of you without notice, no job security, minimum wage. Bonus is little to not possible. Not organized. Live by Quantity Over Quality..Numbers"
bad,"youre not gonna move up in the company, the job is a revolving door with new people almost every month. worked here 5 months and was already the longest tenured footwear employee"
bad,The amount of work and compensation dont match. Manager roles without manager money. The set up a million deadlines and have unrealistic expectations. Employee retention was terrible.
bad,"The stress level varies from day to day based on what manager is working. Any issues that employees are having are not dealt with appropriately. They are just dismissed. Current employee's hours are cut because they are told there are not enough hours to give, but then they hire in new employees and give them more hours than current employees."
bad,"I would recommend this job for college students only, if you have major responsibilities this is not the job for you. When i was employed there management would change often."
bad,Management sucked I learned nothing they decided they wanted to let me go after I got 10 credit cards and protection plans I was a hard worker and management lied in my face and told me they don’t keep seasonal worker but beginning of when I started working they told me they where going to keep the managers are full of it and the css didn’t care and most of everything I dislike was the way the ran it and how every manger in there were full of nonsense l.
bad,Under new management it was not a pleasant experience working at Dick's Sporting Goods. Hours were very inconsistent from week to week. The store was always undermanned and employees were forced to cover multiple departments. There were never enough cashiers scheduled and sales associates had to work as cashiers on a regular basis to reduce the lines at the registers.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Managers sit in the office on their radios chirping down at everyone but wont ever come on the sales floor to assist.  I believe people in charge should lead by example and they do not. Also, they dont do any sort of training they just throw people on the floor."
bad,If you love sports and want to engage with customers on a regular basis about them this CAN be a good place for you to work. If you're a cashier theres not a lot of opportunity for you however. The wage is very low and they are constantly pushing you to sell more of their credit cards. At a certain point they changed my title without informing me which ultimately led me to quit the company. They do offer a 15% discount however which can be nice for some.
bad,"I fully understand running a lean operation, but the expectations of the individual employees and managers are unreasonable. Having to run a department with only 60 percent of the minimum suggested labor allocation is insanity. Managers regularly had to come in on days off while not getting paid to do work allocated to regular employees because there weren't enough of them to get it done. Not only is that illegal, but unethical. This is not a specific gripe to this location, but company wide."
bad,"Long hours, gruelling work days, almost no breaks (you were reprimanded for taking too long or sometimes any), and a lot of the time I just stood there staring at a wall during the slow days. On high traffic days, we'd be heavily understaffed, and most people would avoid the cash register to help."
bad,"It is high school all over again"
bad,After four years of working like a dog I was refused a lead position that I feel was rightfully mine for another coworker who worked one day every month or two. After contacting ethics hotline nothing was done and they asked me to switch departments.
bad,"It is a difficult job because of the amount of people that do not show up for work on a continuous basis especially on the weekends when they are needed the most. Not enough full time positions and low pay. Also there seems to be a more reactive approach to things than a proactive approach. "
bad,Managers where rude and would look down on associates. Working un department was stressful due to lack of staffing. Not enough hours manager would put down associates
bad,Everyone is mean and dirty in that company . Very cut throat and not very welcoming. Everyone gossips and no one tries to help anyone . A lot of people slack off and are constantly on their phones . Associates act as if it's time to hang out with their friends and socialize. Management is usually no where to be found .
bad,Okay job.  Not much time off or benefits.  Low amount of hours for the store.  Tough for store to function with amount of sales and services expected.
bad,"Much like the balance of B&M retail, DKS is trying to find its way in the new Ecomm boom. There are a lot of competitors out there trying to ""steal their lunch"" right now.  Will be interesting to see how they and other retailer fair in coming years."
bad,"Then once they get you in the door. They treat you like they own you. For a part time job you can manage. As a full time employee it is not worth it. Scheduling conflicts, poor leadership"
bad,All Retail is pretty bad and this is no exception. It was a job and I got paid. Customers treat you bad sometimes and depending on the manager they do too.
bad,"Hard to get ahead. Upper management is big on micro managing. Huge emphasis on loyalty program, credit card sign ups, and ship to home sales. Weekly ad sets sometimes confusing and hard to understand based on signing."
bad,The managers were not flexible at all and made it difficult to get time off. They wouldn't even allow time off for the holidays. A job I was happy to quit.
bad,"This job can be a complete waste of time if you're looking to move up. If you're a college student with almost no bills, it can be a good fit. The pay was pretty terrible. The management was almost exclusively unresponsive to feedback. HR will cut your hours to almost nothing if you close some availability."
bad,"Fairly easy job but there would be times where the store would get slow and you would have nothing to do. Some employees were favored over than others by management. Managers would specifically target employees whether if they would get hours or not. I overheard the assistant saying ""He's getting one day a week because he's an idiot""."
bad,"wasnt the best, management could have been better. typically leads are supposed to help hourly emplyees, in this case people with no experience were training lead postions."
bad,"If you are the self starter type that can work without being micro managed, this is the job for you. There is not a lot of feedback or input on a daily basis. The growth opportunities are highly limited unless you are in the right place at the right time."
bad,Management was not competent with employee environment. Crude and non-caring work setting. Were not allowed any self expression. AMost employees were able to get along but there was always work related drama within the store.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Its a great learning job to build experience and that is where it stops. Job would have been a great job. I was content there, until I was fired illegally shortly after being #1 in Customer Satisfaction Sales Surveys out of 10 stores in WNY/CNY."
bad,"Their management organization was very poor, leading to a lack of cummunication. Also it made it difficult to get work done and help customers. The scheduling was poor as welling having been released the day before the scheduling date."
bad,"Despite the few associates who provided a good work ethic and team membership skills, management was poor and professionalism for the work environment was missing. The store often disorganized and lacked respect to associates as well as customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with disrespectful and rude employees and management. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers successfully find what they need after scurrying through the store's unorganized receiving."
bad,Too many kids and bad work ethic here.They mess the schedule up all the time.Not enough hours. People no call and no show all the time.
bad,"It took me many months to learn basic procedures at this company. Management was never available, they were rarely their to help resolve any issues or conflicts of scheduling. If you needed to call out; you would be guilted and harrassed. They would force you to give an acceptable reason for not showing up to work. "
bad,"Left as soon as I could. Poor management, terribly ran store, coworkers were unresponsible. The store actually closed down while I was working there due to such poor revenue."
bad,"Day mostly consisted of assisting customers and providing a quick and courteous check out, managing and assisting cashiers, and meeting the daily quota of new loyalty card and credit card sign-ups.  While I did like working there, its more of a place for college/high school students to work."
bad,Was not my favorite place to work. The hours were long and the compensation was poor plus there are minimal benefits if you even qualify at all for them.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of this job was working with sporting equipment most the day, and the hardest part about this job was the amount of hours I wasn't receiving."
bad,"As soon as you open the office door phones are ringing."
bad,"A typical day at Dick's consists of running down a laundry list of department specific duties that may or may not apply to each store.  Then to start small projects and audit issues that consistently become problems like hosted price changes that are incorrect, on hand quantity that is never updated, or general layout moves all based on company direction."
bad,"I went threw a number of managment changes with Dick's and every single one of the managers lied to my face. Once you make a decent amount of money and accumulate vacation time they will use any excuse in an effort to get rid of you weather it be through attrition or firing. Fun place to work, its just to bad that managers are so incompetent or worried about there own position to take care of any real needs the store might have. In training youll learn how customers are the main focus. In reality the only focus is on reducing payroll even at the expense of the customer experience. Sign me glad to be out of there."
bad,"The day consisted of helping customers out when needed and cleaning up the store during closing. I learned more about different types of sports then the ones I already knew about and more about fitness. My co-workers were great we all got along for the most part and had fun while working together. The management was not very good, we went through so many store managers and the other managers had favorites. The hardest part of the job was probably the lack of hours. Most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with."
bad,Ring sales and help customers with their purchases or any questions they may have. I learned valuable money handling skills and better cashier skills. Management showed preferential treatment towards certain employees and gave hours accordingly. Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job were the supportive co-workers.
bad,"Dick's Sporting Goods survives on the backs of under-trained employees and a high markup on most of its products. Of the retailers I have worked for or have been involved with, this is the only large company that does not utilize a night crew for stock, and associates have no ability to order the merchandise in their store, nor posses any knowledge of what merchandise is due to arrive."
bad,"-process all apparel, scan out SFS orders, cleaning, and whatever else the managers give as a task-all has to be done within the time limit that is given which is short due to budget cuts."
bad,"Good products, nice selections. Coworkers all nice. Management was good, pretty supportive. Hardest part would have to be lack of space for inventory. Most enjoyable the the people."
bad,I work here... in Middletown. STAY AWAY. Hours are very limited. They keep changing the front end managers. 4 different front end managers in the last 7 months. The one that's there now is mean. I don't complain in the jobs that work because i feel that every job has its cons. but this job sucks.. horrible hours you get a decent discount but then can't use your coupons that you get?? its just a joke. 300 dollars spent for a 10 dollar coupon??? freaking ridiculous !
bad,Unlike other companies They keep track of your call outs on a 13 month rolling scale. if you are not a fulltime assoc. you have no sick days etc. so a call out counts against you.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"The advertisement for the job was for a full time morning shift employee, but when being interviewed, the job offered was a part time (25 hr) swing shift job.  When hired, the hours were gradually dropped from 20 hrs weekly to 5 hrs a week, or not scheduled at all.  The manager claimed to ""Be scheduling so little as a hint to quit"" She was a manager than encouraged breaking company policy, telling loss prevention to hit customers or trip them.  She made fun of people for their dating preference as well as having eating disorders."
bad,"Low pay. Hours constantly cut last month of each quarter. Management Incentive by cutting payroll it increases their quarterly bonuses. Non union, no rights or benefits. Low pay."
bad,Poor work ethic poor management the structure was super poor and it just wasn’t organized pay rate wasn’t fair and it seemed kind of sketchy in most ways
bad,"it was an alright job, they didn't really give many hours to anyone except a few people so it was pointless to be making a drive over there just to not get any hours"
bad,Not a place for a career. Only for those who want part time and want to add a lot of walking to your day. Some employees are very nice and helpful but that is rare. Management needs to managed better by their bosses.
bad,"Note: this may only be my specific location, I'm not necessarily judging the company as a whole."
bad,I enjoyed my time there but was very unhappy with the way they ran the store I worked at.  We were always way understaffed and stressed and upper management was not supportive of employee working conditions from a stress and anxiety perspective.
bad,"What started as 45 hrs per week quickly turned into 75-80 per week... as the company went public and had to answer to stockholders, bonuses went away and hours went way up.  PT'ers were cut or eliminated...  managers were stuck doing everything from stringing tennis rackets, unloading trucks, cleaning bathrooms, and running registers... and working 70-80 hrs per week. Fun times!!"
bad,I was an apparel associate for 3 years and was not given a raise until I was finally promoted to Nike rep. I was then told the position was taken away and I was put back into an apparel associate role. The management at the store now is very poor. The store manager doesn't listen to workers and speaks down to them and the two other managers don't respond on the radio. The workplace was a very fast paced day and a lot to do but the thing that kept me there for so long was my co-workers. The job was almost never rewarding unless you kept asking for a raise even after so many years.
bad,"Job was good when I first started, was told I would have at least 28 to 34 hours which I did. But is slowly went down to to 20, 18, and then went down to about 12/8 hours a week.  I have a family of 4, I can't live on that so I sadly had to look for another job and move in."
bad,"Being a work place of typically people who are or just got out of high school it has that sort high school atmosphere among employees and even at one point management. Hours were scarce for the most part and weren't exactly used in the departments they were meant to be used in."
bad,"I've worked here for over two years now and as more time goes by, the more unbearable the job gets. In the beginning, it was enjoyable. I still do enjoy what I do -- working with the customers and keeping them satisfied. The managers don't care about their employees and are extremely disrespectful. You rarely get any recognition for everything that you do. It just isn't a tolerable work environment anymore."
bad,"Daily task are given out which is hard for one person to complete alone, but it only gets harder with no pay role, and lack of dedication from a lot of people to only drive the stress to full timers and managers which leads them to have insane mood swings."
bad,"Not paid enough for the ridiculousness of that place. Some management picked favorites, and everyone lacked work ethic. Store looked terrible every day, and nobody cared."
bad,Just my experience with the Company in the last three years.  Need to hire better Mangers and For the Lead Mangers More Training and less tyranny.  While they call themsleves mangers they sure are not leaders which brings the moral and the overall stature of the store and employees to not what the company use to be.
bad,Dick’s sporting was an very unorthodox job environment. That I did not enjoy working in . Lots of toxic staff members . I personally did not feel safe working there with all the retail theft going on
bad,"Overall the managers are weak, but employees are strong. It started out fun with the managers but I began to notice who they really are the most that I worked with them."
bad,If it weren’t for the people that I worked with and some of the managers I wouldn’t of stayed for as long as I had. The retail experiences through DSG is very stressful for no reason.
bad,"At my store in GA, we have a general manager that doesn’t do his job well, he doesn’t schedule us well so the store is always a mess, he lies to us, changes our schedule last minute, keeps us there till 11pm after we close at 9:30, and is just not a good person to work with. After a year of being there I had no review and then I got a raise of 25 cents, from what I heard most people get 15 cent raises. This is not acceptable for the amount of work we do for the store and the company, it’s hard to get recognized for putting in that extra 1%. Management plays favorites sometimes."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"At the beginning of my first two years, I loved it. Then we got new management and it was terrible. Hours were inconsistent and would never work around school schedule or family events."
bad,"Very little conscientious regarding quality. No desire to improve processes. Top down dictatorship. A supervisor fell asleep at his station regularly, without corrective action being taken. Overall, a dismal experience."
bad,its pretty slow paced and boring at times the people who work there are nice but only some of them the others can be really rude and make rude comments.
bad,"Within my first two days I was the head of the department (not by choice) the lead, walked out my first day of retail. I was advanced with no training and expected to do everything that the other leads where doing."
bad,"A typical work day at Dicks Sporting Goods for me, I would usually go in, and go to the department which I worked (shoes) and help customers find whichever shoe they liked best. I'd offer them any accessories to go along with their shoes like socks or insoles. I learned to instead of being confronted to confront. Management wasn't the best. Workplace culture was alright, nothing to complain about. There wasn't really any part of the job that was hard and there also wasn't any part of the job that was enjoyable."
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance  unfair"
bad,If you are a man then this is your place to work.  There is no opportunity to advance as a woman.  The micro management is out of control.  They do not let their managers control the business.
bad,Company has many issues that they are struggling to overcome in this current market. They were replacing management at a furious rate and will have trouble excelling in market climate if changes are not made
bad,It was a good job at first until the job starting being different than I thought it would be and the managers weren’t really understanding. A great part time job though.
bad,"It's a great gig, with nothing serious, but if you need more money and a career Dick's Sporting Goods may not be the place for you. I mean it has a flexible schedule."
bad,"The managers are completely unfair, picking favorites and treating the rest of them like garbage. The hours were completely unpredictable, and unreliable.Terrible place to work."
bad,work place was boring. didn't pay a lot and i didn't feel welcome while i was working there. i did make a few new friends but other then that I was ready to get another job.
bad,Store was expected to work with minimal staffing and required to stay in a designated area but yet expected to complete things in areas outside that area. Schedules were changed during weeks but not properly redone to allow coverage of areas.
bad,the job was ok but the management was horrible the managers was rude it was an ok job but I wasn't treated like family working there they didn't give me the proper treatment I deserved as an loyal working for a year
bad,Co-workers would not do their jobs. I had to pick up their slack.  Management had their favorites.  No room for promotion.  I had to work 8 hour shifts even though I was part time
bad,Very unorganized.The job could have been easier if full time supervisors took the time to give the hourly supervisors the correct training. The benefits were great
bad,"Low wages; Low hours"
bad,"I would help customers choose the right shoes for their feet, I would unload the truck, and I would also help where ever I was needed. I learned about customer service, and about what makes the perfect shoes for someone."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"This company is managed really poorly. Things change daily as to the way things are supposed to be done. The company sells good products, but customer satisfaction could be improved."
bad,"The head store manager bullied me and harrassed me every chance he got. He is awful with customers and his employees. Absolutely shouldnt have a job that he does as a head manager of a store that is in a huge corporation. I dont recommend to work their while he is a manager there. No matter what happens, if you call HR or talk to other managers about the situation they all know him so well or theyre afraid of him and they dont take any responsbility or actions to help you."
bad,you have to constantly pick up after people you deal with teenagers stealing and making a huge mess of the store. the people i worked for didnt care and only wanted to look good in front of the big boss when they came in and its very un trustworthy
bad,"management is poor, at best. Hours are inconsistent. The other employees are nice but the management is awful  and does not care about college kids wanting to put school first."
bad,"Any position other than apparel is an easy position. The apparel position requires a lot of responsibility. And for some odd reason management always wants apparel associates to do mostly everything. For example, their busiest days are the weekends during the weekend they expect their apparel associates to be backup cashiers, finish tasking, help customers out, attend fitting rooms, keep up with return items and at the end of the night fully recover the whole apparel department. Management is so easy to judge and getting a thank you from them is difficult. Management only cares about their convenience and not their employees convenience. It is really difficult for them to work around school schedules because they don't hire enough employees. On the other hand co-workers are fun to work with and i love to give customers good quality service."
bad,Store associates create a great bond with one another and it creates a good environment. That environment is countered with upper management running everything with a fear mentality.
bad,"no benefits, no vacation time, ect my management team was good, however they are constantly hounded about sale, serivce, cutting peoples hours, I once worked at a dicks with 4 employees in the whole store, 1 manage, 1 cashier and me and another person to run the rest of the store.  Customer service scores would be low because they wouldn't allow more hours to cover the shole store."
bad,"This was one of two part time posiitons I held while trying very hard to get a more stimulating job. Unfortunately, the crash in the price of oil made it very difficult to find anything. Just as I was to start a position, layoffs cancelled that opening."
bad,it was not a good environment to work in and the pay was not good the managers was all rude and nasty i barely received any hours only when someone else called out its only a good job for a high school or college student not a career job
bad,"a very disappointing place to work at. It was fun, until you started to see the true colors of people. It was time for me to find another JOB that I could be happy and enjoy my job. NOT A GREAT PLACE"
bad,"Not a terrible place to work, but not great either. The discounts are great, but that's about it. Management staff is not terribly willing to give you consistent hours. I've been having issues with management being flexible about working around my second job's schedule."
bad,"There is no work/life balance. Its either all or nothing. Upper management holds little regard for their employee. Long hours, little recognition. Great people trying to do it all and getting over worked."
bad,Not a great company to work for. They only care about taking more and more hours away from you. Then they will need you last minute and call and be mad if you can't make it in! Trying to push out all full timers and have only part timers. Crazy amount of work to do. So many daily projects on top of keeping the departments tidy and helping customers. Sometimes there is only 3 staff in the store! Customers get frustrated easily because there is no one to help. Training is difficult as there is always something more important to finish! Fire fighting every day. Corporate waste money while they trim your hours to save money. Right place right time advancement. You are not rewarded on your merits and hard work. I was hired full time but now only work 34 hours a week. Which I cannot afford to do. Need another job now!
bad,"I've only been with this company for a few days, but I already have a gut feeling that this is not for me. I have worked in a shoe department before, but it was nothing like this. I have been told I am expected to know each product and how they work with each sport in great detail and know how people walk specifically and what kind of shoe they will need. They are hiring a large amount of people due to the expansion of their store, and it seems like they don't have anyone set aside to help the new employees find their way around and know what they are supposed to do. My first day I was left alone in the back room for about 10 minutes because my department lead had to go take care of something and pretty much forgot about me. Until I find something better I have to stay but I know this isn't the type of job I was hired in to do."
bad,"Typical Big Box Mentality, took advantaged of dedicated hardworking employees. Great Store level management team, amazing associates. Like a second family."
bad,This is a good short term job but not a long term job. After a while they don't give you enough hours and they don't really seem to care. Management is horrible.
bad,"Good helped customers around the store, was very friendly to coworkers and managers. Was fun to be around always made people laugh and customers let me be known"
bad,It's retail so there's not much to really say. I enjoyed my time here it's just that retail is not for me. Lots of organization and people skills required
bad,This place is very organized. You have a bunch of co workers. management doesnt train as they should but you can catch on very quick and they are also really helpful.
bad,"it was a fun place to work with lots of cool people as coworkers, but could get stressful due to the extra tasks that can pop up out of nowhere, like floorplan changes that have to be done by the next day"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"I was let go 4 days after I lost my mother to cancer, for missing to many days in a row. Management was not understanding for cooperative at all and were very rude."
bad,"Mostly interacting with customers on a daily basis, a lot of running back and forth and apparel clean up. Corporate and store level are on two different pages, and a lot of the time things arent in the best interest of those at store level."
bad,When I worked we had horrible management and we were understaffed. I was one of few apparel employees. They were really strict on recovering the store. I would say only take this job if you need a lot of hours. It is hard to get people to work for you because no one wants to come in. Also they really push the score card onto customers and constantly remind you about it. Really annoying! Also really lame discount and you can't even use it on clearance. Most of the time clearance discount is a better deal.
bad,"All of the cons I listed were dealt with shortly after I left working for them and 90% of the management was terminated. My work day consisted of building bikes, unloading trucks, and organizing stock by department."
bad,"I've worked for this company for over 6 years and I have found it to be run strictly on politics.  Upper management is dictated by who they know, not what they bring to the table.  People will lie and cheat to get ahead.  The morale of the company as a whole is very very low.  Work load is at an all time high with no incentive, acknowledgment, or reward.  I've enjoyed building relationships with most of the people that I have worked with, but that time has been overshadowed by the horrible treatment and bad business decisions of upper management."
bad,Would not recommend unless desperately in need of a job.My biggest frustration is that when cooperate cuts hours for one reason or another the salary assistant managers are used to fill in the gaps. I am required to work and complete all of the manager tasks and run the store all while throwing freight and selling items to customers doubling my work load with no extra pay or days off. Salary managers are basically free labor.
bad,"Need to give 2 week heads up for a day off, but they give you the next schedule (Sunday to Saturday) the Thursday only 3 days until that Sunday."
bad,"This job offered long hours, minimum wage, and difficult customers. The bosses were friendly but female co-workers were hit on often and it was often dirty."
bad,"Management was less than great, had very little sense of employees or the culture in the store. Allocation of talent lacking as well as no adherence to standards. No room for improvement within each store, no ability to go above the call of work. Altogether not a good experience. Technology lacking, and therefore there existed service issues."
bad,I enjoyed working in a field that allowed me to discuss 1 of my passions on the regular. I enjoyed the customer interaction. My co-workers were more like friends who I happened to work with.
bad,"It was a good job for someone learning to deal with customers."
bad,"A typical day at work is doing your job plus everyone else's. There's always someone who calls out of work or just doesn't show up (and I mean this happens every day), and management just expects you to pick up their slack. You're stuck at the registers, usually alone, and no one on the floor answers you when you call for back up or ask them a question on the radio. "
bad,Dick's is a typical retail environment in which your experience is largely determined by who is directly above you.  There is a large disconnect between executives at the corporate offices and employees at the store level.
bad,"Love meeting new people everyday and hearing their stories about what their shopping for and what made them stop by the store that day. "
bad,If your a teen looking for a summer job dicks is going to over work you and under pay you. Some of my managers were awesome and fun to work with and then some would be grumpy and take it out on you. My co-workers were around the same age as me (19-24) and also felt the same way as i did.
bad,Was a good place to work part time but not full time.  Management was terrible and promotions were few unless relocation was an option.
bad,"You can tell the management at Dick's Sporting Goods do not want to be there as much as everyone else. I've worked there for almost 3 years and just now received benefits after over a year of begging. The hardest part of the job is working with the management to accomplish goals, it's especially difficult when your Lodge Manager does not know anything about hunting/fishing/camping. The best part of the job is working with the customers, the regulars, which most of us know by name. The customer relationships I have formed are the best I have had at any job. That's what keeps me there."
bad,"good job, typical day consist of organizing and making shoe sales, management was a bit unbalanced , hardest part of the job was keeping stock room clean. working with customers was best thing about job"
bad,"major disconnect between corporate and the stores. Poor management and they will constantly change your schedule, send u home when u aren't needed and drag out the day and have u stay at their convenience. They promise to help you at the store level but it's a huge myth. Worked there 6 1/2 years I can honestly say that there is no motivation for people to do their jobs. They bring in managers that they think know what they are doing and they don't. The training is non-existent except if you count the DVDs when they hire you. Yea half the people fall asleep."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"DSG is a cool place to work, you are surrounded by lots of sports equipment and people who are interested in sports."
bad,the employees were great to work with and be around. The envionment of the workplace was fantastic
bad,bad management no future overall job was ok but not something id sujest as a carrer but more of a just need a job type no carreer opportunity
bad,"very strange company to work for, processes are complicated and payroll is awful revelant to workload."
bad,Good place to work at for the benefits and advancement is your job. There are many departments you can cross train in.
bad,"Sort through apparel and other merchandise to be put out on the sales floor and if nneded i would operate the cash register."
bad,"I was thankful for the job but the little time that I worked there was unpleasant. I witnessed numerous employees quit and many who didn't show up to work without notice, resulting in some employees having to work multiple departments at once."
bad,"Worked long hours, flip schedules, not much time for family specially around holiday time. Impossible goals to reach a times, ever changing programs within the company"
bad,This place is a joke the management doesn't care about its employees and they will run you into the ground if they get the chance. If you stand up to them they try to find ways to force you out. Just avoid at all costs.
bad,"Do not even think this company is serious about giving a job with advancement or full-time status, except for maybe corporate jobs that I am not included in. I originally applied for a team sports position but I was offered a cashier spot for the same pay. I went above and beyond what was asked and was promoted four months later to Customer Service Specialist with a small pay increase. With the promotion comes a disproportional amount of stress and extra unscheduled work hours. I  kept metrics at or above what was asked and inquired about switching departments. Turns out I worked too hard to get what I asked for; I was told I was needed most as a CSS/cashier and I would lose my pay increase if I switched departments anyway. "
bad,Co-workers not friendly and friends keep to themselves and do not socialize with new employees. 
bad,"Each day at the store included a new task to be completed. Projects made the day go by quicker. Although there are many wonderful employees- including management- at Dick's Sporting Goods, they do not value the individual employee. I hardly ever saw new positions filled from within the company."
bad,"-hours are hard to get"
bad,"i worked at sports authority prior to dicks sporting goods as a certified footwear authority. the management team from dicks promised me a better paying position, advancement, and hours. within 2 weeks of working they promised me fulltime if i worked hardand showed them i knew what i was doing,which i did. the first month befroe the grand opening of the west nyack dicks sporting goods i averaged about 50+ hours a week with overtime just helping setting the store up, coming in on days off just to help out. after the grand opening my hours went below 30 and suddenly i noticed that others who in my eyes were slacking, were getting more hours. it clearly showed that they demonstrated favoritism in that store because i was more qualified to become the footwear lead. at sports authority i had to take certifications for about 2 weeks before i was promoted, whereas dicks on the other hand they just randomly chose who they felt should take the promotion. the truth of the matter was, the person they promoted ended up asking me how to do his own job since he didnt really know anything about shoes. alot of other co workers who previously worked there will tell you the same thing, it wasnt my customer service abilities, because i am confident that i have that, they chose seniority over actual qualifications for the position. not only that, i was also terminated because i apparently missed too many days, but the truth was teh days that i missed i had either requested off more than 2 weeks in advance, which the manager knew about it, or they would randomly revise the schedule without notifying"
bad,"place is ok... the pay is much better than other retailers, but this company will do whatever they can to kep you from getting to where you want to be.... favoritism is at an all time high in this company... if your manager likes you... you can do whatever you want whenever you want... if you aren't a favorite you will be pushed up and out one way or another.... also good luck getting that manager to like you since in 2 years of working in the dedham area my store went though 3 store managers, 5 hardline managers, 3 softlines managers and about 9 sales support managers"
bad,"This is just for the Roanoke, Va store #127. The management is very lazy and does a terrible job at hiring good help. Whatever your starting pay is (which is barely above minimum wadge), you can guarantee that you will not get a raise for a very long time."
bad,I really don't have much to say other than my fellow co-workers were great to work with.
bad,Customer service
bad,"Even though they preached work/life balance, they didn't live up to it. Worked 60 + hours per week and was told not good enough."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"you are required to coach, coach and coach no matter how good and associate is. i was told in my review that people preform at their highest level when they fear for their jobs. I was also told that there are no days off unless anything is fully finished. Your told not to have an outside life that Dicks is your life and its stressed by management and dms and regionals. They pay very well, but you are required to work 60-70 hour work weeks off season and up to 100 during holiday times. i was with my store from opening in 1998 to 2009 and the last of the opening crew to leave. I wasnt allowed to step down as a manager to an associate to change careers either. They frown on that since you are a manager going back to an hourly. I would have loved to move out west but that didnt happen. Now they have a cap of $15 hour after that no raises. Benefits are also very well paid, that was one of two plus things they had. But the negatives out way the positives by an average of 10-2 easily."
bad,I worked in the apparel department while attending college. The flexible hours were great to work with around my college classes. The only problem I had was working with a bunch of perverts. I swear every guy in there was all over me and constantly hitting on me. Whoever that other person who posted about the golf employee you are right!!! He was a major creep!!
bad,My job was never made clear so working here was not the best. The products offered in the store are amazing despite the working conditions.
bad,"document everything you buy and do. This company always thinks to worst of it employees unless you are a favorite, sometimes even then."
bad,"I liked the job at first but besides the normal day to day you will have with any job... They don't listen to the customers' product needs. Scheduling is a nightmare, turn over happens all the time, managers are pressed harder and harder with less and less help and/or training. No raises and double work when it comes to resets. Not a thought out company."
bad,"I know some people who worked at different stores be okay, but I had terrible management at mine which made the work slog on. I don't recommend working here as ""we are like a family here"" means ""you'll work every department while other people don't do there jobs."""
bad,Dick’s sporting goods is fun most of the time to work at but at the location I work at it is managed poorly most of the time. Management is not always understanding most of the time
bad,This company doesn't really care about it's employees just from the some of the standards they have in place. They want you to push and sell so many things at the register so they higher ups get a better paycheck. Try to work you like a dog so they don't have to hire that many people.
bad,This is a good job if you have a car. They are very big on being on time which I do believe is important but they don’t allow employees to be 1 minute late without giving them a point towards being eventually let go. They don’t have any thought about traffic or other circumstances. Which I don’t believe is fair.
bad,"Fast-paced, but sometimes too fast paced due to budget cuts on payroll and thus a lack of floor coverage. Internal theft is maximized by not-so-good working conditions and long holiday hours"
bad,Management is not experienced. High turnover. High expectations for part time/ hourly workers. Low involvement from management. Terrible accountability across the board.
bad,Do not let the interview fool you for working for this company.  A high nosed corporate entity forces otherwise easy to get along with and friendly management to impose impossible daily goals with minimal staffing.  You will most likely work one or both weekend days every single weekend for months on end without the ability to take off days without getting a serious talking to by management.  Pay raises are not what is promised and tend to give the minimum amount possible and put up a fight unless you threaten to quit.
bad,"Typical days are redundant, stock shelves, re organize shelves, stock shelves again. Some times you get to switch roles  and cashier when other people don't show up for their shifts."
bad,"my direct manager  was great, however the store manager created a great deal of unneeded stress, always riding somebody.  most Associates work well together and support one another.  most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and helping the customers, and building relationship by providing exceptional service."
bad,"You always have to fake it until you make it. I did chat, emails, QA, customer service inbound & out bound calls, tech support, supervisor. I quick ty"
bad,Very few managers auctally Care. Making numbers keeps district away. Very competitive and sexist environment. Worked as a lead for 5 plus years and only made minimum wage by the time I left. Started at 10. To much responsibility. To many chiefs and not enough over worked indians.
bad,"Don’t expect anything special, work environment is stale and management is harsh. If you are going to work here my advice is keep your head down and don’t draw attention because they will come down on you. Store manager is rude and condescending, but other managers are reasonable. Only positive I can think of is at least I made some good friends from working here."
bad,They expect you to work yourself sick for very low pay. No appreciation for the employees. The managers were only out for themselves and how many bonuses they could get.
bad,"Dicks sporting goods has no family values they do not have a work life balance, they expect you to be consumed with dicks sporting goods, you lose your family"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,the management was constantly changing and none of the managers were very good. the employees caused drama that was worse then high school. the managers don't listen to the employees and constantly micromanage.
bad,Managerial Leadership is poor at DSG. Managers are pressures to make deadlines that are unrealistic and then punish employees when those are not met..
bad,"The staff is much more of a younger crowd, in high school or college. this makes the culture fun and exciting for anyone else who can fit into that demographic."
bad,I loved the job itself. its semi labour intensive but it was enjoyabe and relaxing. The managers on the other hand are horrible. I was pushed to cry in the bathroom all the time. Not the role models they should have been.
bad,"fun place to work, poor management, low pay, not flexible with working hours, coworkers were helpful, Management was rude, they give you time off when it is needed."
bad,Poor management. Poor communication. HR does not take employees seriously. Many coworkers have called HR on our store manager being inappropriate and he only gets “talked” to about it.
bad,"My experience at Dicks Sporting Good's started off pleasant when I first began working but soon became very stressful and tiring. I was a part-time worker but wasn't always given party time ouse or was sometimes even given full-time hours. In my department the leads were very disrespectful, they felt that because they were leads they could treat other employees in a bad manner. Management wasn't great either. When I was let go from the job I hadn't received a phone call or a written notice, I had to find out through an associate who still remained at the job. Management also showed a lot of favoritism towards certain employees. This job is also very stressful because they standard for the apparel section only were very high. We were required to stand for 8+ hours sometimes. We couldn't have the store during closing unless the looked absolutely perfect which was a bother because I am also a full-time student. I wouldn't say all Dicks sporting goods stores are the same, but the one I worked in Aventura, Florida was terrible and I wouldn't recommend anyone to work in that negative environment."
bad,"Working at Dick's was mediocre at best. They hired me knowing I was an athlete that needed specific days off for tournaments, yet they didn't comply with my schedule once I was on the job. They also were very iffy about scheduling. One week I would work 4 days, then the next two weeks I wouldn't be scheduled at all."
bad,"As a Freight Flow Lead at Dick's Sporting Goods, you are at as the stores personal freight Jesus Christ. They send you more more freight than your backroom can handle. Along with this they constantly understaff your truck crew but still expect you to finish as if you were properly staffed. even if you do manage to finish processing everything, the rest of the departments can't get all the freight you process out. When this happens, it is still your fault and you get a ""talking to"".The benefits are okay, but in order to get vacation time you have to have been in a full time position before you can even accrue vacation time. I have been working with Dick's for 2 years and I have enough vacation time to take a day off. The managers really have no idea how to manage people. They treat everyone like a kids, even if you are not. They expect you to stay busy and complete a laundry list of tasks, while they sit in the office."
bad,"In a typical day, we spend all of our shift on our feet, and get very short lunches, management does not lead by example, but a do as I say, not as I do approach. The company emphasizes achieving sales and metrics goals, without recognizing or compensating those who do reach those goals."
bad,"Slow during the week, opening and closing are super easy and im bored 99% of the time while weekends are fast paced    they dont really train you, youre just thrown onto a register and learn as you go. Scheduling is always a problem at my location. Dress code is super laid back."
bad,didn't like working here. I helped open a local store from the ground up and when I asked for more hours I ended up getting my hours cut to the point they laid me off and hired new people with max hours.
bad,Dicks distribution is ideal for gaining experience and finding another organized better paying company to provide your skill set to. You can be promoted if you are clicked with management and do as they tell you.
bad,"Management was very rude.   Seasonal employees are not given any"
bad,"4 hour shifts, all reorganization and relocation, some of management was decent the other part not enjoyable, very fast pace and critical. The company is not set up well."
bad,did not give enough hours to support any bills and were always late on getting a schedule out you could never plan anything until the day of. understaffed.
bad,Loved working for this company it was very fun and pleasant work inviorment unfortunately i did not make enought for travel expenses so there for i had to quit
bad,"Don't treat all employees fairly, some get treated better then others.  Have to work over 6 hours to get more then a 10 minute break.  If you need help everyone tends to get an attitude with you."
bad,"I worked as a seasonal employee (only two days - Thanksgiving and Black Friday of 2015). The other employees were snobby, unfriendly, pious, and generally unpleasant. The work was exhausting, which is fine, but the overall environment was so overwhelmingly unpleasant that I would not ever want to work there again. I'm grateful for the experience that I gained, and even more grateful that I only had to work there for two days."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Very mediocre work environment. Store was downplayed by its own management many times. I did not enjoy slow days. I miserably learned about work culture politics.
bad,Not a great place for moms seeking management positions to work. The balance between work and home-life is difficult. Nights and weekends are required for female managers.
bad,"This job always kept the ball rolling, always had something to do. This made the days go by fast. This job was very understaffed and probably about 100 things assigned to one person under the pressure of customer service. Very bad balance."
bad,"I run the front end and, keep it running smoothly. I ring people up. sell fishing licenses. Help customers find what they need and want. The hardest part of the job is when a customer doesn't really know what they need or want they just have a vague idea."
bad,"Clocked in, stayed at the register the whole shift unless needed else where.  Loved one of the managers. The others didn't seem to care too much about the employees.  When asked to go elsewhere in the store, wasn't given proper instruction and was left to figure out things on my own."
bad,The department I am in is very frustrating. I don't recommend trying to pursue a career in this company for they do not care for your problems and see you as robots .
bad,Management is not the greatest with poor hours and bad pay. inconstant scheduling and hours have been the main reason for me to leave this job as well as lack of opportunity to move up with the company
bad,"The facility I worked at was very unprofessional, management was a joke, they don't give you hours, and we were well under compensated.  I guess it's a fine job for starting out, but if you have bills to pay don't even bother."
bad,"A typical work day depends on what department you are working in. Helping customers is the main focus of the company, along with cleaning, organizing and running a register. "
bad,Good place to work if you just want to work a few hours here and there. My manager laughed at me when I mentioned a raise and when he finally agreed he gave me a 5 cent raise for one pay period.
bad,I really enjoyed my coworkers but the management was motor good. At the location I worked in we had a s new store manger every 5 months and they all changed up how the store was running. It was constant change and no set structure
bad,"It's A good place to work if you like to get hours. However, not the place to work long term. Loved the people there did not love the job."
bad,Great place to work if you are in love with sports and engaging with various people on a daily basis. However in all honesty if you are a minority it is very difficult for advancement in this company.
bad,"The management here is HORRIBLE. All the managers are childish, will talk about you to other associates behind your back, are not nice when it comes to taking any time off, always have favorites, treats older employees with way more respect than the younger ones, expect you to come in every time they call you in, even if you have requested off, and do NOT follow the corporate rules that are set in place for a reason."
bad,"Working with people you dont know gives you the opportunity to show them who you are as a person im matters of seconds, and that helps me what i need to work on as a persona and how to live a happy life."
bad,"Don't expect to last long here. They will give you the boot without warning. I came in one day, saw I had no hours scheduled for the next week. And I had to approach the manager to find out I didn't have a job anymore. They don't care about the employees one bit."
bad,"Poor organizational structure, managers can't coexist, everybody suffers. Raises are systematic, as in $0.50 per year of employment for hourly workers, with a cap. Company policies and processes are outdated and sometimes even dysfunctional."
bad,"Get place to work part time but if your are looking for a career, you may want to look elsewhere "
bad,"fun part time job, management changed almost monthly and was hard to keep the job balance. Would recommend coming working here as a summer job or for students."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Work you to the bone for little pay. Employees who have been at a store for a long time are lazy in their responsibilities. Management at the store level is generally good.
bad,"The mangers have no idea how to make schedules, I don't how many time I was scheduled to work and when I got there they would tell me that they are ""over hours"". Its not worth the drive for one day a week."
bad,"Too little labor and way to much for staff to accomplish.GM were loading dock labor, front end cahiers..."
bad,"The new management staff is awful about communicating anything that is going on in the store. The general employees are nice but have no idea what is going on. The current store manager lacks professional tact. He will ask you a question, then while you answer he will just turn and walk  away mid answer. They never have the correct scheduling out on time, they will change it at minumum 3 times a week during that current work week."
bad,The Hardest part of the job is standing still behind the checkout all day. Need to get up and move around.
bad,Nothing exciting I didn't like the way they pushed you to push product on customers. I didn't lie trying to convince people t buy something that I knew they didn't really want
bad,A typical day at work includes managers who repeat themselves at least 15 times a day on top of constantly nagging their associates who are already doing what they were told to do. You have no help with trucks or anything. Even managers ignore the customers and you when trying to find solutions to problems. Co workers are great but management seriously needs replaced. Non successful way of running things if you ask me.
bad,"Great place to work as a young kid, management tends to lean more towards employee who can give the ""metrics"" when it comes to hours and leniency."
bad,I feel that the average day of work goes by rather quickly. I learned that there is no opportunity for growth within this company. Management at least on my shift seems to have no idea what is going on and follows the lead of what first shift standards set. The hardest part of my job is not being able to suggest any new ideas because they are so set in stone and nothing will ever change there.
bad,They only offered 12 hours per week average at just above minimum wage. The schedule was never the same so you couldn't try to get a second job. Hours store was open was good but you were on your feet all day
bad,The company used to be a fun place to work where one had hopes of advancement. Now it seems like all the sales leads are given 31 hours and expected to work magic all while having their jobs threatened if standards are not met.
bad,"Typically a day at work consisted of checking product counts, changing mark ups and mark downs along with assisting customers. I have learned from here how to sell credit cards. Management never had things on time although they were very knowledgeable about the products. My co-workers were very nice and hard working. Hardest part was moving sections around the floor. i enjoyed helping people."
bad,"This company was great learning experience because they allowed me to learn all departments and I was able to be scheduled freely in any of the departments in the store. The down side was I was overworked and underpaid. I was working almost 50+ hours a week and barely making enough to get by. When I first got there management was great, but at the end of my time there the new management really overworked employees and didnt appreciate them."
bad,"fun environment but just a job to pay the bills, people talked about you behing your back."
bad,"Working here was enjoyable only because of my customers and a few co-workers. I always worked in more than one department and learned about every sport there was. I had the highest sales in online orders,was good at getting customers everything they wanted either in our store,online,or in another store."
bad,"Like any job there are some complications, but here it seems you're doing a lot more than what you're getting paid for and barely get any reward for excellent work ethnic or customer appeal. They ask a lot from their workers, but don't reward them for their outstanding work."
bad,"Apply for this job a month or two before the holiday season if you are planning to work here. After the holiday season, they plan to cut the hours of any crew member type associates and leaving on vacation to avoid the fuss. Good job if you can handle retail but play it safe if you have bills to pay or money to save."
bad,This particular job didn't pay very well. The average pay start was 9.25. Above minimum wage but the tasks that were required of each job description wasn't worth it.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,A typical day at work included opening the store and starting the gun count then selling and working with customers that were not always the easiest. I learned how to work well with my coworkers and to deal with the varying attitudes from customers. The management was not the best but they knew what they were doing and didn't have great attitudes towards their employees.
bad,It was a pretty slow job and the pay wasn't all that great. I made a little over 8 dollars and I get I wasn't doing much but it wasn't worth it. That is why I left for a better paying job.
bad,"Management was awful and hated by the employees, long shifts having to stand up was hard on my body often. Often wasn't given a break. Constantly tried to advance to other departments and was reassured I would be able to, but was never allowed, even after being trained in another department and having covered that department before. I was also called in by my manger for ""an emergency because somebody called out"" and upon arrival was given a vacuum and extension cord and told to vacuum the store for the next four hours before moving on to other tasks. Dick's has potential, especially if you work in lodge department or team sports. The pay could've been higher, and raises were fought for and still inadequate."
bad,"Advancement in less then 3yrs"
bad,Did not get the right training and some people who worked there were very rude and sometimes did not do there work. But there were people who help a lot.
bad,"Dicks Sporting Goods was a fun place to work sure, but the inconsistent pace and less than satisfactory scheduling caused issues. Fellow employees failed to meet the expectations bestowed upon them so other employees had to pick up the slack."
bad,"I really enjoyed working there, the people were fun and it wasn't that bad of work. the main problem would be corporate. Also management is rough, they are always stressed out and so they build it on to us."
bad,It's a good place to work. Not many benefits or advancement opportunities. Work hours are based on daily sales so you never have a steady income or work hours
bad,The store manager keeps on discriminating for my disabilities. He secludes me from everything and gives me the lowest raises. He also refuses to work with some of my accommodations and talks to me and treats me horrible in front of co-workers and customers.
bad,"I had great co-workers, but the management created a stressful work environment. They also don't care about you as a person and undervalue the PSC and only use you when they need you and after they treat you as if you were irrelevant to the business."
bad,"Typical of a publicly traded company, it is clear that Dick's main focus is on the shareholders at the expense of the employee.  Dick's is constantly looking for ways to improve morale, but have not been able to find a good fit yet."
bad,The company is a at will employer whom will fire you for any reason. I was terminated without just cause. The management does not value their employees. if you are 1 minute late you receive points and so many points equal termination. I felt I did everything including making employee of the month several times and management still did not appreciate my abilities.
bad,"•hot days at work since the A.C never worked even though it was a new building"
bad,"Managers chosen at one particular location did not follow company policies and allowed employees to squeak by without following rules or abiding by common ethical practices. When confronted, issues were not handled or changed."
bad,"The fellow employees were awesome, two managers were great ,but the store manager was immature and unprofessional which led to a poor working environment."
bad,"Unwelcoming environment childlike management "
bad,When I first started working for DSG I loved the team atmosphere and the quick paced environment. With the new changes in the company all they care about it money and employees are way overworked and there isn’t enough staff on the on the floor. Creates a miserable work environment when you’re spending all you’re time sprinting back and forth and dealing with angry customers because no one is one the floor.
bad,Dick's Sporting Goods is very chill place to work in. You get to wear sporty clothes to match what the company sales which is a plus because you are comfortable while at work.
bad,A typical day is very chaotic and you should be able to make constant decisions without the help of your superiors. Plus be able to talk and communicate with customers.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Very typical retail position, but lacks authority in the sense that coworkers tell each other what to do rather than manager. Needs more leadership and accountability on behalf of staff."
bad,The managers are extremely selfish and unhelpful. The only reason I kept my job as long as I did was becuase of my coworkers. The staff they hire are amazing people but the management treats them like dirt.
bad,"Dick's is nice because its a sporting goods store and everyone wants to buy the stuff there, including associates, but the hours, the work load, and the amount of pressure is never worth it for the low pay scale that has been out dated."
bad,"The management would not fully accept my hours and would often ignore the workers needs. Being there felt like a high school with the teachers (management) having favorites and ""cliques"" between associates. However the discount is a good selling point."
bad,"-Management is terrible"
bad,"When I first starting working here, management was willing to work with my school schedule but a year in, everything changed. New management was hired after the closure of Sports Authority and they began to ignore my availabilty and would schedule me for days I wasn't able to work. They also underwent multiple layoffs, cut hours randomly,  leaving us understaffed and to pick up the pieces."
bad,Biggest issue was that issues that have been ignored for so long catch up and are never addressed which causes a variety of other issues. Upper management tends to be very unfair to the store managers and their expectations are unrealistic.
bad,Ramped favoritism from management. Fun employees but that's about it. If you're not buddy buddy with the managers you will not be scheduled hours. They tell everyone the same promotion lie to them to go above and beyond only to promote their favorites.
bad,Dick's Sporting Goods is a fun work environment for those who love sports. I have found that I learned some important skills while working there such as processing and shipping merchandise for customers. I got to share my passion with customers and learn about their passions. I got a chance to process the freight as it was coming into our store and checked the manifest to ensure what we received was what we were supposed to. I found it difficult to move up or get a raise. There is no communication between managers and can cause headaches.
bad,The culture is more like being back in highschool than it is a work environment. The compensation is pretty bad and hours available makes it quite difficult to earn a living wage.
bad,"A lot of pressure, but not a lot of support. Training is lacking, and it's a sink or swim environment. Morale is low, but salaries are good so people put up with it. Systems are fair to poor. Be prepared to do a lot in Excel on very tight deadlines."
bad,"It depends what location you are at. They are all different, but corporate causes problems at all of them. Management and other part-time employees all lose as a result."
bad,"Management is, horrible, policies not enforced, only good thing is flexible scheduling. I obviously was not happy with the company now that i am looking for new employment elsewhere."
bad,It's a different type of atmosphere at Dick's.  If you are used to a fast paced environment then this isn't for you.  This place really doesn't challenge you enough.
bad,Worked two years and promised a position and strungallong finally left good time working there but again no future and full-time is 32 hours a week
bad,The work isn't difficult nor takes much thought. Becomes old very fast due to ten hours in one lane. Over worked nightly due to constant understaffing. Under qualified supervisors as well as managers. Whatever benefits the company way over employees! Benefits such as paid vacation days and personal days are nice but it is very difficult to get approved days due to constant under staffing as well. Overall morale and turn over rate is by far the worst I have ever seen.
bad,"under staffed constantly "
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Was hired 2 years ago at a low wage, minimum and have received 18 cents raise since being there. Many new associates hired at higher rates, because of the male management wanting a female oriented front end workforce. Typical day is very easy work, but there is little to no room for advancement within the company without transferring stores. Management expects much but does not compensate."
bad,There is no store structure that allows for growth. The company is very operationally focused and is trying make the customer the priority? They have not changed any operational aspects of the store and still expect the tasks to continue and be executed seamlessly. While completing the 100's of operational aspects of running a store while being 100% focused on the customer. You have to acknowledge that customer service is 100% priority and has and is a constant struggle to provide with one associate in a department. As a part time Job where you walk in and walk out its not so bad as a manager its a joke. I have been with the company many years they have so much potential an just focus on adding more processes and creating VP's. Its pretty simple provide a great place to work and your customer will receive great service!
bad,"This company does not care about its employees or its customers. As a Customer Service Specialist, you're under a ton of pressure to push Scorecards and Private Label Credit Cards on customers. If your percentages are good, you'll get hours. If not, you won't. "
bad,"I was hired in October and not once during either of my two interviews was I informed that my employment status was ""seasonal"".... then two weeks before Christmas, the store manager comes out and says ""oh yeah, you have two weeks to prove yourself if you want to stay past the holidays""... Proving yourself meant selling enough credit cards. I would not have been as annoyed if management was more upfront and honest during the hiring process about whether or not I was permanent or seasonal."
bad,I didn't like working for this company. The management was horrible and they don't give you any hours
bad,"I worked as a lodge associate in the hunting/fishing/camping department and loved the lifestyle behind the products I was selling since that's why I got the job in the first place. My particular store was brand new and started working there before the doors opened. Everything about this company is on a trickle down effect. Being the bottom of the totem pole as a hourly associate, different managers would give completely different orders that always seemed to conflict with everyone. Their were three managers at my store, the general manager, the hard lines manager and the apparel manager. All three came from different workplace backgrounds and were all new to Dick's Sporting Goods. One manager would cry and throw a fit over a  product display, we would change it, then the district managers would see it when they visited, make us change it back, and then when they left the manager would make us switch it back again! I enjoyed the work, easy and fun job, but this company has a large turnover rate for a reason. It's not lousy employees, its ill-suited management."
bad,"As an hourly associate, they typically leave you stranded with little support from management or other departments.  "
bad,"the thing I loved about working here is learning, learning about sports equipment to hunting gear this store has It all, I had great co workers wonderful manager."
bad,This was a very slow pased job. I did not feel like I was a part of a team there  rather just another employee who is there to do my job and leave.
bad,"My typical day consists of greeting and helping customers, taking phone calls, folding clothes, putting freight out, and running the cash register while keeping the store clean."
bad,"Not to busy during the week, weekend, get pretty busy, managers do play favorites, co workers are pretty cool, hardest part of the job is dealing with management."
bad,they promise advancement and hire people under you to do the job you wanted to. Unfair treatment of employees.
bad,"Despite leading all stores in our district in sales, there's no hours to distribute due to ""bad payroll"". Management will constantly tell you this while they give you 5-10 hours/week. Great co-workers but unfortunately bad management and horrible payroll. Job is super easy, its all talking to customers and pushing out back stock to the floor. Definetely not a job you can rely on for consistent schedules/hours. Good idea as a second job."
bad,The co-works I had were great everyday was wonderful however the management was very bad some would come in the door at 7am yelling. Jokes between co-workers would be turned around and used against them in write-ups. This is a high stress store to work at. The best part was the co-works and friends I met while working there. The hardest part was dealing with the managers all day long if they didn't like you they would make your life a living nightmare.
bad,"A typical day at work would be me at the cash register checking out customers. I learned how to be a cashier. I have always worked with children so when I was a cashier it was something completely different then any of my experience. My management was good. They were very helpful with many things, and were very patient with me during the training process. My co-workers were fun to work with. Never had any problems with someone not doing their job. The hardest part of my job was getting people to get score cards. The co-workers and I would make it a competition to see who get the most score cards. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people, and interacting with other people you have the same sports interest in you."
bad,"Very fast paced with slim payroll but job is doable if you just stay busy. It is much easier than some companies I have worked for, they just expect you to work and do your job fast."
bad,"Overall, even though the job and position I severed was an enjoyable experience. I believe some of the management and people that work inside the department needs to be evaluated."
bad,I enjoyed working there because I worked with great people. I had an understanding managers were always willing to help and support. once those managers left and new ones came in. It made the work environment not as enjoyable.
bad,"The workplace culture was fun for the most part, only because of all the sporting goods in the store. However, the management didn't really seem interested in helping you advance."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"I worked at the front-end as a CSS, I loved my co-workers and I'm a college athlete so I loved the atmosphere in the store and had no problem promoting company goals. The pay was good and I got a lot of hours. "
bad,"At the location I work at, the staff are very friendly and helpful. Although they help keep a positive workplace, the fact that it is a retail store in a popular tourist makes it a more on the unbearable end. The days feel so long when working, even when very busy, that it is particularly exhausting. Not only that, there are times where you would be the only person working one department for hours and you are expected to do everything perfectly."
bad,clean building.  learn something different every once in while.  hard to advance when management has an idea of who they want for a particular position. most of the staff is friendly.
bad,"This store wants you people to be in the key position, but they are so child like. you kids who care less about customer service are in the key roles.  and don't want to work with the public when a issue.  if you are over 30 good luck getting promoted,"
bad,Management would ask what the problems were and when I would explain and want to discuss it with them they would be offended. I loved my coworkers and majority of the customers there though.
bad,Good place to work. Not a lot of internal promotions. Would have stayed on if management did not create a lot of undesired drama. A good place of employment for young kids.
bad,"The company is a difficult company to have a clear path for growth.  The leadership does not listen to their team or action on the needs of the employees.  There is high turnover in the company because of this and thus constant change, making it difficult to establish consistency in process and team culture."
bad,I did not enjoy my time their. The mnagement team was not helpful. I did not like the wqay they ran their compamny at all. I would not suggest working there.
bad,"I love the job function, dress code, and job culture.  However, unless you are a man with multiple degrees, you will not advance.  Unfortunately, I have been in my position for years and new kids come in with degrees, get promoted, and promptly fired for not doing their job function.  This company does not often promote from within."
bad,"Upper management didn't care about the employees who ran the store- it was always about numbers. Low pay, low room for advancement. Wouldn't work here again"
bad,"I worked in the golf section for a year and a half. During this time I was one of two associates to learn how to do anything and everything in the golf department, including being proficient at cashiering when needed, and I didn't even get a 25 cent raise.  In the end, I mostly disliked this job because of the main store manager, and working in retail is not for me."
bad,"Most employees never showed up to work which made it stressful especially on weekends having to cover areas that you were not familiar with, and the manager never got on to them or never fired them and then the ones who actually showed up never got appreciated."
bad,"its a retail job. greet customers and sell merchandise,credit cards and warranties. good people to work with but the job is just like any other retail job."
bad,"compared to other retail companies, DSG does not really care about its employees.  I've wasted 5 years there moving up to management only to realize my starting salary will be equal to what I make hourly after you total the 45-50hr work weeks.  3 months of the year are blacked out at my location from any vacation time.  They are constantly changing rules and points of interest with in the company."
bad,"When I first started working there, I felt very isolated and left out. The people there, including the managers were not friendly at all and I was often awkwardly standing there when everyone else was interacting. I feel that the job itself was easy, although not much to do when the store does not have customers which happened very often. The manager that did the scheduling played favorites and since I never got the morning shifts, I never got to know her so my requests for better shifts were never accepted."
bad,It is a very stressful place to work. They run the business like they are going out of business every week. it is a constant fire drill to get things done. they need to invest in better technology.
bad,"Overall, I enjoy working in the customer service field, I am very knowledgeable when it comes to footwear so the job came easy for me. I just didn't enjoy my management because they were extremely unprofessional"
bad,"Employees were friendly, and starting pay wasn't bad, but you only get a thirty minute unpaid lunch once you've worked at least 6 1/2 hours.  Other than that, you are stuck with a ten minute brake so long as you work four hours.  You will run into a lot of friendly employees who are willing to help you out by giving you a few of their hours here and there if you get short shifted (which happens a lot I might add), and they are also willing to help if you need to switch shifts.  This brings me to my next point which are the not always friendly managers.  The managers like to make examples out of people, and not in a good way.  No one tell you that you were scheduled for a lunch and you weren't given a schedule or were able to find one that was readily available? Be ready to be told to clock out early. No one in your dept, but they are swamped up front? get ready to be told to clock out early.  Trying to help other associates who are swamped in their section?  Be prepared to be told off over the radio for everyone to hear.  My best advice is to do your best and attempt to follow what the managers say, and try to develop working relationships with them, but then still be prepared for unjustifiable punishments.  It isn't all bad working there, each day presents a new opportunity to network, and further yourself, but unless you are a full time employee, expect those days on the job, and hours to slowly diminish.  It gets bad when you have requested X hours in a week, and barely get that number for a whole two week pay period, especially if you have bills to pay and the base salary"
bad,I would like to find a company that I can grow with and find respect in the position I hold from management. I think without support from your superiors you'll find your employees follow suit and have little to no respect for you either.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Great place to work if you like all kinds of sports. Not the best paying and the staff a my store was very limited we had to work many time with very little staff.
bad,"Management was disorganized, poor work environment, scheduled me when I was unavailable due to school once again related to the management. I worked with good coworkers but we were inefficient due to poor leadership, we were left to figure things out on our own."
bad,"When I got the job at Dicks, it was part time nights. I had not worked outside the home in many years. I was a little scared. I learned quickly, and became known as the work mom to all the teenagers that worked nights. I moved from cashier, to one who trained the cashiers, and I also learned to count the tills and do the daily deposits."
bad,"A normal day at dicks sporting goods was very eventful. Normally a full list of tasks to do upon arrival as well as customer service requirements that needed to be handled. Overall, a decent company to work for."
bad,"This job was a transition job for me post-military, but it helped serve the purpose of keeping me financially secure until I could find another path."
bad,"Dick's Sporting Goods offers a great way to interact with people. However, it offers low hours with small benefits."
bad,"A typical day at work, once i'm clocked in, i immediately check my dressing rooms, my power isle and my folding tables to ensure a neat and organized appearance to the apparel department. "
bad,As my experience was only with this store I can not rate the company as a whole. Work environment of this one store was well below my expectations. If you value work life balance this may not be the company for you due to frequent schedule changes.
bad,It was a very cool place to work at the beginning of my employment; especially if you are into sports. Began to get very old and repetitive at a certain point.
bad,"Working there was fun at first but the management was horrible and so were a few of the workers, they didn’t really know what they were doing , if you ask for a day off they always say no ."
bad,I don't want to do this.  Some of my experiences there were confusing. It would take more than what I have to say would be difficult to describe.  Sorry.
bad,"The managers were amazing but the pay, workload, and hours were not so amazing. I was paid barely enough to pay the bills I do have since I was still in high school and my hours were not complimentary to a student still in school like they said they would be. I would stay 2-3 hours after closing still working and get home around 1:30 on a school night where I had to be up at 5."
bad,"It is much like any other retail job. But unlike commission jobs that I have the pay is not great unless you are in management. Even then there are much better paying retail jobs. It was great to work with sports themed products, but overall the job and company were disappointing to work for."
bad,Good pay but a lot of work. Never enough help with the amount of customers. Best thing was they start giving vacation within a few months.only worked here for a few months
bad,Store managers micro manage like constantly. Could never really tell if you were doing a good job. Company doesn't like to promote within even if you may be a great employee.
bad,I really did not enjoy working at Dick Sporting Goods. They really did not see eye to eye on scheduling due to my school schedule. Other than that I loved the discounts
bad,"If you are new to the workforce, dicks will give you a good dose of nurturing to get your feet wet into working in a high-tempo retail environment. Once acclimated, the work can be monotonous as everything down to the temperature in the building is controlled outside the building such as plan-o-grams, transfers, what is ordered, etc."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,The company wasn't a bad place to work for about 1.5 years but the company has recently decided to lower the available hours while increasing what they demand of you. Worked in the golf department for almost 2 years and the majority of that was without help.
bad,"Dick's has great benefits and is flexible with your schedule. However, depending on your manager, you may never receive a promotion or substantial increase in pay. The overall moral of the place is low and there is nothing being done in the IT field to make things better. The IT directors allow the end user to dictate how things are run."
bad,"you can cross train around the store but their is no advancements available until someone leaves or moves up in position to make room for your growth. you don't get paid your worth you can work very hard and learn everything you need to know but it wont be rewarded or compensated just appreciated. unfortunately, appreciation don't pay your bills does it."
bad,"Assistant Managers allow employees to be very disrespectful to their"
bad,"The company has soo much potential but is poorly run. it is far too centrally controlled. having been in a company that values its in store management ( CVS) opinion and efforts, Dicks was more looking for robotic behavior ( task driven, not business driven). Not enough payroll at store level to really get the job done."
bad,"I'm not into sports so the job was very boring to me. And they only had me fold the same clothes over and over again for hours. The management was never really around, and I never got to know them well. After a few months I wanted something different."
bad,"The company is growing that allows advancement possibilities if the local management can cultivate it. Must be a ""yes"" man in order to not be seen as a threat."
bad,Management doesn't care about employees and they are very rude
bad,"Managment sucked, wouldn't work with me to transfer to a store closer to my house after numerous times of asking."
bad,just a stop in the road. only was to advance is through department leads and managers pick and choose their 'favorites' to be advanced. ok job all depends on your given management (like every job)
bad,Don't work there the manager don't give a rip about the employees especially in operations. I almost died so many times trying to lift up gun safes and kayaks ect . The paid doesn't match what the job is for.
bad,"If you are into sports and/or outdoor activities, it is a fun place to work. Your weekly hours are very flexible. You can get health benefits as a part time employee. The only negative is compensation"
bad,"Managers were a little unorganized. A lot of people quit while I was there because of how harsh and sadly, a little rude, one of the mangers was to them."
bad,Not anything special. It was a good first job but the hours felt ever lasting even on 4 hour shifts. 30 minute breaks are allowed on shifts over 6 hours. 10 minute breaks are allowed once whenever
bad,It was a very enjoyable job.  You must be alright with working long days (12+ hours) being on your feet the entire time.  Very fast paced environment working with young people.
bad,The management was alright but it wasn't the greatest. I was a lodge associate when I worked there and the managers were supposed to train me properly. Unfortunately I never got the proper training to perform my daily job.
bad,"Dicks Sporting Good And Field And Streams Are A Great Company Through The Hiring Process.  I was hired at the very beginning of October as part time cashier/ customer service I was not hired as seasonal.  So I started working loved working my job loved coming into workers I'VE NEVER CALLED IN, I'VE NEVER BEEN LATE,  I'VE NEVER NOT SHOWN UP FOR MY SHIFT,  MY DRAWER HAS NEVER BEEN OVER OR SHORT, I'VE NEVER BEEN ON LANE ACCOUNTABILITY AND I'VE NEVER BEEN IN ANY TROUBLE ON THE JOB ALWAYS DONE WHAT I'M TOLD. I worked the day before Thanksgiving I worked Thanksgiving Day And I worked Black Friday I worked ever holiday scheduled never complained I even took shifts when people needed their shifts covered to get more hours etc. Well a couple of weeks ago they let like 7 of us go saying we were hired for seasonal I was not hired for seasonal they lied to me and they picked people to stay that has called in been late been on lane accountability several times etc plus they fired 3 to 4 full time employees I don't get it I have 2 daughters and rent to pay.  I've been looking for a job non stop and still can't find one and I'm worried me and my girls are gonna be homeless these people are heartless and could careless because it's not them while I sit here and cry and worry about me and my girls pathetic someone help"
bad,A typical day would include being in the department all by yourself and expected to still give a high level of customer service and still tend to department needs. I learned that retail sales is not for me at their level of expectations. The management was concerned about one thing - sales. the workplace culture was very negative. The hardest part of the job was working in the department alone and trying to get every thing done that needed to get done. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I could totally focus on the customer and their individual need.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Long hours and late nights should be expected as the managers weren’t always the nicest of people. and there would be issues of people not showing up to their shifts.
bad,"had  different jobs to do and  learn different areas of the store"
bad,"Overall the appeal to working for this company was the team dynamic. A typical day would be a collaborative effort, based around being understaffed and overwhelmed. For the positive thinker this created strong bonds with coworkers. Realistically this is a good place to start working in customer service because the pace requires fast adaptation, but if you don't seek knowledge the work day could be rough. Workplace culture depends on the staff on a given day. Hardest part of the job is managing tasks while pleasing customers and management. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills and helping appreciative people."
bad,"There is not much to do besides repetitive, busy work. Does teach you how to cooperate with other people and work as a team. The environment is okay, and there is nothing really enjoyable about this job."
bad,"Pros"
bad,I didn't like my ASM he wasn't really a people person. He was [retty sexist and childish in a lot of situations and would blame us for his mistakes which wasn't cool at all.
bad,management wasn't too good. they seemed unorganized hen it came to structure for the workplace. environment was fast pace must be quick on feet and people orientated.
bad,I moved through this company from the lowest rung to a manager role and saw that the company routinely exploits its salaried workers to do the jobs that they are unwilling to pay hourly workers to do regularly. Too often we schedule to a budget and then are told to send workers home and cut shifts through the end of the week. Unfair to everyone at the store level. Being a manager in these stores left a bad taste in my mouth.
bad,a  day in Dicks sporting goods would consist of it being very busy especially at peak hour which starts at 12 O'clock and normally last a wile considering the fact there aren't enough people scheduled. management had to many favoritism so made most of the employees uncomfortable.
bad,It is always crazy. Not a bad first job but after a couple years it becomes very stressful and cut-throat. I learned how to pick up quick and save myself time when your on a tight schedule. The most enjoyable part is the people i worked with.
bad,"The managers did not really care about the well-being of their employers at all. They were always trying to win competitions between all of the stores in the region which was understandable, but in result to it, they treated the employees terribly. Hours were also very inconsistent."
bad,"working for dicks is great, except for the pay, benefits and the rude customer base. making new friends is easy, and most of the people there are down to earth."
bad,"It is just a place to make money and to find a job. I am not a fan of retail jobs, this was just something to get me through college until I got my degree"
bad,surprisingly hard work and not much pay. you can tell this job was tailored for young adolescents who don't have too much responsibility because the demands are more strenuous then you would think
bad,This is my full time job and they do not appreciate their full time people and grant their part timers more opportunities than the full timers.
bad,I worked there4 for a little while but I didn't really find it productive. it seemed like more of a drama filled cess pool only because of some of the other associates that work there and try to put their personal life before customers.
bad,I've had two experiences with this company that to me would lead me to not really care for this company. I was not allowed to work in a certain department because of my gender. Also i was not hired on my first try but i lost about 50lbs and reapplied and was hired on the spot.
bad,"Most of the managers that I worked with did not care about anything other than the bottom line, there was no communication and even less caring about their employees"
bad,"The company overall is a good company I believe, however the location that I worked for had many management issue that could not seem to be resolved."
bad,"While i was there we had 2 whole different management teams, in less than 6 months of the store being open, They carried on unprofessional relationships with the staff, and seem to put their employees last."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Boring job, especially on weekdays. they give some people really good hours but they giive the rest 6 hours a week. plus managment does not care about employees"
bad,"The employees are very outgoing nice caring down to earth people, but some management in unfair. Some management is great and caring but some are not."
bad,At the time I worked at this store it was going through a lot of transition. Went through 3 store Managers in less the 8 months. Too many department managers. I am sure after all these years it is a much better place to work. It is now a brand new store
bad,"We were usually understaffed and over worked. "
bad,good perks with employee discount and friendly staff. constantly pressured to sell warranties
bad,"I enjoyed working at Dick's because I loved the things I sold.  I'm an avid sportsman, so selling products for fishing, hunting, and camping really worked well with me.  However, the job got really old because of all of the busywork the management had me perform.  I constantly found myself rearranging and moving products around at the managers discretion for no real purpose but to kill time."
bad,Tough company to work for offered little to no training. Can be a good enviroment if you have a good management team and the company isn't cutting hours.
bad,managers were really unorganized. sometimes paychecks would be sent to the wrong recipients
bad,Good job for college students with busy schedules looking to make a little extra money on the side.
bad,I generally enjoy my day at Dick's but find little opportunity to advance even with a bachelor's degree.
bad,"Entry level job for people who are in high school. I would recommend this company. If you like sports and an active lifestyle, this would be a good place for you to start your first job."
bad,Sold shoes and thats it big store but not alot of fun working there
bad,"Typical retail environment.  Little room to move, job goes no where"
bad,"Sometimes the job can be enjoyable, but when you think of how much you're getting paid all the joy goes away."
bad,Store Manager was very questionable on procedures.  This job did give me the opportunity to learn more about hunting and fishing because the other people who worked there were fun and eager to teach.
bad,"The main duties of a sales associate at Dick's sporting goods is to provide customer service on the sales floor and keep the merchandise tidy, organized and accessible to customers. I personally made life long friends working there and everyone carried their own weight there."
bad,there are no full time positions in the store unless you're a manager. company is trying to use obamacare as a defense for not hiring full time workers. customer engagement specialist is nothing more than a self help desk that must get quota of credit apps filled every day. managers are overworked and crabby most of time. only way to talk with in store is by use of headset not telephones.
bad,"I maintained the entire sales floor at times, management wasn't stable, I enjoyed helping customers."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,never open to suggestion. poor utilization of internal talent
bad,"Each day at the store included a new task to be completed. Projects made the day go by quicker. Although there are many wonderful employees- including management- at Dick's Sporting Goods, they do not value the individual employee. I hardly ever saw new positions filled from within the company, and witnessed many supervisors quit due to little upward mobility in the company."
bad,"The company itself isn't a good company to work for, any retail management position that promotes their employees to work over 40 hours on a work week just because they are salary, i cant agree with."
bad,"Bad Management (manners,tone,work effort)"
bad,dicks has a great business model
bad,Co-workers are very fun. Management is a little too relaxed for my taste and definetely plays favorites. Some rules don't apply to others. The job itself is ok. It's not a very hard job but you don't get paid very well.
bad,"Retail is extremely boring and the pay was not that good. However, I did work with some great people"
bad,"People at the Independence store work extremley hard, they have put in alot of hardwork and dedication to the company. Unfrortuanley this company does not have much room for advancement, and moving up within the company is close to impossible! The hardest part about working there is the management style, they have no communication, and alot of times the employees are left confused or frustrated. The most enjoyable part of working there would be the customers, being around sports, and your fun and loving coworkers."
bad,"This is an ok job if you are a college student, beyond that I would not recommend working here unless you are confident in your ability to move up. upper level management makes significantly more than everyone else."
bad,Overall this job teaches the core values of customer service and the importance of product knowledge.
bad,Great people that worked there but it was a new store and very disorganized. Customers often left unsatisfied due to the lack of employees on the floor and often mispriced or non-priced items.
bad,"From when I was working there, management wasn't really helpful. Basically had to learn the job on the go and had to use past experience. Culture wasn't as friendly as I thought it should be."
bad,"it was pretty cool, typical retail job, show up and do your job and they will most likely work around your schedule. Management was okay depending on who you worked for. Hardest part about the job is the rush you may get for huge sporting events. Not really an enjoyable job."
bad,"The work is not hard, just very frustrating. The company is poorly managed. They do not care about work ethic, or responsibility so your job will be safe regardless, but they do not determine hours based on work ethic, responsibility, etc. If you like sports, most of the customers will be easy and fun to deal with though. It also pays good for an unskilled position. If it weren't for such poor management, I would have very little complaints."
bad,The hardest part about the job is the computer generated schedules makes it hard for employees to earn decent paychecks.
bad,Nice job for college athletes. Not great hours. very little room to advance or move up within the company.
bad,"DIck's Sporting Goods is filled with great people working there. It is an amazing first or second job for teenagers and college students. They are very flexible and compatible with student's school schedule. Management is very open with their employees, there is minimum conflict. The only con tow irking for Dick's Sporting Goods is that employees hours are constantly cut. There might be days when your only on the schedule for one or two days per week."
bad,"Not the best environment to work in, but it's a job. Learned how to effectively interact with customers in a retail environment"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
bad,Could not handle dealing with several different departments needs for such a low salary. Definitely dont recommend because i had my hours shaved for the dumbest reason; i.e: closing the store needed to take +3 hours after close to return the store to normal.
bad,Most days you either have nothing to do or too much to possibly accomplish. It was an easy job but was not worth the pay. I got a 13 cent raise (on top of minimum wage) after working there a year.
bad,"My brother and I worked there for quite some time, opening the store. 6 months in, management hadn't let go of some seasonal employees and were losing money. Again, instead of laying off employees management continued to promise everyone more hours. The hours never came and many employees left."
bad,Great place to work if you like retail. typical retail job Not a lot of room for advancement unless you kiss butt
bad,At dicks you had to know about sports at least a small amount. To sell the right items to customers without baiting them into something they didn't need. We would mostly just sell what they needed with small up-sales on items that went well with what they bought.
bad,"I learned how to multitask very well at this store location, I worked in apparel and as a cashier and would have to quickly be able to get rid of a line while still showing excellent customer service. The managers were great."
good,Was not a fan of the job. Provided no benefits to my future and had to work awful shifts. Worked there for about 4 months and decided to take talents elsewhere.
good,"I loved working here but the managers did not cooperate with me and we did not meet certain, mutual views. Since I was the fastest worker people came to me to help them do their jobs. Rob did not keep his promise and he gave me consistent eight hours a week. It was too long of a commute for the pay and hours so I was forced to quit."
good,"First thing is to count the Guns and make sure all were accounted for and all were entered. Then it was time process truck. In the meantime helping customers, selling guns, tuning on bows, and working the Manager on Duty shifts."
good,"High turnover for management.  They do not train employees on the necessary tasks.  Customers are terrible.  You are expected to sell loyalty accounts and doing so seems extremely fake.  No clear mission for the company.  The team sports area was fun tho, setting up youth with the things they need."
good,"The Job itself is great, if you can manage to deal with the management. If the management does not like you they will fire you and hire there own friends. Its a very biased environment."
good,"If you don't like to play games, and I don't mean sports games, this is not the place for you.  Old boys network for promotion, poor pay and advancement unless you are managers pet.  Targeting by managers if they want your position for a friend.   Schedules cut mid week with no notification then write ups for not being there.  Managers late on a daily basis but if you are 1 minute late, you are written up."
good,People here were not very friendly.... and TOO MUCH drama!!! Management was NOT the best.... they would push your “score card and credit rating” too much. And would come over the head seats and embarrass whoever had a low score... I do not think embarrassing the people who work for you.... is working in your best interest... hands down
good,"barley get any hours.. They don't put you on the schedule to work majority the time , but call you to come in even though they didn't schedule you. And if you aren't able to come in , management will most definitely give you a nasty attitude. They want you to harass the customers about score cards, credit cards, protection plans, and donations.. which is very irritating to customers and puts associates in an awkward position. CSS employees try to play manager and tell you what and how to do things.. Management is good for scheduling you AGAINST your availability and tries to make you find someone to cover your shift, even though they screwed up the schedule.. unorganized and all over the place."
good,"Dick's is only good as a part time position if you are looking to get discounts off sporting goods, and already have another means of income. They do not hire full time positions nor do they advance from within. They burn out the employees and inconsistently schedule the workers such that they never can rely on any income. They culture is very petty and the manager of this particular store is unapproachable when it comes to issues. There are favorites which get the desired hours and the rest struggle to have basic hours.  If you are available 24/7 -365 you will get hours but if you have outside commitments even on 1 or 2 days - you cannot be considered for any full time positions."
good,The job itself wasn’t the problem but the management are mostly caddy middle aged women who if they don’t like you will find any reason to fire you or make you quit. They ask for availability and schedule against what you give them.
good,Co-workers and customers fun to work with.  Management style very difficult to work under. To much additional customer interaction required of employees.
good,Enjoyed working with my co workers. A lot of management turn over which lead to instability in the store. Lead to an unhappy work environment for management as well as employees.
good,Its an OK job. Gives you little hours management is not fair and most of the time they cut down hours not much benefits but the employee discount which is 25%.
good,Too many personel agendas in management.  Mot managed per corporate standars.  If you are you were protected.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"The management is horrible. There’s a lot of favoritism in the work place. The new hires get treated better than the people who have been there for years and they also get better pay. There’s no one to talk to about problems within the company, and if you do try to talk to someone, they give false promises. The only good thing is the people I’ve met."
good,"they will work you to death, they do not care about health issues or family emergencies at all. they expect you to work at a 10 hour shift plus overtime if they ask on a school night. if you are unable to do something for you they will threaten your job status. i would never work here again or recommend anyone to work there."
good,"enjoyed the job, mgmt not so great. compensation is very poor and raises are an insult, (ie .23 cents after one yr.). They have constant turnover due to young staff and poor pay."
good,"while I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and working with sports and equipment I had interest in, the management was intrusive and gave me little time that I was secure in making plans for activities outside of work."
good,"Ok place to work, they are sorta flexible with schedules. However, if you are not one of the store managers favorites you are screwed. If you are a favorite you can do whatever and get away with it, like permanently injuring another employee and nothing happens to that person. Good enough part time job but thats it."
good,"The job is a job, people there are all about drama, hours normally get cut on a daily due to that there’s not coverage for departments. Managers are alright if they're having a good day. The pay is repulsive, and they don’t take care of the employees who have dedicated years to the company. Biweekly pay isn’t ideal especially for the location. Overall it’s not the best place, but if you need a job, it’s a job. They’ll hire you."
good,The company it self is great. The management is the problem. Their not convenient when it come to scheduling. Only if your full time you get to have a set schedule which is so unfair.
good,"The only way you're respected and get any type of job advancement or recognition is if you suck up to the managers. Stroke their ego make them and the store money and you might get a bonus candy bar. However, they are flexible with scheduling but that doesn't mean you will always be put on the schedule."
good,The employees I worked with made the job fun and enjoyable but not very many hours were given and at times shifts were cancelled. training in different departments are available
good,"I loved working here, but only one manager can answer scheduling questions, and she's never in store. I was working 6 days a week when I started, and over time it decreased to 1 day a week, and then 3 consecutive weeks off the schedule. "
good,It's a good job for summers but the hours can suck and management is poor. Pay is good. The knowledge you're expected  to know of every department is too much to put on someone who is looking for an easy summer job
good,"A typical work day has you sweating all day because of all the tasks upper management gives you. They are not hard, just physically exhausting. The management is poor and do not really care if you get hurt on the job. The culture is toxic. People, especially management, guilt trip you from taking too long of a vacation and forget you even requested off even it is months prior to the date. I had to train myself, but have learned from the solely from the training videos how to sell product better. This is a job that I wouldn't recommend, unless your active and are flexible with your time."
good,Worked all over the store and can tell you working register or apparel are the worst. Store had poor management when I was there. Wouldn't schedule me on days I coached Little League Baseball instead of switching my shift to morning. Got into a verbal altercation with new manager who was all sexually harassing female employees. Neither of us faced discipline but that was final nail in coffin for me. Play sports year round in football yet wouldn't have any football gear in Spring. Idiotic model.
good,"They don't care much for their employees and will go through as many as they choose. All that matters for this company is making sure their management is doing what they need and customers are happy. However many part time and even full time employees get thrown under the bus. They have a 8 point attendance system. However, working over time, being called off on your days off and being asked to stay late don't take points away. So one can work 45 hours a week and still gain all their points and get fired in the same week."
good,"Starting at Dick;s Sporting Goods was really great at the beginning, new experiences, new people, everything was great! Right after the grad opening stuff started shifting a bit. Overall I learned good marketing skills, days were not really busy, was not too bad."
good,The managers treated staff poorly and did not care about their job just bossing lower people around. The name of the store is the name of the people that work there
good,"Slow, and part time. Almost never full time. No room for advancement. Managemet was lazy. You feel alone, until you do soemthing wrong. Never praised for good things"
good,Upper management is out of touch and does not have good communication skills. Often times you are expected to work an entire department by yourself while getting freight out at the same time. Overall it is not the worst place I have ever worked but not my idea of a fun workplace.
good,The management was very threatening and had little consideration for its employees. I am a college student and we would routinely stay up until 1 am to close the store because our manager was very meticulous about things.
good,"Terrible management, not enough hours, rude team members, didn't make work fun, terrible CEO didn't speak to workers when they came in for store reviews, store mangers are terrible."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Second Summary for this company. Need to train new employees much better.
good,This job is really all about business no play at all. There are some cool managers but majority of them are all business no play. They do strive for customer satisfaction at any cost.
good,Show up before the store opens to do gun count. Sell products. Count guns. Clean and leave.
good,At Dick's Sporting Goods I unloaded pallets with a pallet jack from trucks in the early morning then broke down the boxes/merchandise to have it ready for the store. I also worked on the floor as a sales associate in men's clothing. The job was easy enough but the hours were hard to come by and the salary was less than what I am use to making.
good,"Great place to work with friendly down to earth people, but very few people at each position leaving little room for flexibility. Schedules don't change and doesn't allow for unavoidable conflicts in life."
good,"fast paces, short hours, lots of fun. Working here i a very challenging and enlightening. The benefits are good and the employees are friendly. Managment."
good,Very dramatic work environment due to certain people who constantly have to argue and start problems and management doesn’t know how to handle the situation.
good,"I worked for Dick's Sporting Goods for less than 6 Months when I was promoted to a supervisor position. The position is great for a person that does not have children and can work any shift."
good,Management held each associates at a different standard even when the associates were doing the same job and worked same pay and hours. Approval of vacations was nice. Depending on which you worked with was enjoyable to be there.
good,"Working at dicks is fun sometimes, when the managers are in a good mood. If the managers are in bad moods, everyone in the store is in a good mood. They tell you that you have the opportunity to become full time, but it's a lie."
good,I would suggest this job for anyone in high school or college. It is not a place to waste your life as a career. The management does not help in training and the pay is not worth it
good,Poor store management...not flexible...not competive wages. The store manager is in over their head and the store is very low in staff.  I wouldn’t reccomend.
good,"Wish the pay was higher, more room for advancement .  The weekends are best to work because it’s busier.  Customers are the best part of the job .  It’s good that DICK’s carries more high end merchandise that other sports stores don’t carry.  Co-workers were awesome"
good,"The managers expected you to do duties outside of the intended workplace such as look for trash under display bins, zip tie the display floor boards, stack yeti cups on a shelf with a 12 foot ladder and count other departments' inventory. I was forced to find something to do even when there was no one in my department."
good,lack of hours always and lack of store manager. They give you training but have unsaid expectations and communicate poorly to both department leads and part time associates
good,"No grace period, so if you clock in even 1 minute late it will count negative towards your record."
good,Co workers were rock stars.  Not crazy about much else.  Salary not equal across board.  New people come in making more than people who have been there much longer.  Hours not consistent.  I was hurt on job and cleared to go back to work by doctor but my hours went from 35 hours a week to 10 - 15 a week.
good,"I was a cashier along with working in the footwear and apparel department on occasions. The job was very faced paced no matter what department you were working in. The people I worked with were great and made the job fun. The only thing I didn't like was there were no guarantee of hours each week - some weeks you were working 10 hours and the next 40. They never give anyone overtime and do not give anyone full time hours constantly. The management was very rude and inconsiderate of your time and feelings. They do not always approve your requested time off and will overwork you. If you want to deal with rude customers, difficult management, and an extremely low salary - this job is for you."
good,"I worked at Dicks Sporting goods as a seasonal worker. It was a pretty slow paced job. It would be a good first step into retail for anyone looking. The management team is pretty laid back, easier to work for."
good,management shows a lot of favoritism and does not offer many raises where raises are deserved. often times you will see the company take more care of the customers than the employees.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Dicks offers many opportunities for achievement yet can still manage to make their employees feel undervalued at the same time. Although the pay can be nice along with the full time benefits, the job security is something to fear."
good,I loved the people I worked with and it was a blast working with certain people. but management was below average and the store manager worked less hours than me on any given day and would rarely be in the building.
good,"The favoritism is incredibly blatant, and the workplace is overall extremely toxic. Hours are incredibly restricting, the hourly budget provided leaves the store often understaffed relative to traffic and/or coverage needs. Being a part time associate, I've personally had weeks with 42 hours and weeks with 10 or less, and I've found myself being treated terribly for what my position is. Management regularly took advantage of my needs to force me into roles which I was uncomfortable or unable to fill under the guise of ""well you said you needed hours, so I gave you hours""."
good,When I began working at Dick's Sporting Goods the hours were great so I was getting my moneys worth for the work I was putting in. Now I barely receive any hours and I don't make enough money to live off of. Also if the managers start falling out of favor with you they treat you poorly and stop trying to help you receive more hours or better pay.
good,Not the place to work if you’re looking for reasonable management who care about their employees and their business. Lack of career advancement or benefits
good,"As a cashier, I was mistreated and over worked. The managers gave into customers no matter what and treated their employees like peasants. The merchandise is good, though."
good,"It was a cool relaxed place to work but there’s so much favoritism, lack of recognition, people who have worked there a while pawn they’re work off on everyone else, people disappear from the sales floor and end up in the office chilling. Asst SM is busy giving the pretty people opportunities for more hours while I’ve worked my tail off and am begging for even an extra hour or two"
good,"Working at Dicks Sporting Goods was very fun at first. I enjoyed the work environment and really enjoy working with my true passion, Golf, but after several months at Dicks they began to move me all around the store. This made me cross trained in every department which provided me with more hours, however due to so many callouts I was always doing something other than what is written in the Golf Associate job description."
good,"Dick’s is an awesome company, but it’s hard on employees. The expectations are extremely high for part-time employees. Managers expected far too much d"
good,"In the begging, I thought this company was alright, however, I quickly caught on to the workplace culture of this company.  No one wants to show you it, management will constantly blame you for everything (even when its not your fault!), and dude they demand so darn much from you without even showing the slightest form of gratitude!  I never in my life worked for a company where I saw over 300 people leave within 1 year alone!"
good,Will only hire on part-time basis.  No full-time positions outside of management for the first year.Will not work with you on scheduling.  If you can't work with the schedule then you are fired.
good,"It all depends on the manager. A good manager creates a great environment. A bad manager, creates, a not so fun environment, and it clearly shows with the employees."
good,Hours were irregular.  You could never plan on a schedule.  Management turnover was frequent.  Breaks and any pay increases were far and few between.  It could be very stressful
good,Or at least the South Loop location. There is so much theft that happens there. The management  at that is poor.  The store was consistently under staffed. And the turn over rate. was ridiculous. Glad I longer work there
good,dicks is a tricky place. some stores have great managers and some have intolerable idiots working for them. dicks sporting goods uses managers as disposable commodities and often that can be reflected in attitudes towards work and other associates.
good,"It was an okay place to work at, Just make sure whenever you are assigned a job, make sure you have that job done, complete and correct. It's not hard work it's just time consuming and it's a lot."
good,"The job is slow paced where I worked, employees are lazy, mainly cause managers are way to lax. But if you do your job and actually like sports you'll love it. You learn a lot about sport gear and accessories, camping and hunting as swell; anything outdoor. The pay minimum wage and benefits suck for employees, all they offered me was a 401k. No insurance or anything else, unless I missed it on the mail. The discounts are ok but not great; 25% on most aperal and 5-10% on other items. Paid 15 min breaks if you work less than 6 hours, 6 hours or more is 30 mins unpaid and if you work more than 8 hours you get a paid 15 and unpaid 30."
good,"Within the year I have worked there; 3 managers, 5 team leads, and 12 associates have quit due to management. One in particular.  "
good,"Would work anywhere between four to six hours, would cash people out when they finished shopping and when there were no customers, I would clean, wipe down counters, etc"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Management and corporate are not really in tune with grasping talent and using it, instead the more you know the more they do not want you involved. Promotions operate on the 'good-ol-boy' system and age/gender. If you have worked for the K-Mart or Sears Corporations you pretty much have a shoe in. "
good,Dicks was a good job for me while attending college.They were willing to work around my class schedule and would give me extra days off if I requested ahead of time.
good,"Although this can be a great place to work, the company is not very efficient with payroll limits.  The company district does not stay within the payroll allotment which then creates cuts in hours allowed to work. This creates a hardship on employees who count on the income to provide for their families.  "
good,"Bad hours, empty promises, managers are a bunch of corporate monkeys listening to the big cheeses. Big inefficiencies which i could fix if someone would pay me the money. I used it as my part time job so I can make some money while going back to get my masters in Marketing! If anyone is reading this. If there is anyone that is in charge of reading these in depth and gets this far down the page, or your a person who is a decision maker for the hiring process I ask you to consider my resume. It's tough out there. Just trying to get ahead in the world. Just hoping this message reaches someone. My message in a bottle. May you drift off and send help........ GOOD BYE! lol"
good,Just needs a lot maintenance. A great environment when we all work together! Customers are great and you can learn a lot from them. Employees are not scared to teach you new things.
good,"Co-workers are great, the managing staff not so much. they also don't work with scheduling around school.The hardest part is getting up in the morning during the holidays."
good,"When I first started I had very little cashier experience, I couldn't even really do a basic return. They gave me a half hour training session with somebody who really didn't know much about cashiering either. I was frustrated every time I came into work for a solid two months. Nobody was giving me the training I needed and they immediately promoted me to cashier manager. I had to figure out most of the things I know by myself. Ive been a cashier manager for about 9 months now and I just about have everything down. I am the one training new cashiers now and I try my best at giving them the skills they need because I know my managers are NOT going to give them the training they need. Other then that there was a lot of drama and petty things happening in the work place and the managers again did nothing about it. I had to learn to not get involved with everybody's work drama and stick to the first priority when you come to work and thats CUSTOMER SERVICE. That was my favorite part of my job, seeing somebody's face light up when you go above and beyond for that person. That to me is what makes a job a good job; your attitude is what is going to define your working career."
good,"A typical day of work involved a lot of customer service and restocking of aisles. The things that I learned while working at Dick's Sporting Goods was how to not run a business. My coworkers and I were not bad employees by any means, the plan from start to finish wasn't always the best. There were many times when I wasn't able to focus on customer service because of the workload that was left for me to do."
good,This is a slow job and management was not as organized as they could be.  Employees are not told when they are working and not allowed to give any input into how things should work.
good,"AS this job was part time while I was a student, I was relying on a little bit better communication between myself and the management to make work and school work together and they were not supportive of that."
good,"I have worked for Dicks Sporting Goods for over 5 years and at the same location. I went from a part time to full time with benefits and won't complain about the benefits because they are actually pretty good. However, been through several store managers and the most recent/ current manager is terrible and makes working for the company miserable and not wanting to work there anymore."
good,"At first, you will love this job. Then you will find out that your management team is less than stellar. There is only one good manager there and he is thinking about leaving. "
good,I was in charge of cashiers and their performances. I counted their tills at end of their shift and counted safe at end of night.
good,"LACK OF TRAINING, kinda thrown out to learn.  Then mistakes are made real quick to write up.  Always cutting hours and never have enough staff on hand to cover areas. Puts one cashier out during busy holiday and wait times for customers are long.  Always giving daily task to do but,  Push the sales of customer service but never give enough payroll to cover or to be available for customers. Task are never completed or half done. Some have a lot different task which takes away from customers.  One person will have to cover multiple areas some they wont even have knowledge in. Puts way too much money into managers traveling, and training and not enough in for the employees that really run the store,  The ones on the floor expected to sale and do."
good,The guys I worked with at this job where cool. We got work done. We all put in 100 percent
good,"coworkers were awesome but management wasn't organized. They seemed to be bothered by simple things and would get annoyed very easily by customers. They would not take responsibility and are more likely to throw another employee under the bus than take responsibility, They would only concentrate on SCORE cards and credit cards and would sacrifice quality customer service if they weren't interested in either program offered. The company is too big to care about their employees so as long as they were making money they were satisfied even though they majority of the employees and some customers were unsatisfied about the way the store was being ran."
good,I was simply amazed by the turnover rate. I almost worked there 1 year an it was not a good experience. The departments were always well under staffed and hard work would never go noticed.
good,hardest thing about the job is closing at night. co workers are cool will always help you with any problem if not busy. best part about the day is leaving at the end of my shift
good,I was abe to cross train in all areas and assist customers. Management was aways changing and not a source of job security.
good,I enjoyed working there because I enjoy footwear but the hours were to inconsistent and up and down.  They didn't really schedule footwear properly so sometimes id be doing a lot by myself.  Other associates would not work there job properly so I ended up doing extra.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,you must be on top of your own training and teach yourself day in and out  Take notes  and be ready to give up some personal time! There seems to be more lateral movement then there is room to move upwards !
good,The job has flexible hours but the store I was at has horrible management. However I did get to move up in the company easily which was a plus because it was available.
good,"Working for DSG is a challenging and stressful environment. Every manager handles things differently. Metrics goals are pushed upon employees almost everyday. High metrics means high bonuses for management with only high 5 gift cards as an incentive. Pay is probably average for any retail establishment. Being a lead does mean an expectation of more work duties. Understaffing seems to be a common thing for all stores. Keeping payroll low puts bonus’s again in district managements and aboves pockets. Working as an FFL is stressful. Pay for the hard labor isn’t always worth, but it’s a job right? The distribution centers ( Conklin & Smithton) are aweful. Can it ever load a truck properly or safely for associates. We have a truck unload and time process that must be achieved. Bottom line look elsewhere."
good,With every job there will be goof things and bad things. For myself there were more bad then good. The work culture is toxic. high turn over rates and very unsupportive management.
good,"All the people i worked with in not just my store but other stores around the state were really good people. The managers above the store level would change the store's ""Top Priority"" Every few hours and started to get the feeling of a fire drill mentality rather than a thought out plan."
good,"1. Sales Leads can't sell"
good,This company is good for a part time job if you are only needing the money for fun stuff. They do not guarantee hours and have a high employee turnover.
good,"management was very strict and not very willing to cooperate with employees, the company always put sales before the employees and would put unrealistic standards on the employees"
good,"Dick's is a great company to work for. Be ready for long hours and nights and weekends, but that is retail. The culture is competitive makes it fun for athletes to join the team. Upper management has a bad reputation among store team up to and including Store managers and district managers. (everybody thinks they know how it should be run) Pay is lower than most retail but you get to work at dicks so much different than working at target or walmart. not exactly fun to sell toilet paper."
good,Upper management has no idea of what a day in the store feels like.  They are getting away from customer service and becoming Kmart all over again.  Don't have a personal life outside work and want to enjoy it.
good,Assisting customers. Merchandise stocking and re-setting.  Most employees must be cash register trained.  Managers increasingly disinterested in working with employees to improve working relationaships in a professional manner.
good,"A typical day of work means a lot of work.  Being in apparel you are typically short staffed and there's rarely communication. You are in charge of two floors and are given 4 seconds to rush to the desired fitting room that are all spread out in different areas to get to your customers before you are yelled at or told something. You have a lot of freight and stock, no one tells you what to do, even working the first few days and simply get angry if you don't guess on what to do. You have to learn everything on your own with no guidance. It may be different in other locations but my location did not seem to like helping or giving guidance on what to do. Most associates were not nice and my location were not friendly. Scheduling was a disaster, associates only wanted customers out the door. Management did not want anything to deal with their employees but luckily I had a great apparel manager, we also had an apparel team leader but she did not like dealing with newbies."
good,"Not a terrible place to start your working career.  Retail isn't for everyone.  Mostly younger people working there, besides management, so you can't expect too much."
good,"I was hired to be a seasonal worker at a sales associate level. I was given part time hours. I was trained to be a basic level sales associate that walked around and helped customers. that was fine. "
good,"Its a good starter job to get some retail experience and some money. Only that though, if you are thinking of becoming a manager or move in the company from within you better cut that fantasy out. Dicks hire outside of the company for management mostly and the some cases where you do get a higher position from inside; you hade to wait 5 years just to do that. Plus they pay their associates pretty poorly and the benefits aren't enough to stay long. This company is only for beginner experience, not a lasting career."
good,"The team at Dick's tends to be pretty good, there are a few bad apples. The problem was that there was no real way to advance or to be used based on your skill set, they just put you where they needed warm bodies."
good,Solid company but very robotic. Operations are measured that are really of no value to the store or customer. Lots of pencil whipped documents and clipboard programs. Binders for everything. Most are not important and serve no purpose.
good,"the hours are not good if your a full time employee, even worse if your part time. usually 32-37.5 for full time and 4-12 for part time"
good,I mainly worked the truck which wasn't awful in itself but having to be at work at 4am is not ideal. You are then timed to unbox and get everything floor ready but you're not given enough support to actually meet these goals. I was never trained to work on the floor but I still had many shift there.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I would not recommend Dicks Sporting Goods in Nashua NH to anyone! They expect their employees to do more than they are willing to do themselves, they randomly change your schedule and penalize you if you do not comply."
good,"It's not really much room for advancement or raises. It is a good atmosphere if you like sports. Just looking around the store is filled with energy. I honestly think the experience depends on the leader of the store. Sadly mine only cared about increasing our sales percentage, and not the team he had behind him."
good,"Management is all over the place, one manager will tell you do something then 10 minutes a different one will come along and tell you to stop and work on something else. Management rarely listens to your concerns or requests. I requested off a month in advance for a vacation, and the request was never approved or denied (they never looked at it even after I talked to my manager about it). Be prepared to work on a project all day then come in the next and your project be undone because ""you did it wrong"". Coworkers and customers are the only fun part about the job."
good,"Very easy job, very bad management skills.  The customers are great, but the managers do not know how to manage schedules efficiently and are very bad with communication skills."
good,"There are a lot of full time associates or leads that are always looking for the opportunity to advance in the company. However, majority of the time they are overlooked by upper level management. Dick's needs to work on hiring more within the company, not bringing un-experienced people in from outside companies specifically Walmart. It is a fun work environment, depending on the season. Easy job for the low pay."
good,"This job to me was great for building my resume but I was very disappointed with how the managers handled certain situations. Also, salary and job advancements didn't happen very often. Annual raises were about 10 to 20 cents tacked on to your current pay. The jobs we did there deserved a higher pay than what we received."
good,My over all review was ok. I started before they opened so I helped to set up the store and then left right around the holiday time. I met some great people there and some not so great.
good,"needs better closing staff, more management at night and deligating task during day to take pressure off closing shift. better pay needed for the tasks given during day."
good,"Its a fun environment to work in. I have great regular customers. A majority of colleagues that I love and adore, however favoritism reeks its ugly head from time to time. The young employees can whine their way into making drama happen the workplace. Makes it hard for me who is in her 30's not to rip them to pieces. Sometimes my experience can overpower their egos."
good,"I’ve worked in many retail companies. I left this one because the manager was rude to me, talked about bad about me to my coworkers, and refused to cooperate with the schedule I gave him. If it wasn’t for him and the scheduling conflict I could have stayed with the company."
good,"Just a normal department store job with ok management and working conditions. I worked on the second floor and didn't have many customer come my way, but it was relaxing just building bikes."
good,"Low pay, bad managers, long hours, difficult work, micro-management at every turn, not enough time given to complete certain tasks, huge push on credit cards with very little compensation rewarded, very little promotion from within, basically hard to get ahead with the company. I had 25+ years experience prior to going there and never got a shot at management for whatever reason. Co-workers and managers all agreed that I'd be good at it but the district managers, who are basically idiots, wouldn't give me a shot. I gave it almost 4 years and finally moved on, probably for the best."
good,"I worked behind the gun counter, and honestly that is the only reason I was able to put up with working there so long. The managers had sticks up their bums, and the other employees were.... rude. The job itself was great, but the people there working along side you made it horrible. In the year I worked there, they were going to give me a 17 cent raise, and in my review I performed better than expected. Apparently, you have to work there, part time, low pay, for 3 years, or until somebody quits, to get a higher position. Most of the full time employees had been working there since the store opened. Good luck advancing. Management ignores vandalism, unless you are a good employee, then they blame you for everybody else's mess."
good,"Working in retail is no easy task. Unfortunately, I experienced plenty of negative days at Dick's. The managers were overworked. All of the head district managers get paid so much to do less than associates. Dick's needs to value its employees more and compensate them for it. I wish the large corporation was more put together because it is a great place to shop!"
good,"I was a seasonal cashier my job duties included, tending various transactions, processing returns selling ammunition in the outdoor department, register and store cleanup and assisting on the sales floor when asked to do so or short handed."
good,I applied here because I was looking for more work experience. The atmosphere was busy and I spent my day interacting with customers and various people. The management was generally good although slightly disorganized.
good,"Typically, there is a dark cloud hanging over the store when the store manager is in. Stress is in the air. The condescending remarks, the talking-down to associates, the constant pressure and negative attitude doesn't make the associates want to work harder. The associates, other leads, and assistant managers, however, are much more fun to work with. Overall, the atmosphere in the store is positive, except for when the store manager is in. This is not to say that the assistant managers and other leads are lax when working, but it seems we (as other managers) have a different outlook on things and try to make the day more positive and fun while still achieving our goals."
good,The company is so backwards!!!!! And so behind time! Academy is wayyyyy better! Management and their supervisors make all the money and don't care about the ones that are actually dealing with the customers and providing customer service
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Friendly workers and good managers. Everyone was very nice and helpful. As requested a day off for schooling I was granted it. Time consuming and are always stocking shelves.
good,There is a fun environment here everyone is pretty much friends but there is a lack of good management here. You have to beg and plead and basically break arms to be able to have your basic needs heard in this place.
good,Management needed to be more involved and concerned with team to achieve better time constraints and financial goals.  Management allowed unprofessional practices between managers and employees.
good,Not to bad a place. management  an be the big problem they're all looking to promote and don't care who they throw under the bus to do it. your co-workers are mostly college or high school age which can be pleasant but also it makes scheduling a bit of a problem.
good,"I worked there as a seasonal employee, and had a good set of hours at first, but towards the end of the assignment there was a large decrease in the hours I worked because they began to hire so many new people, also pay was low. But everyone there was friendly and was open to helping me when needed."
good,"If you're looking to stand around and not do much all day, this is the job for you. As a cashier I would pretty much wait for customers to come to the door and greet them. Not much to do as far as moving up in the company."
good,Just your typical sporting goods store with not enough staff to accomplish daily workload. No organization when it comes to the employees due to the nature of short staff. No flexibility when referring to a transfer in the same city or state if that. Some departments have it way more easier than other and the supervisors never let you go when you have completed your schedule hours.
good,"Working for dicks sporting goods was fun. We had many different products and was able to satisfy each individual with what they wanted. I couldn't stay there because it was seasonal. If the job wasn't seasonal, i wouldn't have stayed because of the hectic work schedule as well. I had no time for school and i fell behind. I decided that my school work was more important than being a cashier and if i wanted to better myself, i had to pick one or the other. The staff and management was nice as well. Everyone got along."
good,I enjoy the position very much.It is fun and a challenge each and every day. I have learned much about business and the corporate world.
good,"Fun work place fast paced low pay and no room for advancement, it was a good job as i went to school to fruther education. I learned how to deal with customers help thier needs, my co workers were friendly the hardest part was standing all day."
good,The people are outstanding but the work load wasn't worth the pay or lack of hours.  it wasn't a lot of room for advancement short term.
good,"If you have no life, you should work here. Some managers are good, but most managers aren't understanding if you have to miss work for personal reasons, emergencies, etc."
good,Each day is pretty much the same and can get boring. I didn't learn much because its pretty much a straight-forward job. The management plays favorites. The best part of the job is the co-workers.
good,All you get is minimum wage. Very hard for advancement. Great fir college kids during breaks or working part time while taking classes. Discount could be better.
good,The store managers would treat employees as lesser individuals or that they did not matter. A typical day at work would be I would show up after going to school. Then I would start my shift and try to help the customers that are in my area and will continue till the store closes.
good,"Dicks is a fun place to work only because your working with people of the same age (high school/college). Over all the company and management is only concerned with how they look on paper. Poor opportunities for advancement, and non-competitive pay. They are good with working around a college schedule, but keep in mind they will not think twice about keeping you there till midnight before an exam. Worked as the Bike tech and Certified Fitness Trainer but was forced along with other people to clean restrooms. So your job description is basically as good as toilet paper. There is also a lack of appreciation, ex. someone called in sick so I stayed 7 hours pass the end of my shift, came in literally 3 minutes late the next day and was written up.  Not a bad college job though, I would not recommend making Dick's Sporting Goods a career choice though."
good,The job requires a lot of walking around and dealing with customers. The people that work there are mostly nice at times. The management will work with your schedule if you are in school. Its a high paced place to work
good,It's great to learn new positions and advance my skills. More of a stepping stone than a career path. Was able to get to know myself more as a person from this job. Management was not always supportive and turn over rate was high.
good,"A typical day at work is spent processing order for schools, leagues or other organizations.  Lots of following up on cost of goods, shipping confirmations, and paperwork.  Coworkers are friendly people that will go out of their way to help each one another and customers."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Since I played baseball in college and a few years professionally, I worked in the Team Sports department of Dick's Sporting Goods.  I was able to provide answers to most any question customers had and provide them with excellent service as to what they needed on the particular day.  Before we closed the store each night, I would take an exact inventory of items in my department and make sure all products and items were in the correct location and in the eye of customers walking in the door the next morning."
good,"A typical day on the job consists of assisting customers wherever and however I can throughout the store. whether it be as a cashier, or just personal assistance on the performance floor. working here I learned that assisting customers wherever and however I can even when I don't know much about a product, is needed to help a store function properly. Management at Dicks is unfortunately not organized and depends on the employees for majority of situations. The teamwork at Dicks as far as, working together to get our job done and keeping customers happy is very well. My coworkers and I had a great work relationship and never had any negative encounters. The hardest part of working at this establishment was not having a consistent schedule, and not getting any breaks when working 6+ hour shifts. The most enjoyable part of working at this establishment was interacting with and helping customers."
good,"I had been with this company for a few years, and at start it was enjoyable, but when I transferred stores it became less enjoyable."
good,Though I only worked at DSG for short time I was able to learn several skills that would propel my advancement in my current position. The conflict resolution and customer engagement skill have allowed me to work more efficiently.
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods, much like Academy Sports, is a great place to gain retail and sales experience. The constant contact with the general public makes grooming social skills a breeze. However, most Dick's Sporting Goods hire the bare minimum. Often an employee will be asked to work multiple departments, despite very limited experience in them. Even during the holidays, which everyone who's worked retail knows are the most difficult part of retail, Dicks often was short on staff. Although that issue tends to be linked to available payroll, the employee doesn't get compensated more for being forced to work twice of what was originally asked of them. Indeed, Dicks doesn't match up well with Academy's atmosphere, I would still recommend working there for the sales and public service experience."
good,"I worked at the east towne mall dicks and I hated it, standing at the slowest register for months on months not being rotated to faster registers was dreadful. I had a couple opportunities to move up to footwear or apparel but my boss told them no without confronting me. I would have rather been moved up. One of the managers there is incredibly rude. No one gets treated fairly there, it's all about favorites like noones allowed to use your cell phone unless your a lead or at customer service.. No no one should be using personal phones on the job anyways."
good,"I am usually at the store in the morning  doing tasks that must be done before store open.  Tasks include ensuring cash office accuracy, firearm audits, coming up with projects for opening employees, and processing ship from store orders that must be sent out in the afternoon.  We receive a truck about two days a week, so on those days I focus on freight flow and making sure product is merchandised and priced within 24 hours.  As a key-carrying lead, I am able to open and close the store if a manager cannot.  Therefore, I have learned and performed many tasks that managers are asked to do when I am leading the store on my own."
good,"It's retail. What do you expect from it? It pays low, there are no hours available, and they are not very fun."
good,This is a good place to work if you need flexible hours and attend college . They work with you and give you time off if needed .
good,The employees at Dicks Sporting Goods are great. Its the hours and pay that are not fulfilling my needs.
good,"I only worked at dicks for a couple of months, because it was the offseason for the golf course. My responsibilities included helping customers with their demands and also keeping my workstation looking clean and presentable. The store was pretty big so I only got the chance to meet a couple of my coworkers who turned out to be friendly people. The hardest part of my job was to assist every single customer when I was the only employee in my department during a busy day. The most enjoyable part was to successfully help out a customer."
good,"overall good place to work, good learning environment, turnover rate very high, cant keep good employees because they don't treat you the best!"
good,I worked there for a while as a contractor only to be tossed out because I didn't suck up enough.  I trained multiple people and was very good at what I did.  I had applied to become permanent several times only to be rejected.  Management is corrupt.
good,"A typical day at work involves me going in to a manager always in a bad mood for some reason. It was either we didn't get enough surveys or enough scorecards or credit cards. I learned that a ""good job"" actually does boost your moral in a job because we rarely got them. When it comes to management, it was positive and negative. They want you to think that Dick's Sporting Goods is your life and you shouldn't do anything else but work. If you were to take a day off two months in advance, you would still seem to make it on the schedule that day and then they would try and convince you to come in. The best part about the job was the co-workers and the dress code. Don't expect consistent hours if you are PT though cause you could get 35 one week then 15 the next. They also try and take your breaks away which somehow they succeed at because you're supposed to get two 10 minute paid breaks if you work four or more hours but somehow you seem to get no break unless you work over six hours to get an UNPAID break."
good,Young and fast growing company that requires high energy and the ability to multi-task. As a manager you must drive sales while also improving the level of customer service in the building.
good,"Overall just ok. Managers are not willing to help associates. Show favoritism too much, and never on the floor. Don't motivate and work with associates enough to help the weaker areas of the store. Feel like I am being over looked and not appreciated for what I put in."
good,"management and workers tend to stick in cliques, management doesn't tend to care about customer service. Store operations run well. Good entry level job."
good,"Really easy money but managers do a really bad job at managing and making sure everyone is on task and working. They don't take the time to work individually with you so that you can move up or get a pay raise, and if they do its because they favor you. I worked a lot in operations behind the scenes to get everything done and never ONCE did i get recognition or a position raise, but people who do half the work you do get pay raises and appraisal. its very backwards"
good,an ok experience at Dicks Sporting Goods. I would have stayed longer if management kept their word and had me doing the job I was hired for. Management was very unorganized.
good,"Dick's was good, however there were some management issues. the pay was good, and there was only one 30 minute break no matter how long you worked, whether it be an 8,9,10, or 12 hour shift."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,It was a very cool first job (legally). Some weeks were better than others and I felt undervalued A LOT. I don’t ever see myself working for a company like this ever again.
good,Dicks Sporting Goods wasn’t a bad job I just had to come back home for the Summer after school was out. Other than Maintaining my school work and working it wasn’t that hard of a task at all.
good,"The management had changed on a monthly basis. Managers from other stores had moved to our store, managers at other stores were fired or quit. Many employees left after less than a month."
good,I wouldn't recommend working at Dick Sporting Goods to someone with experience under their belt but for someone who is looking to gain experience it isn't that bad. I love most of the people I work with but how things at the company are ran I often disagree with.
good,"This specific store is pretty toxic, in terms of the workers there. Very ""clique-y"" and everyone will talk bad about you behind your back. Not a lot of respect from management."
good,"busy, fast or slow paced, boring atomosphere, dirty-needed deep cleaning from outside company, co workers were young and distracted, not super considerate of customers, not the best of customers, hardest part of the job was hitting the sales/credit card sign up quota"
good,"This has been my favorite place of employment yet. "
good,"An great job for those who want to stay at entry levels, as it is a favoritism game for moving up in the company. Offers many great benefits. Is a great place to work for for the most part, unless you have a goal to achieve more."
good,"Expect to get in trouble for using the restroom, and NEVER leave the gun counter. You will get in so much trouble. Also, if you work in lodge, never question why the flag isn't there. Starting in 2019 they terminated all of that to make everything equal. I questioned my boss once about that and said it was wrong. Got a schedule change and my hours cut in half."
good,DSG was great at first but then I soon realized the managers were super unorganized and very biased. Don't expect a raise until your 15th month their.
good,Fast paces work environment. Quick job placement through temp agencies to fill vacancies. Weekly pay; ideal for extra income or anyone seeking quick employment.
good,"Working as a customer service specialist for the front end, you start to feel like a drone doing the same things over and over again. Working here has definitely allowed me to develop my customer service skills, but by no means is this establishment somewhere I could stay for more than a year. Management, at least at my store, was fairly flexible when it came to schedules, which was a definite bonus."
good,"As a manager, you work 50+ hours a week.  I was never properly trained in my position but got plenty of support from my store manager. It's an Ok place to work."
good,have poor management and are horrible with comunication. i love helping the customers but you feel a bad environment and unsafe when getting things in the back because they cant get people to fix ladders or they just dont care
good,The job could have paid better also advancement isn't really a thing here. Th people that i worked with should not have the positions that they do. They are under qualified.
good,The only good thing about this job as opposed to other retail jobs is that the employee discount makes the job worth working. I think that the management in the company is decent at best. The store manager is very poor and making schedules and continues to hire new employees when there is not enough hours for current employees.
good,Ok if you want a typical retail boring job. They don't seem to really care if the employees are happy. Not too sure overall but the one i worked at there was no room to grow.
good,"footwear is a fun department, I love the people that work in that department. we have to help customers or work in the back stock. management is not the best."
good,When hired as a seasonal employee I was told that I would keep my job after the seasonal period. I was let go on New Year's Eve by my manager on the floor with no reason for being let go and was required to finish my shift as well as go over for a girl who called in late.
good,"In my experience at least, I felt very left out. My manager made me feel dumb all the time. Hours were cut. One manager was rude, unless she liked you & I got the impression she did not."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"It was part time. It had some perks depending on management , and your schedule flexibility. They pay was higher than minimum wage and raises were given yearly based on performance."
good,I enjoyed Dick's but the only full time positions available were for the department leads. If those were all filled there would no opportunity for advancement.
good,Over all the experience is good except for the store manger’s attitude. He is very degrading towards everyone and doesn’t offer any career development in his store. He is the reason I’m looking for a new job.
good,"Great people at store level, senior leadership only has one customer they are truly concerned with and that is Wall Street.  Dick's Sporting Goods is a successful company despite its Senior Leadership in particular their CEO."
good,"Dick sporting goods is boring job plus the management wasn’t the best either , showed favoritism to the employees whom they like , no equal opportunity that store"
good,"A typical day at work was organizing the clothing racks, make sure all the prices were up to date, make sure the sales were good, assist customers in finding what they needed. The hardest part of the job was the fitting rooms, there were so many fitting rooms that had to be kept clean at all times and it was hard when customers would just go in and leave everything."
good,must work on weekends. working night shift is the worst. pay is low. management is not always willing to work with you. lots of turn over in management.
good,This job was fun and would recommend for anyone looking to get sales or retail experience. The likelihood of you advancing in the company is very low.
good,"Disorganized, High Expectations LOW PAY. Even if you work well and are dependable there is little chance of promotion. could be a fun job if you're lucky enough to find good managment"
good,"Your fellow employees are cool and taking phone calls is easy, but the management doesn't listen to your problems and will refuse to do anything about it."
good,"Manage people, converse with customer, MES, customer service overrides, merchandising, sales, advice directives, computer work, mobile devices, remote area printing, audits, security checks and a variety of other duties."
good,"I started out as just an Associate of the Front End (registers). Within 6-8 months I'd gotten a promotion to Customer Service Specialist (CSS) which came with a raise and added responsibility of counting the tills and the safe. The management is very iffy to say the least, you never know when they'll be in a good mood. Working retail in Florence is never fun, but management pushes credit cards and protection plans down your throat making your day almost unbearable."
good,worked part time while going to school. was an aircraft mechanic in the military but everyone is viewed as being incompetent by management and above. Very upsetting being treated with such demeanor.
good,"The workplace is great and i enjoy working with everyone that i work with, The most enjoyable part about working here is that i meet a lot of people that make me a better customer service specialists."
good,Greatful for the experience through out the years. The place was like my second home . I love make the employee feel like a home setting. And very good company with great benefits
good,"Very busy environment, constant activity on the sales floor. Overall not a bad job, but do not expect advancements or promotions. This company prefers to hire an excessive amount of associates, rather than to take the time to train and promote. No benefits either."
good,Retail sucks and with bad management it really sucks. But you're working at a sporting goods store so if you enjoy sports and the outdoors than it is a fun sales environment as you are able to educate your customers. The management expects you to perform at their level while you barely get paid above minimum wage.
good,"The company is WAY too operationally focused.  Too many merchandising changes when not necessary taking away from customer focus.  Some stores don't have the inventory levels needed to ensure customers are able to get what they came in for... in turn, building the eComm business even more."
good,"toxic work environment. some co-workers are cool, however, the management is terrible. Overall I wouldn't recommend working there for a long time. lot better jobs out there"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Sold Shoes for Dicks on the daily basis. I worked part time and it was not the greatest of hours. The management was supportive but the job was not very hard. We did not receive any compensation for our sales.
good,The most I have learned from working at Dick's Sporting Goods is how to merchandise products effectively and provide incentive for customers to make purchases.
good,"work part time, no benifits and never get payed for sick, vacation nor holidays, but make you work all the above. store mananger expects you to be like him, when only getting paid min wadge.always a line, but to short staffed."
good,"Before my current store manager got there I had a lot of fun working there. Everyone would get their work done, focus on customer service, the store was clean, we got along, and for the most part enjoyed working. When the new store manager got there everything went downhill. I have not met a person who so blatantly disregards how his employees feel, their needs and who knows so little about day to day occurrences. Corporate has also turned a blind eye to the little guy and they don't support nor condone his actions, choosing instead to stay out of it. But again, once he leaves, the store is a joy to work in, being able to help customers and get work done is a rewarding feeling. It is one of the few jobs where you can mess around while working and I had a lot of fun on days the manager was not working"
good,"I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods for over a year. I was hired as a Sales Associate and they quickly saw my potential. There was no store manager and The Assistant Managers lacked communication. Although they did work and knew how to manage. I liked working for Dick's because I was appreciated by my co workers and some managers. I feel the lack of communication put strain on the company by stressing out the managers, who then put there stress on the workers, which you could see in the stores condition, sales, customer response, and lack of work being done. I agree people shouldn't show stress at work but when it effects the whole store unfortunately its always going to show in many ways. That sadly happens in many companies. I will say that I did have a good manager who trusted me with various tasks. I was always building displays, merchandising, and completing transactions and orders for customers. I helped all over the store and I unloaded trucks Wednesday and Fridays making sure all the Apparel was properly set with security tags and put out on the sales floor. I left nothing in the back. I liked that they depended on me. I do feel that they should show appreciation to the hard workers. I found out since leaving there that there is not one manager or employee still in that store that was there when I was employed there."
good,"its an okay job, good discounts for employees, holiday discouts are good as well, good job security, best for high school and college students as a part time job, high turn over"
good,Typical day started of with a group meeting with your supervisor/leads. I had to constantly ask to get trained on equipment. its a controlled temperature environment
good,"I have worked there since the store opening last year and have been a faithful employee. The atmosphere is great but management is not too great. I have been asking for more hour because I have two children and myself to take care of and I only get 12-14 hours a week if I'm lucky! They will not cross train me in another area of the store which I've asked many times to be because I want to advance and know more parts of the store. They also will not give me more hours or move me to Full Time, but continue to hire new employees."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at Dick's Sporting Goods but I feel it is time for me to leave seeing as I do not have the proper pay or work hours to pay for my school right now. I am also trying to get out of retail at the moment, but overall it was a wonderful experience working here. You work with a close knit team of great people who are all there to help you and easy to get along with. We all share a love for sports and are passionate in the quality work we provide and the products we sell to customers. I would highly recommend this place as a first job."
good,"Management is horrible."
good,"Typical dysfunctional distribution center. Not horrible depending on your direct manager. Plenty of favoritism, which could be good if management likes you, but unfair to everyone else. Horrible location."
good,"Working here as a college student my manager was not very considerate. I was constantly scheduled on days i had classes. I had to turn in an availability sheet a total of 4 times. The manager took me as a joke because i was a college student and would laugh when i told him i had to attend class on days he would call me in. Also with all of the sports that are around today, its sometimes hard to differentiate the sports when some of the equipment and clothing is similar."
good,"Due to constant turnover from unsatisfactory management, there were often chaotic situations without proper Leadership to instruct associates when it was needed most. I'm not sure if this same situation applied to all locations."
good,Awesome environment with decent music and usually no stress from customers or business.  Unfortunately you're talked down to by management and it wouldn't be a surprise if you were being micromanaged in your day.
good,"The pay is low, raises are few, and the hours are revolving. It is a typical retail job. No fun and little respect. You gain very little in the way of professional development and pay will never reach a comfortable level."
good,What's that! You give everything you have and they take everything you have. Don't look to have a social life if you work for DSG! Do everything with the absolute least amount.
good,It's a good job if you are new to working. Anybody with children will probably need more money. It was hard to keep a roof over my head with 3 children and work a part time job that doesn't pay much.
good,The managers at this store have unrealistic expectations of their bicycle technicians. You are expected to provide customer service to two whole departments that are on opposite corners of the store while building bicycles in the back of the store. There are never enough people working as the manager gets to pocket whatever is left over from the payroll budget.
good,My experience working at the dicks one town over from me wasn't the greatest. Everyone is different. Management wasn't the best they more yelled at the associates and stayed in the office all day. They never really got know know the associates.
good,A typical day at work usually consists of taking care of customers. I work up front on register so that is basically my job the whole time I am there.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Was not a horrible place to work and the manager took a risk with me as I have had no previous sales work or retail service before this job. I thought that he was nice, but a lot of other people had an issued with him. They expect you to stay late sometimes and work more hours than you originally had for the week, but if they assign too many hours and don't have the money for it they'll cut your hours."
good,"Work environment is pleasant and love the culture, depending on what manager is there work can be stressful or it can be very nice, I have learned the process of inventory."
good,"My co-workers for the most part were very cool, but the management wasn't really good, especially when it came to schedules and leniency towards personal problems that interfere with a persons shift."
good,"less then 2 days notice on scheduling for following week"
good,"Our store manager at dsg Highland, IN (store 781) is very sexually suggestive and makes for uncomfortable one-on-one time with him. All of the other managers are great people. The staff has a close-knit, team enviroment and we often go out together after work. Lots of cross-training; almost everyone has to learn cash register in case we ever get backed up. Hours fluctuate depending on if we have enough payroll, making this job financially unreliable."
good,The Job is somewhat poorly managed. The bosses act more like peers rather than superiors. The opportunities for advancement are few if not non-existent. Employee turn-over is very high. In one year there over 15 new faces cycled through.
good,Working at Dicks wasn't so bad. Got a little hectic on the weekends. It was pretty big store so there was always something going on. It was honestly not a bad place to work. Good coworkers and managers.
good,Company is growing rapidly and outlasting other BM retailers. Looking to expand our web presence to compete w/ other .com sites.
good,working at Dicks we were short handed a lot on staff which made the job hard. The managers were hard to work with and was sometimes rude. The rest of the staff that worked there we're all nice people and fun to work with.
good,"Dicks is a good company, but nothing special. We are asked to push their credit card and their free scorecard rewards card a lot, and there is a lot of pressure to keep the numbers of rewards card sign ups to make sure the company standard is met. I like most of my co-workers. It can get stressful at points like most jobs. For me, this job pays the bills while I'm trying to find a better job thats in my field of study. "
good,"Spent most days keeping up with organizing products and keeping the flow of the front end smooth. scheduling was sometimes difficult due to a lot of co workers having to always change shifts. However, I did learn some good tips in management, especially when it came to counting tills."
good,"Nice job for college students, they are willing to work with your class schedule. Management is very understanding of how important college is. The amount of hours you get sadly depends on how many people you get signed up for scorecards."
good,I was only seasonal but was not treated as an employee. The managers forget our names unless you become best friends with them. Decent hours but was never told when I was layed off for seasonal help.
good,The employees are fun to be around but they lack in leaders. It feels like some of the managers do not agree with the way things are ran and take it out on others. But they do work around your schedule which makes it hard to want to leave.
good,"My typical day at work would range from organizing truck shipments that come in early in the morning, to providing service for customers on the sales floor, to cleaning and recovering my sports section. "
good,"The job here is fun and the people are great. The managers were very flexible with everyone's schedules.The downside to the job is that the store lacks management  and structure. Some individuals were compensated more than others based upon an favoritism. There was a lack of opportunities for those who truly put in a hard day of work. The amount of hours are never in accordance to your availability. For example, one week you could work 28 hours and the next you could be working 8 hours. This job is a more suited opportunity for individuals in college or whom would want a part time side."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Working for this company was an experience.  This position really tested my patience with management and coworkers.  I learned to always ask questions and think for yourself.  The hardest part of the job was working with other employees that did not value their job.  Work is something I always hope to enjoy no matter what it is.  Management was helpful to an extent.
good,"Managers were rude, disrespectful, and could care less of the things you needed."
good,Learn a lot about merchandising and selling as well as dealing with difficult customers and making relationships with customers. I enjoy being able to assist the customers and sell our products because I believe in there quality and the functionality of them is best suited for anyone with workout needs of all kinds.
good,Great work experience. Energetic work atmosphere. Hours not guaranteed. Pay was minimal. No room for advancement. Policies always change.
good,Not much room for advancement. Management could back their employers more. Return policy needs to be enforced or changed.
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods has the potential to be a great place to work, but with the leadership team that was there while I was working, it became a horrible working environment. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,"I like the people I work with, the discount is good, nice selection, just okay management."
good,I really enjoy my job at Dick's Sporting Goods because it directly relates to my passion outside of work which is sports and the outdoors. Because of my passion I thoroughly enjoy working with customers and assisting them with the knowledge I have pertaining to my areas of interest. The pay here is terrible though for the amount of work you will put in for a shift. I have interviewed three separate times for management positions to always be beat out by someone who is a bit older and has more experience in the work field in total. I like being in charge of my department and following planograms to make decisions in changing up the flow of the department. I always have enjoyed my co-workers and have made some connections through these fellow co-workers. However it is time for me to move on to a career that will pay the bills a little more and gives me more opportunities to move up in the ranks!
good,"Typical day at work was stressful because they want you to do everything. I learned alot although, I could of learned alot more. the Management was terrible and to demanding. Co-workers were alot of fun to work with. The hardest part of the job dealt with the management because they expect way to much out of one individual. The most enjoyable part of the job dealt with the co- workers."
good,"Funcionários despreparados e sem especialização, empresa familiar, havendo sempre discordância entre Pai e Filho"
good,"A typical day at work consist of getting a list of task to do for the day when we are not working on customer service.  Customer service is number one. It is very important to help the guest in any questions or concerns they have and make them feel welcomed and make their shopping experience as best as we can. "
good,"management was a joke, pay was awful at 8.25/hr and there are no full time employees. everyone is part time so they dont have to give benefits."
good,They cut your hours when things get slow and you never get more than 30 hours per week unless you are a manager. But if you are looking for a part time job and a fun place to work then this is a good fit.
good,"Stressful, like any retail environment.  Great prices and deals for the customers"
good,"General Managers always changing, only found one in three years thar could handle the store."
good,"DSG does not care about you as an employee.  It is a great job while in school or as a first job but the careers are limited.  You must put your time and effort in for a few years before being noticed as a valued employee.  It can be a fun environment being around younger athletic people but has it's perks and flaws.  I liked it because I liked my co-workers but as any retail job, you are not valued unless you have stayed over time."
good,"A typical day at work for me would consist of running around keeping apparel clean, cashiering , maintaining customer service and backing up other departments that needed my help. I usually organize my day by doing things in an order that allowed me to get multiple projects done in a very fast paced efficient way. I was relied on all the time by my manager and coworkers to carry the work load because the other employees couldn't always finish things or weren't always sure how to complete tasks properly. So as a Team player I worked with them showing them what was required to complete the task. I usually showed them how to merchandise or fold properly do fitting room checks every half hour kept the return bins empty and the dept looking its best. I then would help shoes or any other departments and as always I helped customers in any area of the store."
good,"A typical day went fine so long as you didnt need to make any decisions. Management was never in agreement with each other on how to handle things. Also compensation was little more than minimum wage even with raises. Store had no values when it comes to employees, and had no decency to warn of hours being cut."
good,Just to make sure that myself and team were offering everything
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Managers were ok. They were very good at picking sides and not looking at everyone's point of view. As a CSS I was lead cashier and they would choose to listen to one other trouble-maker cashier over me. Customers were good, I enjoyed to interaction and trying to get scorecards, credit cards and warrantees due to good customer service. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rough customers and keeping you're cool while managers acted like teenagers. I loved learning new things daily and expanding my horizons."
good,would be better with more back up for cashiers so customers dont get irritated.
good,"The Cashier job is very straightforward. Very simple to learn the register. I hated having to push the ScoreCard and Credit Cards. Management wanted you to be more focused on pressuring customers to sign up for the card than delivering great customer service. I was hired with 6 other people and the training was horrible! I spent 15 minutes with the Admin. Assistant doing my paperwork and then was sent to a computer in the Golf area to complete my training. I was asked several questions by customers as nobody was staffed in golf that day (or ever). I didn't feel like anyone cared if I was trained or not they just wanted me on the schedule ASAP. I was told I would have 30 hours in my interview which is the ONLY reason I accepted the position. I had open availability and still only received 8 hours. I was also informed that if I didn't bring my credit card apps up that I would be written up, my second week on the job. Not worth $8/hr."
good,Managers are corporate pawns. Extremely incompetent. Inability to schedule correctly
good,"I enjoyed working here for about 3 months until I learned how the management treated the associates. After 7 years in the retail sporting goods business, I was surprised to see how little employees meant to the company. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and some managers. However I would not recommend working here to anyone who cares about doing a proper job."
good,"If you arent looking for a serious job this is a perfect job for you. Very laid back, with great benefits. They have no problem with working you hard 45 hours one week and then only giving 12 hours the next week. Wont promote from with in"
good,A great atmosphere of hobbies most people enjoy...very bad ran stores.
good,I worked this for over a year and my clamp truck dropped a box and they made a BIG deal over it
good,"Karens and thieves everywhere. So boring. Hours are rarely stable. Poor wages and constant micromanagement.  It's a good RETAIL job, but not a REAL job."
good,Working retail hour are difficult and especially when holidays come around the company really uses and abuses their top performing employees and constantly schedule them with hardly any time off
good,"Working here only for a couple months between school, it was the most stressful job I have had. I was forced to go above and beyond what I applied for and became very stressful and hard to deal with."
good,You have to deal with customers getting in your face over coupons and them mis-reading sale signs. There isn't much room for advancement. There are at least 4 managers at every store and if asked a question you are likely to get 4 different answers.
good,Great people to work with. Management was okay but thought a little too much of their position and power. I think the most ridiculous thing was setting up and tearing down outdoor displays.
good,"Good management, no  Commission even if sold 5 bikes in a day, fun place to work for sure, one day you will work as a pro golf salesman, the next as fisherman expert."
good,Dicks sporting goods is a good place to work at but however managers are not all on the same page and hear different things from all of them as well as not much not appreciation
good,Working for Dicks during the holiday season was fun because it was very busy every day I was working. There was one manager who was very difficult but everyone else that worked there was super nice
good,No opportunity for promotion and unfair treatment to hard workers. The associate discount is nice but does not make up for the work environment or the lack there of.
good,I’ve worked there since before the store publicly opened and the managers are okay sometimes. There is favoritism and they give everyone less then 10 hours a week unless your a favorite. Managers tend to have unnecessary attitudes due to personal issues and they keep you there all night until the store is perfect. It’s not completely bad But i would never reapply to work here.
good,"This place was a joke half of the time, our managers were all stuck ups. They would mess up on your schedule, they’ll set you for one shift and change it to a whole complete different shift without letting you know. We were always short staffed, managers would literally show favoritism treated everyone differently. The workers there were honestly great, everyone was kind, fun, and outgoing."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Dicks provides the opportunity for a “job” for the young person, meaning one who goes to school.  If you are older and looking for personal gain and advancement then it’s not the place for you.  I’m 45 and one cannot love off of what they pay.  If you are a person who likes working with and having fun with the customers it is a great place to work.  Very few holidays paid, not much of a chance for advancement, low pay especially for the skilled positions (ie. bike tech, golf tech.). Can be fun if open minded and customer focused but don’t let that fool you, you will be taken advantage of if you are a hard working individual.  With that being said, it all depends on your immediate supervisor, choose wisely."
good,it was an okay place to work. I felt like it was not managed very well and that I was appreciated for all the work I had to do alone when I shouldn't have been working alone in the first place.
good,Good entry level job. Management at my particular store was horrendous. There were 2 good managers and the other 2 made going to work difficult. They want more and more from employees without fairly compensating for the work. But the other associates were awesome.
good,It was a joband it paid my bills pretty strict I wish they offered dryer employee discounts. Environment was good and clean the other employees were nice to work with and was very professional environment.
good,"Employees would be horribly scheduled and when brought up to managers, little change would occur. Friendly environment but goals need to be revisioned"
good,"The company as a whole isn't bad, but expectations are high for team leads. Managers can lack professionalism at times resulting in low employee morale. Opportunities for advancement are not common. Hardest part of the job is meeting demands by management with little to no staff in a normal day. Best part of the job is being able to stay busy throughout the day."
good,"Some of the people are pretty cool, but for the most part it’s kind of catty. A few managers put on a nice face in front of you but the second your back is turned, not so much. Pretty good pace retail job, never really got overwhelmed with work. If you call for a backup cashier though, prepare to wait. When you’re new, you get treated like you’re 5 and someone is always hovering over your shoulder."
good,"The store structure should be very easy to run, but many obstacles exist in the day to day operations that make this company a challenge. Lots of auditing, lots of distractions."
good,"The lay was good and the store was fun in general. Management is iffy and dont plan on having a life. Minimum 50 hours a week salaried and during the entire month of November and December it’s 6 day weeks, 10 hours a day with no comp time."
good,Dick's Sporting goods is typical of most retailers.  Many employees were clock watchers simply looking to get a paycheck or works there long enough to get something better or finish school.
good,"management and lack of hard-working coworkers ruined this job for me. the shifts are inconsistent and not only are you working on mall hours, but you have your own separate store hours as well that you have to deal with."
good,"The job itself was pretty easy and enjoyable.  You get to assist customers and talk about things that you're passionate about.  The main downside was the management at both locations I worked was just terrible.  At the first location they would expect you to pick up all extra shifts with less than a days notice, expected you to stay busy at all times while working, and were just very strict for a minimum wage job.  The second location was just constantly understaffed which ended up with me manning the entire store by myself and getting yelled at through the walkie talkie to help a customer when I was in the middle of helping other customers.  They had me in the interim lead role for the fitness department but would not give me the benefits of the lead role (pay increase, leadership responsibilities, etc.).  Many coworkers quit because of the management at both locations."
good,Not a place for advancement or growth. They have the Lodge Associate loading gun safes in to the customers auto with a hand truck and usually by themselves.
good,"DSG for all of their size and history do not seem to remember the basics.  Why they are there, who their customer is (internal & external), selection of product assortments for categories, how to stay in stock for demand vs. singular seasonality.  Their growth is dependent on annual buyouts of smaller regional players, while locations comp growth is minimal.  In recent years they have consistently put their board's apparent politics above serving their customers, which is a terrible situation for both their customers and employees at the retail level, which they refer to as the F.A.C.E. of their company."
good,"Dick's was a standard, run-of-the-mill retail job. I had never worked in retail before, and most likely won't again due to personal preferences. Assistant managers were all fantastic and accommodating, but top-tier management was disorganized and lacked empathy and appreciation. Was used to caring management, so that took me more by surprise."
good,"You will build good friendships with the employees , the managers sometimes will put you into jobs that you've never done and tell you to figure it out"
good,Work as a team to ensure that all of our athletes/customers are provided with great service to obtain the proper products (shoes) for each individual.
good,"DSG is alright for a place to get on your feet and get used to working with people. As a first job, it's not terrible but the immediate management are petty and bicker often."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the youth set up with equipment and seeing the excitement, as well as being able to share sports knowledge to young kids."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Easy going job, repetitive by nature , but it surely pays well, good people to work with but the managing isn’t that great, and still struggle with prioritizing work place"
good,There was always something to do fro you if it was busy work or the floor had to get moved around. There wasn't many days where we weren't busy. The only downfall is that the managers never really helped out when it was busy.
good,"While this is a fun environment to work with the people who are sports enthusiasts, the work life balance as management is a real strain. The salary that is paid to management is sub par for those that advance with in the company."
good,"All depends on management. Company in general is going through some big systemic changes, but all in all it just depends on management. The company preaches teamwork and even goes as far as referring to fellow employees as teammates, but the managers do not treat it like a team environment"
good,"The company has gone through a lot of change within the last 10 years and has become very different from the company I started working for in 2005. Economic climate drives a culture of desperation, lots of ""shoot from the hip"" decisions that end up creating a lot of headache a few months later. Depending on where you are in the company and what level it can seem like management is floundering to keep their head above water. That being said, there are many pros about working here - job security (in comparison to other retail companies) and a ""fun"" culture at times."
good,Some days it seem like the customers were more friendly than your actual co-workers but there might be some reasons why that was a possibility. Not going to state reasons.
good,"I see and experience their Management Style and Business Model as very liberal. At times it is felt by all employees, not just myself, that the Company is neither employee or customer friendly."
good,Good job for building work experience. Able to learn about a variety of products and how to perform services. Seem to value external promotions as opposed to internal. Lack of training for some areas and no knowledgeable people to help you develop. Benefits are great but compensation/raises are only OK.
good,I wouldn't recommend this as a full-time or solo job. There is little room for advancement within the company. They usually hire managers instead of promote their own.
good,"I enjoyed the job, monotonous at times but I enjoyed the lodge experience as those are activities I take part in during my free time. Management is constantly changing and do very little to get to personally know the employees."
good,Working here gave me a great work ethic and experience for my future jobs.  Good training but would get asked to to so much with so little help.  Had a bad experience with the later part of my years where got put the blame for things out of my control and was not properly trained to work with Fire arms
good,"Retail is a grind at times. Where I worked, in the Lodge, it was better than most areas in the store. I love the outdoors so it was interesting to talk to the customers with the same interests as me."
good,It's not the worst job out there food industry is certainly worse. Its a great first job or job to get experience in order to get your foot in the door. Beyond that it really isnt great theres limited opportunity to move up unless you get lucky. Persistence does not seem to help as nothing happens ulness it's managements idea.
good,Have some good perks but pay is not what it needs to be to work full time. You are responsible for a lot in the lodge department since you are dealing with Federal regulations.
good,Made great friends with the staff and was excited coming into work.  I felt that the work that you did and provided for the company went unnoticed.  Taken advantage of if they knew you was a hard worker
good,"Dicks sporting goods was a good place for me to work, I was working there part-time and got promoted for my good work, but there wasn't enough hours for me, so I'm looking for advancement."
good,"I loved every person I worked with as a coworker, but the 4 managers we had sometimes made us little people feel stupid or would embarrass us in front of customers."
good,"This job was very routined. There was no real freedom with this job, mainly because the cashier's quarters are so small and confined. I did not enjoy being stuck in the same place. I also did not approve of the structured, corporate style of management. I feel like corporations are more restricting on the individual."
good,store always felt short staffed causing a stressful work situation. The hardest part was trying to help customers and still put away back stock in the time allotted.
good,"the its self isn't bad but the pay could be better , the other DC's make some . if you have and emergency management feel as if that is  personal they really are careless about things that you have going on and im speaking on  medical issues , family/children , weather and etc ."
good,for me this job was fun minus the management because you work with a lot of the same people you go to college with so thats fun and plus it gives you something to do other than just go to class and nothing else
good,"Laid back, flexible schedules. inconsistent hours, can go from 30hour weeks to 10-15hours without notice or reason. mostly great management, understanding and easy to get along with as well as coworkers"
good,"Was hired on as a Cashier but, was soon promoted to Customer Support Specialist. I was very happy to be promoted but, was later disappointed when I had to make the decision to resign because of scheduling issues when it came to school. Duties included making sure my job area was working at a timely and professional manner as the customers are always correct."
good,"High management turnover store, Disconnect between District management and store leadership team. Not enough payroll to complete company tasks and expectations. Transfer requests very limited and only happen when in the good graces of district management team."
good,I wouldn't want to work there for longer than a couple years. Just took the job to fill the time between military duty stations. Very mindless work. typical retail environment.
good,"It is a fun place to work, not much to offer in terms of career advancement though, they just don't pay the overworked cashiers enough, and toxic work environment."
good,"I worked at two different locations, the employees were great however the stores were always understaffed.  "
good,"I really enjoyed working there, the people were fun and it wasn't that bad of work. the main problem would be corporate. Also management is rough, they are always stressed out and so they build it on to us."
good,Started off part time and was a good job. I got promoted to a manager shortly after I started. The company makes management and upper management changes all to often. No one ever seems to know what is going on.
good,"My store manager is very relaxed when she is not stressed.  She can be a good leader, with soem positive qualities a manager should have such as working alongside her employees. When she is stressed, she begins to stress other people out by yelling and getting frustrated."
good,"I start by dust mopping the store aisles, then I clean the bathrooms and make sure they are stocked.  and make sure the plumbing is clear.  then vacuum 4-5 rug pads. from there  I am free to do what I see necessary."
good,"The overall downside was the favoritism that management showed towards certain employees v. others. Often times attitudes of employees would be rude towards customers and management would not say anything. In other cases, the smallest mess up could cause a long talk or an over observation that other employees wouldnt receive."
good,"I have worked for several managers within this company and it really depends on the manager. If they have been with the company for years and years, good luck liking them, but if you have a new manager that is customer focused you'll have a great time working there. Work for a manager that creates a positive atmosphere, shows they appreciate, and value the people that work for them."
good,"Great place to work, Very flexible on hours. Gain additional savings through 3 point 5.com and in-store. There are advancement opportunities for the motivated associate,"
good,Fast growing and ever-changing. Compensation could be better and work life balance is all depending on the store Manager. Weekends belong to the store long hours accompanied with mandatory holidays makes starting a family hard. Good PTO. If your stay long enough and the benefits are better than most. Do not expect a nice bonus no matter how well the store does.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Management was decently fair, definite signs of favoritism."
good,The job is easy if you enjoy working with people. Management is not really that good. They do not know every department so expect associates to figure everything out.
good,Depending on your department there will be a lot to do. the job can be fun as long as you know how to multitask. You have to be quick on your toes depending on how big the store is.
good,"Depending on what department/team you work with, experiences will differ.  Work is fast paced.  Many departments are very top heavy; appears to be too many Managers, Directors and VP's, creating tension on cross-departmental projects when decisions need to be made quickly.  Excessive meetings lead to inconsistent planning and confusion when aligning expectations.  Some departments insist on operating in a silo, while other business partners depend on transparency to stay on target to achieve project goals.  This hampers productivity and, in some cases, causes delays due to inefficient communication and unwillingness to ""show each others hand"".  During onboarding, emphasis is placed on a healthy work/life balance.  However, again, depending on department, this has the potential to disappear quickly.  Long hours, overwhelming meeting calendars and heavy workloads become the ""normal expectation"", making successful results rarely recognized by leadership."
good,"If this is your first Job or you're looking for a seasonal job (i.e College student) then this is a good place to work. Don't expect advancements opportunity as they do not like to promote from within, unless you have a college degree. Management can often times have a huge lack of communication which can lead to problems at the store front level."
good,They work there associates to much and not enough staff at a time.Its a male dominated company no progress women.I would not recommend anyone to work there.
good,"its a pretty good place to work at but if you work alot of hours one week,you dont get any the next week. the whole store is a open door policy so if you need help with anything anyone will help."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. We seem to get along really well, and I feel like most of the management care about me as a person. "
good,"A typical day at work for me is either a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Since I go to school during the week I only work on the weekends. There I hardly do projects like setting up a wall redo a section of apparel. All I have to do is recover whatever section I am assigned to and just provide the best customer service ever."
good,I've been there for 3 years I have seen the peak of performance with great management and associates. Now you can barely get anything done it is extremely political with associates getting promotions or getting hired because they have a family member that works there.
good,"Typical day at Dicks would be putting out or tagging clothes and helping customers. Helping customers find clothes or helping them find something in another store."
good,"Strange scheduling training is non existent. Impossible to move up in the company. The management was always changing especially at store 725, which closed doors due to location. Our store was treated as a manager breeding ground and never received the consistency it needed to survive."
good,I worked part time at Dick's Sporting Goods during the holiday season. During my time there I worked in the Hunting and Fishing department. I was partly responsible for the stocking of various products in the hunting and fishing department.  A typically day encompassed of attending to customers needs and keeping my department in a presentable fashion. The workplace culture was mediocre due to the fact the people there were working only as a stepping stone to their next job. The most difficult portion of this job was keeping up with the customer's demands and request during the holiday season.
good,The other employees were great to work with but no opportunity for advancement or pay raises. Managers were great to work for. There were a lot of responsibilities in the lodge department for the small amount of money we were paid.
good,Due to this being part time the pay varied from week to week. Customers would treat the employees terrible. Also due to the schedule varying it is difficult to do anything outside of work
good,Job began as a great job until management came and changed a lot of things around. Raises were good at first and moving up in management was good because the got people who was doing the jobs and new what was going on in the warehouse. Then it all stopped they started hiring from outside of the warehouse putting people in management who didn't understand the job but demanded numbers because there bosses demanded numbers. People with attitudes looking at you and talking wreckless. Good place to learn some skills probably work while your going to school. Going into the job is like walking into the county jail or prison.
good,"Though a great place to work, a typical day at work was definitely routine. Not a lot of change happened during the time I worked here, and working here did not really help me develop as an employee or person. Management was mediocre, as some weeks my schedule would be pretty spot on with my life needs and other weeks would be pretty upsetting."
good,management did not care about its employees. the company was not family oriented nor did anyone care about family or do anything for their employees at all
good,"Typical day of early morning meeting, goals for the day or no meeting at all. Management gets everyone in order to see what departments need to get what projects done."
good,"This was a customer-service based job dealing with the Sporting Goods industry, which I enjoyed.  I mainly worked as a Cashier, but also processes returns and organized the store.  My interaction with employees was pleasant."
good,"It was good first job, got plenty of hours. there wasn't much advancement though. i felt as if i worked there for a year i should have been hired full time."
good,Worked for DSG all through out college. Flexible schedule to accommodate students. Learned valuable sales skills as well as how to deal with customers on a daily basis. Not much room for advancement.
good,"Overall, good working environment. Great for college students, not enough income for adults out of college who are moving forward with a family, etc."
good,management is lacking communication skills and is not good at boosting up the staff to do a better job. Breaks are very sporadic and often don't happen until close to a shift ending.
good,Nice job  unless you work in the mods! If you work in back stock G od has really bless you. They have crazy shifts like 2nd shift works 10 4 days but 1st works 8 mon-fri
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is the pinnacle of everything that is wrong with the retail industry today. They over work their best employees constantly with the only recognition to those employees being to put a sticker on a board by your name. That's literally what they do. A place that sells firearms will reward hard work by putting a star by your name.  The manager's are paid give or take 50K a year while consistently being work 60-70 hours a week, and are never given adequate payroll to accomplish tasks that need to be done on a regular basis. If it's not christmas season it seems as though EVERY month is a ""low payroll month"" and Corporate has to cut back on hours as much as possible. For a company that profits nearly 5 Billion dollars annually you would think they could stand to have more than one employee per department one time or another."
good,This is a good workplace with flexible hours.  There is little opportunity for growth.  Always something new to learn and do.
good,"Good management.  Team work.  Friendly people to work with, but slow work days.  Need assigned more to do.  Cashiers don't have many customers during their shift, and there is not much work assignments for the cashiers to do accept just stand around and organize a few items in their small area and just wait for a customer to check out at the register."
good,I function off of being very busy. I always do well when I am keeping busy and always working. At this job I did not stay very busy so time would go by very slow and there was not much you could do besides wait for customers.
good,"Spent a few years working my tail off for this company. It seemed that both Management and Corp level employees do not really care about their employees but more about metrics and numbers then internal progression."
good,"A great place to work for a fun atmosphere and coworkers. Management was constantly under duress from corporate visits, which in turn created an aura of frustration which was present every day. After a change in store management there was a lot of confusion that followed. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay on the same page as management and not step on their toes. The most enjoyable part were my colleagues who were always willing to help customers and each other out."
good,the co-workers make it enjoyable and fun place to work. Decent amount of red tape and politics but that's to be expected.
good,"At first I liked this job, great people and decent management.  The work environment is really nice and hours are manageable but lacking for this position."
good,management was not good.  pay wasn't good.  policies were not good.  dress code was good and lots of different areas to get into to learn
good,The management was not organized. Friendly staff otherwise. I did not work there long but I worked during school and they could not seem to work with my class schedule.
good,I spent 4 years working for dicks sporting goods. As a part time lodge associate and was consently lied to by management about that I was going to be promoted to a full time lead position. They try to find any way to fire you. And most of the management both in the stores and the district and region all treat you like you have no brain. Nor do they know how the processes work like gun background checks or how to fill out the paperwork.
good,Working for DSG has been a positive yet very challenging workplace. The amount of hours you work has made it impossible to have a normal family life.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Every sneaky, they have a buddy-buddy system going on there. You'll lose hours, so their ""friends"" can work. I left, and they asked me to come back and when i came back, they took my raise from me. It was only 13 cent anyway, while people who came in after me had a raise of $5. Just a messy place to work."
good,"A typical day at work is getting all of the operational tasks done while making the customers the number one priority. I learned how to multi task super well. The management at Dicks Sporting Goods is very strong, all managers play an effective role and keep the store where it should be. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with everything during holiday season both operationally and taking care of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is all of the friendly co-workers and seeing customers leave the store satisfied knowing that we made their day."
good,Good place to work part-time and work in a sporting atmosphere.  Very little room for advancement and management opportunities.  Excellent Store Manager and associates are enjoyable to work with.
good,"Basic job, large company, high turnover, lack of communication. Just a stepping stone for communication skills"
good,"When i first started working there it wasn't bad. The hours were decent and the management was awesome. A few months before I left that store started going down hill fast. They switched up half of the management and stopped caring about what the associates thought. As far as the store manager was concerned associates were no better than 6 year olds or sheep, depending on who you were. Unless you were one of the 3 associates who knew how to say everything right, whether you actually did what you said or not. He wouldn't know the difference from the office. The hours have gone down dramatically for all part time associates. If you get a job there don't expect to get any more than 10 hours no matter what they might promise you. The other managers and most of the associates are awesome and good to work with but the arrogance of the store manager just makes it utterly difficult to want to work at that store. PROCEED WITH CAUTION!"
good,"great place, friendly faces from employees. Managment was a little tough. Most enjoyable part of the job was the hours that you wanted was always met."
good,"Management sucks to work with, little to no hours, very slow now that holidays are over, there isn't anything hard about the job. The only part I enjoyed was seeing people that I like"
good,"I play hockey, so working at Dick's Sporting Goods was pretty interesting and fun. I was a greeter (""Customer Engagement Specialist"") and a typical day is greeting and directing customers in the right direction. I managed online orders as well and tried to get as many as possible each day. Most of the people I worked with were okay, very friendly. There was always that workplace drama and gossip though, like there is every where you go. But, I loved my co-workers for the most part. Management was not entirely at it's best. The store manager at that time was very lazy and unproductive. The department managers on the other hand were actually very hard workers for the most part. I think my favorite thing about working there was the walkie talkies. Jokes would be made left and right on those things. I learned to deal with angry customers and help make sales whether it was me covering the shoe department or trying to make online orders for customers."
good,They only care about their money and the customer they do not care about their employees. Want employees to slave for them for little pay
good,"Make sure the floor is fully stocked and merchandise is properly tagged. Greet customers and answer any questions they have about an item and offer suggestions on what would best suit their needs. Clean up the store at the end of the night. "
good,"-Helped customers. Helped co-workers."
good,I do not recommend working for this company. They do not value loyalty.
good,It all depends on the the type of manager you have.  It can be a fun job with the other employes.
good,"I have gained mentoring, training and recruiting skills working with our current trainees. I have enjoyed this most. I want to continue to grow and develop my career, along with others."
good,"Four managers there, two of them you have to be a girl or kiss up for them to like you. Always cutting back on budget every week bit somehow find time to get new hires while the people working there get there hours cut every week. They need to give the hours to people who actually get their work done rather than how long they been there. Don't get your days requested off."
good,"The benefits for a part time employee are horrible. If they like you and there is no full time positions open. They will work you full time and then cut your hours every 12 weeks. As part time...medical is expensive for bad coverage and unlike walmart and Target there is no accumulative vacation time. A typical day at work is hearing how you should be customer service focused to drive sales, raise score cards percentage and etc. In reality, they want you to get all these projects done first. If it's busy the store is more than likely under staffed. Corporate doesn't seem to have a clue as to what they're doing because when they make a plan and send it out to stores they change there mind and make you re-do it twice or they dont send you the product or fixtures needed for it. Which waste more time and money. Also, they try to recycle but they use crazy amounts of paper by folding shirts with copier paper. All around, co workers are good people. Managers are good workers that should get compensated more. They work harder and work way more than 40 a week but corporate is run by people who just graduated Business School and have never worked as an associate in a retail store in there life."
good,"The store is beautiful, the product is the best, but the management lacks the organization and leadership to make it great."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"DSG isn't the best company to work for. Employees do what they want, when they want. Management has a ""bury their head in the sand' mentality. Customer service isn't the main priority, it's all about ScoreCards, Dick's Credit Cards and conversion rates."
good,"Selling shoes and other sporting needs to customers. I learned in more detail specific things about sports and sporting needs of all kinds. Management was okay, they were friendly but not too much understanding. I enjoyed working with my co-workers they made the day easier. The hardest part about the job was standing on my feet for long periods of time. The best part was helping customers out and putting smiles on their faces!"
good,"Nothing new each day. Management was great. Co-workers were fun, some drama filled. Learned ALOT about footwear."
good,It is an ok job did help me with developing customer service skills and also helps me with communication skills to help customers get what they want.
good,"Customer service representative. I was a supervisor of the cashier associates. Completed tasks before deadlines. The co-workers are typical, its a hit or miss if you get a long. Best part is if you love sports you'll enjoy the job. Hardest part was dealing with the public cause not everyone is the most friendliest."
good,"A typical day is based on customer service. As sales lead of my departments, I am required to do the majority of all service work (bike services and building, racquet service and formerly snowsports service work). As well I do any training of new employees in my departments. I work hand in hand with management to drive metrics, complete store game plans for layouts as well as filling in where I am needed throughout the store. The hardest part of my job is balancing the daily workload with the realistic amount of work that gets done in between helping customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers find exactly what they were looking for and being able to explain the product with my extensive knowledge of the products and its uses."
good,"Provide customer service, problem resolution, one of five cashiers possessing managerial override authority concerning transactions, maintain register, back cash office till balances/deposits, meet and exceed various sales goals, answer and direct incoming calls to proper destination, restock front end merchandise, assist in training new cashiers; Promoted three months after hired; February 2012 Employee of the Month"
good,You have some room to grow in the company but not a lot probably. Get cross trianed in as many departments as possible to get more hours if that's what you want.
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods is company that prides itself on putting the customer first. However if your individual that values weekends and nights off, this is not the job for you."
good,Company is great to work for and helps with personal work goals. Prioritizes customer service and promoting from within. Flexible hours and competitive pay.
good,"Bad communication skills like they won't call you to let you know if you have to work or not. Super unorganized, short staffed, barely any hours and you have to do all the work to get answers about the schedule or when you get paid next. If someone says they're gonna call you back they will not."
good,Super good job for college students who want to work part time. Pay is fair and you have room to grown in the company. But they are not scared to hire outside of the company
good,I liked working there for the most part. My coworkers are all very friendly and help you with what you need but the boss was selfish and got angry with you if you asked questions
good,I really enjoyed the position at first... I felt that I  was targeted after my car accident... and once they decided that I was no longer needed.. they found a way to weed me out! I  would caution anyone who applies to be very careful.
good,"In my time at Dick's sporting goods I have learned a lot. I have learned how to deal with customers that are difficult, I have learned to deal with different types of management, but most importantly I have learned to adapt. Being at DSG forces you to constantly adapt to your surroundings such as busy days, slow days, good managers, and bad managers. I have showed up to work with an idea of what I will be doing and then immediately having it changed right before I clock in. Every day is something different and being able to adapt has been the key to success."
good,"Dick’s Sporting Goods is a good place to work at, but there’s a lot of people that slack off that get hours compared to the people that want to work and don’t get hours."
good,The job was good for the most part. The environment felt segregated between departments. Which made it hard to work when we had to switch shifts. Upper management was very strict as well
good,Some managers were great not to bad I guess that part of a organization they were good on scheduling v and helping but showed favoritism I removed starting there when the store opened they offered me 7.50 like how was I suppose to live with that. Then lied and said I’ll give you 13 after 6months over been there for 2 years I started with 10 and needed with 10.50 the pay such
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Did not pay a fair wage for the service I was providing. Manager was ok to work for. Dicks has no discounts for veterans or our emergency responders. OK
good,"I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods for a total of 3 and a half years across different stores in different regions as a full time lead in a couple of different departments. It's hard for me to give better or worse ratings because in my experience your work experience with DSG was solely based on your management team. I worked in some stores where the managers were great people and treated employees with respect and held them accountable. Those environments were great to work at. I also worked at stores where the management team did not hold their employees accountable and would talk about their employees not doing what they asked them to other employees, but never actually manage the employee not doing the work. I think the corporate office does not always know what goes on in these stores and in turn put unreal expectations and hour restraints on these stores which causes the management team to not be on their A game which then trickles down to the employees. Overall, I enjoyed my time at DSG and I learned a lot while I was there, but the pay is not competitive with other retailers and if I was still in retail I would have left for another retailer that paid more money."
good,It is a good place to work but it does get stressful at times.  Working there you learn some great customer skills but the tasking assigned by management is overbearing at times.
good,"The main isssue was with the store manager he said one thing and did the opposite, he made one employee cry in front of customers and then job security you don't have one. Nobody at the store that where managers knew any of the poiyices at all but they wanted you to work a 8 more hour day without a having hours limch but only a half hour lunch"
good,It was a decent job for someone who just turned 18 and looking for a part time job while they are in school. They treat you right and work with you anyway they can.
good,Typical retail environment but working in the back room is great. Good hours (6am-2pm) when able to work full time. I learned the importance of delegation and effectiveness working in shipping and receiving.
good,"Management believed metrics( credit cards, protection plans, and loyalty account sign ups) are more important than making relations with customers. They often would not give any type of praising at certain moments. Often when a co worker did something good they would flip the situation into a way they should have done more."
good,"When you first start, it’ll be fine and fun but then they overwork you while not paying you enough and schedule you till 10pm and then 5am the next day. I’ve also seen coworkers who have pulled 12+ hour days & this store has some shady policies that I’m not sure I trust. 10s instead of 15s, schedule you 9-12 hour shifts, etc."
good,Was a good team environment to work in. Very physical work with lots of walking. Working retail is very demanding trying to meet a large and diverse customer group that comes into the stores. At times was sent on assignment to other stores in the area to help with inventories.
good,"Management did a good job scheduling staff around personal needs such as school, other jobs, etc.  Compensation was fair at best.  No commission offered and yearly raises are small.  Promotions from within are rare.  Often expected to perform more duties or work at a faster than realistic pace with little to no incentive for the employee themselves.  Management gets most of the credit for the positive things happening at work and is quick to point fingers when things go wrong.  Job is satisfactory for students, people who have other sources of income, and retirees who are looking for part time work.  Company seems to prefer most employees being part time so that they can manipulate the payroll in their favor."
good,"Typical work day you would go in 3 hours before store opened and get everything set up."
good,"I worked extra shifts when ever they needed but because I wasn't best friends with the manager over my area I never got the chance of job advancement, only the ones that were buddy-buddy with them did. Many times I had to do my job and the job of the lead cashier's because they were to busy conversating in other departments. After I made my first complaint on the Lead cashier and a few other his buddy's who were working and I came to work after my days off and was told that I was going to be let go, because I missed too many days, many of which were from the time right after my father's death, which is an excusable absence."
good,Learned a lot here operational wise. Managers are a strong team together. Most associates are very engaging and try to help other associates to better their work experience.
good,Some management issues but good place to work. Good place to work for starting out on work field. Lots of good people to work with but some communication issues.
good,"My career at Dicks Sporting Goods started out very promising coming on as the Freight Flow Lead, however as changes in retail brick and mortar stores is constantly in need of adjustment, the job has become increasingly stressful with little reward for extra responsibilities that are continually being added."
good,"Great place to work if you are just starting out or needing something part time. The pay isn’t all that great (and I was a CSS). Competitive sales and marketing. You will not get any holiday time off during thanksgiving/Xmas season. Management is ok, could be better. Very family friendly"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dick's sporting goods. Workloads were too much sometimes, but for the most part you are just helping people with their passions for outdoors and sports. Considering I hunt and played many sports in high school, so it was a great fit for me. Management was a big downfall for me. Managers seem to harp on the good employees way more than the bad. I worked in the gun department and I was kind of disappointed I did not get any reward for selling such expensive inventory."
good,"employees are fun to work with and well trained. managers can be stressed at times, causing an uptight working environment. tons of customer interaction"
good,"While the facility is beautiful, it depends on the department you work in. Some of the work life balance is way off. I work with a great group of people but the missions are sometimes unclear from leadership."
good,Working here gave me further retail experience that I am able to use for my current roles within the workforce. I enjoyed the employees I worked with while working for this company.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"to complete jobs and core roles, demand is very high for you to cover store with maybe 3 other people. and No respect for women in the work field. managers are disrespectful"
good,Opportunity to advance into other departments in leadership positions. Very good employee discount rates. Offer many different choices in all sports categories.
good,"The managers got very lazy and they would hand off their work to employees sometimes, but overall it was a good place to work. Just make sure that the managers are dutiful."
good,This is a retail job and with retail jobs you get the retail life. They all pretty much suck to work at. BUT it is a good first job for some 18-25 year old still figuring out what they want to do or taking classes in college. Make the best of it and it will be a good learning experience.
good,High stress environment.  Great products to keep it fun.  Staffing model is very thin.  Expectations are very high for store teams.  Omni-channel retailer.
good,"The job was very fun and exciting. It was all about teamwork, hardwork and dedication. I've learned that This job would require a lot of teamwork and determination."
good,Nothing really to complain about. It's your typical retail job environment with options for shifts. If you're a good worker they will give you ample hours.
good,"I was cross trained all threw the store so a typical day for me was busy. My main job was working in receiving and taking care of the SFS and BOPIS. I learned all part of the Freight Flow Position and assisted out FFL in all areas. I learned how to do claims, transfers, receiving of merchandise and many other things. The hardest part of my job is having to leave it. I loved working as the Operations Specialist because it kept me busy and made the day go by faster."
good,"When i started as a cashier a year ago, I desperately needed a job. Since then I have been promoted once and it came with a $1 raise which became a $.75 raise when the minimum wage (what i originally made) was increased barely a month after my promotion. My pay was never adjusted for the minimum increase that occured in January, 2018. I recieved a ""merit raise"" of a whopping $.25 even though from then (even up until now) I'm one of the best performing cashiers. My new title is ""customer service specialist"" which gives authorization numbers for various transactions, gives me keys to access backrooms and register tills (even responsible to count the tills at store closing should the managers ask), as well as being in charge of all other cashiers. Again I am consistently the top 3 or 4 performing cashier EVERYDAY, I don't stand around like my coworkers nor openly complain about any task asigned to me. Somehow my coworkers havent been let go yet some make only $.25 less than I do as a basic cashier. That's right, my ""merit raise"" placed me JUST above those I'm responsible for. Theres no real oversight on store managers scheduling decisions so we're constantly short staffed (at my store) and even an assistant manager (who started as a cashier 14 years ago) doesnt understand why the store mang. consistently shorts us which makes our reviews drop and new company policy bases additional payroll on the store performance (nice big circle to screw over stores). The company policies don't help the stores and actually give a bonus exclusively to the store managers based on how much of the"
good,As a head bicycle technician  I found the work challenging daily and learned and developed new skills daily. The position presented an opportunity to develop friendships with customers.
good,I've been working here for over a year as a part-time associate and it's a good job for money on the side. Although there's no growth in this company. Doing well in the job isn't meaningful either
good,"I worked here in college and while it was fun, I wouldn't recommend it as a long term option. Typically shoe sales allows for commission sales. While I understand the service end of pressure free sales, this job pays minimum wage to employees who generate near $1000 an hour in sales. This job was very fast paced and was fun, but should have been compensated based on performance"
good,Depending on manager it would be stressful. I would clock in and then go up to the registers. Sometimes it would be extremely slow but as soon as you stopped cleaning you would get yelled at but there would be actually nothing else to do.
good,"It was a fun environment to work in, but not every employee was as willing to provide good customer service as some which put stress on the few workers who would genuinely put effort into their jobs."
good,Management is not trained and they are very unorganized I have been working at dicks since day one that it has opened in the Houston district and no manager or district managers have ever recognized the hard work we put in as employees
good,A typical day at work is monotonous. The same tasks were done with occasional projects to do. Management is typically lenient with their employees which creates a very chill working environment.
good,"Was fun as a young college student and I enjoyed the discount on merchandise and the general atmosphere among my coworkers. However management was harsh and un-supportive of students. Unwilling to work around changing school schedules, second jobs etc. Expected Dick's to be your life and to be willing to bend to their beck and call without any real compensation"
good,Allowed me to take time off when I needed it for school work and or tests. Pretty flexible about allowing you to go home for a weekend or if you have prior plans. Day as a golf associate can be pretty slow during the week and can get hectic during the weekend.
good,Not very good work life balance though compensation is very good. The company is always moving to the next season or sales event so you are constantly doing floor moves. Some of the challenges with all the moves is ensuring you have enough staff to both make the store look great and service customers for a great experience.
good,"cooperate would make display setups on paper that don't work in the store, small discounts, constant push to sell credit cards. Store General manager's that don't know laws concerning firearm sales."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Very busy store must have great work ethic skills "
good,Good for single families and recent high school graduates.  This job does not pay enough for me to sustain my family's medical insurance or receive government assistance but it is a god place to start you work experience.
good,The lack of management and experience within the company destroys the everyday work ethic of its employees. Management at a store level is lacking the ability to function as a team and get everyone on the same page.
good,This job was really good for the simple fact that I enjoy working with people. Although the management was poor I still felt like I was advancing my abilities to be a great worker.
good,"Good place to work if you are in school and can only work part time. It would not be a fun place to be if you were working there full time. Got to work with some cool people. Management is ok. Often times you are under trained to perform tasks such as restring tennis rackets or inspect bikes. The hardest part of this job, like any other retail job I am assuming, is dealing with customers. Not all customers are bad, and some are actually really cool, but most shifts you will deal with extremely rude customers."
good,"They're big on customer service, but they care more on pushing credit cards and warranties. Most of the associate are a pleasure to work with, but some managers care more about the store bottom line then the employees feelings. Your lucky if you get 4 days to work. Little opportunity to advance and work full time. The job is a revolving  door."
good,"I have worked with 2 separate dicks sporting goods and my first one I worked at I had an excellent expierence although managers tended to be loose with call offs sometimes making it hard on workers. The second dicks I worked at was while I was in college and my overall experience was awful. The managers were giving me 8 hour shifts on school days when I requested not to and when I asked to change my schedule because of clubs they were unwilling. The pay was awful for what they expect,I worked in apparel and they would usually only schedule one worker to cover the entire apparel section and would get mad that the store wasnt spotless or slightly a mess because you couldnt maintain an organized section while assisting customers and recieving no help."
good,"This job was high paced for the most parts and very unorganized with little help from management. It was located at Crossgates Mall and the breaks hardly left you any time to eat.  When the schedule says you are out at 10, you are kept at least another hour late. Managers are not very positive or charismatic."
good,This job here I worked a lot in the back room. Shipping and recovering. I would do overnights to bring in merchandise for the store. Was treated very unfairly by the management team.
good,"working here was temporary, it was just to get a temporary job to make some money. they were terrible about scheduling. i had a lot of evening availability after class but would only get scheduled once a week or none for multiple weeks at a time"
good,It’s okay working there the management isn’t the best but i get paid pretty fairly as opposed to other employees who work there but i also wish there was more hours for me
good,"A Typical day in apparel is clothes, clothes, clothes. Things like folding, hanging, setting floor plans, making sure that there are correct merchandise exposure standards placed on them, etc."
good,Pay was a little above what I expected but not by much. Got a small raise when I changed departments. Management was very friendly and concerned about employees. Hours and weekly schedule are varied and annoying most of the time. Easy job overall but the hardest part is getting all the metrics that management demands from each department. Discount is really only good if you combine with big sale prices.
good,"Schedule is almost always wrong. The coworkers are great though. Costumers are typically friendly. Hours are terrible though, was getting about 20 hours a week."
good,"Dick's is very stressful.  They schedule at the bare minimum, which allows very little time to get chores done.  Some of the management is rude and condescending.  Not a good job if you're trying to balance school or another job."
good,"Fun, fast paced, and very competitive workplace."
good,"Decent work, quick paced but allows you to work with like minded individuals. Would still recommend this job to a friend. Good hours for someone who is still in school."
good,"Poor communication from management lead to high turnover. Either very boring or annoying stressful, with little to none motivation or support from upper management."
good,I would not recommend working for Dick's Sporting Goods because retail is on the decline so there is not much room for advancement. The upper management of this company is also very shady and not accommodating. Raises were abolished for a year and then returned. It has been very up and down for me but the store at which I worked was at least very relaxed. I cannot say the same for other stores.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I stayed with this company for a long time mostly because I loved working with a lot of my coworkers. The last few years I was employed there however, the culture shifted drastically. New hires were thrown on the floor without proper training, gimmicky sales strategies were implemented nearly every week, and senior staff who had the knowledge and training were pushed out of positions in favor of younger cheaper labor"
good,It was one of my first jobs but i enjoyed it but i hated the fact that they hardly hired on full time or at least increase the pay for some workers i was forced to work part time. But worked full time hours.
good,"Typical customer service, sports store job. Sell and upsale customers. Always recommending and pushing products for hight sales. So also selling. Manager was kind of a jerk."
good,My store managers are great and actually look out for their employees for the most part. DM and corporate keep the payroll bare bones so on busy weekends there are the same number of people running on the floor as a regular evening. Don't forget to push those credit cards though!
good,"You can never do anything right, always changing what they want to be done and pay/promotions rarely happen. Not appreciated for your work. Besides from my store manager the other managers were extremely appreciative and understanding."
good,"love the one on one interactions with customers. but unfortunately,  there are other aspects at the job that could use improvement. decent pay and decent benefits"
good,"Good Company to work for, great opportunities to advance. It is hard work, however if you work hard you can move up in the company."
good,"Not the best management. Work environment could be better but could be worse. Good job to start` off wth, but some of the employees are not the nicest and are very negative."
good,Something quick to keep the bills at bay. It was a relaxed environment. All the managers are on separate pages. Low stress gives you time to plan for your next step in a career.
good,"This company does not care about work/life balance. Management can make or break work culture. If you work with a well balanced manager, the culture can be fun while productive."
good,Management seems immature and gives the store a feeling of dealing with a bunch of high school kids.Things can feel unorganized and confusing at times.
good,Your bosses definitely do not support you or have your back. They squeeze you like a sponge until you realize how under appreciated you are and you quit. This is a good entry level job for
good,"A typical day at work is mainly customer service focussed. Management is fun but also too laid back. Other co-workworkers are great to work with and make for an enjoyable work environment. For the most part, the job is relatively easy but the hardest part I would say is answering the customers questions properly because of limited training and information on the items that are sold in the store."
good,It all comes down to leadership. Some managers and leaders know how to grow their employees and some don't even know how to return a phone call or email.
good,"clean up racks "
good,"A typical day would start off by being greeted by your coworkers which is always nice... management is eh, not the best. Nice people but only care for a certain bunch. Most co-workers were amazing, become real close to everyone. Customers can be real nasty though so it's hard to stay positive but co-workers always helped you feel better."
good,My typical day at work started with unloading the daily merchandise and organizing the shelves and bays. Then I would take a gun count and check to make sure there was nothing left in the backroom.
good,They lied upon hire saying everyone is a temp and that if you do well you oi get to stay.  Both of which were lies. I helped put that store together.  I really did like my coworkers and what I did.
good,Standard big box retail. Enjoyed brand rep meetings and training on new products. Advancement opportunities are there if you can play the politics.
good,management isnt the greatest. Company seems to have a chip on its shoulder. Great place to work if youre a student with flexible hours. Barely any pay increase. Hours are inconsistent.
good,Not a bad place to Work Typical sales job. You will learn a lot about the department you work in and the associated sports that the department takes care of
good,"I've learned how to work with other people and communicate properly. The hardest part of this job is balancing it with school, the managers schedule you for a lot of hours per week."
good,Solid company with great future. With Sports authority Closing it will propel DSG to a strong future and sold growth by just opening the doors. Customer focused
good,"This was a good part time job, the best part is the discount.  Typical work day includes getting tasks done but mostly focused on customer service.  The pay, about what to expect for retail."
good,"Most of your jobs will be tedious, but simple. You'll be on your feet the entire time. The work environment depends entirely on how the manager is. They are constantly paying attention, and interacting. So if they are stressed, in a bad mood, or if you aren't doing your job. They environment will quickly change. However if they are in a good mood, then you should be fine, as long as you work."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be me at the cash register checking out customers and answering any questions they may have about our products as well as helping them locate various products throughout the store. I've learned how retail works by working here at Dick's Sporting Goods. I've also learned how to check out customers at a cashier as well as communicate excellent customer service. The management were pretty nice at first. After working there for a while you start to learn their true characters. Some of the management aren't very friendly after a while. When I'd ask to take a break, they would get agitated and sometimes I wouldn't get one. They also put me on the floor without training and got upset if I slipped up or made a mistake. Besides the online training I completed I learned everything else along the way with the help of my co-workers. My co-workers on the other hand are great and very friendly. They are easy to get along with and very helpful when it comes to new employees. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the isolation as a cashier and trying to keep busy when there aren't any customers to checkout. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and seeing them leave with smiles on their faces."
good,"Great place to work, very easy job. But management isn't the best and hours aren't that good. Co workers are great. seems to be always short staffed"
good,"With the liquidation of Sports Authority our company has brought on many of their employees. They have given them better compensation than the employees who have been there for years. I have been with the company for almost 4 years. I have taken on additional responsibilities, I have always went that extra mile plus I have previous Administrative Assistant experience but I only make $11.25 an hour. Which is pretty sad since the cost of living, in Colorado, has increased 99% in the past 10 years. In the four years that I have worked there our store has had 12+ managers."
good,you go into work and have a lot to do right away. then you have to go up to the register all the time when the line is a little long. I do like being around the customers.
good,I would come to help clean up projects that should have been resolved the day before. The turnover was bad but never having the positions filled for months on end was even worse. I never was able to develop into a better leader because no one was available to provide me with the training I needed.
good,"A typical day involved speaking to customers all day, assessing their wants and needs and suggesting certain products based on desired spending range, quality needed, and more. I learned a lot about sports that I had never known much about at all, as well as sports that I have always been passionate about. A lot of the day was spent interacting with co-workers to assist them in finding products, information about products, or working on floor projects. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a father find his son his ideal first baseball glove or first set of football pads and see the excitement within the child."
good,A typical day at work would be to assist customers in finding what they need and provide great customer service. As well as ringing on a cash register and dealing with money.
good,"At the store I worked, there were 8 different managers all with different plans and ideas. They always try to trump the others, so the vast majority of time at work was spent doing a task for one manager, undoing for another, and redoing it differently for yet another manager. Departments are not allocated to management efficiently. As a temporary part-time job, it is decent. It is very very difficult to achieve full-time status or pay raises. The part-time employees have absolutely no job security and often find themselves working zero hours in a week. If the management team could be trimmed or allocated more efficiently to specific tasks and departments, the store would get much more accomplished, would be able to increase sales, find products much more easily, compensate workers better, and retain employees longer. Lack of communication and collusion among managers leads to repeating the same task multiple times, making the employee feel that nothing was accomplished. This led to declines in morale and spiked the turnover rate."
good,"A typical day here would be standing at the register and assisting customers with their check-outs, greeting customers, and occasionally showing customers where certain items in the store are located"
good,"The work-life balance is pretty standard for retail, but this type of work seems only suitable for students and retirees. The idea of working towards management after earning a degree is laughable when the end result is a below average management salary and ridiculous hours."
good,This company has a lot of great potential if only they would listen to the employees who's actually running the daily operations.
good,"Ok place to work, compensation not worth the trouble or time. People don't stay long, company is a revolving door. If they spend more time investing in employees then company would probably grow. Minimal training on products, employees sound like they know what they are explaining but really not."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,I enjoyed working there but some of the managers are not very helpful and do not do their job correctly. Also if i would let them know well ahead of time i had prior engagements on a specific date they still put me on schedule.
good,Your always on edge working here. Turn over rate is extremely high. Would have great hours if we didn't have a whole year of mandatory overtime weekends.
good,there's always something to do busy work. working in environment where you work by yourself not much teamwork and everybody is for themselves.
good,"Typical day at work starts with the firearms count which needs to be done every opening and closing shift. After that is complete a myriad of other tasks need to be done. Such as helping customers, assisting other departments, watching for suspicious people, cleaning, maintaining product on the floor, possible training, and any tasks the managers or department manages need done. "
good,"Fun, busy upbeat environment. co workers very pleasant to work with, fast paced and exciting to provide face to face customer service"
good,"A typical consist of assisting customers needs as ensuring that they have a great shopping experience. My co-workers were very supportive and helpful. There was not anything really hard about the job, unless it was a very busy shopping day and we were short handed. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new faces everyday and knowing that you were able to make there day better with a great shopping experience."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods had an enjoyable workplace. The employees, as well as the managers, were personable and fun to get along with."
good,A fast paced place to work based around customer service.  Only issue I had was management gave unrealistic time frames for projects and slaved you through them.
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is a typical retail sporting goods store and very fitting for a college student or even a high student. If you can get a good hourly wage when your hired it can be a bonus because you may not get another raise for awhile.
good,"Depending on the store a typical day at work can be easy."
good,I further developed my ability to suggestively sell merchandise while also promoting the companies credit card sign-up opportunities. A typical shift consists of checking out customers in line as well as assisting customers with any problems they may have throughout their shopping experience. Management was strong upon my arrival at Dick's but has declined drastically since I returned from my second semester of college. Co-workers were friendly and usually reliable. The hardest part of working at Dick's is the long hours of standing in one place. The most enjoyable part was helping people and making sure they had a positive experience in the store.
good,"My overall expirence working at Dick's was not the greatest I must say, I feel as though I was frowned upon on the days I was in the front by myself. The managers take there sweet time to assist customers, overall I feel that the customer service there is poor. While working there I witnessed managers and employees being RUDE to customers."
good,"Company is more focused on their share holders then the people that work the store. Amazing people work there and the company need to focus on them! Hardest part is working hard for nothing, very little hours and zero appreciation."
good,"As a front end lead is was my job to stand at the front door like a cheerleader and greet customers. I swear every single person was blind ""yes, where do you sell the hunting equipment"" well sir there is a giant sign about the department that says Hunting Gear. Maybe its there. Seriously, you are blamed for everything. If a cashier is short in their drawer its the front end leads fault because we should have been making sure the customer got the correct change. Really. I did love working there, printing out hunting and fishing licenses to kids cause it was their first time going, helping customers with their background checks so they were able to purchase guns. But the management tears you down and doesnt respect you at all."
good,I was unsatisfied with my time at Dicks Sporting Goods. I felt it left a lot to be desired as an employee. There was no real support from the management team or much positive feedback from any other employees during my short time there.
good,"I unload trucks and distribute the freight to each department and service customers. I have learned new ways to merchandise product.   The management seem really nice at first but once you get your foot in the door there is alot of favoritism that happens and they do not know to time manage your shift or the things you do so you feel confused every day. My co-workers are great, we work as a team to help each other out for the most part. The hardest part of the job is needing help and looking for direction from a manager and not getting a answer. I enjoy helping people such as co-workers and customers especially when it ends on a positive note."
good,"Typical day consisted of folding clothes, reorganizing walls, helping customer both on the phone, in person and on computers. Helping with cash register as asked and required. I learned a lot about how to put a store together since i was there helping put it together when it first opened. My management there was pretty decent, they were very helpful and resourceful if needed, but weren't the best at their job. My co-workers became to be some of my close friends. The hardest part of my job would of had to be when I would have to please a customer, by finding them something similar to the product they wanted if we didn't have it. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the environment and the people i worked with."
good,The typical customer tends to be athletes or the parents of athletes. Location provides great traffic and friendly clientele.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Working at Dicks Sporting Goods is a fun environment to work in but they expect you to consider work your number one priority. If you are in school they don't want you to think it's as important as your job. They can't keep employees. The scheduling is hardly ever right. They are always having to fix it.
good,"The management here was very laid back. Almost too laid back. At times I would complete all my daily task and begin to look for more just to keep myself occupied as the clock ticked away. I ran myself out of work, and eventually was transferred to the morning shift, unloading the truck. When I applied, I made sure to note on my application that I was unable to do heavy lifting (100+lbs) on my left shoulder. They also didn't seem to mind that I lived almost 10 miles away and didn't drive to work, so it was a near impossible defeat when I would should up first every ""truck day"" at 6am. They also forget that some people know how to do things better then others, and moved a person who had no experience or knowledge of what they were doing into the department I was hired for, to cover my position while I was doing the truck."
good,"If not for all the cleaning.It would be a super place to work at,also wage increases and advancement is bad."
good,"This was a fun place to work. Helped to open the store from building the fixtures to stocking the floor and backrooms. Good people, but some issues with evaluation and communication."
good,"Management of planning is lacking vision and direction"
good,Managers are expected to work 50 hours/week while only being paid for a base salary of 40 hours. Those 50 hours turn into 60 hours during holidays with little to no appreciation during this time.
good,"Excellent staff, great management, even guests are cool.  Hardest part of job a lot of run-a round but also makes day go fast.  Good summer job with very low pay and not much opportunity for advancement."
good,learned a lot of new things as a sales associate. Being as young as I was the amount of knowledge I received about the world of work came mostly from here
good,great environment if your sports minded. the work part is what gets in the way of total enjoyment. high expectations with little resources to achieve goals.
good,"Independently reorganized the Administrative Office. Implemented and streamlined for processing newly hired associates for the holiday season. Learned new software systems: HRIS, Oracle, and PeopleSoft. I liked the sports environment and the teamwork spirit of all the associates. Constant managerial turnover for that particular store and the lack of hours."
good,"Typically, a cashier has the job of providing customer service, answering telephones, checking people out at the store and promoting the loyalty programs Dick's offers. Sometimes, this is all at once and it can be overwhelming when you work alone. What especially frustrates me is that the cashiers are told to promote the credit card, warranties and loyalty/store card and when a certain target number is not reached, management gets into a tizzy over you ""not doing your job,"" when really you are trying your hardest. It's not always your fault. "
good,Dick's does not promote from within.  I was an assistant manager and was told I was qualified but they only hire store managers from outside the company.  They don't like to transfer either.  Discounts on Sporting goods is great though.  Sporting goods retail attracts good people who love what they do outside of work.  And then bring that love to customers at work.
good,"I learned how to be creative in an office setting"
good,"Management was all about making them look good, and did not care about there employees."
good,"What people say about the job requirements and difficulty is mostly accurate - we 're not operating a particle collider or anything - so it's great for a student or a side job. The difficulty comes in with select customers/managers/ coworkers who make it difficult (usually managers). Coworkers are typically awesome and make everybody's shift better. The managers are up tight but regular employees are easy going, dont take themselves too seriously and just try to be nice. Everyone here is right about expectations. There's nothing wrong with daily quotas and/or personal goals but the metrics are blown out of proportion. You are apparently not allowed to have a bad day and are ""reminded"" that you didn't get enough protection plans, scorecards, and my favorite the PLCC aka credit cards. I'm not nor have ever been a cashier and I'm tired of the metric updates and reminders. During a closing meeting, a manager once lectured us that we were lackluster in our metrics even though the store was fairly dead for much of when I was there. It was as though we should magically create customers. I wanted to ask him ""how many sign ups did you get? Ohh zero...fascinating."" Can't speak for other stores but my experience is if it was a bad day the employees didn't rise to the occasion and if it's a 6-figure day the manager(s) working that day pushed the group to be great associates and was a great leader. It sounds like a lot of bad but aside from the managers/corporate influence it's not half bad."
good,management is decent but i wouldnt stay with this job for more than a few months.
good,Cashier position is demanding. Communication was good with staff members. Hard working team. High demands from cooperate.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I would ONLY recommend this company for part timers, students, and people who absolutely love retail. It killed my home life. They work their managers 50-60 hrs a week and up to 80 during the holidays on salary pay."
good,Work days are spent on the sales floor assisting customers with purchases. Management is easy going and allows employees too much slack for behavior.
good,"I worked at over 12 over the store in the tri-state area. Most management are only concerned with bottom line and their bonuses. So far behind the industry in every aspect of retail from inventory, training, loss prevention, and every aspect of communication."
good,I was with the company for 5 years and grew professionally. I was gained valuable experience.
good,"I worked split shifts. Typical day was merchandising and sales of fishing and Guns. I learned about Guns. Management was always changing. Hardest part of job was standing and working late at night."
good,Often required to do the job of multiple positions on top of customer service.
good,This is a fun and exciting place to work but I feel the work done by all employees is very much underappreciated. Management focuses all time on making most money possible rather than satisfying customers to make sure they keep returning to the store for future needs
good,"Everyday at Dick's was different than the one before. "
good,"Its not fun to work in retail I left cause I wanted to do more.  I was there for about a year. "
good,I worked in Buffalo at Dicks and everything was going great with hours but had to transfer to Albany on personal reasons.  The management at Albany was very unorganized and when you applied to request off weeks in advance you found that they still would be scheduling you then.  They also would not give you any days to work on top of messing up your schedule.
good,"I am still currently employed here, so I will not go into any details."
good,The hardest part of the job was dressing the mannequins. Especially the ones twice my size.
good,"No day is the same at Dicks. There are always new complicated customers on the phone as well as in person. Management expects alot out of the workers but refuses to pay them accordingly, or give them chances to excel. I have had a lot or coworkers that I got along with, but the turnover rate is incredible.  "
good,"Cashier and Sales assistant in high volume store"
good,Good company to work for. Good Benefit package. Co workers are wonderful and management is fair. Pay is good and hours are flexible.
good,"even thou you worked hard, they still broke the promise of keeping everyone longer."
good,I worked hard every night. I learned alot of new things. I did alot of duties.
good,"A typical day at work consist of helping customers, working on daily projects, replenishing merchandise, and keeping my sales floor at it's best. I learned a lot about customer service, installing a new DNR terminal at the service desk, and inventory management."
good,I am currently working way too many hours to enjoy life. I am a hard worker and don't mind doing what is needed to get the job done. But I am currently not getting the help I need to complete the tasks that are asked of me.
good,Fun fun fun! I learned a lot about the sports world equipment. Then management was was excellent. They was always willing to teach you more about all merchandise sold though out the store. Co-workers was friendly and always working hard to meet our sale goals. The most enjoyable part about this job was helping the customers select that perfect gift foe that special someone.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,It was very exciting to be apart of a company that touches the lives of every sport enthusiast every and to know that the location you work at is there home to find what they need to continue there journey
good,"I liked working at my job and with customers, teaching them a few things about the purchase. At times they even taught me things too. When they came back and told me how well I helped them was the best."
good,"For the most part the people are great - the work is not the best. Sections of the company are disorganized and it creates a lot of extra and frustrating work, most days I'm just pounding my head against the wall to no end. The perks (gym, cafeteria, not in the city) are great but it's starting to not outweigh the downfalls of the actual job."
good,"On a typical day, I arrive to a mess, and pretty much clean all shift long. While doing so, I help customers with any and all questions about shoes, such as differences between brands, and type of shoes. I arrived with no retail experience, and learned a lot about shoes, brands, and people. Management has changed throughout the year, and so has quality of things like our schedules, and attitudes of employees. As of late our availability schedule hasn't even been looked at! The best part about my job is my co-workers. They are always there to help if anyone needs help completing duties. There's not really a ""hardest part"" of my job, but the most enjoyable is helping someone and them actually saying ""thank you""."
good,"Nice Store but has a very limited space to display items year round. Example, hunting equipment and tent equipment."
good,"a typical day here was selling athletic shoes to customers with accfed.essories. what i learned was the ends and outs of athletic footwear,the management really needs to encourge their employees more. my co-workers were ok,but needed to cut down on the gossiping,the hardest part of this job was working in a dept that was shorthanded,it is very difficult to give proper customer service when the dept is not fully staf"
good,There is alot to learn in all aspects of the company and you can grow pending on your position and location.
good,"Manage the front end of the store, count tills, and do the daily deposit count."
good,"I started out looking to help a friend, who was the soft lines manager, to fill n a hole in his scheduling and get me out of the house for a few hours a week. I soon became a go to guy to work shifts when people called in sick and was shortly thereafter made the Running Specialist. I completed all of the required training and started to develop a regular clientele. Earlier this spring, my friend left for a better opportunity and the new manager that replaced him has a different philosophy for scheduling. There is no fixed schedule and what started out as a requirement for availability for two Sunday shifts a month became every Sunday morning. When I asked for two Sunday mornings off a month to go to church, my hours were cut and I started to get random shifts that made it impossible to plan for anything with my family."
good,"Dick's provided a perfect opportunity for me to share my knowledge and passion for golf with other golfers, while helping them find equipment, apparel and services to support their passionate pursuit of the game."
good,The management could care less about the insufficient coverage in departments and how employees are not compensated enough for specific tasks which deserve some extra pay.
good,"Weekends are very busy, and fast paste,"
good,"Overall, DICK'S is a great company. I have learned a lot of valuable skills throughout my employment here, but specifically for my role, there is absolutely no career path and the upper management is disorganized, alarmist, and utterly lacks communication skills. I enjoy the company culture and the other employees, and we are compensated fairly. I just think that the management needs a drastic makeover."
good,"Good team. Needs to greatly improve scheduling for ALL workers,not just the peoplw they want to be there. Statement: ""If I was given a job, there should be no reason why Ive been sitting at home for the past 3 weeks working other people's shifts jusr to make money"""
good,Work daily through tasks given my manager. Always providing customers with high service. Working together as a team to accomplish tasks. Different levels of busyness at times of day.
good,"Management does not communicate with each other.  Some are belittling in their communication.  Scheduling is erratic and does not match availability."
good,"They expect allot of work from you for such little benefits and pay which is literally unfair for the work you have to do, but overall helping the customer led are the best part of the job."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Challenging, fast paced customer service environment. The company is changing structurally, relying heavily on online sales vs brick and mortar. This leaves fewer employees covering multiple areas. Company used to have a focus on specified service for each specific sport. Now employees are required to be more of a general helper in all different areas of the store. This requires that someone is able to selflessly multitask between customers, store tasks, and online sales."
good,"Dicks sporting goods can be a tough place to work, but it can be rewarding also, if you want to work your way up the ability is there, but if you want to stay Part-Time that is also fine"
good,"Most of my coworkers were students, as was I. I never had a problem with management, except when they told me one time that church was an extra curricular and I should work, not take time off for that. I loved working here. That was just a minor bump, nothing occurred like that ever again."
good,"A great learning experience for a high paced retail environment teaching the value of balancing multiple customers and sales at once, the importance of display and professionalism, Most of the management was excellent in teaching with excelled customer satisfaction (one of my managers hated life and took it out on us). Hardest part of the job was running 3 departments at once (Team sports, bikes and fitness) keeps you spread thin and unable to really focus on the minute details."
good,"lack of extendable hours especially during the summer, finally there are some workers that are given raises who have worked less than you and will never receive one."
good,A typical day at work would consist of getting there clocking in and right to your job. Always looking forward to greeting customers and asking they are finding everything okay. If not busy then only some days you would have new things to put out but other days you would go around and just fix clothing and made sure everything looks okay and ready for the next day. Management was always pretty chill depending on who the manager was for that shift. Enjoyable because I'm an athlete and I love anything that has to deal with sports.
good,"Would work for a typical 8 hr shift."
good,Great place to work.  Workplace culture was fun.  Poor management from the field office was my least favorite part of working there.  Favorite part was the team I led in all locations.
good,"Great place to work if you are SUPER flexible with your schedule and have a good management crew. Depending on store location, there are opportunities for advancement and they have great benefits,"
good,"I have my own conclusions on what could have been better, but it's ok. It's a bit hard to move up the food chain in the company, personally I feel that it was hard for me to do so."
good,Dick sporting goods doesn't Appreciate there worker's. pay is  not reasonable. Turnover is high.. No incentive for employees other than Credit Card set up. Low employee morale.
good,"Not many full time positions. They play favorites a lot. Try to discourage shoplifting, but the process of deterrence is not very successful. Need to give more hours to people that work hard and efficient."
good,"I enjoyed working with everyone there. Management was great. Although, working in a mall as its up and downs. I usually always left work in a good mood."
good,"Dick's is a great place to work part time while going to school. The management however has gone down in rating and so has the store's rating. Over all, I have not worked there in three years and could not provide a recent rating."
good,Everyday was something new. Even if it was just slightly. The pay was not the best. But the people and management was supportive and always encourge indepentdant thought.
good,"Although working at Dick's is more of a hobby for me, the pay could be better for the job that I do. Working in Firearms Sales is sometimes stressful, and dealing with unruly or agressive customers can make you want to leave the job. Management does not always back you up, especially if making yu look bad will make them a sale."
good,My manager was fair but strict. No problem there. Hours difficult to come by at times. Dicks new culture of ani gun would keep me from ever working there again.
good,I would be the first one in the store everyday during the week to pick up a mess left by the night staff.  I would communicate this issue to managers but wouldn't solve much.  I always worked hard to complete my tasks and was appreciated my the managers and always willing to help other debts.  Everyone was friendly to work with but the hardest part of the job was dealing with the loss prevention manager and our store audits.  always finding something that was wrong or had to be done different.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I have always worked with people and I got to work with some close friends.  That always makes the job a little better
good,"The management wasn't how I intended it to be, it lacked structure and the scheduling for everyone was always inconsistent. It was a fun place with great co-workers, but the management could have been better."
good,"Job is challenging at times ,benefits are good which include medical, dental and eye along with paid vacation, personal days,overtime offered and 401K jnvestment"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,When you fist clock in I would check the guns to make sure they are all locked up. I would then begin to clean my department and help customers as needed. I learned how to handle sensitive information such as SSN and other info needed for background checks.
good,"On an average day as an apparel associate, I would spend my entire shift putting away clothes and cleaning out fitting rooms. I someone did not work apparel the night before or for a few hours your shift would become a horror due to tons of clothes piled up for you to put away. Most times there will not be anyone else working with you so it would be up to you to put away all the gobacks by the end of your shift. Personally, I do not think managers understand that one person can complete such a task when they also have to act as backup for cashiering and helping customers ESPECIALLY on a busy day. With those conditions in mind, the pay rate for this job is underpaid and deserves more than they offer."
good,"Pretty good place to work, pretty average retail job, nothing made it stand out much more to me than any other retail job. I believe it was fairly average, good job but there can be better. Not much to say."
good,"Most of the managers knew what they were doing, some were awful at their job or communicating to associates. It was never too enjoyable working there all in all."
good,"It's an alright place to work but generally management will run very thin on you which makes it difficult to want to stay or seek advancement. I did enjoy the work in my department when I was left to my own devices, which unfortunately wasn't all that often."
good,A fun place to work at but wages are not good enough to get you through college or other expenses. Raises are minimal and even put you back to minimum wage when you were working above minimum wage before your raise. Besides that management is good and so are the other associates. Its a generally fun place to work and is a great experience for a beginner in retail.
good,The work I do hereisnt all to bad but it isnt anything to write home about. The management is where the problems are. They don't usually have a structured plan going forward and there isn't much opportunity to move up into management unless you're an outside hire.
good,"I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods the summer before I began college. The work was fairly easy. The store was a bit understaffed. However, management was incredibly friendly and fellow employees were as well. "
good,Biggest concern was how they continually hired form outside the company. Many bottom level employees would be put in posistions to train their superiors at the team lead and management level.
good,Some of the co-workers were really cool while others wouldn't give you the time of day. There were 5 managers when I worked there and only 2 I felt like did their job and cared about us workers.
good,"I like it was cool , and easy and laid back job not really anything to stress about. "
good,"I was employed as a contractor in the Creative Marketing department. As a contractor I had virtually no benefits, and often could not even take part in company functions. They are increasingly relying on contractors to do the work, since they cost less than the long-time workers they have. But you will be second fiddle. "
good,The company is very demanding and does not seem to care too much about employee training nor do they care about the hours that their employees work on any given day.
good,Nice place to Wk but to slow paced. I need something more challenging and fast pace. Looking for a job in the profession I went to school in right now.
good,The location that I worked at was very messy. Many associates considered this job to be their social life and nothing was accomplished. There was lots of gossip and hard work went unnoticed many times.
good,"this place is ok to work at, an easy job if youre into the products but very busy as managers understaff in order to gain financial bonus quotas. Difficult customersare common"
good,Lack of work made me look for new job and relocate to new area. Work was really easy and could be fun at ones but when they give you no hours at all each each and decline you for the days off you request takes the fun out of working!
good,"overall, the days usually went by very slow. The break times weren't very organized. Management wasn't very friendly. Cashier wasn't the greatest position to have"
good,"Hours weren't great, but flexible. Management needed help. I enjoyed helping people in the store but co workers and management didn't act as a team. They had their favorites, and liked to stick with them."
good,"A chance to work with people of a different caliber, and meet people of all walks of life. Advancements within the company are hard, but persistence pays off"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical day was being yelled at by managers for not working harder while they sipped from their cups of Starbucks. Management was very lazy and picked favorites. Plus the air conditioning did not work, it was constantly hot and miserable."
good,Not enough hours. to many people working that you don't get hours throughout the week. but very organized and ran correctly. well chosen employees with good mindsets
good,"ok place to work employee are helpful friendly,some supervisor need more work to be done,put overload is a good place to work ,needs to improve on upper manager"
good,The management was very poor so its turnover rate was very high. There was not a lot of hours to go around for all the associates. Also the pay was very poor in my opinion.
good,"If you are in school or college, this is a good place to work part time.  It is a typical retail place to work. I would not rate it as a rewarding place to work as it is typical with most retail jobs."
good,Every stereotypical horror you here in retail will happen at this job. I remember when I tried to get a promotion there that I spent months going significantly above and beyond what my job was and never got recognized for it. If you want to work here to start out then I recommend it but don't plan to stay there forever
good,"Decent company to work for, room for advancement, okay benefits, yearly cost of living raise. Working in retail for over 8 years this was by far the busiest store i have ever been in, weekends were rough, the overnight shifts even tougher. Overall if your like retail its a good place to end up but you have to be willing to work the hours and relocate for the possibility of advancement through the rankings."
good,you may have to be there at 5 am and leave at 1 AM. its fun and they are flexible with college students but if youre not a college student good luck..
good,I liked working at DSG while I was there. Its a very friendly place for anyone especially those who play sports. I liked all the customers and the job that I did. I actually was able to work in just about all the postions the store had just because I was there for so long and I liked being in a new spot each day I worked becasue I was still learning things. The only few things I didn't like about the job was that as a cashier then you had to keep your score card scan preferably at a high rate and then we used to try and push customers on getting a credit card with each transaction because we were told to do so.
good,I enjoyed working there with the employee's and working with the public. But the management there was always different with each Assistant Store Manager. The Assistant Store Managers there at Dick Sporting Goods was never on the same page far as how they handle things. They would let curtain employees that was not management handle problems that they should of handle themselves.
good,Retail is always difficult at times but its enjoyable working with product that i love ! I enjoy the pout doors so this is a great place to work for me. I enjoy working with the team to prepare our youth to take on a life time in sports and outdoors. It is fun to see the kids getting suited up in their equipment for the first time. It is also fun getting to know the customers that share the same passions as you do.
good,it was a fast paced corporations due to the fact that it was a new location so we were getting ready for grand opening. scheduling wasnt up to par but other than that it was an okay experience.
good,"Be prepared to not only take care of your department. You must make yourself availalbe for all the departments.Oh you will be ask to be a cashier, when things get busy."
good,"I guess it would be okay to work there, The management really wants what would be best for the store and its customers, the workplace could be better, the hardest part would be to keep up with the pace of the environment."
good,"The store I worked at fluctuated from being incredibly busy at times, to deader than a door nail. This meant that some weeks I worked way less hours than others, and this was non-negotiable. This along with the pay being sub-par, are the main reasons that I left."
good,"I worked at the Dicks in Midtown which was ok for the most part until we kept getting robbed. So they went to cut our hours to compensate for the loss. So instead of receiving 20 to 30 hours, we were barely reaching 20. Which could have been avoided if we had the security that the other stores had. But it was never put in place the store was robbed every day."
good,Typical day is okay. Can be really slow for hours then a large line forms within minutes. People end up returning a lot of items. They push heavy on us getting customers to get credit cards.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Hardest part of the job: trying to convince customers that this product is the best. "
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods is a high energy, high stress environment. Must be a self starter and hit the ground running or you will be left behind. Attention to detail is a must."
good,Can be a fun place to work depending on management. Long and tedious hours and work days. Pay is menial and manager have too much on their plate to really be productive.
good,"I thought they could have done things differently, managers don’t really understand some workers are students that play a college sport and there schedules are not as open as others."
good,Workplace was really well. Everyone got a long with each other and helped out if needed. Management was not too strict since we were given our own tasks to do through out the day.
good,"Good company, but lack of training and opportunity for advancement. Did not receive proper training on task being requested to accomplish. Overall the company is a good company to work for."
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods was an okay temporary job.  When I first applied it seemed like a good fit and that I would expand my knowledge about golf because it was the position I was hired for.  I soon learned that I was never going to be just with the golf department because I was always needed else where.  By the end of my employment my title would have been to long to list, because I was doing just about every job in the business, from cashier to working in the shipping department.  There was lack of leadership and lack of motivation.  Employees were good people but it seemed there was always drama and people talking behind each others backs, which is not good for any work environment.  My overall experience learned from Dicks Sporting Goods was good."
good,This was a good job. I had a semester off of college so I got a job in the golf department. It was a little boring and very slow because it was the off season.
good,"A typical day at Dick's Sporting Goods is filled with giving great customer service and completing daily tasks.  I have learned how to perform running analysis on customers to find the best fit that fulfills both their needs and desires.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making connections with customers, making sure that they know that I care and am here to help them find the right product."
good,There was an over amount of managers so a lot of the time no one knew who to listen to or what to get done because so many managers were telling us to do this or complete that first. it was a good experience as it was the beginning of my job career. Although it was too disorganized and not a positive environment.
good,"Dicks Is a decent place to work, No full time though and salary is low. Good discounts and they work around your schedule great if you are in college or have another job."
good,it is a very straight forward sales job. since its retail there are lots of dead periods especially the weekdays. coworkers dont talk to each other. very repetitive job and gets old very quick. pay is very good though
good,I enjoy the environment mostly. The co-workers work together to achieve goals. There are some opportunities for advancement for those that work really hard.
good,I wish I had better things to say but unfortunately it has been very saw tooth.  High highs and low lows.  No room for growth and lack of strong direction across the board. There is too much decisions made out of emotion thus creating inconsistency all around.  Too high of expectations.
good,And you will often do more of the heavy labor jobs when you're first in the door and they are not very willing to train you to do the lines of inventory however there are some really good supervisors there over they departments but your lower level management can be very cold and unreasonable
good,"My typical day was helping customers with what shoe they would like to try on. Get the customer the shoe and give them my opinion when asked. My other co-workers weren't as hard working as I. So I was doing most of the work in a day. I learned that sometimes you just have to put up with terrible co-workers. The management was okay, it wasn't the best."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Just a basic retail job that didn't have much requirements but didn't also give a lot of opportunity to grow. Good for a college student or for someone that needs a part time job.
good,Management is what needs to be looked at as far as standards and employee treatment seems as thou there may be an issue of favoritism. Managers at times have a hard time communicating amounts eachother
good,"Decent pay for the hours you work. Low stress, relaxed environment. Only leads get recognized where I worked. It's the buddy, buddy system there. Low budget and no hours. Work is very slow at times!"
good,Not a bad job if you are a teenager. I just need more money. The work was not hard. The people were very nice. Not an ideal job to have if you have a family.
good,"Customer service is the key to working at Dicks. Management is hardworking but constantly stressed by everyday changes from the home office."
good,"When I was in college this was my job during winter break. During the holiday it was fast-paced, but enjoyable! My title was a cashier. Therefore, my duties included handling all final transactions. I was the last face a customer saw before leaving the store and it was my job to make sure they left the store with a positive experience. The hardest part of the job is pleasing every single person who walks in the door. For the most part I learned a lot of interpersonal communication and customer service skills."
good,when i was let go i was not officially terminated from the company i was simply taken off the schedule because i was the only seasonal worker in my department and was never called back.
good,okay since you force me too its not a bad part time job if you can deal with retail. hours are sparse but if you can tie your shoe you'll have a job their as long as you like.
good,"It was a retail job with exactly what you'd expect at a sporting goods store.  department managers were cool, store manager, not so much.  Then again, he kinda needed to be the way he was.  Lots of before hours setting up displays, changing sales signs, and stocking shelves.  They did make you clock out, then wait up to 30 minutes for the office to close up, then there was the bag/jacket check.  Other than that it was a fun place to work."
good,"Customer service driven job"
good,"Great hours, very flexible scheduling, management is ok depending on store and location. Great employee discount and benefit options."
good,Fun laid back job with flexable hours. Hourly pay is minimum wage. Reviews come each year but max you will receive is about .25 cents. Management is terrible. Do not reward employees with anything. Based on your work performance and your availability they may give you more hours. Call outs will only put you on the managements bad side. Sick time is provided but ill not be automatically applied for call outs unless you ask. Worked there for 2 years dress code has changed 3 times and company does not supply clothing for employees. All in all all employees are fun to work with but for the company there is no growth. Good part time job for students.
good,"This fit my passion and I fell in love with the idea of working in sport gear and wear. Great team, a team I believe in and had fun around. Glad to have been there."
good,"If the work life balance was better; and management cared more about the sake of their employees, then this would actually be a cool company  to stay and work for."
good,"It would be fun yet productive, I learned alot about bikes also how to help others in need. I also helped train new co workers . The hardest part was lifting the weight sets."
good,Corporate does not know how to treat their employees. Depending on the store you work in it is a good company. Its a busy atmosphere if you aren't ready for it then don't work in it.
good,Learning sales techniques and helping customers. If your a former coach or player a great retail store to being sports everyday. Co-workers become teammates
good,"I got this job as a placeholder. They did a decent job training but management had changed so much since I was there. Only two managers ever stood out to me. They were very helpful and as long as you did what you could to help them they would help you out. The other ones had their heads up their rear ends. They were either so hypocritical (wanting to jump all over you for messing up one time when they were constantly doing the same thing) or were little to no help when needing backup. I got a lot of complaints from customers saying they couldn't find me. It didn't help that I was the only one covering the entire area upstairs by myself because we weren't given hours to have a second person help us. ""Customer comes first"" wasn't always the case because you would get pulled to do little side projects but then reprimanded when you didn't get good customer satisfaction. It was very back and forth. It is a good company however if you want a flexible schedule or you're just looking for something the do during the summers part time."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Hard to get established. Poor store management and career advancement opportunities. Hard work not celebrated or appreciated. Dificult worj environment with no celebration of multitasked, multi talented people."
good,"The area isn't the best, there are several thieves that come in on a daily basis. There needs to be a security guard in the store at all times but the company rather loose their product than give somebody a job."
good,"Company is growing and is struggling to find the balance between tasking and customer service."
good,Really easy and the pay is pretty abysmal. I come in and do my work and then I'm done. When its really busy you have to haggle for a break. But it's understandable at holiday time.
good,"Super customer-oriented. Basically want you to kiss the customer's a**. Co-workers and a few managers were awesome. Hardest part of the job was dealing with so many customers and answering calls while being understaffed. However, that makes time fly. The most enjoyable part were my co-workers and wearing sneakers to work"
good,I enjoyed working at Dicks! I miss it and the fellowship between other employees but I needed employment closer to home and a higher pay!
good,"inexperienced management, but if you have any common sense about retail, it is not a bad job or hard to learn. Employees sometimes lack this knowledge."
good,"Fun environment for sports lovers and people in general. I loved working with fellow sports lovers, interacting with customers that were sports lovers and being encouraged to talk sports all day. The Break room had a TV turned to sports all the time. Management was a highlight, everyone I encountered in management at DSG was professional, fun, and likeable. Overall, good place to work for a second job."
good,"Great place to work, apart from the low pay and poor raises. Flexible hours. Poor schedule making. If you like sports, you will enjoy your co-workers."
good,"I didn't work there long, but it was a good place to get some retail experience while also going to school.  It is a great part time job."
good,"Great work environment for hourly associates looking for part-time work. Unfortunately, upper level management has no idea of how the day to day business in the store is ran. Expectations from district management and above are very unrealistic."
good,"First job, cant complain much, it was fun, but moved onto to bigger things. management was helpful and understanding. working at a sport store is fun for any sport fanatic"
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a strong company to work for. They continue to grow stores at Dick's, as well as other brands to diversify. Such as Field and Stream."
good,I learned a lot about athletic apparel and a few things about other departments. My co-workers were great! Management sucked! There was a lot of favoritism and they were for the most part unapproachable and rude. They don't let you change availability for school and required you to work with only 2 days off a week at the most. The hardest part was keeping up with the phone calls and fitting room buttons and dealing with an understaffed store. The most enjoyable was meeting great people!
good,A typical work day for me entails processing shipments to 200 stores that flow through our distribution center. At times I'm asked to assist other departments with inbound/outbound freight & stock. In my time here I've learn the functions of WM / SCI & improved my skills using WORD / POWERPOINT. My co workers are next to amazing and great to work with. I'd say the hardest part about this job would be the certain members of management but all in all it really is a great place to work at if you have thick skin and motivated.
good,"Not much good to say about retail in general. Dicks Sporting Goods however has the worst business structure."
good,"Working at Dick's Sporting Goods , you will learn to handle with people by assertiveness and patient. Scheduling is highly flexible when trying to balance school or other jobs. Overall, developing sales and interpersonal skills is very essential working as a cashier."
good,It was alright work days. some better then others but when u are not o the same page it can make managers very upset even if you were just off  for a week and the are changing the store around for the new seasons. I have never work retail before this and I would hope other places in the mall doesn't act the same
good,"I have a degree in sports medicine. I know a lot about feet and gait analysis/kinesiology. I went in with a BA and an Associates degree (unrelated field) and yet I felt like I was treated like I knew nothing."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"This used to be a job that I looked forward to coming to work. But now I might get 13 hours a week, and that is almost every employee not just me. Pay is decent for a part time job but the lack of hours doesn't come close to making up for it. Management does some off the wall things occasionally. All in all if you are looking for a decent part time job while in school and you don't really need money just something to do then apply."
good,"dicks sporting goods overall is a good company to work for, get treated well from the time you start to the time you leave, co-workers were great always had some type of joke to keep you laughing and help enjoy your day at work"
good,Working at a brand new store taught me a lot. Im a hard worker and for it being the first time opening up a new store was a fun experience. Of course it had its up and downs with some of the people i worked with. I would usually do freight or work with customers on helping them find their right attire for clothes or shoes.
good,"While working at Dick's a fairly easy job to work, the corporation itself is made up of a bunch of snakes.  Employees are only a number there.  They want to pay you as little as possible while having you work the most hours as possible.  Management was very good in the store and I made some good friends working there, but the corporation as a whole is very heartless and takes advantage of its employees."
good,"Work was not hard, but management made it hard to cope with. Compensation was not the best."
good,"My day was spent building, fixing, and selling bikes for customers and the company."
good,This job is very easy. Try to keep busy. Look for another job that pays better while you work here. Unless your a manager you get payed very little to sell thousands of dollars.
good,"This is job has been helpful in giving me a steady income while I search for a job in my field, and a job I am truly passionate about. It has helped me improve on communication skills, customer service, and multi tasking. I have learned organization, time management and patience. This job had equipped me with skills I plan on using in my career."
good,"Retail, Great for Students in College or part-time job  Early morning arrival.  Laid back environment. Meet new customers each day"
good,"Typical day is running the floor to ensure your customers are getting serviced while merchandising and completing tasks. Dicks have not learned how to stop being such a task driven company so the associates can focus on the customers. Or another way to say it, is that they will not pony up additional payroll to get tasks completed and drive customer service."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods top management is forward looking although strategy is not always executed throughout the organization with properly aligned incentives."
good,Management not always the greatest but it can be a fun place to work
good,"I'm a cashier so my typical day consists of checking customers out, re-censoring merchandise and folding or hanging clothes for apparel to put back on the sales floor. "
good,"It's a very easy-paced, fun work environment. The management switches constantly, as do the employees. There are old employees leaving every month and new ones coming in for a short period of time before they leave. Overall, it's a very easy job with low-pay and new faces."
good,"As an apparel associate, there were always areas to recover and maintain. It was the busiest part of the store so customers were always needing attention and help. Customer service is a main goal that is a priority focus. Management was good for the most part. Communication appeared to be the biggest downfall; not everyone was always on the same page. Tasks had to be done over again because wrong directions had been given. Hardest part of the job is having to know about all the different styles in all the different brands. Most enjoyable part is that you work with people with similar interests as you."
good,"I enjoy working in a place that is sports and outdoors oriented.  Interacting with customers and sharing our sports related stories are my favorite part.  However, I have to work a lot of extra (unscheduled) hours as a salaried manager."
good,"I love the people I work with at this store, I love most of the customers that come in but in many ways this company seems very disorganized. New policies are unclear, there are not sufficient incentives to make employees want to stay and work their hardest, and the management at my location are fairly lackluster. It could be worse, I could have no job or be treated even more poorly ut this is not the best company on the planet. Especially considering that I had to be to the store at 11pm Thanksgiving evening last year while I am sure the CEO was sleeping or having a good time with his family."
good,friendly environment amazing experiences and customers. wide range or branding and knowledge on outdoor sporting goods
good,I worked there and was a great sales man but do to school I was treated farily
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Retail Job, sometimes can get really slow according to how busy it is at work, Plays the same 5 songs on the radio every day, management is overall pretty nice, co-workers were easy to get along with (sometimes snobby), dealing with impatient customers, most enjoyable part of the job would be working on the floor helping customers find what they are looking for."
good,Loved the job it was just time to look for a more steady job. The position I held was only part time.
good,"The best part about the job is definitely working with others on the staff, its a good group of people, most associates try to keep things pretty light.  Worst part is definitely mangement/corporate, wow do they do things backwards, and it is really hurting the company. They refuse to adequately staff the place and it shows in the customer service scores, and overall appearance of the store.  This leads to an overwhelming amount of pressure being placed on a few associates, to accomplish very unrealistic objectives.  As a part time job, its fantastic.  As for full time, it becomes a grind after a short while."
good,"Dicks Sportings Goods is a large retail chain that consists of many part time employees, and a full time management staff. The co-workers are made up of parents trying to make extra income and students. I enjoy assisting customers and striving to improve the stores metrics. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the inconsistant schedule, they are always cutting hours for budgetary reasons."
good,"The store I am employed at does not have good management, they are young and try to hard to be your friend instead of your boss. That seems to form favorites and alliances among the workers which causes major issues. Payroll and scheduling is awful, one week you might have 30 hours the next week you'll have 12. "
good,"It's fun to work here if you really are passionate about sports, but the pay sucks and they don't like to give benefits even to employees with full time hours."
good,"Lacking in any real product that has value, almost all of it was cut rate and not worth the money that was spent on it.  At the same time, employees were expected to make sure that they sold 'warrantees' that were completely useless and didn't have any kind of backing at all.  Management was all about making sure that your face was seen by every customer in the store, or else.  There was no emphasis on making sure that a single customer was taken care of, just say 'can I help you with anything?' and your job was done."
good,Communication seems to get lost. If you ever leave a message or ask somebody to do something it never gets done and the message seems to get jumbled around.
good,Promised promotions but then give it to other employees they can pay less to do the job.
good,"Typical retail environment. Everything is constantly changing, and you are responsible for meeting the goals and needs of the company. As long as your managers are understanding of time constraints, and you are willing to work harder than most, you will do fine in this organization. Enjoy the people you are working with because there is a very high turnover rate in this organization."
good,Management is not all on the same page so It causes chaos sometimes throughout all departments. Not all co-workers came to perform work but rather cheat the system. A typical day would be to clock-in by 3:30 and start by 3:45 and have a break at 6. By then I would have processed about 200 guns into the Department of Justice Gun Log System and provided loaders with 10 shipments of firearms. By 8:30 which Is lunch I would have laid out about 100 guns and logged them in. At 12 was another break and work has started to slow down but 80 percent of gun cage work was complete. At 2:30 was the end of the shift I would love up the cage and file all necessary paperwork.
good,It's hard work and face paced. It wears down your body quick.
good,Always very busy which i enjoy because i get to multitask. The tons of regulars we had for their kids in sports. I enjoyed helping people pick out athletic wear. I think every one were to close as friends and they needed to learn to separate that.
good,It was a typical retail job for the most part.
good,"A typical work day consisted of working out back stock onto the floor in the morning. During the work day it was all about helping customers find their desired product by providing knowledge about various alternatives. For closing time you would need to clean up what's left from the day's customer crowd to prepare for the morning, while still getting to remaining customers first. Most co-workers were young college aged students with a rush of hiring during seasonal time. The major drawback to the large seasonal group is the lack of discipline possessed which must then be corrected by veteran staff to keep optimal work flow."
good,Boring. How to run a company. Good for the most part. Fun. Store manager. Paycheck.
good,Dicks sporting goods can be fun but management does not listen to employees needs or give much opportunity for advancement.
good,Great job for building character and great for college students
good,"The management wasn't all that supportive and clear on the days objectives. The staff however were nice, friendly, and very helpful. The store overall is clean and presentable."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I was disappointed with my employment at Dick's because I was hired to do one jib, and then I often wound up standing by the door to greet customers which is not the job I thought I would get."
good,"The culture is arguably the best aspect about working there. This job is teaching me how to properly use my resources and also how to manage more effectively, also making sure that goals are met. But again, the best thing about working here is the people, and the things we sell."
good,Not bad. Depending on coworkers. Job get really repetitive. If you don’t mind that then this job might be for you. Wasn’t a fan of the higher ups constantly coming in to check up on employees.
good,it is a nice place to work i just need more hours to pay my bills its a nice clean store good people to work with management is good the pay there is alright
good,"Fun place to work at, some parts of the job can be tedious. Managers are friendly and understanding. They try to support and help the employees out as much as possible. Daily goals."
good,Learned how to put customers needs first and be nice to all customers even in difficult situations. The other team members were good to work with. Expected breaks were not always provided.
good,It was fun talking and dealing with all types of sports. I love football and track and being able to talk to other people and kids of my experience was the best.
good,It was a very good job for those who are in high school or want a very flexible job or second side job to make money all the people in the place were great and very kind to one another definitely a safe and stable work environment
good,Horrible Management and work ethic there.  They don't care about their employees.  They do try to keep the store nice.  Nice discounts though and employee coupons
good,"enjoyed the experience, great for people who are looking for a temporary job. great co-workers and great environment. management is nice and freiendly"
good,"Very customer focused, fast paced environment.  Many different departments within the store to get a bit of variety.  The other employees there were great.  Management always appeared to really care about their employees."
good,"Working here was a good experience. The place was very short staffed and was not helpful with working around my school schedule. Most of the people there were good to work with, but also didn't want to be there."
good,"It was  great experience working at Dicks sporting goods, very helpful and mindful management and team. Strong focal point on team involvement and the better of our community."
good,"we were always understaffed overworked and under appreciated. Turnover is very high and in the 6 months I worked there I probably worked with 10-15 different people quit due to the things I stated up above. Management purposefully works the weekdays so that they don’t work weekends which are high volume days. Overall, too much work to do and not enough people"
good,"Dick's is a decent place to work for a part-time college job. No drug test. Easy two interviews. Most of the time the job is pleasurable to work there. Stress levels are high because the lack of employees that they have working there. They thin out employee schedules for 1 person or none, in each department. This causes stress levels to be high due to customers needing attention in multiple departments at once with a lack of coverage on the floor. No benefits for employees besides leads or managers, which is typical for retail. The discount is 25% but can't use it on sale or clearance items, which the item than ends up being the same price as customers."
good,Honestly when I first started the culture there was awesome. Over the past few years I feel like corporate has veered away from why the company was first created and has forgotten about the people who make the real money for them at store level.
good,I started off full time but after a few months I had to adopt a second job with better hourly pay so I cut back to full time at dicks. Management at my location was great and personable as well as the employees. The job itself had more stagnant moments throughout the day than I would have liked though.
good,"Nice place to work, just need full time. Loved selling guns, working with customers and the discounts.  I needed more hours but overall it was a great place to work.  I enjoyed what I did."
good,"The job is rewarding when helping athletes find what they need for the desired activity, but the environment is task heavy and very fast paced. As long as you are a hard worker, you will always have hours to work."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Great coworkers and environment, but shady management screwed things up for me. The store managers all seem to force each other to keep a small circle of sales leaders, completely disregarding other associates."
good,It was an okay place to be. It just wasn’t meant for me. I need something a little bit more consistent. Great people though ! Great place to work part time
good,"Nice place to work at with excellent coworkers, flexible hours as well as many benefits. pay was fair for a starter job and the work load was very easy to deal with."
good,"many of the managers and staff do not properly manage the store how it should be managed. Employees almost fight for hours and it is known that if employees have ""butted heads"" with managers, these managers have intentionally not given people any shifts for a week at a time."
good,"As an hourly associate, this can be a very rewarding company to work for.  During my time as an hourly Lead, work/life balance was great, with excellent benefits and a fun work environment.  As a salaried manager, the work/life balance is completely tarnished.  Averaging well over 60+ hours per week, with no overtime, during non-holiday periods, vacation blackouts nearly the entire month of November and December, the job is just not very fulfilling.  The communication lines from CSC to the store level is not very efficient.  The compensation and the culture of the team that you develop around is what will make or break it for as a Salaried ASM or SM at Dick's Sporting Goods."
good,Poor corporate management and poor work-life balance. Not the worst but could be easily improved thought better corporate structure and understanding of day to day store life.
good,Prefer not to comment about the company. Everyone’s experience is different. I will say there’s a big turn around in associates as well as management. I’ve been ok my time here just looking for something part-time.
good,This job is an easy job to get experience in retail. Great people to work with. If you work part time the hours are fair and managers are great at working with you if you want more hours.
good,I did not enjoy my time at Dicks sporting goods. The management was not the greatest and often would not communicate what needed to be done. I was a sale team member and would often have no contact with my manger.
good,"I would cash people out, count the drawers, help customers find things they needed / wanted. I would also stock the shelves, and sort clothing, hang clothes on hangers, made sure they scanned correctly."
good,"The job provided a multitude of customer service related skills that will translate to future jobs in the industry. Surrounded by fellow sports fans, in a fast, fun, and energetic environment."
good,"Ive only worked there for 4 months, its been quite different than what i thought it was gonna be.  I havent had many good experiences with both management and customers."
good,"Fun place to work, competitive atmosphere.  Hardest part of the job is work life balance.  most enjoyable part of the job is seeing kids get excited over sports gear."
good,"The people who worked at the place are very friendly. The place I worked at had good flow of people and the days work went by quickly. We were pushed to have people make credit cards for them, which was probably the hardest part of the job."
good,"The time I worked at Dick's Sporting Good, it went from a friendly, customer emphasis, to a stressful, get products to the floor and priced correctly.  Which, at times, was to the detriment of the customers.  So, customers would become hostile to the associates, due to the lack of customer support."
good,"The people whom I worked with were great people, that including the superivsior. It was the customers who come to the resistger who could or would not look for someone in that department to answer their questions was annoying."
good,Everyday was particularly the same. Unloaded trucks sometimes and categorized products. Rang the register sometimes. A lot of assisting customers on the floor.
good,"Working for this company is for a special kind of person. The management was incredibly rude, frustrating, and they create a rather toxic environment."
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is a great first job for any young adults. Offers good skills when it comes to working in customer service. The tasks in the workplace is not so difficult to get done.
good,"It was an okay place to work since at the time I was playing a sport, going to school, and working there. So they worked well with my schedule. But I have heard its really different since I have been there."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Dick’s Sporting Goods is geared more for the younger kids. High school and college. It appeared that the managers were on a strict allocation of hours for the employees. Always seem to be shorthanded. We received golf clubs and golf supplies at seven in the morning and have had to have everything stocked by nine or 930 and sometimes it wasn’t enough time For one person. Stressful but we got it done
good,"Use to be a fun environment to work in. With all the cutbacks and new management , we all have to work 3 times as hard with 10 times more stress because we have minimal employee's on the floor and micromanaged. Nothing like being in your 40's and being treated like a 5 year old."
good,Working at Dicks Sporting Goods isn’t any different than working at an other retail sports store. Working there it requires you to be focused and dedicated in getting your different objectives done every day.
good,"I enjoyed doing floor plans with some of the employees, one of the leads was very helpful on how to do floor plans, very productive thorough and kind."
good,NA I don't wish to comment. The work balance is terrible. Management is not good. Associates work off the clock. That will be all i will say. Benefits are good. Stress level is high. No ac on until 9am going in at 6 am with no air is horrible.
good,The company pays too little and asks for too much of their employees. They stress on them hard and while never giving them enough credit for juggling customers and daily tasks.
good,This position was  like any other retail position. Lots of work at minimum wage but it was nice to be around sports if you are into  athletics. The manager treated people as statistics as opposed to people.
good,"I didn't necessarily love working here, but it was an alright job. Management was pretty laid back which I appreciated given the nature of the job. Wish pay was more."
good,"Company ws fun to work at but wasn't there for very long. Typical day involved sales and stocking the sales floor. Pay was not good, but was a great job for any college student"
good,"Fun atmosphere to work in, but with hours being cut, not enough floor coverage, requiring more expected from you than you are compensated for. Pay and benefits are not the best."
good,Cool environment you have lots of fun on the job. You’ll enjoy more if you’re people person. Good discounts on store merchandise. Opportunities to advance.
good,Under-appreciated and underpaid. Management chooses who to hold accountable and is inconsistent with discipline. Turnover is extremely high so its hard to develop relationships.
good,I had a good experience. I was able to learn some skills to help better my future. They did pretty good on scheduling when I was going to school. Enjoyed working with my peers.
good,The store was fine. What you would expect in a retail position. I worked there for 9 months with out problems. They gave me time off as needed given that I told them with good time.
good,There was always a list of things I had to do each day. I would have to work at a fast pace to get the things done on time. Management was fine all they asked was to get your job done. My job was not hard just fast paced. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,The people I worked with at Dick's was the reason I stayed there. They were wonderful and easy to get along with and work with. They were very understanding and helpful and would do anything they could to help each other.
good,Typical retail. Working 50+ hours a week. Overall DSG is making strong moves for the future with the online competition at a peak. It is a fun work environment just be prepared to be married to your work.
good,They pay their employees very poorly for the tasks assigned. Department leads are doing the jobs of 3-4 people and making 12/hour. This company needs a complete overhaul of their incentives if they want to stay open.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"dick's sporting goods can be  great place to work with the right managers in charge, work flow seems to be less stressful if your supervisors are less stressed,"
good,Typical day was pretty slow unless we were really busy. The culture was pretty good. A lot of the employees were also college students my age so it was easy to relate to them.
good,My only complaint about my experience at Disk's was the lack of staff in our department. Upper management knew about it but never hired anyone for our department. They only hired for apparel.
good,"The work environment at Dick's was very independent, and loose, but supervised well. This was my first retail job and it was a great experience. I learned a lot about the basics of working in a Sporting Good's store."
good,Not a great place to work at but definitely not the worse. Management should be more educated and not just hired on who knows who (which happened all the time)
good,Provides something different then your average retail job as the sports sections let you work in an area you care about. Easy to use systems allow for simple transitions into the job.
good,"I had my interview and was hired on the spot, was told I was going to be making more than three-quarters of the employees. I was only getting paid $8 something and only had part time hours. The environment was very relaxed and casual due to the athletic dress code. Their prices were super high, even when 'on sale' and with the employee discount. They did provide ear pieces which was very effective for communication. Basically the pay and hours would've been ok if I was still in school, but I wouldn't recommend it for a working adult as the only means of income. Left for a better, higher paying job."
good,This was just a part time just have extra income great team I worked with an management was great if need extra cash. Company will work with you on time needed.
good,poor management is one of the issues with this company. They have no consideration of employee needs. They don't work with your schedule.but overall the job is easy
good,"Working with such a big staff was a lot of fun. Not only did it help the work day go better, it made completing projects easier because you were working as a team."
good,At Dick's Sporting Goods the management was rough. I always felt like I knew more about the product than my managers. This job is fast paced and the pay was low.
good,I worked holiday season.  They would get upset if you missed a weekend shift or any shift.  I know it was the holidays but we still have family lifes and can't be there all the time.  I was scheduled almost every night and every weekend and was to miss a lot of my children's activities.  I'll pass.
good,I haven't worked their in  awhile so Idk what it's like now. When I did management was terrible customers sucked and no one would listen to your opinions.
good,"I loved working at Dicks Sporting goods because there was always something to be doing and someone to be helping. Even though the work was repetitive it was still challenging and rewarding. I was able to meet and work with all kinds of people. We worked as a team and always was running around trying to get everything done, never enough hours in the day. I worked as a salary manager so I got to coach and help people grow into their rolls. the thing that did get me down is that I was expected to always be working on my days off.  Would end up working 60 hours or more a week. salary managers do not get paid overtime so in the end I really wasnt getting paid anything. it was also really hard to get any time off even if asked for months in advance."
good,"a solid company, good on-line interaction for specialty items, great atmosphere for the sports minded individual, nice community interaction, offers solid relocation options."
good,"it was produtive sold many things, i had a decent time working it was fun and stressfull but not over bearing. Most coustomers were polite and respected my opinion and help."
good,"I assist customers in looking for the right fit that they believe will raise the level of their golf game."
good,"As a cashier I spent much of my time customer-facing.  I learned how to handle cash, interpersonal skills, and how working in retail is.  Management was great.  Collaborative all-around."
good,In a consistent state of chaos.  Management does not communicate with each other and with employees under them. Pay is competitive. if Hired full time benefits are active within 30 days.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Working at the DC is very physically demanding and fast paced, but it is a rewarding company. I have learned a lot about how products are distributed and processed. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new skills and that the employees get constant recognition of a job well done. Most of the supervisors were friendly, however, I feel they should have worked more as a team instead of trying to outdo each other."
good,Managers and supervisors did not give proper training to complete job role at hand. Very spotty management and rude coworkers. Pay was not good and the work schedule was very erratic.
good,"It was fun working at Dick’s. But its not a career starter. Bag searches, catty coworkers, but they did track your sells and credit card sells and rewarded you"
good,"Discount was nice for a few items but the stores stock is expensive, so it didn't help that much."
good,"Started out great, loved working there. Not paid enough for the amount of work that is asked, a nice work environment. New hires made more even though I had been working there for awhile."
good,"Very difficult to get time off, some managers were not very likable by their coworkers and often made it unenjoyable to work. I requested to have a weekend off over a month in advance and it was denied almost immediately."
good,I was able to work there around my school schedule and was promoted twice. Coworkers were great and it was an enjoyable place to work. Once I finished school I was ready to move on.
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy sports.  Work as part of a team, and advance through the racks if you wish.  Hourly associates have a great time however managing at Dick's is quite a challenge."
good,"Provide register coverage as needed and ensure strong customer service standards are met by supporting cashiers through complex transactions"
good,"Small company growing pains, limited resources and demanding workload make up some of the challenges associated with vXchnge but they don’t outweigh the pros"
good,Work life balance is lacking and things get overwhelming around the holidays. Standards can be unrealistic when it comes to different elements of the job
good,"I'm still not sure how I feel about working here. The training to start was very poor. We watched some introductory videos about the company, and then we were put out on the floor for our second day. I felt clueless out there most of the time; however, the lead was busy and was not able to train me very much that day. The only thing I knew to do was help customers I saw walking around, but I didn't feel prepared enough to help most of them. Next day working they put me on a register with no training-had to ask coworkers questions all day about returns, security tags, discounts, etc. Once I knew what I was doing, it was fun. It's a nice environment with the coworkers, but training is very minimal, and I think alot of that falls on management."
good,This was a really fun job working in sporting goods. I met a lot of great people there. Didnt seem like there was much advancement opportunity at the time.
good,"I worked here several years ago. While I was at this job, they provided me with flexible hours. I enjoyed working at Dick's even if it was for a short time."
good,"Everything Golf, tons of training and very challenging"
good,I enjoyed working for Dicks during the time I was there.  Very flexible with my class schedule and allowed me time off when I needed it.  Training was also very good.
good,Dick's was a fair place to work.   The scheduling could've been better.  No real training . Expected a lot for the amount paid.  Heavy lifting required but not disclosed.
good,Working at Dick's Sporting Goods was a good experience right out of high school. I was able to develop customer service skills and general people skills.
good,"Managers ""hid"" in the office while the inmates ran the asylum.  When business got heavy, the managers disappeared and let the lead employees handle everything.  Employees came in late ( if they showed up at all) and were not held accountable in any way.  Associates were shuffled around to different areas to cover for those who were late."
good,"Responsibilities and team-work was great, the expectation the management put on us however was unreasonable and consistently kept us from performing our job duties."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,good company to work for...…………good department heads………clean displays  constant sales discounts………………………………………………...would recommend dick's to a friend.
good,"The people are fun to work with, but they do not guarantee hours which makes it difficult when you're trying to pay your bills by a certain time each month. Good side gig."
good,"Opportunity to get sales experience if that is an area you are interested in. Put in spots that you are passionate about, golf, hiking, running, gaming etc."
good,Great company to work for in the day but they started changing the importance of the golf professional to drive revenue for that department and it was time to move on
good,"The management at their stores tends to be pretty poor. They try to get you to do more work for less pay, and may not promote you, or compensate you for your certifications."
good,"At first everything was as promised, friendly work environment, training as a cashier to learn the ropes before advancing to HR, normal work hours, the occasional potluck or Saturday treats and so on. After training, at least for me was an empty promise of advancement was stuck as a cashier for months and position was given to someone else. Stayed because I believed they would deliver on a position that was promised. Only left after realizing that I had been forgotten. I appreciate the opportunity to work but at least tell me I'm no longer getting the position. I hated finding out through a third party."
good,Working at Dick's Sporting Goods was a fun exciting place to work. I really enjoyed the people I worked with until corporate fired almost everyone in the store. While working there I had 6 different store managers.
good,Love the golf part of the job. Golf is very important to Dick's Sporting Goods. The golf facilities are top notch. And every golf employee at Dick's Sporting Goods is very knowledgeable of golf and golf equipment.
good,Working at Dick's was a true sport themed environment. It was competitive in the quotas that employees had to reach within the end of the week but overall okay working environment.
good,"Typical days were spent doing many jobs outside of actual job description. Worked as a ""team"" so typically I was stuck with all the work, didn't mind picking up the slack just never received any recognition for it."
good,"Dicks is very fun to work at, but they push credit cards and scorecards on the employees, and if they do not reach the quota they get lectured. But the management always tried to make it fun and a friendly competition."
good,"I folded all the clothes, from fitting rooms to returns, I helped move heavier items for guests, cashier experience, cleaned displays cleaned whenever necessary, move kayaks and canoes to close the store"
good,"I really enjoyed working here. However, employee management and staying true employee's availability was poor. Me along with several co-workers had the same issue of being scheduled outside of our availability."
good,the store was clean and always looked nice. but the managers were always rude and couldn't really ask for anything. The worst part was if you were late even by 1 minute you were given a point and you only had 8 points in a whole 6 months.you would also gets 2 points if you got sick and were unable to make it. One time i had gotten a shift covered and the girl didn't show up. I was penalized but she wasn't.
good,"It’s an okay place for more youthful applicants. There was a lot of outside drama brought into the work place due to that youthful culture. As I aged, it was something I no longer wanted to deal with on a day to day."
good,Must be able to work hard depending on the the department you work in. Depending on your position you'll have to be able to wake up very early to put away the consistent large deliveries.
good,Dicks sporting goods was really great for a while until i was there for a year and then after that things just got worse because they wouldnt work around my school schedule and wouldnt let me get the days i needed off.
good,"Dick's is a fast paced work environment, you are up on your feet all day. The managers are amazing and make work fun. You have short breaks, everyone is very nice to you."
good,The people you work with are usually awesome! Good vibes. Easy job. Get a 25% discount on most items. Meet new people and get to hang out in the back on slow days. No benefits though
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Aside from providing me the skills of working with and accommodating for customers, Dick's provided an easy work environment.  I got along well with all associates and managers were clear and understanding"
good,"management at Dick's is great they make sure all employees are happy and make sure the work space is fun and uplifting. very easy place to work at, good environment"
good,Working for this company was an amazing experience. It was fast-paced and the location was in a high traffic zone which created a steady business flow.
good,Co-workers are great with and you can learn a lot. Management is questionable depending on which store you work at. You are often given more tasks to complete than you are able to during your shift.
good,I only worked at dick's for two months before my college semester began but it was definitely my favorite job so far.  The downside is i couldn't secure my job the following summer.
good,Did not work the full 40 hours. Only gave you 30 minutes for lunch. Never received vacation time. Benefits are good. Need to know about each department.
good,"Extensive amount of customer service. A typical day includes assisting customers based off needs. After business hours, the job includes zoning and reorganizing store for next business day."
good,"Working there was a chance to meet lots of military personnel, past, present, and future.  It was like a social club to me.  The only part I did not like about this company was that it should have been more profit sharing, and investing in 401ks."
good,I literally never knew who my boss was hours were so minimum but i worked in the shoe department were i learn i was good at sales i mean very good surprised myself
good,You learn a lot working as a customer service specialist in a large store like Dicks. I learned to be extremely patient with people and to never let my anger get the best of me in a professional environment
good,"working in the golf department was very relaxed, slowest department at the store i worked in as district managers refused to spend the money to put in the hitting bay so would get MAYBE 1-3 customers a day so pretty relaxed. most of the time spent doing club repairs (normally just swapping out grips or cutting down or extending club lengths)"
good,you can learn a lot if you keep a good attitude. work place culture is solid. employee dress code is relaxed for the most part. the hardest part of the job is standing on your feet all day long.
good,"Great temporary job; however, management is not well organized. The work place culture was great, yet working retail is not fun. I would not recommend."
good,"Fun place to work, not a solid career choice unless you are in management. Morning time was best.. usually tasked out already for placing ads.. evenings were rushed"
good,"Busy store, tons of traffic, customers with high expectations and attitudes.  "
good,This was a job that I had during my college years.  I gained a lot of experience in dealing with customer service.  I enjoyed my co-workers and also enjoyed the customers.
good,At first it was really fun but then it changed. There are too many cliques there and the managers didn't help that. Overall customers were nice and work was easy.
good,Competitive work environment. Associates and managers were great. Provided tools to be successful in and outside of your everyday job. Also helped with career advancement.
good,"Working at Dicks Sporting Goods was a great learning experience. I learned the basics of identifying and selling firearms in the Hunting and Fishing Department, how to help customers find what they needed and how to manage our inventory. The managers were fair and fun to work with. Culture in the workplace was very intense and fast-paced. The hardest part of the job was the amount of negativity received from customers when they did not get what they wanted but I enjoyed the job I had as it gave me a tremendous amount of experience."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a good place to work overall, but due to the fact that it's a retail job, your hours can vary and change. One week, I worked 30+ hours, 2 weeks later, I'm not scheduled at all and I have to find a new job just to meet my bill payments."
good,"Good place to work for a high school/college student. Learned a lot about retail sales.  Work place was rather busy especially around holidays, but overall a great experience."
good,Good place to work with a fast-paced environment.  It is a typical retail work environment.  Co-workers are fun and management makes the working environment enjoyable.
good,management is a joke!  they do not care about there employees safety or well being.  they are more concerned about moving things around store than they are about helping customers
good,Dick's is a very nice place to work if you have a good store manger. If you have a ad store manager it is not nearly as nice a place to work. quick paced and always something to do.
good,"Good company, fast-paced, lots of responsibility, lots of people, lots of personalities. Good job for part-time or student. they will keep you busy!!!"
good,"Worked here part time while I was in community college, they are usually flexible with what hours you ask for. Like most places the people who are higher up in charge aren't quite fond of the requests and flexibility you tend to seek."
good,I was the type to always try and find a come up and hustle hard all on my own. When i started at Dicks Sporting Goods ive learned that a team can help you in many ways. Ive learned and developed my potential because of the people
good,"This position was just for me to earn a couple extra dollars as I substitute taught and coached football. After I was done with the season, I decided to move on to Best Buy."
good,You have the opportunity to advance quickly. This is because of the high turnover. Raises are offered often in the first year of employment. Management was severely lacking.
good,"It was an okay job. It's retail so it gets stressful at times when lines are long and there are not enough cashiers there to help. I would recommend this job as a first-time job, be it full time or part-time."
good,"DSG is a good company to work for. The workplace environment on an associate level is fun, and fast-paced. Interacting with customers and managers simultaneously to give the best customer experience is a challenge. Only a few are truly able to keep up, but when you get used to it, it's a blast. When you get the All-Star associates all working together, you can sell the whole store."
good,Never know what it’s going to Be like. Working here sucks because your other team players don’t clean up UNLESS they work the night shift cause they are lazy. I recommend not working here
good,"While the overall environment was fine, having a store manager and district manager work in the store led to favoritism at times. Other than small management issues the coworkers were awesome, and helping out customers with their sporting needs felt good as well."
good,"To be honest, most of the workers there are friendly, but management is just the worse! they don't help out at all and just hang out all day. And then its a problem when u need them."
good,Good company just not enough pay to live off of only way it’s worth it if it’s full time other then that waste of time very relaxed except for start of baseball and holiday seasons
good,"Lots to doo, good customers,great work place technology, very good benefits,very good place to learn the retail trade and hone customer service skill,good place to work if you like sports"
good,"While working @ Dick there were a lot of changes in management & supervisors quitting. Work load including mandatory Saturdays, and volunteer Sundays. During my time of employment, there were a lot of changes in Management & the quitting of supervisors as well as the murder of an employee who had given up information of alleged thefts by Dicks employees, second shift within the warehouse. A lot negative elements during this time from January 2015 - June 2015."
good,Typical work day is much like any other retail environment. Some times its hectic sometimes its slow. regardless there is always something that needs to be done. And of course there are always the customers to think of.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Workday is structured with set goals and tasks to be completed. Shifts go by relatively quickly as one is always engaging customers by providing support for the customer's needs. Management was good and direct when need be. Although, workplace culture suffered due to lack of hours and staffing therefore resulting on more pressure on each employee. It was always a pleasure helping out customers find what they were looking for to go to their event."
good,"DICKS Was a good place to work while attending college, however I feel that I can be an asset to another company outside of retail.  Working at dicks it was always something different everyday which was always keeping you ready for the next task."
good,Work environment was good but I was hired and trained and then never scheduled. Person I needed to talk to was never in and the company just kept me hanging on and having to call in for a non-existent schedule. Basically a waste of their time and mine.
good,Dicks was a fun place to work and learn about sporting goods but didn't spend a lot of time there. I love sports and worked here during the rest of year kings island was closed.
good,"fun place to work and learn about the fitness, outdoor industry.  enjoyed working on bicycles and helping people pick out the correct bike for their needs."
good,"Early hours (4:30am start) then shortage of days to days to work if the sales were down. there point system was annoying, there communication between management was bad"
good,"nice job, typical day, is to check out around 60-80 people.As a lead, I learned good leadership skills from this position, to make sure that everyone is on the same page as far as meeting goals and hitting our metrics. the hardest part is working with other leaders who feel more in power than the rest when we all hold the same position or those who don't work as a team. the most enjoyable part is the team work and effort from all the good people who like to work."
good,"Depending on what store you work at and what managers you work with will make a world of difference. You must have a good attitude to be able to handle a place such as Dick’s Sporting Goods, otherwise this isn’t the place for you."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is great for young people in their late teens (mainly college students tying to earn a buck). Dick's Sporting Goods is very relaxed. As long as Scorecard percentage, protection plan, and credit card goals are reached (which are actually easy after sales pitch becomes natural), there really is nothing to worry about for all departments. The only thing would be to keep everything neat, no one bothers you. But when goals aren't reached, managers WILL harass you, and make you work extra hard and find excuses to call you out if small issues aren't taken of. My experience at Dicks Sporting Goods overall was a great. There was a lot learned in the persuasion of sales and really understanding people, whether it be managers or customers on a positive and negative note."
good,"Great first job or a job for a college student.  Retail is what it is, but management was very easy to work for.  Hours lacked, but all-in-all, a fun place to work."
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods is very flexible with students and their school schedules. This is one of the main reasons why I enjoy working their. They have dealt well with me as I was in my undergraduate program. Many of the workers are fun and easy to get along with. Like every company, there are some flaws, but overall the job is fairly easy. I get to work with a diverse group of customers, most of whom are very polite and fun. The hardest experience I have had with this company is working during the holiday season. Traffic flow of customers becomes heavy, but over the years I have been able to find the best ways to handle it and still work effectively."
good,"Good to have if your'e going to school because they schedule around that, the job itself feels like you don't get paid enough for what you do have to deal with depending on the department you work. Id go footwear its the only one that really doesn't have to get on the register."
good,"The workers where fun, the managers where alright. The only thing was the way they tracked how many shoes associates sold, you would have to stick a sticker on the shoe when bringing out the shoe but if the customer doesn't buy the shoe then it is a wasted sticker and when it gets busy how can you track who and what customer is buying the shoe so its hard to get every shoe you sold precisely in numbers. Another big thing i didn't like was the shout out system or the ""excellent customer service"" because you can just shout yourself out for doing good and i feel like you can just shout yourself out all day and end up getting a ""million"" stickers just to be the employee of the month, i feel like the shout out system should be only shouting out other associates because your associate friend is actually impressed by your customer service and is taking the time to shout you out."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a good place for a young individual who enjoys sports to work. I started as a cashier and moved over to team sports. They were very understanding about my scheduling because I am also a full time student,"
good,"It was fun to work there but there were downsides to the job as well."
good,"It was an alright job to have in between selecting my career. Customer service is top priority, you should have a high tolerance for rude customers, and enjoy the pleasant ones."
good,It was a really great place to work when i first started.  A new manager came in and she started changing things.  Change is good when they are beneficial but the way she changed things employee moral dropped.
good,"get paperwork find product throughout the building to load"
good,"I have worked there for 2 years. I have seen managers come and go but there was only four that have stayed since grand opening. When they brought a new store manager in they assumed everything they new from home depot was correct, Not the case. They were blind and leading people that did know what they were doing to their demise. They will cut your hours in thirds with no notice and expect you to be okay with it."
good,while working at dicks sporting good they gave me very few hours and while working there they would always find something to stress about. I guess you could say just the management would need spiffing up besides that the customers were great and the team members were fantastic.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,This is a fun place to work i love working here i had a great experience i had a great time the staff was fun i did alot while i was here i experienced alot
good,"Created floor plans regarding the departments major moves and how it would be implemented"
good,timing praise excellent perfect arrest timing standards normal human insane tiring great good timing hunt insane limited options future good courageous
good,If you like sports then its a great place to work at. Willing to work around your schooling schedules. Easy going place and some great people you get to work with.
good,"relaxed place where i could enjoy methodically building bikes, fitness equipment, or steaming gloves. good place to work with good people, but not enough hours where i happened to be."
good,"The job itself is pretty simple and straightforward however management is not up to the standards I would expect from a company such as dicks.  Also customers were generally rude at the location the I had worked, mostly due to the dysfunctional environment."
good,"overall it was a fun place to work at, there is always something new everyday. with so many departments there is a lot that you can learn. its always busy so there is always something to do. taking care of the customer is the main priority."
good,High turnover rate within the company. Management struggles to work together in a timely and efficient manner. Learned valuable customer service and people pleasing skills.
good,Was a great place to work out a while in school.  Great people to work with and a fun culture.  Flexible hours and typically willing to work with you on days off
good,"*Built Fitness equipment and bikes"
good,Good summer job for High Schoolers/collge kids but a lot of drama involved and some people did not get along. Some favorites were  made by the management and the other employees seemed to wind up with other tasks which the favorites could have very well done.
good,Long hours and unstable scheduling lead to easy burnout.  Direction from corporate lacks a true vision and is very difficult to get a definitive answer on many subjects.
good,Able to incorporate your ideas and they be taken into consideration. Sports fanatic place to work. Job advancement opportunities exist. You become knowledgeable of various areas in the sports field.
good,"Rate of pay does not increase after you ""max out"" for your job title. Very demoralizing. Length of employment does not matter. Nor does the type of employee you are. Examples are for instance : not calling in, tardiness, and over-all job performance."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dicks Sporting Goods, although when I asked for Sundays off due to the fact that I had committed to coaching a fall league team they did not listen to me and scheduled me on those days making me have to choose between them and something I very much enjoyed doing."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Great place to work if you are looking for a relaxing job with not too much of demand. Management was decent, and great perks of working in store if you are into sports."
good,"As a Team Sports section employee, a typical day at work involved helping customers in the sports, fitness, and bike section of the store. I was also on call to help out at the register when lines got long. "
good,"company was evolving to better train and equip leaders within the organization.  Currently, they have one of the best external training programs for incoming leadership.  reccommend."
good,"Very well run corporate Sporting Goods outlet.  While generally positive, it can at times suffer from the negativity that minimum wage retail employees often succumb to.  Excellent company as a whole, I would recommend to others!!!!"
good,Dicks Sporting Goods consisted of a fun working place. Employees were encouraged to make the job fun while abiding by the companies mission. There wasn't a lot of change that happened day to day.
good,Asked to switch departments every week for a month straight and nothing was ever done. Lack of communication between department managers and store manager.
good,"Going into any retail job you should kind've know what your bound to expect. If your completely content with working retail, you probably won't mind the job too much. It's a very laid back environment with a lot of friendly people who all have a passion for the department your set to work in. There is footwear, team sports, apparel, and so on.. I'd guess the overall management for the entire company is pretty good. If your okay with making 9-10 bucks an hour and your a high school student this job would do you just fine. If you don't like being told what to do all the time and are interested in being able to afford your monthly expenses, turn back now."
good,"I worked there for three years between two different stores. I liked what I did. But it just got old after a while. There is a lot of bs that goes on there, but there are also a lot of good times. It's a great place to be if you just need a temporary job. One tip though, never work for the Mason, Ohio location."
good,"Since it is retail, you have to keep your head on a swivel and be prepared to assist in multiple departments, not just your own. Dealing with customers is a stressful task, so you must be resilient."
good,"I was responsible for running the warehouse, cleaning the rest rooms. I also worked as a cashier. I strung the tennis  rackets and also sized and drilled bowling balls ."
good,"Great company & name, but direction is lacking at store levels due to constant change and inconsistent in management goals and style. Must be able & willing to sacrifice family life in order to succeed"
good,Nice job to work for if you're looking to earn a little extra money while in college. The management was alright. Does not seem like a company to really move up in though.
good,I worked here for a while and was promised a promotion for several months without ever receiving it. The scheduling is usually changed without notification.
good,"I am usually stocking, recovery the store, answering phones, and running a register.  Folding clothes and hanging clothes.  I also will help run the register if needed."
good,Workplace culture was such that all departments worked well together. The most enjoyable part of my job was training new team members and watch them succeed
good,It's ok. Warehouse work. Has the usual busy times and slow times. offer vto (voluntary time off) when it is slow. The vacation time is nice. Benefits are ok.
good,"I enjoyed the time i worked at Dick Sporting Goods, the paid fairly and if you were a hard worker you were good on hours. Very fun place to work to get some job experience."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Working here was an average experience. Basically what you would expect working in a retail store. Not much pressure to open credit cards unlike other places.
good,"it was a nice and invaluable experience to open a store, however there was a massive budget reduction afterwards. I met great people and gained new experiences in my short time there"
good,Management was cool I learned a lot from working here some days might work hard some days real laid back just aint like the getting paid every two weeks in its a good company to work for off weekends.
good,Everyday is different. Some days are slow and some days are fast paced. There are things to do everyday and you must learn to manage time between finishing tasks and helping customers.
good,My typical workday was getting the sales floor ready for the day and making sure everything was nice and neat. I folded clothes and put them away most of the day. When shipment came in i had to restock the floor and the stock room. This job entails dealing with customers the whole day in helping customers in finding what they are looking for. The hardest part of this job was dealing with nasty customers that didn't understand certain things like if we didn't have something in stock. The most enjoyable part of this job were the people i worked with. Management was a little iffy at the time i worked here.
good,The supervisors were great with working with my schedule during collegiate sports. I had great co-workers who were fun to work with especially on really long shifts.
good,It was a seasonal position. I will like to be hire full time  for the summer months. Part time during the school time. Management was very helpful during my training period.
good,It was a good place to work. It changed and management become less involved in your growth. The culture become stagnant and long hours. I learned to adapt to the ever changing world of retail.
good,"I would say my experience at Dick's Sporting Goods wasn't bad, but it was no where near good. When I switched departments to better fit my school schedule they lowered my pay. They started to schedule me more hours that my grades were suffering. So I had to quit."
good,"it was always a busy day , even when the traffic was light in the store. I always felt like a team member. I enjoyed coming to work, we  were like a family. "
good,"dick,s sporting goods is a great place to work fair treatment and a great place to grow. great employees as well as management "
good,"good retail environment for sports minded the pay scale is adequate "
good,its basically what you look for in a part time job. nothing really special about this place though. so neither for it or against working at dicks sporting goods.
good,Unloading and loading trucks for shipments.I learned packing and shipping skills as well as managing a full warehouses staff.The workplace culture was to put customers first and to make them happy.The hardest part of the job was that there wasn't enough hours to get everything done. Since it was a retail store they were cutting payroll all the time.
good,"The company is great and growing really fast but those successes are not enjoyed by the employee. "
good,Working at Dick's was a pretty ideal part time job while in college. the hours were flexible and it is not a high stress job while still teaching valuable customer service lessons.
good,Expect way too much out of their part-time employees who are not being paid enough. The management is very lackluster and never around to give advice or a helping hand.
good,Experience depends heavily on location and management. Good management allows for a fun work environment. Hours are extremely flexible. All employees are 18+ which is a nice bonus for retail.
good,Working at dicks wasn't my ideal job. It had its perks but overall id give it a 7 out of 10. Mangement could have been better. The workspace was fun and my co-workers we fun to be around i had a good time with them.
good,I started as a part time employee and worked my way in to management. Great opportunity if you're looking for a career. This is also a fun place to work while you're in school.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Helping customers, varying schedule, little pay, coming in before store hours, and staying after to finish freight that comes in every couple of days.  Very Repetitive."
good,Nice place to work for students. You can move up in management with hard work and dedication. You get to interact with hundreds of different people everyday.
good,I helped everyone with whatever they needed. Mainly with fishing gear and camping information. I also assisted customers with hunting and shooting.
good,this job is not a hard job. Setting gameplans is the most difficult thing to do which is not tough to figure out. I've had good management and bad. Some managers care about moral some don't. overall it's not really enjoyable but is easy to get by or move up depending on the effort you put in
good,"I enjoy working in the footwear department and have a passion for sneakers.  Our footwear lead is very fair and a hard worker.  A frustration of mine is that there are a handful of people who do minimal work, come in late, call-in sick all the time etc. and there are no repercussions.  I have heard that it is more of a pain for management to fire people so that is why they do not"
good,a typical day at work is long but fun you get to interact with a bunch of guests that have some really cool story's to tell about there adventures and their hobbies
good,Casual work environment you come to work in clothing that represents the department that you work. It is a retail store so things can be very numbers based at times.
good,"From being in a management position, I learned how to appropriately work in a customer service position, handle opening and closing deposits, and take care of daily sales reports from all departments."
good,"enjoyed the people "
good,Not much full time opportunity but it is a great opportunity to get your feet wet in customer sales.  Plenty of varying positions and secure location.
good,"The work place was a fun environment, but I did not receive enoug hours for a good check. The job was not productive enough and by it not being productive it would make the times that work boring."
good,"While the clientele and products allow for an exciting work environment, results typically took priority over personal and company integrity resulting in a very negative situation for team members."
good,"I would come in and stock shelves, zone items, help customers, and sell guns and ammunition. The hardest part of the job was not having a supervisor the whole time i worked there."
good,"A very fast paced retail environment where you are required to wear many hats and just because you get hired for a certain position, know that you will be pulled in many other areas to help out whether it be on the phone, cashiering, assisting a customer in a certain area of the store, or maybe help cleaning the restrooms. There are great people who will help out along the way but advancing in this company is all upon what you put into this job. Management is different from store to store but somehow this company follows a culture that lends itself to that you are empowered to learn and soak up everything you can because the more you can do and know the more you will be compensated for."
good,"I worked here in the apparel department and it was a never-ending battle. It was always the largest, messiest department with the most work to be done. Once a table of shirts was perfected, you'd move to the next one. Within 5 minutes, your previous table would be destroyed again. It wasn't a bad job, but it required a lot of patience and a love for folding clothes and constantly keeping busy. Having a lot to do always made the shifts go by pretty quick. Overall, it was fun for a retail job and all my coworkers were very friendly."
good,"Nice coworkers"
good,"Fast paced work environment with an enfaces on sports. Managers and Co workers are a pleasure to work with. However, there are little benefits for part-time employees and you may work six days a week to get 30 hours. They will work with your schedule if you are a student but I would not recommend a retail position as a full time job unless you become a manager."
good,"A typical day at work included money handling and customer service. I learned how to customer service skills and how to sensor clothing. The managers were great and taught me a lot, but failed to tell me I was a temporary employee. I really enjoyed my co-workers and built many friendships. The hardest part of the job was receiving hours and the most enjoyable was that there was constant traffic."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Always made me feel welcome and presented a good working environment. Always had the right tools to do my job and the best part was probably the occasional pizza.
good,Started before christmas and was told I would be full time hours but never was scheduled over 30 per week.  Training was short and never given information on all duties required that need performed.
good,"I was quickly promoted through the Lodge department. Overall, management was fair. During my employment our store went through multiple general managers and staff turnover."
good,Good company and continually trying to grow and gain market share in the US.  It is a young company and they do try to develop talent from within the current base of employees.
good,"good part time if your looking for sports fields Must know all sports, good management team and hardiest part of job is being able to stand for several hours"
good,"MANAGEMENT WAS GREAT! BEING ABLE TO INTERACT WITH CUSTOMERS.Helping them with boats fishing rods, poles, lures, sports equipment and fitness. On the other other hand there was not enogh hours"
good,I really enjoy my time working here on the holiday season and the people I worked with.  I like the stuff that I worked with including hunting supplies and firearms. The only complaint that I have is that the store was a mess really.  It wasn't organized and was not very neat.  I would say a solid 95% of the people that worked there were really nice to me and helped me if I had any problems.  I really did enjoy this job because the things I was able to work around was one of things I truly love to do in life which is hunting.
good,"Work/life balance is hard.  Your schedule varies so it is hard to schedule doctor appointments or child care.  Otherwise, a fun place to work."
good,"People either get stuck here or they leave when they get a whiff of the extreme workload that's asked from the managers.  Personally, I handled the online orders from the website (Ship from Store method) for the majority of my employment and I don't think there's a person alive in the company who understands the workload that they're asking when the holidays come around.  I was never offered a raise from starting at seasonal pay (8/hr) and I had to ask repeatedly to get up to 10/hr, even though I've demonstrated the ability to lead and I've been with the company for over a year.  The benefits are nice and you can make some friends, but their hiring process ends up bringing in people that don't respect the responsibility that comes with the territory most of the time.  Finally, you'll get tired of hearing about overall satisfaction and issues like speed of checkout at every single morning huddle, but nothing has been introduced by higher-ups to really combat that."
good,"retail is retail, no other way around it.You have to deal with a lot of customers and work around store managers. Depends on the day if it is good or bad"
good,"This job taught me both retail and finance related work skills.  It is a team environment, which was both enjoyable and beneficial to my personal development in leadership and overall efficiency."
good,work there ok place general retail business   no employees bad hours good merchandise glad to have them here sometimes don't have product that customers want need to go on line to order
good,"I work at Dicks while I'm in school, along with playing college soccer. Even though I had busy schedule, Dick's is willing to work around it, and provide me with the hours that I need."
good,It is a fairly easy job for those who like to keep busy. There is really no complaints about this company. I got the experience I needed in retail.
good,Learning things on the fly is very useful here and so is a good memory. fun environment as long as you work while you have fun.
good,"Working as a golf associate at Dick's Sporting Goods, my main goal was to sell as much equipment and cloths as possible. I realized that there is not much golf club repair, but a lot of retail and sales. You are basically a retail associate."
good,"This where I got my first job and this place is great to get your foot in the door. I started out as a cashier and with the experience they gave  me, two years later I was working at a bank"
good,Great atmosphere for those who enjoy sports.  You have the ability to spread your sporting knowledge to the newer sports fans.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Provide customer service over the phone handling situations regarding complaints, concerns, questions, or any other general info. needed from the customers."
good,Management was more worried about tearing their employees down than building them up. A lot was put on me and most of the people I had working under me were college aged kids.
good,"Chick's Sporting Goods is no longer around, as it was bought out by Dick's Sporting Goods.  It was a fun place to work nonetheless."
good,This was a fun job for me when i was young. and when i got older it was a fun part time gig. not that into this job as a career. management seemed pretty good to me.
good,"The hardest part of your job is the micromanagement from corporate as well as the low level of care on the corporate side. "
good,The hours kind of suck but overall it wasn't the worst place to work. The staff is friendly and is passionate about helping people find what they're looking for.
good,"Dicks sporting goods is a great social place to work. Co-workers are friendly and always willing to help. The hardest part of the job is the fact that it is retail, which means unless you are a full time supervisor or manager your hours are completely random and you have low pay. The most enjoyable part about the job is that you get great satisfaction of helping a customer find what he/she were looking for and it bringing a smile to their face."
good,When I arrive at work I am ready to do the best job I can do.  We are not allowed to come out of our lanes and we are not allowed to talk to other associates.  I does not make for a pleasant working environment
good,I would interact with the customers greeting them and finding out what they liked and disliked as well as expressing my opinion on what would be the best fit for them.
good,In a typical days work I would unload pallets  and load product on to the truck.  While employed here I obtained my Forklift Driver Certification.
good,"I felt that there were undefined expectations across the board. Management and Corporate expected different things and then Supervisors would expect something completely different. I thought it was poor effort by all parties involved to communicate with each other about goals both long and short term. I also felt as though the ""team"" concept was lost on some workers in the building because they had a checked out attitude making it harder for those that put effort into the job."
good,"I had several promotions within my time with the company because I wasn't limited in mobility, however, the sporting goods industry isn't in my best interest."
good,The leadership was never clear and the department is in the process to being outsourced. So they let the whole department go without telling them or giving any warning.
good,Overall not a bad place to start in retail. As far as career advancement it is VERY political and favorites are plaid even among the management staff.
good,"The environment was okay, there was a lot of drama among employees. My job was okay. I dealt mostly with numbers and money. Very organized."
good,A good starting place to work for younger people. Flexible schedules and average hours. Great working with customers while learning new skills.
good,feel like part of a collective and not an individual. company has ridiculous regulations and policies and management will accept no criticism.
good,"Recovery lasted all day. Even up to hours after the store was closed. Even on Sundays. Good discounts for athletes and great place for college students to work on breaks,"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"they did not give many hours but they treate dtheir employees pretty well i have no complaints. they gave you the time you needed off when asked, and they were also willing to work with you."
good,"My typical day was very relaxed sometimes busy, my co workers were very friendly and open, My management was very nice and friendly as well."
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers meet their sporting or fitness goals, whether explaining the difference between baseball mitts or assisting someone with the benefits of different types of knee braces."
good,Good environment with a management team that makes you feel at home. I've always got the right amount of training needed and never felt lost on the job.
good,Typically a cashier but occasionally will work in apparel putting clothes away and maintaining a clean and friendly store. Co-workers are supportive and motivating. Very easy to get along with and share common interests. The hardest part of the day is dealing with the poor management while trying to keep myself and customers happy. I love being the person that makes people smile. Always in a pleasant mood regardless of the people I've had to deal with
good,Love sports! fun low key Enjoy helping customers and educate on sports that aren't familiar with and get them into the right product.
good,"It was fun to work with people my own age, but the management was lacking. Very focused on meeting ridiculous sales goals."
good,"Nice Office facility with fitness center, full cafe (many options), Starbucks and dry cleaning services on campus. Nice employees and great benefits. However, lots of meetings and can be difficult to balance work and family if you have a young family."
good,"If you are looking for part time work this is the place for you. If you are looking to advance your career you will most likely not succeed. They do not like to hire from within and it is almost impossible to get descent raises. Other than that it can be a fun job, depending on coworkers. This retail job will definitely require more work and a lot more knowledge than other retail jobs and will still pay you minimum wage."
good,"The most important part of the job was customer service. I had daily tasks to accomplish but the main purpose was to satisfy customers which I enjoyed. Also a pretty fun job with good people, I was just ready to move on."
good,"I am a people person so working retail was not as bad as some people describe it. Helping out customers as well as co workers is a great feeling to have at the end of the day, especially if the customers leave the store happy and employees gain knowledge and trust from you. Being in a diverse work place makes it a great experience not only at work but once you leave work as well. Having the ability to adapt to certain situations is definitely a benefit and has been one for me as I've worked for this company."
good,"This company can be a lot of fun to work for, but you need to love sewing, or crafting, or scrap booking, or etc.to be able to connect with the customers and share projects and ideas and truly enjoy it. if you're not crafty, then its just a job."
good,Was fun work as it was in the golf department however the pay can be low and the job a bit boring at times.  Other than that it was an enjoyable experience.
good,Great place to get exposed to the Customer Service Industry. Black and white policies to adhere. Ultimately a fun environment to work in.
good,Fun enviroment with people having fun and helping customers but pay is not good at all.
good,"A typical day is a morning meeting to tell you about the previous day in sales and metrics and to also go over goals for that day. Usually have a couple of hours to restock and work out any freight that may have come in. Lunch time customers start to hit it pretty good, and from that point forward its all about the sales. Closing consist of recovery and restocking from that day."
good,Dicks sporting goods is fine if you are ok with getting shafted on hours.
good,It was a decent company to work for while going to college. They try to work around your class schedule.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Fun place to work.  Typical day starts with determining what needs to be accomplished in the bike shop like what bikes to build/repair and/or what skis/snowboard needs service.  Most enjoyable  part is learning new skills like skis and snowboard tech work
good,I liked working there with my other employees and the costumers.
good,"A typical day at work consists of receiving shipments from corporate, opening all boxes, sensoring products according to our standards, and putting more products out into the aisles.  I've gained organizational skills, communication skills, and have furthered my customer service skills."
good,"Typical day is cleaning up the apparel area and assisting customers.  Learned to be patient with others.  Management for the most part was good, some were very immature.  My co-workers were great, I had made some great friends while working there.  The job was not difficult, almost mindless.  The most enjoyable part was making new friends while I worked."
good,A typical day as a freight flow lead at Dick's Sporting Goods starts off with checking e-mail and communication on what needs to be done early morning. That is followed by any general maintenance that needs to be done before the store opens. Depending on the day the frieght flow lead will either handle inventory movement or will oversee the unloading and sorting of incoming shipments.
good,"great retail experience, most associates willing to help."
good,"Working at Dick's Sporting Goods was a good experience for me. I was able to provide exceptional customer service to a variety of customers. I learned tons of new information about the myriad of products they sell and was able to apply it everyday. My typical day involved general restocking and recovery of the sales floors as well as engaging customers all around the store. The least enjoyable aspect of the job was actually my fellow co-workers. Although I got along with everyone I worked with, management seemed to hide in their offices, intertwining themselves with the cliques of the store. A more motivating and engaging management is ideal to me."
good,always on a skeleton staff and they still make cuts.  hard to get assigned  tasks done on time as they would add and change things constantly.  Was fun for the most part as long as you are flexible and do well under stress.
good,Had to go through 15 managers to get an answer on anything. Management walked on egg shells on just about every topic.
good,For the most part this was a seasonal job and I was just a cashier. I needed a job and didn't really stay and expand here.
good,I love the health conscious environment here at Dicks. Most of my coworkers and customers are active and living a healthy lifestyle.
good,Learned a lot about how to assist customers and manage my time.
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is an excellent retail employment opportunity for young adults looking to develop their professional customer skills, but it is not the best working experience for tenured retail workers looking to advance and make a living in a department store environment.  With a high turnover rate and underdeveloped hiring model, employee retention rates are low and you'll likely use Dick's as a launch pad for other career opportunities rather than as a home base for long-term employment."
good,I work here part time a couple nights a week. They are flexible with my hours and willing to give or take hours away when needed. Fun work environment getting to work around athletics. They always have tasks for you to do so you will always stay busy. They give a lot of opportunity for movement throughout different sections of the store.
good,"I have gained skills and also showed what I had to offer. Even though we had to part ways becasue I have felt I wasn't growing with the company, it was an over all a great pleasure to work with them and the team at Dick's Sporting Goods."
good,Short staffed a lot. Customer interactions were good. Very busy place to work.
good,"DSG has changed since I was there, so I won't judge them on their past"
good,"They were not consistent with their direction until July, 2014 when they let all the Golf Professionals and Fitness trainers go.  Not sure of where they will go."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Retail, good for the college years. Met a lot of nice people but needed something better for the future and didn't enough money for the work you put in."
good,This was defiantly a job I learned a great deal of what not to do as a manager and what works best to motivate the team.
good,I really liked the job at Dicks but I spent 3 years there and I was looking for something better.
good,people focused work environment. typical day varies for each people depending on which department you work in.
good,"Perfect place for the college kid who enjoys sports, not a whole lot of advancement although they praise themselves on promoting from within.  Last 3 managers were outside hires."
good,Fun place to work while in college. Learned great customer service skills.
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods was a positive learning experience for me.  i was there for almost 10 years. i worked with many different managers though out my career there. i started out processing freight, merchandising new product, reading floor plans. assisting other associates in their potential of rising with the company. product knowledge was very important in the company, athletic equipment, clothing, footwear, you had to know what you where selling and give the right information to the customer so they had enjoyable experience at the store and their activity. the above would describe a the typical day at Dicks. I guess the hardest hard of my job was the day i left the company i really like working there. i loved meeting new people, customers and new associates."
good,"My workday consists of daily cleaning and organizing, assisting customers, packaging products to be shipped, helping co-workers with tasks and processing defectives and claims. I supervise a small team that unloads trucks once or twice a week and occasionally perform MOD tasks. I have learned essential leadership and problem solving skills. Management, for the most part, is helpful and appreciative while keeping a friendly and professional relationship with their employees. Co-workers are generally friendly and hardworking and go out of their way to help make each others day a little brighter. The hardest part of the job is balancing multiple tasks throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of accomplishment that comes with a job well done."
good,"A typical day at work was unorganized."
good,"Poorly ran.  If your not full time, then you get low hours. management doesn't treat employees with respect."
good,A tremendous place to work! Co-workers and managers are easy to get along with as well as the customers!
good,"A typical day working at Dick's Sporting Goods for me personally entails daily entries of store shrinkage, company fiscal reports, and employee information updates electronically as well as manually. I also maintain employees time clock punches, new hire selections and job postings, interview scheduling, and many other HR related endeavors. Including the day to day needs of upper level management such as running errands or any other assistance needed. By juggling the many tasks I have become accustomed to I have learned a great deal about the inner workings of a company financially and managerially. I do feel that the management internally could be run in a more organized and sufficient manner. My co-workers for the most part are dedicated and hard working individuals. The hardest part of my job is the high demand for certain tasks to be completed in very short periods of time, I am often handling more than one task at a time. Luckily the same thing that makes my job difficult is the very thing that is most enjoyable for me. I thrive under pressure and love facing a challenge. I believe that being challenged in the work place betters you as an employee as well as a person."
good,"Everyday involves interacting with consumers. Helping them with their purchases and helping other cashiers with transactions that need a manager assistance. Working clean is a must! At the end of the night, a CSS is in charge of making sure every tills accounted for and that the entire area where the registers are at is ready for the next day. The co-workers are great, we are big on team work. I love the the fun sports atmosphere."
good,"Typical retail job. Management delegates chores for employees, and employees maintain the sales floor."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,I was a cashier who also had to help keep the front end of the store clean and tidy looking.
good,I love the outdoors so it was easy to go to work for the most part without the ugh feeling.
good,"the people I worked with is what made the job fun otherwise it sucked! Never got any hours management wasn't the best, pretty decent discount on everything though"
good,"Retail giant in sporting goods industry, growth opportunities available"
good,"A great team-oriented environment."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I would make sure daily projects are being completed in a timely manner. I was in charge of my department's payroll and budgeting. I had one direct person I would answer to, and I had 17 people directly answering to me."
good,"Typical day consisted of customer service, merchandising, and helping out other departments. I learned how to correctly merchandise a store. Management came and went pretty quickly. My coworkers were hit and miss at times. You knew who would help out and you knew who would not get anything done. The hardest part of my job was being put down by a manager as an excuse to not give me more hours to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a cohesive group of coworkers that helped out all the time."
good,It was just the nature of retail having to work nights/weekends/holidays.  Not great for family life.
good,Hours are unstable and there are not many hours given to the employees other than holiday season. Rarely have chance to advance in company
good,"Great management team, plenty of opportunity for advancement, cashiering, understanding of different types of machines and products that are sold."
good,My review of this job is good my co worker are very nice and good at what they do. The hardest thing about this job is not getting what the customers want being its out of stock.
good,The company strives on providing great customer service. The management is good at listening to staff.
good,"it was fun i liked working there"
good,"standard retail environment, nothing more, nothing less.  Lodge department is used as a whipping boy however.  We had to move product more than any other department and moved three times as much as the 2nd most department.  Employees are horrible at managing the warehouse if you need to pick up large items as there is no warehouse employees and regular employees are forced to do it.  Management spends all day in their office and will only come out to see the light of day to discipline or yell at employees.  Severely underpaid at lodge department as well, hourly pay and no bonuses and commissions even though we are forced to sell and meet quotas."
good,"Overall the company was a fun place to work. A typical day consist of Stock, counting inquiry, shipping, Re-Stock and of course customer service."
good,"A typical day would be to organize department, take out freight from back stock, build bikes, help customers with fitness questions and fitness equipment. I learned a lot of valuable sales techniques. The management was disorganized toward the end of my time there. I was hired with four managers and by the time I left there were two managers and no store manager. I had a very good relationship with my co-workers. There was one co-worker in particular that was higher up that was rude to a lot of the employees and made the environment very uncomfortable and hostile to work in. The hardest part of the job was the drama created by some of the employees and the favoritism. I enjoyed the relationships I had with majority of my co-workers and being able to help customers with questions, especially fitness questions because I am very passionate about fitness and health."
good,I enjoyed working in the lodge. I sold guns and outdoor equipment which I enjoy being outdoors in my free time. I used my skills learned over time to help customers with purchasing the right tool for the job.
good,standard retail sales job in the sporting good market. They didn't want to pay overtime keeping the best employee to limited hours.
good,This place is great for those who love sports and love being around them. Growth opportunities are bleak.
good,"Exciting, active place to work"
good,"my typical day at work was me being on a register, ringing out customers and taking care of there needs. I was required to clean and tidy up the store at closing and opening time."
good,"A decent company to work for. The management is friendly, but you can still tell that they are working for themselves."
good,"The Dick's Sporting Goods in Montgomery, AL goes through a lot of different managers. They don't give a lot of hours. I enjoy the employees and atmosphere."
good,"Often at work I was so overrun by customers and had so many projects going on that I had to rush customers along in their decision making process rather than spend the time with them I otherwise would have to ensure complete satisfaction with the product."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I have learned many things about the company, and lots of experience."
good,This is a great place to work but not a great place to try to make a career! Lacking in compensation and benefits. Typical retail!
good,"Sales experience, promote credit cards, rewards card and warrantee programs."
good,Help assist customers in apparel with any questions or concerns they may have about the items sold. Folded clothes and checked fitting rooms to make sure everything was clean. My coworkers were fun and upbeat. The hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult customers while trying to up sell the products. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping to manage the floor and keeping everything neat and orderly so that operations ran smoothly.
good,"My responsibilites as a sales associate at Dick's Sporting Goods included greeting customers and ascertaing each individuals wants and needs. I would recommend, select, and help locate or obtain merchandise based on customer needs and desires. I worked in a diverse environment of co-workers from all age groups. Everyone was part of a team and worked together to achieve our goals. The hardest part of the job was the flexible scheduling as I prefer more of a fixed weekly schedule."
good,I guess it all depends on which store you work at as to what to put down as a review but overall it wasn't a bad place to work.
good,"The here was not bad, sometimes working with the customers was the highlight of the day."
good,"Cool place to work if you enjoy sports, helping customers and etc. Great benefits. As well as a good discount on all items in the store."
good,"Typical day at work, would be plowing through the doors and being suffocated by negative attitudes. I learned that with a negative manager, work will be difficult. The management is absolutely terrible and customers steal so much stuff there and they don't do anything about it. Co-workers have too much baggage that they bring to the workplace that is unnecessary. Hardest part of the job was walking through the door to punch in. The most enjoyable part was walking out the door when my shift was over."
good,"A typical day at Dick's Sporting Goods consisted of assisting customers, running a cash register, putting out stock, merchandising, and straightening the sales racks. During the time that I worked there I saw three high management changes within a six month period. This caused quite a lot of confusion and low moral among the employees. All of my co-workers were fantastic, driven people however and the atmosphere was always fun."
good,The store itself is great with a few in-house problems. Needs to be better for the customer experience
good,It is a job that pays you cheap and have you work hard all the time. They do not want you to get any over time or you get in trouble. They always schedule you so that you only can take a 30 min lunch break.
good,"Work consists of customer service, and maintaining a well-balanced array of products on the sales floor. "
good,"Very productive. Your coworkers are easy to work with an we all had to work as team in order to get a certain number every night. Management is supportive, but raises are nearly non-existent. "
good,A typical day at work consists of helping out customers with their needs as far as picking out the correct footwear for them to use and  scanning the work environment and knowing when to fill in areas with more sneakers. I have been a relatively patient person before this job but have built even more patience working in this job environment. For the most part management is good and productive and I have no complaints. Co-workers are positive individuals who are good people to be around. The hardest part of my job is keeping composure in extremely busy work day with frantic customers but composure is always kept. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting everyday with my co-workers. 
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job, but the management was rather inexperienced at communication and business relationships.  "
good,"When working at the cashier I learned to be patient and efficient when working with customers, and how to manage working at the register and also taking care of my other responsibilities. Other responsibilities included stocking gum, snacks, and pop, organizing clothing on the pads nearby. The hardest part of the job was trying to help customers when issues that occurred with the cashier system that were out of my control, and I learned how to give exemplary customer service."
good,A typical day at Dicks Sporting Goods consisted of selling shoes and helping around the store with different projects.
good,"Good company, worked as a team with the members of my group to accomplish sales goals and tasks that needed to be done"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,me an all my co-workers would line up an do are early morning work outs before work
good,"Working at Dicks Sporting Goods was very enjoyable and pleasent. The people i worked with made it an fun place to work, everyone was pretty close in age and very friendly. The management was very nice and helpful also. When i first started and was a little confused everyone was so nice to help me get into the hang of things."
good,A good experience in learning customer service during a period of change in management.
good,The work environment was not welcoming and unfriendly. Good pay but too many hours set my svhool scgedule off-balance.
good,"My typical day at work would be different with each day. I met new customers everyday and greeted them all with a smile. I learned how to use a different computer style of register. The management was polite, but have many issues of their own. My coworkers were great, but some of the few were not so polite. There is nothing hard about my job. I adapted to everything quite quickly. The thing that I most enjoy about my job, is the fact that I get to meet new people everyday."
good,Counting my draw
good,Greet customers and ascertain what each customer wants or needs.
good,good company to work for. nice place to shop. location is a good place
good,It's been a while since I worked there but Dick's Sporting Goods was a good place to work at. Good management team and a nice working environment.
good,Assisted customers. Kept floor and stockroom neat and orderly.
good,It was a fun and fast pace store. I learned more details on sporting goods.
good,"Greet Customers, Run the cash register, answer phones,"
good,"I loved the managers at the particular store I worked at. We had good moral and were constantly being encouraged to be creative. However, the only downfall was corporate was always cutting hours, so it was hard to be productive when only one associate was in each department."
good,Fun place to work when I was in college the pay is low but they are flexible with class schedules. There is very little room for advancement becasue they usually bring in people from the outside.
good,I enjoyed my job and what I did there. I enjoyed being busy during my work day.
good,Work with good people but the pay is low and they were not flexible
good,"good envirorment, good managers, sometimes crazy customers"
good,Dicks sporting goods was a fun place to work if you are passionate about any sport.
good,"Very high pressure sales, and unreliable when scheduling. Typical customer service environment."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical day would start with me looking over my area of work and making sure that everything was in place. I also had to check the dressing rooms to make sure they were clean. I learned how to work at a fast pace so that my work would not pile up at the end of the night. We didnt see managers much, but we knew if we had a problem we could talk to them. The co-workers were always moving, and at the end of the night if they were done cleaning their section they would ask you if you needed help. The hardest part of the job was cleaning at the end of a long day."
good,dicks sporting goods is a good company to start off with but i feel that after 2 years they dont treat you how you should be treated pay wise and overall outlook.
good,A good place to work at. Managers are not all very pleasant. You must enjoy working in customer service.
good,I have gained a lot of knowledge about sports. I enjoy the fact that I can still have fun at work. Working in retail does become very busy especially around the holiday and the beginning of sports season.
good,Great place to work if you're just starting out. If you're more experienced it's not so great because you'll have to start at the bottom. Pay isn't very good.
good,When your coworkers expected something done that is important to them; it is rewarding to see their satisfaction and gratitude when that thing is done right and in a timely fashion. You gain respect and they learn to depend on you.
good,"This was a part time job to help get me through college. On a typical day I would build, repair, and sell bicycles. The team at my store was in constant flux because it was a store that was used to train and promote district manager. The hardest part of this job was working with old bikes where a long goes wrong very frequently. The best part of this job was being able to learn a new and valuable skill that I can use the rest of my life."
good,"Managers were unprofessional, not a very caring environment, long hours and sudden change of shifts, cutting hours or asking you to not take your break."
good,"Answer phones, greet customers, clean designated area, run register and ask about replacement warranties. Management was OK. Co-Workers made the day go by faster and made the workplace enjoyable. Hardest part of the job was the warranties."
good,Typical Customer service duties with a little management capability. NEVER got out of work on time. Scheduled until 9p would generally leave 10p or later...
good,I loved working there while i was going to school but i am now looking to further my career since i am done with college
good,"A typical day at work, overall average compared to most work places."
good,The hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day and not having any benefits.
good,This job was decent . It was a fun enviorment for me when I was a student. Its a job not a career.
good,Employees are like family here. Very welcoming group of people. Not a lot of room for advancement. Could be cleaned up a bit.
good,wonderful work environment
good,The customers is what it is all about!! They make it worth going to work every day!! I love not knowing what is going to happen when I walk through the door.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I love the employee discount, but only one out of three managers were understanding. The others were rude and did not care about the employees. The customers were more fun than the coworkers, there was drama that the management handled poorly."
good,"Most employees are great! (Most) Managers are easy to work with and talk to about life issues that interfere, and they’re very understanding and care for their employees as long as you get work done."
good,"A typical day at work is naturally dealing with people while being on the move. i learned to deal with all types of people while keeping composure. Management was not as understanding and fluid as it should be. Responsibility was not taken for the management's shortcomings. The hardest part of working at Dick's was dealing with the people because they can be unpredictable and not always in a good way. The best part of the job is the friendliness of the staff, the atmosphere given can be the best and just what you need to change your mood for the better."
good,"This is an upscale sport authority, the management was great, unfortunately they schedules were not fair, they will put me to work for 30 hours one week and will not schedule me again for 3 weeks. The hiring new people all the time therefore to older employees get hurt."
good,"Pay was to low for the job and area.  Fast paced store.  Management was good to work for."
good,"Although I enjoyed the people I worked with, management viewed the employees as numbers instead of individuals and were not the most exciting people to work for."
good,"Overall fun time working with kids, finding the correct equipment. Costumer service was fun, Coworkers were great. Management was okay, should of been better, they really have no communication when changing things around the store. The job was never hard to me, always fun and entertaining due to the fact i love sports."
good,If you’re looking for a stable job with a consistent paycheck then it’s good for you but you will struggle if you are living on your own. Atmosphere is fairly good with a good management and leadership team.
good,"To be honest, I love being an associate at DSG. Taking the knowledge I have with fitness/running and applying that to help a customer is so rewarding. Helping the customers and cleaning the sale floors is your typical day. To describe the management team is hard, one minute they are your friend, the next they are your enemy. In my currently location, the store manage only cares about his self and his favorite associates. But I don't want this review to reflect all ""Dick's Sporting Goods store"" because I have met several store managers are not like mine."
good,This company is a good place to work for if you need flexible hours do not expect to have extensive pay but the staff there is friendly. Raises are minimal and many times you are overworked because there is limited hours and employees working.
good,"I have a college education and marketable skills in a different field, but if I had to work retail again it would be through Dicks.  A fun, vibrant attitude that encourages employees to remain and feel like they are part of a team."
good,"Weekends are slammed off and on through the day as we do coupons for sports groups that get sponsorship through us, we know it'll be busy, but not enough people to cover the floors or registers when we have lots of customers."
good,Always great working with the coworkers because similar likes an dislikes are there. The management has a hard time acknowledging positive reinforcement and only seem to notice and mention the negative actions.
good,The store is very busy and we are not given enough hours to properly staff the store for optimal customer service. Long-term projects and improvements fall to the wayside because tasks at hand dominate time.
good,I learned a lot about store politics. There was no opportunity for advancement no matter how hard I worked or how competitive I was.  It was very disappointing.
good,"I was an awesome worker for this company. Just felt like Management could engage with workers more. Easy work and The Turnover rate is crazy, gotta get in where you fit in."
good,"Relaxed uniform. Pretty good place to work for someone in high school or college. Like most retail jobs, it can get stressful around the holidays and back to school."
good,It's a great place to start working and get some experience too. It's very good for people who are still in school and want a flexible work schedule. The pay is not that great but the place and the managers are always helpful.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Great enviroment, along with very nice employees and the store was set up very nicely and the sales were very good for people needing something in any section"
good,"Dick sporting Goods is good but not the best, learned alot about sports and equipment for as tools, rollers and sales, managers need to be more understanding"
good,I worked in the back as sales support stocking and unloading trucks. I don't think the pay supported the work that was done. But the other coworkers were great and the discount is awesome!
good,Been working here for about 10 years now.....it’s very chill but when it comes to working your butt off and not getting the  recognition you deserve is very stressful.
good,"learn to wear many hats, and work on your feet. you are given support by peers and supervisors but upper management is harder to reach and react to concerns."
good,"great place to work, with equal opportunity! I learned a lot about sports, fishing, hunting and active wear. Co-workers were easy to get along with and work with. A typical day at work was a fun filled environment, with reasonable goals that could be accomplished. The hardest part about working here was holiday season, yes it is a face paced environment but it required all hands on deck to get the job done, you have to have patience and great communication skills to have a successful day but when the day is over everyone is tired but they still have to make sure everything was clean and put together. Great place to work overall."
good,If you work your butt off you will not be compensated. Never work here to save your life. The people are nice but they expect way too much out of minimum wage workers.
good,at the time we had fun as a staff great team. it's corporate and they changed the layout so many times it was annoying and people could never find stuff.
good,"I think working in apparel was very stressful for a first job, but working as a cashier or in the shoe department would've been easier in my opinion. Managers handled problems very well and communicated what they needed to get done. I didn't get trained by someone in the apparel department so I had to learn on the fly which was also stressful, and I didn't get as many hours as I would've liked."
good,"I could have a social life during this period of work. I was able to work with management and make a schedule that could fit with my life and that made work a lot more bearable. It wasn't as eventful as other jobs I've had, but for a retail position it was alright."
good,"Work could get very stressful during the holiday season and during inventory. Must be willing to talk with unruly customers, be patient with people who don't know what they want, and be able to clean up lots of messes."
good,"My role is responsible for maintaining visual presentation on the salesfloor which includes processing freight, getting product to the salesfloor, and updating gameplans. "
good,"I found that the atmosphere was fun in the sense that they sold items for recreation/ health/ sports, but at times the work load was heavy. Unloading semi trucks full of pallets of weights, bikes, treadmills, or other heavy items took its toll after a few years."
good,I have been there for just shy of four years and have been through four different managers. They don't pay well but they do offer really good insurance.
good,"Four 10 hour days and Three Days off. The work will test your patience and resolve everyday. Some days the job is easy and you wont hear any complaints about your work. The moment things take a turn for the worst, that is when management pops up. Associates could be working to meet productivity but if one or two things dont get done they get in their feelings about it. Associates at the bottom work the hardest but are definitely underpaid.The hours are there if you want more opportunity's to make money.In house relocation is also available after 90 days in your position. Depending on where you start that would be the most recommended action. Only 3 personal days a year and very little vacation time.If you like working hard then you found a job!"
good,it was a good place to work. the fellow workers were fun and helpful with a few expansions. the reasons i left are  no hours to work and the store manager not very personable.
good,"Customer Service is hard but I ended up leaving my position because of an anxiety flare up. I was only suppose to work 30 hours a week scheduled for 40 and never was able to leave on time. I would get in trouble if I left with a line of customers or if I had a task that was unable to be completed. My anxiety was caused by this job and I was not sleeping at night because of it. You have to stand up for yourself and take control of your schedule otherwise they will take advantage. Other than over worked employees, it is a great crazy family to work with."
good,Some DSG's are awesome while others aren't. Just depends on the management at the locations. Hard to get raises and most places start close to min. wage unless you work in lodge or golf.
good,"When I first started at Dicks we had a great management team! Then they all slowly ran off by the DM who did a very poor job and helping anyone excel other than his self! As the great leadership, I once had left I also left because the new team leaders weren't builders but more of a demolition crew."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"DSG has an amazing work culture encompassing values such as passion, teamwork, driven and skilled. Everyone is so friendly and willing to help you on any task or project. The support you receive here is incredible! In terms of company policies, DSG lacks the incentives   you see at most companies due to their conservatism. Also, there are no diversity initiatives in place, which discouraging for new talent to adapt and transition into this company."
good,"The job is ok. I just had to make money when I moved. Management changed a lot. Typical day you're just moving clothes to the floor. And the hardest part was dealing with customers{ not all , just some}"
good,Ok from what I remember. Very male dominate got pay raises every year. Can feel like working in a high school with the drama that occurred. Different opportunity to work in a different environment if wanted.
good,"- 7-9 hour days"
good,"Shifts could be really fun working with co workers and helping customers. Shifts could also be terrible. It is common to be under staffed during busy shopping times. Managers/leads would either be great to work with or mico-manage employees and be rude. Managers were about half and half, good or bad. The hours are flexible, but can be erratic. Wages are okay, however, after working for a year and receiving a perfect review from my manager I received a 19 cent raise. Then every new hire at my same position would start off making $1.25 more per hour. This is why I left the company, they don't value your work whatsoever."
good,The job was interesting and they taught there full time staff a lot by sending them to training's related to the department they were in.  They are very encouraging and patient and are willing to teach employees how to be good sales people in there departments.
good,"I enjoyed my time here however, I never got a pay raise nor had many hours each week. The management was good and i had a good working relationship with all the managers."
good,"Managed footwear deck. Most footwear sales were team sports. Typical big box retail environment. Busy days, lots of call in from other employees that had to be covered."
good,Dicks was on okay place to work. Difficult to communicate with management. Not only was it difficult to talk to the management but some people we extremely difficult to work with and management would not take care of issues in a timely manner.
good,Feels you're focusing on the manger's duties delegated to you while sacrificing your own duties in your department then being thrown under the bus when your area is audited.
good,"The culture is fun, depending on who you're working with, but also professional. Varies store to store, district to district."
good,"Dick's is a decent place to work. The warehouse is clean and automated except for the shipping department. The pay is not the best and starting pay is pretty low, since it is in Atlanta."
good,The pay for a college student is good but not for someone looking for a career. The processes that have for a large store is the same as a small store.
good,Fun college job to work at. It gives young people that first taste in to what coroprate america is like. I felt like it also is a great job to get young people acclimated to handling person to person interaction.
good,"Expect to work overtime at least once or twice a month. The Atlanta location is the biggest Distribution Center at the moment. We have a ton of stores to service which means a lot of trailers being dropped on the yard. If you work hard, stay safe and come to work on time then their will be no issues. The hardest part is staying consistent with work over a long period of time. "
good,Over all the job was fun but the management is not good at all. The store manager only cares about himself and they bully you into working on off days.
good,"The job itself is nice and very enjoyable, I loved it. The management however, is terrible. Never knew what was going on in the back, managers would never listen to employees, managers and team leaders would often not care to the job, unless a customer is involved. No communication between managers and employees would often lead to very confusing and sloppy environment."
good,"Dicks sporting goods has a higher turn-over percentage and is viewed as a temporary job. The position is what you make of it. If you want to come in and slack-off you can do that but will see the door sooner rather than later. If you work hard and have a drive to succeed and build the business, then you can advance very rapidly. You have a constantly changing environment but the pay is not very great. Choosing in which department you would like to work is pretty cool."
good,"If you love sports and outdoors, you will love to work here. Some days are fast paced and some are slow.  Management is somewhat fair. This is a good place to work."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"This job offeres copious amounts of opportunity. Unfortunately I didn't work long enough. While I did not enjoy the environment, strictly because I did not fit in with recreational athletics crowd, this job has good people, environment, and wage."
good,A very relaxed workplace where everyone is friendly courteous towards eachother and that includes co-worker's and customers....Not as stressful as most jobs
good,"Great place to work while going to school because they work around your schedule. While the manager of the store is great, the assistant managers lack leadership skills and cause a poor work environment for all."
good,"I learned all of their hiring and posting into HODES, signage system for the store,"
good,The people I worked with were definitely the most enjoyable part of the job. Work days were long but management made it enjoyable and gave very fair breaks. I will say that it was very hard to balance how much they needed me there while being a full time student and there were many scheduling conflicts even when I let them know of my classes ahead of time.
good,Management turn style. Not great long term.                                                                                                                 .                                                         .                                              .                        .                                            .                                                  .
good,working as a CSS was alright. there wasn't really a balance between work and life. 2 days off a week and didn't always fall on a weekend. management was alright.
good,The work environment is so so. Not that great of a team environment. Warehouse and store are pretty unorganized. Employees aren't really engaged in their job.
good,While I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods I rose through the ranks from Customer Engagement Specialist Team Associate and Bike Technician. It is very demanding but can be rewarding if you put in the hours.
good,Dick's Sporting Goods really emphasizes being a team and encourages team work among coworkers. The work experience was great and there were many opportunities for learning but not much in the way of advancement.
good,"No training whatsoever, throws you right onto the field, co-workers don't really help much, shifts were all over the place with no type of balance in between."
good,overall the job is fast paced and detail oriented. be on time for everything. the hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the tasks that can leave you rushing to get things done.
good,Managers expected way too much of employees with limited pay. Not always flexible with schedule but co-workers were awesome
good,wasn't able to really make a good living here in the position i had.  didn't really pay very much but i was in college at the time so it got me by. not where i would go for a career
good,"what I learned:: the Lakewood location was not a good career choice.  some of my coworkers were 'NOT team players"" and that's the polite professional version."
good,"the hardest part about the job is lack of intelligent from the management team and district managers. Besides that I enjoy the company, product and opportunities they can offer."
good,"The best part about working for Dick's Sporting Goods was helping out customers, while the worst part was dealing with accusatory and miserable managers from top to bottom."
good,"A typical day starts and ends at the front end taking care of customers. Occasionally, the job would move to locating items for online orders or folding and hanging shirts for the apparel department. I've learned how to be a cashier in retail, because it's very different from running a fast food chain. Management takes their job seriously; if a certain department isn't running quota, it becomes known. Co-workers for the most part are fantastic; here and there you've got someone who doesn't show up or always asks someone else to cover their shift."
good,"The company and benefits are great. The most difficult part of the job was usually leaving for the day, because I did not want to leave anything incomplete. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to train and equip other employees as well as work with upper management in improving the business model. Management was lacking in the ability to treat peers as equals, and struggle with mentoring and equipping new managers with the skills and information they need to be successful."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"It's fun, but there was a new manager ever couple months who would completely change store operations. Other than that the store was very fun."
good,"Fun working environment, but I feel management could do better with helping us as employees at getting our job done and getting it done correctly. I like managers that are willing to give a helping hand and get their hands dirty as well some managers do and some do not. The pay is ok and the hours are ok as well. The most enjoyable part of my job are my coworkers they make working there fun."
good,"I've learned how to censor clothes, gloves, etc."
good,Fun place to work always holding friendly games among different departments.  Management needs a little work but all in all a good place. You can go as far as you want to with this company the sky is the limit
good,I loved helping leaders grow in their careers. Great merchandise and shop within a shop concept. Very focused on conversion and personal selling.
good,"While a fun and rewarding place to work, job advancement is very slow. Hours are constantly being cut come the summer months, yet skeleton crews are expected to perform the same as fully staffed crews."
good,As long as you show up and put in a standard day all is well.  If you apply yourself and work hard you can advance to the next level.  After the department manager position it can be difficult to work yourself into a store manager position. This is a standard hourly retail job.
good,This job was fun when the store first opened and the management was very professional. They offered a lot of cross training and would encourage you to want to move up in the department.
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods pays minimum wage for their employees and the raises are only a couple cents.  It is a high stress environment and you have to learn to adapt quickly.  Other than that, there are many perks for getting large discounts on items sold by brand companies within the store."
good,pay scale well below average. Fun place to work. Can't make end meet with pay scale unless you are living with mom and dad.
good,"Working at Dick's Sporting Good's required efficient decision making along with the ability to work in a fast-paced environment. As a cashier and customer assistant there, my duties where to assist customers with completing transactions and returns. I also applied customers for the Dick's Sporting Goods credit cards. Often during the store's peak hours I assisted customers in other departments such as apparel, footwear, and team sports. When particular items were not in store, my task was to find the items online for customers and have them shipped to either the store or to their residence. In the midst of performing my duties I was also entitled to answer phone calls and transfer them to the appropriate department. It was important to transfer them to the correct department the first time so no ones time gets wasted. Efficiency was tracked in numerous ways. Managers checked daily to make sure we scanned seventy-five percent of transactions with the customers' Dick's Sporting Goods membership card. Customers also gave us positive reviews on surveys that print out on their receipts. Whenever employees did something fantastic, we were awarded ""wow"" stickers by your name on a poster with the store's roster. Whoever has the most stickers at the end of the week gets a bronze ""wow"" pin. Also you get recognition for great customer service and the warranties you sell on items."
good,management had no clue what they were doing when I was working there.  I was making less than $8.00/hr starting out as a college student. They gave me a 24 cent raise after a year.
good,"At Dick's Sporting goods, I worked my way up from footwear sales associate to department lead. I participated in and won many sales contests. My sales skills are strong. My coworkers were a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was the requirement to push the store credit card on the customers."
good,"Work life balance is exceptional.  Dick's is an excellent stop gap or part time job for college students.  Not ideal for a career used to support a family.  Culture is great, especially for those interested in athletics."
good,Typical day at work is busy as a cashier. I haven't been with the company long and was able to move up quickly to a customer service specialist. Hardest part of the job is always being on your feet but the best part is helping customers find the perfect gift or item.
good,"fun job good people slow paced, good if u like being on ur own loved most of my coworkers"
good,DICK'S Sporting Goods terminated all PGA Golf pro's nationwide (500 pro's) in July 2014 as a necessary option to move golf sales in a new and more economic direction.
good,"During a typical day at work I handle the returns done in store, count the tills and safe and prepare the morning deposit, while also helping customers and helping the other cashiers when needed."
good,"Management was inconsistent some were awesome others not so much, played favorites too much gossip due to a younger management staff.  Also hire managers from outside of company so many have no concept of what actually goes on in the store."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. is an authentic full-line sporting goods retailer offering a broad assortment of brand name sporting goods equipment, apparel and footwear in a specialty store environment. The Company owns and operates Golf Galaxy, LLC, a golf specialty retailer and eCommerce websites and catalog operations for both Dick's Sporting Goods and Golf Galaxy."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical day at work starts at about 8:30 AM. I clock in, grab a radio, MC40 and a printer and head to the front register. I open my register, prepare my area for the day, and prepare all other register counters for the day. I participate in our ""morning huddle"" and we open the doors to the public at 9:00 AM. If there are no customers, I begin working in the front end area stocking shelves, cleaning counters, cleaning floors, etc. If the front end is good to go, I offer assistance to other departments, generally the apparel department. When customers come in the door, I welcome them and offer to help them find what they may be looking for. Once they have completed shopping, I begin the check out process. I inquire whether or not the customer found everything and if not, I offer assistance. Once they have everything they came for, I ring them up and thank them for coming in. There are times when a customer is less than kind, I continue to smile and try to make their final moments in our store the best. "
good,The people were great and I liked having a good discount on the merchandise. The only reason I decided to leave is because I couldn’t get enough hours of work to make me stay.
good,"Cashiering was easy to pick up. Learned a lot on what to do and how to manage time."
good,"The normal managers were great, but the head guy was awful. Would make you do one thing on a certain day, just to undo it later. Little flexibility with students that had a lot on their plate."
good,I was a customer service specialist. I enjoyed growing my skills as it helped me become more oriented towards business. Management at the time was not the best.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers that were also passionate about sports and helping out others. It made the day fun and would flow. That rarely happened due to many call offs or people would shove responsibility to others. Management was okay due to some just pointed fingers for certain aspects of the job instead of managing the workers. Overall a decent beginning retail job to gain experience in an enjoyable topic.
good,"The staff works as a team for the most part and are extremely hard working (with exception of a few employees, but what workplace doesn't have those). The main problem is how severely understaffed the store is and the communication between department leeds and store managers is a bit on the low side. Regardless, I did get the opportunity to perfect my customer service skills and develope experience as a cashier on top of my apparel sales position."
good,Dick's Sporting Goods is overall a pretty relaxed job. Being a cashier is easy and the work is not too hard. Associates are friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming.
good,"For the most part I have enjoyed my tenure at DSG. However, over the last few months the environment has become incredibly stressful and I have received little to no help from my managers and my workload is becoming tumultuous. I feel that unless some serious changes are made, things will not improve. Overall, Dick's Sporting Goods is a good company to work for. Some of the experiences that you will have are rewarding, while others will leave you questioning your role in this world."
good,"Basic retail job. Low staff. Minimum pay. they do not have that many hours to work with. Generally, huge work load, but underpaid for the amount of work you accomplish."
good,I thought Dicks Sports would be my last job as I saw better opportunities for promotion. I made friends in every department and learned what I could so in a pinch I could help out any area. If I was behind and other staff were free they would offer help. Of course that one manager would complain that it was my job no one else.
good,I Liked Dicks Sporting Goods A lot Its Wasn’t Paying Enough There Wasn’t No Benefits Being Given It Was A Good Job I Liked It A lot No Overtime Hours.
good,"If you're a student wanting a part time job, then Dicks is for you. They are flexible with hours, and give you the hours you want if you ask them to. If you are full time, you get good benefits."
good,Easy place to work when you are in school or have another full time job. Hours are very flexible and the management is okay to deal with. Everyone does there thing and the day goes by smooth
good,"A typical day at work is relatively stress-free. Your responsibility is helping out the customer with whatever his/her needs are. After that, the main part is moving product to where it needs to be and re-stocking as needed. Management is alright, some are better and more prepared than others. Overall, the culture is nice and I enjoy working there for the most part. The hardest part of the job is customer complaints, but that's to be expected. The most enjoyable part is being able to socialize to an extent with the friendly co-workers."
good,great to meet new and exciting people the other employees are great and fun to work with very competitive job and good place to move up in the company
good,"Good company to work for. Flexible scheduling. Competitive pay for retail. Be patient if looking to move into management, not too many opportunities for advancement."
good,"Well, many--probably all, except one or a few-- of my coworkers hate their job. Attitudes rub off. I'm not a big fan of mine personally but it puts money in my pockets and it has also taught me many valuable life lessons. I think the hardest part of the job is communicating and getting along with coworkers. I'm not very sociable at work. Whenever you think the job is done... It's not. Another tough part is dealing with angry or irritated customers, as an employee, you are expected to react calmly, professionally and friendly. So, that's something I've also learned."
good,"I really appreciate the hours of work dick’s provides to new employees once their good working habits are established. After I worked for 2 months, I was given good treatment and 30+ hours of work each week. I enjoyed the athmosphere and comraderie of the workplace. Some of the managers were rude at times but work can be stressful and I realize that. they were amazing 80% of the time and I had an overall good experience working with these guys."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,It's an alright place to work. The people you work with are fun and inviting. I just wish that we could get more hours and a little more pay to help with living expenses.
good,"Dick's is a special place to work.  Management is not so good, but most of the people who work here are super friendly. Perks and discounts are awesome !"
good,"Everyone has it out for each other, everyone is either miserable or finding a way to saotage someone else, and the pay for ship from store was terrible."
good,"I had fun working here, but it was very disorganized and people didn't really take their job seriously. Management sucks and people call out all the time."
good,"dicks sporting goods distribution is a place for basically a first time worker the environment is kind of layed back free to wear what you want to be comfortable as far as attire but for me I am not happy there working on concrete daily it starts to take a toll on your body its not a place I wont to retire from I'm not happy with how management works vacation time is accumulated there is no sick time you are on a point system I would like to be able to take off work, leave early or if be it come in a little later in the day because of whatever that may have happened with no penalties the lunch time is very short and rushed and you really not able to leave the premises come back and enjoy it because of the time I'm looking for a place of employment I can be comfortable in be happy enjoy and grow/move up along with better pay really good benefits sick time vacation time that is not accumulated and that also has a very good environment"
good,its a job its not that hard you must perform each task in a timely manner it pays decent its slow most of the time and most of the time the popular materials are out of stock.
good,It is probably the easiest job I've had but it provides little opportunity to move up in the company based from my experience. They have hired a lot of managers and leads from other stores.
good,"The Retail field just did not work for me. Spent long hours on my feet. If I were older, I would've left earlier than I did. Perfect for High School kids and seasonal opportunists."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working the Front End cash registers and assisting customers. Depending on how busy the store was you might be moved to another department to help them catch up, such as Apparel or Teams Sports. I learned more about customer service and how to deal with customers who are in the wrong, but need special attention to resolve the situation. The hardest part of the job is the competition between the Sales People and Cashiers for keeping numbers up for the in-store rewards and credit card. My favorite part of the job were the people, both employees and customers."
good,"I personally enjoyed my experience working for DSG, except during heavy traffic times when our store was understaffed. Our store was not allotted enough hours for employees to provide adequate coverage in each department; which in turn created bad experiences for customers. DSG thrives on customer reviews and satisfaction surveys, which I felt we were inclined to fail with the lack of coverage we were provided. The environment was high stress and high pressure from management."
good,The employees were fun to work with. Everyone helped out other departments when needed. It is a very good atmosphere. If I can advance I might consider staying.
good,"Just busy enough not too hectic during holidays, low pay for holiday workers. No custodians at certain locations, closing floor associates join as team for maintenance."
good,The employees on the floor were all very consistent with their workloads and management was all over the place. Was not comfortable around certain managers because they did not understand what it was like on the floor.
good,"systems that they use are very simple and some times a bit complicated to the efficiency of customers needs, however every system has its draw backs. as an overall experience i would give them four stars and would recommend others to work there"
good,"Working at Dick's was not a terrible experience, it definitely is not a job I would go back to unless I had a secured manager position. The hours fluctuate unless you are a team lead or a manger. I would not suggest this job for anyone unless they are in college and do not need a major income."
good,"A typical day consisted of me talking with customers and assisting them with whatever they needed. I learned how to detect theft-like behaviors and monitor well. Store manager was good, other managers were not the greatest with the exception of a few. workplace was not that great. Felt judged in a sense. Hardest part was dealing with attitudes from other managers. Most enjoyable part was interacting with customers and fellow coworkers."
good,"Good working environment.  Like every other company, there are office politics you need to navigate.  The only real advancement opportunities are in Pittsburgh."
good,"As a seasonal worker,  i lived in constant limbo. I made some great and lifelong friends with people and supervisors i worked with. I was told i would be hired on permanently,  but somehow this didnt happen. I was told later that it was an accident and was offered my job back, but did not trust them so declined."
good,DSG has been a quality place to work and I have enjoyed my time there.  Lack of advancement opportunities due to recent restructure.  Very stressful work environment depending on your store.
good,"take over evening shift by re-organizing hunting, fishing, and camping department of store. available to all customers as needed for assisting in purchases in these three departments. Responsible for running background checks for gun sells."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Store is very busy most of the day which require you to be able to multitask at a high rate. Staff works very hard at keeping to company standards and making the customer shopping experience a great one.
good,"Favoritism is prevalent and blind soldiers are the preferred employees. They do offer great benefits packages. I felt disrespected and underappreciated on numerous occasions, in what felt like a high school environment filled with hypocritical leadership."
good,The job and staff were great. I didn't like how one of the managers treated the staff. There was one guy that should have been a manager he treated us a lot better and was great to talk to if you needed anything or if you needed to switch days. He did almost everything a manager does but didn't have the title he was only a leader of our department.
good,"very straight forward work, sometimes leadership gets to feeling like there's too many chiefs... but overall not bad. Kinda what you expect from retail"
good,Great company to work for. Easily promotes and typically rewarding. Tough management jobs with tough schedule. I do not recommend taking a management position if you have small children or family obligations.
good,"As a whole, not a bad company to work for. Pay is fair for work expected as an hourly employee. Hours are usually good unless a cutback occurs. Management at some stores in particular is poor. Some would rather scream at employees rather than rationally resolve an issue. Other than that, benefits are great and overall work environment is generally enjoyable."
good,Great Job but management wasn't always so great. Also getting enough hours after holidays was difficult and they would schedule you times you put that you weren't available for. The employees are great.
good,"I have been at dicks for almost 2 years as a footwear associate and I am grateful I have gotten the opportunity to work my there as my first job for 2 years. I learned so much such as everything that has to do with working retail like costumer service, getting familiar with product and learning to work with others. the management has been nothing but spectacular being able to work with them. they work their hardest to keep the place immaculate. there Is so many little things besides having to help costumers and such. in my opinion getting paid minimum wage at dicks was unfair due to the amount of work having to put in."
good,"Typical day to day stuff is a lot of red flags thrown at you last minute, hardest part of the job is hiring good talent. If you get a good manager, they make working there bareable and fun."
good,"They really didnt train me on my job so i had to learn on my own so it was different. i love working around sports which is a dream come true, but there was not any big tasks to do when the customers was not around."
good,"helping customers"
good,"I enjoyed working in the store until I got transferred to the one in Orlando and quickly became displeased with how differently things were. My manager and I didnt get along and he made it very difficult to be there. Everything form micromanaging to making me look like a fool and changing my schedule last second without my knowledge, I just resigned to focus on my school."
good,my work was very straight forward. Management was always their if I needed them as well as co-workers I learned to work as a team not on my own.
good,"It is indeed a fine place to work for a student.  Management is usually always very flexible around school shifts and very understanding of your schedule.  To many very different pay rates. "
good,"You do the job of a manager, the job of a lead and the job in everyone else's department in a given day.  You are put in a position of authority but have absolutely zero authority.  You are held accountable, the rest are not."
good,"Days are pretty easy going through the week with not much to do unlike the weekends or holidays. You'll learn that no matter what position you get hired in as, you will eventually learn every job in the store. The people are amazing and easy to get along with. Management can be very stiff and unruly at points. Too many leaders not enough followers. The hardest part is just when you're completely busy and you're trying to help 7 customers at once."
good,The management here was great. I learned a lot about the operations side of a large retailer. Management was very accomadating.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Although the company provides an understanding that everyone is a person as well as an employee, it does not hold up the job details provided in the interview such as how many hours you will receive."
good,"Ive only been with the company for 8 months and as a part time worker there are basically no benefits to look forward to, the hours are also inconsistent which is a disappointing, payroll is a bit selfish but thats expected. But Nonetheless i still find a way to enjoy the job , im sure its due to the managers that run the store they are all very good people and work hard along with you which is much appreciated ."
good,"It was a fun experience, I didn't get paid as much as I felt I deserved but ultimately it was a good place to work."
good,I enjoyed being around and working with sports customers because I could relate to them.
good,The employees were really nice. Overall everyone worked as a team nicely. Hours were good and flexible. The pay was decent considering it was a retail job.
good,"If you're looking for work as a TEMP then dont expect to work very long. I was employed as a temp for no longer than 3 months and only worked a total of 22 days in those 3 months. Management is great, pay is ok for 8.00 hrly but dont expect anything but a few days out of the week."
good,best part about the job were the people. Great coworkers to work with. Great work environment. Everybody for the most part got along just fine. hardest part was being by yourself to cover a whole department.
good,worked on a conveyor line stacking boxes onto pallets. then world load into trailers for transport. like working with everyone there. off in the early afternoon.
good,Worked on the floor helping out customers when needed. Helped out with inventory and taking down and building displays. Enjoyed working with friends and meeting new people. Toughest part was when it became busy and when other associate's would leave too much work to be done.
good,It is a good company to work at if your are in school or just need a part-time. Fun environment.
good,"Long hours, often working 6 days a week. There are a wide range of co-workers for people in their early 20s to late 40s."
good,"Hired during the holiday season, which at first was a solid job and didn't really have much negative feedback to give about being at Dick's. Average pay and a great employee discount were cool. Just wished i received more hours."
good,Higher up Management was weak. Department managers did everything they could for us to succeed. With as little training as I had I did well above than what they expected.
good,It is very quick paced. On a normal day I would have to work in multiple departments. Most of the time at my location we are understaffed. What I have learned is to work quickly in a fasted paced setting. Management was not the best at times. Like I would try to but my input on things that would work and it would get shutdown. Some managers would help us in difficult customer situations. Or they might take their time helpings us. the workplace culture is okay. Like my co-workers they are great we always help each other out. But sometimes the workplace culture is toxic. One manager is not very helpful at times. Plus wants to talk down on you like a little kid. The hardest part about the job is trying to get multiple task done while servicing customers. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is just being around sports equipment for me. Or new shoes since I work in the footwear department.
good,Great company but staffing was an issue. Disrespect to some management from associates that were not addressed was a regular problem where I was. Talk about being team players when clearly they were not. Company going through a lot of changes too many too fast people were confused.
good,"Work really well with others, as well as managers. Only negative was no one was on same page. Also would like to expand in the marketing department, I believe I can bring"
good,"The people you work with are great, management is good, the workload is over whelming at times, you are pulled all over the store, never really work your dept well"
good,"Overall, this is a fun and entertaining place to work. But, as you move up in the company there are more and more responsibilities thrown at you with little or no increase in pay. Also need to work close to 80 hours a week just to accomplish what is asked of you."
good,Team is great and management is highly motivated. The pay is competitive and negotiable if you prior experience. It's good to be ready to adapt here and be able to give your best every shift.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Work hard, earn as many qualifications as you can. Working in different departments will increase the amount of experience you can use elsewhere. It is definitely the big difference from working anywhere else. Everyone has a chance to work in every department. As long as you have background information in that field, or even might wanna learn."
good,"Plan on planning that your work day will change by the minute, very fast paced. Company seems to be trying to keep up with everyone instead of focusing on a few things."
good,"Other jobs will pay more for the same responsibilities as this one. The jobs in my area typically pay 11$ an hour for cashiers. With only one day of training I was put alone at the front with no other past experience. I was commended for my great work, but it seemed irresponsible on the company's part."
good,"Inconsistent hours, managers always schedule you even when you have time off, no breaks during a 6-hour shift which is ridiculous. Lack of proper scheduling which leads to the store being understaffed on busy days"
good,"Dicks sporting goods was a great place to work at first and i thought getting the lead position was going to be a great way to show my skills and lead my team. At first it was great, but then they hired a new store manager and the whole store itself seemed to struggle a bit. Plus they started hiring 16+ year olds and the work ethic they have is very low. as a lead you're supposed to delegate tasks for your team, but instead i mostly did them myself because i knew they would get properly done and done in a timely manor. Not a terrible place to work, but can feel more of a babysitting job than a leadership job."
good,For the most part the employees are fun to work with but the pay is low for the work you do. The management is good but the company policies are starting to take a turn for the worse.
good,great place for a part time job for school students.  Age to start work was 16 years.   nice pay and discounts on merchandise.  Also vendors gave out different promos during year.
good,Everyday is different at Dick's Sporting Goods and that was one of the things I enjoyed the most. It's not a monotonous job and there is potential for growth with the right mindset and attitude. Working with the public is always an interesting job and it can be both good and bad but typically I have good interactions with the public.
good,"Working for this company was one of my first official jobs and probably one of the best learning experiences moving forward. You learn a lot real fast such as customer service, collaborative team efforts, and large company work atmosphere."
good,"The job itself was not the reason why I quit the job. Management didn't care for their associates, only their store. However, while I was there, I learned a lot about the products and services the store offered, customer service skills went up exponentially, and multi-tasking was definitely a huge improvement while working at Dick's."
good,I worked part-time so many of the questions asked did not apply. Yet I enjoyed my time working there. Everyone was supportive and friendly. Very nice place to work. Pay could have been better though.
good,"Sold sneakers and clothing. I mainly worked in the sports section so my day were going pretty fast but i was a seasonal worker, but i loved sneakers so at the time it really didn't matter."
good,This are good at dick but they seem to be making a lot of cuts making it hard for there employees to get the hours they all need to live. And it is only getting worse.
good,Its an okay job. Too many lazy college students who don't want to work so it makes it harder on management and those who are trying to make a living. I wish people could take more charge and rid of those who weren't willing to put in effort.
good,Working at Dicks Sporting goods was very organized. I thought our store was run well. It was a fun work environment due to the fact that I worked with good people.
good,"Clock in and u make sure th  t no customer is left without help, make sure all items are price, if it low on shelves go to the back and  see if u have the merchandise"
good,"As a 3 year employee, I would suggest that this is a place to start. I have been moved 2 positions up from where I started, but working extremely hard, and provided only the best skills to this company. A typical work day as an administrative assistant consists of receiving PO's, store to store transfers, working the attendance for employees in workforce management, checking emails, filing invoices, and employee confidential paperwork, comparing percentages from yearly, quarterly, and weekly dates. There are much more things that are done different days of the week. With being the administrative assistant it is my job to do everything the manager tells me to do and somethings this goes outside of my job title. The hardest part of the job is making sure that everything is completely timely. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely working with my fellow employees."
good,Dicks Sporting Goods was an overall good place to work. Most of the customers were friendly and the staff were fun to work with. Communication between management and departments doesn't exist. They have no grace period whatsoever and the point system is a beast.
good,"Great people to work with, friendly management.  Nice to have a discount at Dick's.  They gave me a new start in my employment history, so I am thankful forever for that."
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods is a decent place to work. In my time there, I was able to earn 2 raises, although one was because I threatened to leave. The job all depends on type of managers that you work with. If your manager knows what is going on, then the job will be fun. If not, then you will find yourself working twice as hard to keep up with things."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Great customer service."
good,"The hours are always flexible and the work isn't always hard, but the pay often isn't high enough for the hassle the small work is in each department. If the coworkers are fun to work with the environment is worth it, but when it stopped being fun I left."
good,They stress early on how open they are to advancement within the company.  They prefer that over outside hires.  They also offer help and training for people who would like to set up advancement plans.
good,This company is fun and great to work for! I highly recommend it because they are very flexible with working with college classes and other jobs if you have one!
good,Had an excellent time working. Worked with a variety of age groups and also moved my way up the ladder. There opportunity for growth as well as learning good people skills.
good,"it is not interesting,the reason I left was because they do not show appreciation.they also have workers that are not fit for certain jobs.And they will blame u for not being accordant to it."
good,If you are a student or parent who only needs part time hours Dick's is a fun place to work. The down side is the pay is not very good but it is retail.
good,Easy to get along with co workers and easy busy work. However no real chances to move up. Typically lots of repetitive work day in and day out. Able to work with school schedules.
good,"The best part about this job, structurally, is the work environment and flexibility in scheduling. My manager was great and really bought into the message the company wants to sell. Being a part of the best store in our district and one of the best in the region was gratifying. Every customer interaction means something. "
good,Walking into a work place where you get greeted time to time. I've learned how to fold inventory and censoring  product so its ready to be put out by that department. Learning the basic's of how their system works. The management is a little different of how the processes things . Co-workers are great easy to get along with . Making sure customers are being rang up correct and getting refunds back in the correct manner way so there is not hassle at the end.   Just being able to make each and every customer that walks into the door and walks out are happy and welling to come back.
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods was a fun company to work for. I had great relationships with my coworkers and my customers. Although it was pretty difficult to move up in the company, I learned a vast amount about management and the importance of communication. Love the credit card and protection plan benefits."
good,Good training available to stay abreast of the latest trends and selling techniques. Frustrating when you can not get need product in demand for customers.
good,"I worked there for roughly three months and that was long enough to realize there's no job security there. I helped open a new store back in October of 2015 as a regular part-time cashier associate, not as a manager or lead. When we were working on putting the store together, I was getting close to full time hours. Given, they did need all hands on deck to open the store. Once the store opened I was still receiving an average of 30 hours per week... Decent money for a young man. Then slowly as we were squeezing through the holiday season, my hours, and others' hours, were gradually getting lower and lower. By the time of my last day there on February 2, 2016, I was only receiving an average of 4 hours per week, and I wasn't the only one, and my availability was wide open. The thing is, THEY KEPT HIRING MORE CASHIERS AND BUSINESS WAS DOWN. If they couldn't afford to keep the employees they have, then why would they keep hiring? You would think that they would let a few employees go if business was down rather than keep hiring more on? Great management to work for, DSG corporate is a great corporation, but there's no security there. They promised me that my hours would improve before February but they just got worse. I talked to my scheduling manager about it multiple times and he kept saying ""We'll see what we can do"" which, I guess was nothing."
good,"This job gave me multiple opportunities to work different jobs. Always something to get done, never boring. I learned so many new things working at this job."
good,The work flow does not match the compensation. Management does not care about poor morale and do very little to increase it.
good,"The corporate office is very young and fun. It's definitely a fun place to work, but I think new grads are wooed by the gym and sports on-site and so the company definitely pays less than others in the same industry."
good,"Having to call the store to be able to access the building to clock in for work-A lot of times they count you late due to other co-workers not answering the phones."
good,I loved working in a fast paced environment. The pay for a person trying to get there first job. Management was ok and some managers would work around your schedule.
good,Enjoy working at Dick's. Growing company with many benefits. Each day brings new challenges. Learned a lot since I have been employed.
good,Helped customers attain the best equipment for their selves.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Demanding and unappreciative workplace. Management was not concerned with employees.
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a great and fun company to work for. Everything was very organized and professional. I was able to sharpen my customer service skills and meet a lot of great people. The management was very committed and would go out of their way to help you succeed. The hardest part of the job was stocking some of the product which actually was not very difficult at all. This may have been one of the most laid back, easy going jobs I have ever had."
good,The Avon store tends to be where new managers go to be trained. While I always had a blast with my co workers it's so hard when you constantly have a new manager to get in the groove of things. When I worked there though they were always really understanding about needing time off for family stuff and if they scheduled you to work for something that came up last minute I never had an issue finding someone to cover my shift. Besides the always changing managers I really didn't have any big issues working there.
good,Great par time job and great place to work for while in college
good,they never schedule enough employees in order to help customers on the weekends !!!
good,"In a typical day I would assist around fifty people a day in the area of sporting goods. Being a cashier I did not really get the chance to work with other people, but still thrived individually. The management was very strict at times. I enjoyed working here though as I have always had a general interest in sports and fitness"
good,"Great people, managers are okay. I don't appreciate how certain people get more though for less work. No way a regular cashier should make more than someone in Apparel. Also unless you're fulltime you're not going to get hourts. Even the full time people don't get a lot. Overall it's a nice company, but depending on the managment it's either a hit or miss."
good,"Pay is better than most job if you’re young and are looking for something. More of a high school job if you’re not a lead or manger. Management is terrible, store is run terribly."
good,"I love a family feel enviroment .I hope to be able to engage that with my new team at Dicks .A smile can be contagious .Hopefully ,I can spread some sunshine this holiday season to customer service .""Service with a smile"""
good,Wonderful environment at the store level if you have a good management team running the store. Overall company decisions and leadership however do clearly have little vision as to what the exact day to day operations are like and that lack of vision makes them very narrow sighted on the success of the individual stores that will differ from location to location. The store I worked at again developed a great culture where everyone seemed to be very friendly with one another and in most cases be able to maintain the job to a very high level.
good,Downside to this job is they let go of peole on a weekly basis. meaning if you didnt come close to youre numbers consistantly they were letting you go. also some of the higher end managers did not treat customers or the employees well. i already wrote a letter to HR.
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods is a great company that’s based around aiding families to furfill their desires to have what ever they need for activities, Sports etc."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of assisting customers, restocking, and recovering the floor making sure the floor looked presentable for all customers."
good,Week to week hours would differ from on week getting 25 hours to the next week maybe 10 and I would rather something more stable. It is a nice and professional work environment though.
good,Management was really good but could be better. They're super friendly and thankful. Great coworkers who all have a passion for sports and the outdoors.
good,"This job was very physical and quota based. The coworkers were fun and nice.The hardest part of the job was the extreme heat in the summer.The heavy lifting was also very hard on the body. The pay and benefits were nice but the extreme heat is what forced me to leave."
good,Hardest part of the job was standing for such long period of times. And customer but who don't get ride customers. But good place as a start up in retail but don't get stuck.
good,"efficiency in stocking, product placement and customer service. as well as money management and maintaining a cleanly work environment. the managers brought a team effort to all parts of the store."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Management is a little lacking as well as the fact not everyone can operate the register or have a dressing room key which can frustrate customers. However associates are knowledgeable about there department
good,"Loved working their because it was fun the the staff were great always, however the customers were allowed to move their way past rules they had by just ""talking to the manager"" making the cashiers look bad for trying to follow the rules."
good,Mainly a great place to work for college students. Only problem i had was with the scheduling. Certain days i wanted to work werent added to my schedule.
good,"As a Team Lead, my satisfaction came with being able to train, develop and lead an easy-going department. Didn't have much opportunity to advance due to poor management."
good,good place but never felt right to with me being the youngest person there and with everyone a little distant but good spot got to drive alot of exotic cars
good,"Love to work the register"
good,"The co-workers at Dicks Sporting Goods what make working there so enjoyable and worth while. Although that is true, for the amount of work that I have put into that company and working in multiple departments; and can work very well in those departments. There's little payout for me, which is disappointing to me."
good,Worked part time during the school year. very flexible working hours and great co-workers. Can be stressful during holiday season.
good,"Working at Dick's Sporting Goods was fun. The customers were great, always got to meet new people, and co-workers were fun. They made it a very enjoyable workplace."
good,"Had four managers in six months, hard to impress when different store managers."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is very a busy environment and you must be able to multitask. I was a CSS which required many responsibilities. The employees are very hard working and friendly. In the area of management, this store is very mismanaged. I really enjoyed my customers and my job."
good,"Upbeat sports related environment."
good,"I learned how to stalk shelf’s , use the scanner and pdt I would walk around my department ( team sports ) and ask people what kind of sports equipment they needed I also learned how to steam a baseball glove I did several steamings a day. Management was very unorganized with they’re scheduling but they didn’t ever get mad if I didn’t know what I was doing. Most enjoyable part would have to be helping the customer get what they’re son or daughter needs for they’re season"
good,If you are looking for a place that you can work while going to college and that will work around your schedule then this is the place to come.  It is a friendly place to work.
good,"Dick's is a great job for advancement,they truly promote from within. It's a clean work environment and the mental health and stress levels of employees is always a concern. They offer opportunities to travel to other stores and train new employees even for part time associates."
good,"I enjoy the company and the people that work with. It was challenging opening the district, but would not change it for the world. Fast pace and ever evolving."
good,"It was a good first job, not much to say about it. fine environment i guess, great managers and team. No different than any other retail store environment."
good,It is a relaxed job not that hard at all. Learned to do just about anything they asked from me. Just lack of hours and I don't feel like I'm getting paid what I should be.
good,"I have work at Dicks Sporting Goods for six years; I enjoy the management and  the people I work with. Dicks Sporting Goods  a very laid-back, co-worker friendly, team oriented place to work. The management is willing to work with the employees on days off, sick day and vacation time when needed."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is very flexible for students who are in college or currently enrolled in school. The staff is relatively young and always brings happiness to every day that involves working. The only downside is some days can drag on and promotions rarely happen.
good,"Co workers were great, a typical day at work is standing at the cashier the entire time and completing customers transactions, providing answers to questions a customer has about policies, products and services. Employee dress code is very laid back and relaxed."
good,"I held the Customer Service Specialist position for about a year.  Learned various ways of customer service and sales pitches, had loyalty card goals and credit card goals that were met."
good,Busy fast paced place to work. Will work with on schedule. Management is understanding. Hours do change during shopping season.
good,If you like sports then this would be a great place to work and get discounts for working there. great management. friendly co workers and great products
good,"You have daily tasks to complete, but freedom to make decisions within your work. Knowledge is key in the lodge department and customers depend on the information that you give them. The hardest part of the job is getting consistent hours during the off season. The co-workers are all great former athletes, and people that I have a lot in common with. I enjoy spending time and talking with customers any time you can share your experiences and hear theirs."
good,Could use come changes as all companies do but overall I was pleased with my experience at Dick’s Sporting Goods. They had great management at my location and treated people good. Could have better discounts though
good,was always helpful and alot of work but its worth it always fun great people to work with as well and always helpful when you needed a little help as well.
good,Keep up with your points as in when you late for work. Calling in to work.Point system is very strict.Stay to yourself work and go home. I cant really explain a typical day cus my understanding since I have left which been 2yrs now has made alot of changes
good,typical day at work is arriving at work at 4 A.M. prepping the store to open by unloading the truck cleaning the bathrooms and organizing the apparel clearing claims and returns. ive learned how to work mechanical equipment and basic flow of the job. The most challenging part of the job was Claims and Returns. This job had great co workers and  very understanding managers
good,"Fun place to work for and learn new things while working.  You will meet new people of all races, age groups, and different personalities as well. Its a decent job to have and even better as a career if you advance."
good,"A typical day working at Dick's Sporting Goods looks a lot like any other retail store where you put forth great effort to provide customer service while completing the tasks given for the day as soon as possible. I've learned how to be very patient and how to speak appropriately to customers that come into our store. For example if we do not have the product they are looking a rookie employee may say ""Oh we actually don't have any in stock"" where as an experienced employee may say ""Unfortunately we do not have that specific product. However we do have something quite similar to it"" or ""Unfortunately we do not have that specific product. However we can offer an online order with a free shipping fee in store"". Since I work in the fitness and bikes department I normally run into customers who ask very general questions about certain products, such as the pricing on an item, price comparison, warranty, which equipment is best for this situation, etc. Other times I receive extraordinarily specific questions about a product that would require me to either research online or ask for manager's assistance. "
good,They are very kind and work well with employees in their out of work lives. They actually care about what their employees think. Even the higher upper management come in and meet their employees and they take time to get to know who they are working with.
good,Working at Dick's was fun but the management (not all of them) were quite unprofessional with their dealings with customers and employees.
good,It’s fun to work at but they expect a lot of manual labor for so little pay. Lost prevention is a joke. Work- home life balance is good though they don’t expect you to sign your life away
good,it is a great place to work at learned a lot of management skills i have today because of this job
good,they liked to hire people that was out of house instead of moving people up in the career line the days where ethier good or bad nothing in between can be stressful
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to work with the management team on a daily basis. I get to help them delegate different tasks.
good,Not saying all Dicks sporting Goods are a bad place to work bt the one on 202 in Wilmington De was not the best of them ! The job in its slf wasnt terrible but the management was deff the issue.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,the management was tough you could never call in sick always short staffed. than that it was a fun environment. they had food every Friday and there was always something going on. the leads in the departments think they don't have to do anything
good,Fun work place with ok management. Flexible schedule with good co-workers. Hard to work in the different departments.
good,"My typical work day would include the sells of firearms, and assisting customers finding what works best for them when it comes to weapons like Bows or Crossbows as well as Rifles and Shotguns. Most of my co-workers were great to work with and the ones that were difficult I would work with them still to finish the job at hand. The hardest part about the job was talking to all my coworkers since none of them has never served in the military, and this being the first time in 20 years having to work with civilians."
good,Sales - customer service - inventory control - stocking shelves - management
good,Over all the job experience was nice . I liked helping the customers and puttinbfg it new items for people to buy . But the management was not working properly with my school schedule or time off which effected me over all
good,"The company very seldom gives back to employees with anything more than a coupon to spend money at their store. Biggest perk is discount unless you have insurance needs. Not a whole lot of room for advancement of store ops into corporate ops, where the real money is."
good,This is a good job for someone that is going to college or is looking for part time employment.  You are allowed to schedule yourself around your school schedule.
good,"not a well put together company, very rude and dysfunctional. I was only temp seasonal, so I was let go after Christmas. the management just do not get on the same page or respect one another at all."
good,Dick's is a good place to work if your are seeking part-time or second job. I can't imagine living off this as my only income.
good,Dicks sporting goods is a extremely friendly and easy-going work place that respects employers enough to accommodate their religious beliefs when it comes to dress.
good,"I worked part time. First manager was terrible. Second manager was fine, only inexperienced. Job was easy just very slow pace. overall not a bad job for a college student."
good,"Dick’s Sporting Goods was my very first job. I started there with little to no experience. During my time working there, the employees were very helpful and kind. Anywhere I was struggling, I had someone there to help me. Management was considerate and understanding. I’d suggest this job to many people. Also, the workplace was cool. The customers were hardly rude!"
good,The people I work with are the only reason I still work there. 2/3 Managers are people that I do not agree with at all. One manager in particular I will always support no matter what.
good,"Amenities and benefits make it worth it, but corporate hierarchy and politics make advancing difficult based on pure job performance alone. The culture is similar to a college campus with many different cliques."
good,"I absolutely loved working here until we had a manager change about a year ago. The coworkers I worked with were amazing and I've met some of my best friends working here, but that was the only thing that kept me from leaving for 2 and a half years. Getting a raise was nearly impossible. It was suppose to happen every 6 months (or so I was told upon being hired) but it never worked out that way; according to our managers corporate did not approve raises for every employee outside of a few cents. On top of it if you call in sick or have any type of medical emergency it is treated as if work is more important than ones well-being. I had damaged my foot and when I called in to tell them I was going to get x-rays I was told to come in and work in a boot if I had to. The managers there are awful, and give no hours. The only time I ever received enough hours was during holidays. Other than that they picked favorites and gave the hours to them. I suggest working at any other location other than this one, because it was a super fun and great place to work; this location just got stuck with awful management. This review does not go for any other store other than the Williamsville location."
good,Working at Dicks is cool its just at times the management isn't the best. You will receive good hours and are able to take days off and schedule vacation time in advance so that was a good thing I liked about working there.
good,Managers are very rude and don't take into considerations that people have lives outside their company. Sometimes you work good hours and the nest week you have half the hours you worked the week before
good,Overall great experience. The only downside like a majority of retail jobs hours fluctuates horribly. Pretty fast paced and constantly change with the sports seasons.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Dicks sporting goods was a fun spot to work managers were awesome and appearl was fun setting up mannequins. you may have  to unload trucks that can be hard and there is a lot of appearl
good,Helping customers with their sporting needs. Fun and energetic place to work.  Worked around my school schedule. No room for growth but this is expected of this type of work.
good,"A typical day at work for me included being a cashier at times, as well as putting away the freight from that mornings truck. Opening fitting rooms for customers and making sure their needs were being met. Management was my least favorite part, it just always seemed so hectic and disorganized. The most enjoyable part for me were the other associates on the floor, always willing to help each other out whenever we needed it."
good,"While I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods for the short amount of time I was there, it was a great first job and the employees made it so fun! I wish I could've remained an employee for longer but due to harassment from a co-worker, I decided to leave."
good,"Everyone is a team player. Coworkers help each other when there’s an issue or problem with the customer. The customers you have to be very patient with some can be very rude. Management tends to let things escalate if you have an issue with another coworker."
good,The management was very poor you were always told one thing and chewed out by other managers for not doing it right and there wasn’t much wiggle room for promotion or raises
good,"Working at Dicks was a fun experience being that everyone is pretty much around the same age. It’s very relaxed, management is not always the best. But overall would recommend this job to a teenager or someone in college."
good,"Good place to work. I am in Operations, I secure merchandise with security tags and do ship from store. I could use more hours there but the job is manageable"
good,Dicks was an open ish environment making me think more as an individual and grow as a retail employee. Unfortunately it was a seasonal job and they were going to cut my hours after the holidays. I decided to look for other jobs and with miscommunication and misinterpretation between co workers and i the company thought i was going to quit. The management then heard about an inquiry i had with a female co-worker causing them to rashly act out and fire me without a notification but rather a phone call. This was very displeasing and upsetting to say the least considering I put in many hours at a time on a weekly basis. I was very flexible with my hours and understanding where i needed to be and what tasks i needed to complete. This was severely upsetting also because i cane to realize that i love retail and having face to face communication with customers and providing the best customer service to ensure they leave the store content with their time spent and employee quality.
good,I worked as a cashier and I truly enjoyed my time working with the company. I interacted with customers daily and loved the work environment. Management treated you fairly and worked with you if you ever had/have any issues in or outside the workplace.
good,The company is great working for but at times they don't schedule enough people to cover each others breaks. We would have to grab people from different department to cover them. Or even at times one person would have to cover two depart.
good,This is  a great part time job for anyone that would like some experience or would like some extra cash. Staff are friendly and willing to help you get started.
good,"The job seems like it will be a fun store to work at.  You think the atmosphere of the store would be fun.  It is the complete opposite, you are being micromanaged every second of the day.  There is nothing fun about the atmosphere of the job other than maybe your coworkers."
good,Poor hours great employees terrible pay with 20 cent raises at a minimimum. Competitive hours but won’t give anyone full time. Works 37 hours a week and never was asked for full time.
good,While working for Dicks i was at college so it was only temporary and to make money on the side. I was there only a short time but it was pretty relaxed and the management seemed alright and so did the coworkers.
good,"This is a typical retail job, the pay is bad, you are at the mercy of managers who dont want anything more out of life and you have to sell 20% interest credit cards to people."
good,Nothing special in particular. It is a normal retail job with easy days and hard days. If you have ever worked at any other retail it's almost exactly the same. Would recommend for athletes in college because you get a solid discount.
good,Not really sure what to say about working here. This particular store is extremely clique'ish. Lots of drama and not very consistent in the way things are done. Most people that work there don't seem to take their job seriously.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"This company is sharp, and very conservative."
good,"There is always a lot of work with management expecting a lot from the few. For a company expanding staggeringly, there ought to be some checks and balances in place."
good,"This was just a seasonal job for me, but I really do think highly of the company, just recently purchased a pair of running shoes from a Dick's Sporting Goods, and I'm always impressed with the store regardless of which location it happens to be, this is one of things I find impressive about the franchise, and currently residing in Tucson, I would say that the stores in Arizona appear to be one, highly presentable, and two, I assume, must be well managed, but there again, this doesn't surprise considering my background knowledge working at a Dick's Sporting Good's, I am thankful for the opportunity I had."
good,Pay sucked but thr atmosphere was nice. Coworkers were friendly and management was easy to talk to. Enjoyed the customers and even though I don't play sports it was an enjoyable job.
good,the atmosphere was fine the store manager is the one who I felt I had the most problems with he made work extremely personal and I found him to be very unprofessional
good,"An enjoyable part-time retail job where I have learned a lot about retail merchandising. I do work in a very challenging work environment, though."
good,"I run the office, and help out with as much as I can, staying busy is never an issue. I handle everything from picking up phones to hiring and terminating employees. I have learned a great deal on how an office is ran and what it takes to run it. I've picked up skills in other areas of the company, like ship from store and inventory team. The management is a good bunch of people. They are easy to work with and work with you as much as they can. If you work hard for them they will work hard for you. The job isn't difficult, it's learning as much as you can then applying what you have learned to the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom I have. After I get done with my task I can help whoever I want to help, I just stay busy."
good,"Its not a job I would particularly want out of high school. it would be a great art time job, If I was looking for 20 hours a week."
good,"Most days at work were very laid back, however if the manager was having a bad day, he/she took it out on everyone.  I love working here because it is my cup of tea.  This company is too concerned about the numbers and doesn't seem to care too much about employees and their development."
good,I can only reiterate what I said in the summary. I worked very hard for this company and I was ultimately considered so disposable. Typical corporate structure.
good,Fun place to work at people there are nice and some of the managers are pleasant as well. No very understanding if something in your life comes up they will let you go.
good,"besides the less of hours they have to offer its a really great place. its a great place to start of your work career. fast past work, customer service is good"
good,"Honestly it's a good job but however my review Is the store manager, this guy Is very unprofessional and very rude I usually don't review on jobs but this one really touched a nerve!.I'm all for respect and all but once you start talking to me like I'm a dog then cooperate or head chief needs to know what type of person is working for their company.I myself feel this store lacks communication and lack respect if I known the ""head coach""was such an ### then I would not have applied! .p.s. good luck If you're looking for someone who cares about his associates"
good,"My typical day at work consisted of ringing customers out at my personal register or the customer service desk, also i would attend to customers when they needed to find a specific item, i learned how to operate a cash register at this job, my co-workers were great people who were looking to better there opportunity at work just like i was, hardest part of the job was standing up for 8 hours, my most enjoyable part of the job was helping out customers with finding items they desperately wanted and knowing that i was able to help them be happy at the end of the day."
good,Management could be more supportive and understanding and complementary towards staff.  Staff is excelent when it comes to customer service.
good,Lots of drama and not many people got along. Always hard to get off work because of being short handed. Loved working there at first and then it was not a fun environment like when i started.
good,"Would stock, clean and maintain department as well as help customers."
good,"Unloading and loading freight keeping stockroom clean, neat and organized."
good,"Management was ok, co workers were good most spoke poorly when I began there. Overall, for a first job it was not terrible. It became an issue balancing work hours with me being a high school student though."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Some employees get way more hours than others. They have a hard time with making schedules for the store needs. They are always under staffed and you will be stuck doing the amount of work it should take 2-3 people to finish and be expected to finish it
good,"It was alright. The mall was always packed on the weekends. The management was unprofessional at Times, managers had an attitude and always had a favorite that they treated special"
good,It started out cool but the management is horrible. My co-workers were cool and the environment is fast paced and you are always learning something. But the work ethic of that store needs a lot of help
good,"Dicks was a great job I loved working there , I especially loved how the managers and my co workers were so nice and very professional and friendly. It’s Sometimes a fast paced establishment but thankfully I’m a very fast learner and a hands on person"
good,"Heavy interaction with customers. Must be extremely friendly and outgoing. Reach daily store goals. Ex. Credit card sign ups, reward member enrollment."
good,"They have a good starting rate depending on your skill and competence but from the janatorial work in addition to your own duties, they work you so hard you might feel as though that's not enough."
good,standard day at Dick's Sporting Goods is very fast pace trying to balance helping costumers and executing work tasks. Being able to help people with similar passions gives you a good feeling of pride.
good,Everything was good working here they treat u as a family but the management they have needs help very unorganized and they need help with staff and position
good,"foremost, i must say if you're a cashier, try your best to sign people up for credit cards and rewards... and stay motivated and positive everyday no matter the issues in your personal life"
good,I submitted my application for Lodge and Team Sports as a good fit for me since I was involved in boy scouts and baseball and football. Dicks asked what section id be a best fit for and I said I could do good in both. They decided to give me a job in Operations which I never applied for and hired people for team sports who had no knowledge in sports.
good,fast paced working environment ..managers only care about friends they  have hired that they know personally .. managers are to young for management ..
good,My time with the company was enjoyable. The training was not overwhelming and the day to day tasks were anything but labor intensive. I learned to adapt to helping calm disgruntled customers who did not agree with the company decisions.
good,This store is the perfect job or any athlete. If you love helping kids and adults find out if they are going to like trying a new sport it’s rewarding.
good,As a college student I wanted a flexible job that would be able to work with my changing school schedule. They are very understanding at my store and I feel that my pay is fair considering I am just part time.
good,"This was my first job. I learned so much from the 2 and a half years I’ve been working there. I’ve dealt with many uncomfortable situations with customers that’s only benefited me because now I know how to handle a lot of different obstacles. Overall the people here are nice the management is good, and the other associates are very friendly."
good,Great people including management but they have issues putting associates in their desired spots even when they’ve applied to those positions. Some positions are under paid as well.
good,Wasn’t always busy and had a lot of free time. Managers did not always help the people who did hard work and favored those who liked to hang around and talk
good,"A typical workday at dick sporting goods was average. At the store I was located at the management was horrible. lied about my pay. and was given shifts outside my availability. the sports culture outside of dicks sporting goods was nice, as I learned how to get on sight experience with customers negative or positive. the hardest part of working at dicks sporting goods is adapting to the culture of retail and what comes with it."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Working at Dick's Sporting Goods was so much fun. I really liked the people I worked with and the job itself was very easy. Some issues that I encountered had to do with scheduling. My schedule was open with the exception of 2 days but I would be scheduled once or twice a week... I would definitely suggest this job for students due to the fact that it is a fun easy job and if you have certain schedule they will make sure you don't work!
good,"Honestly it was a pretty easy job, I just had to talk to customers and keep my section of the store looking nice.  The managers were nice people and I enjoyed going into work there but it only paid minimum wage."
good,It is a good company but I need a place for advancement. Needed a place where i could learn more and advance in life as well as in the company. Also they should implement more employee suggestions to the workplace
good,"Pay is not competitive. "
good,I was a manager at Dick's for awhile.  I didn't love it at the end.  You were scheduled 5 10 hour shifts and were given a hard time if you left on time.  Tight turn arounds where I would leave at 10 and be expected back at 4am and work til 4pm.  Got called in on my days off alot and usually worked 6 days a week.
good,"The pay is low, even for retail.  A typical day is waiting on customers and stocking shelves.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the amount of inventory which arrives 1-3 times per week and finding a place for it on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk fishing and hunting with the customers"
good,"Mostly the job included customer service, helping customers find whatever sporting goods they required.  Keeping the store neat and tidy.  Doing cashier help when needed."
good,"stressful by management, customers and corporate. So much expectation in so little time. Dicks is a great place for a high schooler or a recent HS graduate to get a summer job or seasonal."
good,A typical day consist of assisting customers in store or over the phone helping them find certain merchandise and as well as pricing. The difficult part is when it's a busy day and as an employee you find yourself helping in various departments.
good,"review time punches, mark late or unexcused attendances on the tracker, print out the line up and make schedule breaks, check for any information to pass on to the team, enter known theft, enter store use or loss product, make sure registers and detachers are working properly,"
good,"The job itself was great. High foot traffic, sales based job. From the corporate side all was in sync. Well organized systems allowed Sales Leads to delegate information for marketing and merchandising goals. As far as in house management, there was a disconnect to employees. My GM at the time was always to busy to discuss KPI goals and merchandising. As a unit I felt a disconnect and often not part of the team."
good,"I liked working here it was just the hours that I worked I was literally by myself in an entire department, it made work a little more stressful than it should have been honestly."
good,"Working at Dick's is quite simple, do hard work and be friendly and you will rarely encounter an issue, Customers are the worst part about the job. Being friendly is very important."
good,"helping customers and athletes from every walk of life with every sport finding the right equipment to make sure they can perform their best at their games, activities or hobbies."
good,"The environment was a great one especially for anyone who is a athlete. However, the managers ability to see peoples work ethic and ability to promote within was lacking. No one takes anything serious and they do not look very hard at normal sales associates. High turnover"
good,It's fun to work there you get to meet so many people and a lot of pro athlete come in there and we help the and take picture with them and the news come when  we have a sport team that won the championship.
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is a company that moves very fast with competitive pay and benifits. You will have the opportunity to grow in this company and chanlenge yourself every day. You will work side by side with a great deal of high quality people and customers are for the most part great. There is no work life balance and that is a major chanlenge and the hardest part of the job.
good,"This is a typical retail job. Not good benefits or pay."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Dick's is an alright company that makes working retail tolerable at times. A good college job because everyone else is your age, and usually pretty cool people. Management as always is the downside as everyone is always playing politics and trying to get someone fired. I guess the benefits are nice the higher up the ladder you go."
good,"Everyday you were helping people find things in the store, running to get sizes they needed, or helping them put outfits together. This job was a job that never got old as long as you kept yourself busy."
good,"There is not much to expect in retail. Customer service is key. Pay sucks. However, the job duties are not complicated. Most days(depending on the season and day of the week) consist of short spells of super busy followed by long bouts of waiting for a customer to service. Best part of all, comfortable, athletic wear is required."
good,"Footwear sales associate, speaking to customers on a daily basis, knowledge of shoes is the hardest part of the job. Learned a lot about shoes."
good,Some great people to work with at my store.  Golf is done at Dicks not hard to see why when you take a good look at their management.
good,It has been a few years since I have worked at DSG and I know a lot has changed. It is definitely not the same from when I worked there. When I was there we lost 3 or 4 managers in a matter of months. The turn over rate is pretty high as well. I worked there for almost 3 years and I worked in almost every department. I ended as a front end lead. I miss my old co workers and a couple of the managers which none are still with the company. Again the hardest part of my job was communication with the in store managers.
good,Minimum wage job that supplied me with enough income to get through graduate school. Management can be difficult at times but overall it was a good place to work.
good,Typical day involved standing around ringing up customers or unloading heavy merchandise off huge trucks at 4am. Co-workers were nice but the management had little to no respect for employees.
good,"A day at Dick's is fairly easy. It involves a lot of organizing products, labeling products, and conversing with customers."
good,Good company to purchase from.  We were often short staffed and were very limited on the hours we could work.
good,"I like the work I do at Dick's, but pay and opportunities for advancement are difficult to come by."
good,Never knew of hours worked. Management had a lack of communication to their specific department.
good,"I love my job, my bosses are all pretty awesome! Lack of knowledge by Management makes it hard to successfully finish the work at hand because the work that is put in becomes negated dew to the inconsistency and bad management skills in the apparel department in which I currently work. Other then that, the Store Manager is very understanding and an all around great boss. The work environment is easy going and the employees are great with people and working as a team."
good,"At dick sporting goods,we really put the customers first. I do alot of organizing apparel, customer service, and helping customers find exactly what they are looking for. The hardest part of this job would be consistency of hours. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to work with customers,and successfully accomplishing the task of finding their item."
good,i do not really member much about working there other then it tought me how to work it was my first job
good,"Usually just folded clothes, cleaned dressing rooms, and did freight every Wednesday. I learned more customer service skills, and sporting good advice. Management was good, most of them pretty understanding and easy to work with. Co-workers were a hit and a miss. Some hard working and some very difficult to keep on task. Hardest part was disgruntled guests and lazy staff. The most enjoyable part was helping people to find fitness and sporting equipment most suiting to them."
good,"Lack of communication from the store level all the way to the corporate level. As any work place there are good days and bad, depending on the mood of the managers and the workload for the day."
good,A great place to work if you love sports. Typical retail environment with steady turnover plus a core long term group. Management is better than typical.
good,"A relaxed fun place to work. A lot of college kids using their spare time to make an extra buck or two. In busy seasons a lot of hours, beneficial in terms of pay, with early starts and late closings followed by returns and recovery would make for extremely late finishes."
good,"I enjoyed working at Dicks sporting Goods. There is no room for advancement, all of the associates are hired as part time to avoid giving them benefits. only upper management got benefits. That’s why I ended up looking for a better job with benefits for my family. A fun a place for young people to start their first job."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Too much favoritism in the company. When I first began the job I informed the managers that I was prior service in the military but they still ignored my schedule.
good,"25% off soft goods (candy, apparel, shoes) and 15% off other goods (fishing, boats, etc)"
good,It was a good place to work. I don’t remember much about pay or if there were bonuses or anything. They took the time to teach you what you needed to learn
good,Every one there was very friendly and to get along with. There was not a dress code to go to work we could wear whatever we wanted as long as it wasn't revealing.
good,"If you want to work at Dick's in Pearland, get ready to get screwed over! The teammates are cool and fun but management wise WOW! Never have I met people go back on their word so much! I'm not from Texas so I like to go back home in North Carolina for the summer. The store director said he'll approve it along with the person who makes the schedules. Which they did but a week before I was suppose to return to work I was scheduled to come in. They said they called me, which they didn't. Long story short I am now fired and it's not even my fault. Now I would've understood if I was a bad worker or didn't do anything at work but I was one of the hardest, fastest and respectful workers in the store. Not to mention I Always got surveys."
good,Dick’s is a great place to work at for beginners and depending the managerial you’re allowed to work freely without much managerial hovering. The pay is also decent.
good,"Working with other people who enjoy Golf as much as I did was so much fun. I really enjoyed helping customers with their golf needs, fittings, and just hearing about their enjoyments as well."
good,its a great place to work when you are out of high school. It teaches you a lot but it becomes boring after a while. they don't really teach you much so its better to leave soon and don't get raises.
good,Enjoyed the atmosphere. And the staff was friendly. A lot of unorganizaion within the sales teams. The management was very friendly however they did lack in experience of problem solving.
good,"I found Dick's Sporting Goods to be a comfortable place to work and be a part of a team. I never really had a problem meeting the companies' expectations. Working schedules were usually flexible and managers were always willing to accommodate my needs. My coworkers were mostly fun to work with and most everyone foster a ""we are family"" atmosphere. The most enjoyable part of my job was my interaction with our customers. Over the six years I worked there, I was able to build relationships with people who became regular customers and always looked to me to take care of their needs. Dick's Sporting Goods was a company I desired to retire with."
good,I enjoyed my position as a cashier at Dicks. I was only part time but when ever we were short handed i always offered to stay or was called into fill in. It's rare for a full time position to come available so i had to look elsewhere.
good,Clock in and just hang out and do your job. Its pretty low stress as long as you actually put in minimal effort. Managers are understanding and the store is fairly well organized.
good,"Great associates to work with, great environment, laid back and relaxed but during holidays can be fast paced at times, managers are very flexible with hours"
good,I got greeted every time i went to work. I felt at home at my work everyone got along and no drama. I learned that working together you get stuff done so much faster.
good,"Some days are good and some are different, just depends on the day. You are required to have knowledge of every department, and help customers with all needs."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a good company to work for if you're looking to get experience as a sales associate. Through this job, I have learned how to manage time and to build great communication skills."
good,"Worked here through college. It is ok, however I would not work there full time only because of the hours, pay, and benefits. It was fun while I worked there."
good,Management is expected to work more than the 40 hours a week they are salaried for. Communication was only once a week from district manager. Equal pay for females does not exist.
good,Good people fun to work at They are just no opportunities for  advancement  in the company and pay is not that great and hours Are not that good. Other than that loved working here
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"It is a great place to learn how to work as a team. It is good place to lean how to become a leader and how to delegate tasks. In a typical day on the job I change prices, set ads and make sure prices are correct."
good,They kept working a happy and fast pace work environment. Team work is everything. Management was back and forth non consistent. Everyone I worked with focused on their job first then would help others.
good,"Overall typical sporting goods store with a special focus on golf. I am a certified club fitter for titleist, ping, and callaway golf clubs. Focus on selling with a consultative approach."
good,Everyone I worked with at Dicks Sporting Goods made the work day fun while we kept it professional. The managers were always kind and easily approachable as well.
good,"It takes a strong eye to build the right empire for customer service. Managers have a healthy task, especially with the high turnover rate. I learned patience and accessibility working here."
good,"Really great experience starting out. You get compensated for getting CC sign ups, which was nice! Really social place to work and you make a lot of friends."
good,"At times working here feels like your voice does not matter. Even as a lead, it can be frustrating to not be able to fully utilize my potential. I would have liked to be given better opportunity and support by management."
good,"Hours were very inconsistent, and management wasn't too receptive to employees concerns. But a cool place to work if you enjoy sports. They bring food to the meetings though, that's nice."
good,"management was decent for retail, work was entertaining and fun, great people, hours were flexible and pay is decent for the required job responsibilities."
good,The manager that handles team sports is the best he always had a good time and always had a blast when I worked with him! The store manager really didn't know what went on half the time.
good,"working with customers."
good,Management is professional to an extent; allowed workers to talk to them however they pleased and also allowed drama to flow steadily through the workplace. Wouldn't listen to newer/younger employees (treated like children)
good,"The employees at Dick's are always fun to work with, and it is a good place to make friends in the college age group. Management is not the greatest and will likely push employees to breaking point."
good,the hardest part of the job is dealing with micro-managers that will not let you do your job unless you do it how they want it done. Along with getting promoted but never being trained on the other aspects of your new position.
good,Over all not a bad place to work. It can be boring at times and other times theres not enough help. Not sure why they dont have people working in every department all the time. Not sure why they stock shelves full of filler product instead of what people actually want. But I enjoy the people and working there.
good,"worked there for a long time just no room for advancement or pay raise."
good,"Very fun loving and exciting environment to work in, get team,customers with lots of fun filled ideas and dreams. the best part is serving the customers and finding what they need for their big day."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,This was the same as any retail store. You can work harder then anyone else but yet get paid and treated the same as the guy who stands there and does nothing.
good,This job is perfect for someone that's in college and only want a few hours or someone that's retired and just want to spend a few days out of the house. Pay not all that good and management is okay for the most part.
good,"shoe sales "
good,The customers and managing can become over whelming is some cases. Although the great thing is that you meet so many different people that tend to be active.
good,"A typical day at work would be providing customers with knowledge about shoes they were searching for, selling them, as well as checking them out from time to time. Working at Dick's allowed me to become more knowledgeable about retail sales, and shoes themselves. Overall management was good, and my co-workers were great. It was a fun environment to work in. I did not find any parts of work hard, because I enjoyed the challenges brought to me. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with customers and providing them with the information they needed to complete there purchase."
good,"very friendly employees to work with."
good,Co-workers were nice management on the other hand weren't very understanding and always jumped to conclusions before anything and no matter what you were always in the wrong.
good,"Merchandising items displayed at the Front End, assist other departments with securing their merchandise according to Company loss-prevention standards.  Work closely with management to insure Company Front End performance metrics for all cashiers are being followed on a daily basis.  Coach new associated as their learn the variety of duties performed in this department.  Report cashier deficiencies or policy violations to a member of management or the Loss Prevention Manager.  The hardest part of this job has been managing the performance of constantly changing staff (turnover is too high).  The most enjoyable has been getting to know the regular customers and their families as they have continued to grow."
good,"Busy day to day operations"
good,Moving from one small sportsman store to a huge corporate business was a big change yet gave me the details of how large corporations have to be run.
good,A typical day at work was checking out customers and offering them warranties and credit options with their purchases. I learned how to multitask my managers were not my favorite group of managers I have ever worked with. They were not as friendly but they were always around to help. My coworkers were friendly and always willing tot fill in for me if need be. The hardest part of the job was knowing that i was putting in 110% and was never going to get rewarded for it. The most enjoyable part was looking at my paycheck.
good,"A typical day at Dick's Sporting Goods involved talking to customers to help them find what they're looking for, making sure that the fitting rooms and return drawers were clean and empty, and running freight onto the sales floor. The managers and employees that I worked with were okay. No one ever gave me a hard time and for the most part everyone just did what they were supposed to be doing. The job was fine in the beginning, however it became too monotonous and I saw no opportunity for a promotion. The pay was also minimum wage which discouraged me."
good,I truly like working at dicks sporting goods. The customers that come in are usually happy and excited. The workers that we bring in are usually really excited to be there as well. It can be challenging at times to manage all the tasks and ensure that all customers needs are met.
good,Learned all about shoes. Learned about corporate practices.  Learned how to train other employees.  hardest part was constantly changing corporate game plans while having single coverage in departments.  Most enjoyable was helping customers diagnose their needs and set them up with a product that suits them best.
good,a great place to have your first job. management takes care of everyone.
good,"Low pay is the only complaint I have.  Other than that, it is a great place to work."
good,"This job was a decent one, to say the least. The company is good and the products were even better. The overall experience was definitely a learning one. The people working there were awesome and the clientele was mostly nice. Retail work is ""different."" I say that because everyday brought something new and unique; I would never know if it was going to be a good customer day or a disgruntled customer day. The job itself was not that difficult, and the hours were good."
good,"•	Assist and cater to customers’ needs and provide knowledgeable product information. "
good,"not a bad place to work, as long as you are in school. I open up the store and work till about 3 in the afternoon. Advancement opportunities are only given to people who plan to stay there for a long time."
good,"A typical day at work is exciting and energetic.  You learn new things every day during work, meet unique customers and most importantly, help customers and making sure they are satisfied.  Management is tough but can be fun at times.  They make sure the store is in tip top shape.  "
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."

good,Very busy most times long hours for holidays. The staff was always friendly and team players.
good,good healthcare for full time workers
good,very customer focused. Am able to satisfy most customers needs as I learn about each department
good,Working here i have gained more experience and great friendships with fellow coworkers. Some of the management makes it a little hostile but overall your coworkers make it worth while.
good,"Intriguing company to work for, especially if you are an athlete. The management crew are always full of life and always have the costumer best interest at heart, which ultimately rubs off on most associates."
good,"Very hard working, I was never late to work and worked over time if needed! I was always willing to help and employee if they needed help. Always have a smile on my face."
good,"A typical day here is productive.  The culture is great as the employees seem to have a sense of belonging and dedication to the brand.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the on-site amenities, which include a gym, cafeteria, basketball court, ping-pong table."
good,"Large retail sporting goods chain "
good,"A day at Dick Sporting Goods was work with a side of fun. Being very involved with sports culture at home, I felt at the right place. The things that I excelled at while working at this job were time management, multi-tasking, and project building. The hardest part about the job was signing people up for credit cards when running the cash register. The most enjoyable part about the job was the bond each emplyee had with each other. It made the staff feel like a team."
good,"Any job in retail is always changing with the trends, so this job is fast paced and challenging. Management is always challenging and you are always busy doing something, which helps the day fly by."
good,Dick’s sporting goods is a good place to work at if you need flexible schedule for school. You get a lot of hours during the Christmas season. Not a bad place for a first job.
good,I enjoyed the team attitude toward having a successful store.  I learned about product placement and the importance of proper presentation of the products.
good,"A typical day is busy but you're surrounded by friendly coworkers, managers and the customers aren't that bad. I learned how to organize myself and the workplace."
good,You get a store discount as an employee. I was a cashier and a floor sales associate. I enjoyed working here along. I love dicks sporting goods. Great.
good,I worked in the bike department originally but because I originally wanted lodge department they started to put me there a couple days a week. When you are cross trained it gives a little reprieve to your daily tasks.
good,I learned professional and sales skills while working. The workplace is productive and there is always something to learn. Most enjoyable moments were working with the customers and providing exceptional customer service.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,It was not a bad place to work. It was fast paced and physical which I like. Supervisors would ask me to help other team members lift when they couldn't. There wasn't much appreciation for going above and beyond.
good,"DSG was a good first retail job, especially for anyone interested in sports.While I worked across many different departments, there was not a whole lot of room for advancement."
good,"Working at Dick's has been a good experience. The employees are nice and the customers have been alright. You get some really nice regulars, rude regulars, and a mix of others. The management has gone through a lot of changes in the last couple months. This has caused the work experience to be a little hectic. However the job has been satisfactory."
good,It was a good job to have in throughout college as it provided for flexible hours and good pay for the time. There was a strong team of associates who all worked together for a common goal of utmost customer satisfaction.
good,Good place to work with good coworkers. Management could use some work but overall good. There are good learning and developing opportunities for one to build on their skills.
good,"Good place to work, very team work based job, relaxing days was never super busy or hectic, just feel the pay could’ve been a little better. Great management team as well!"
good,"Enjoyed my time at Dick's Sporting Goods, the end was a little rough as I was being treated unfairly but overall I learned a lot of helpful skills for future employment"
good,"Good job, great people, aswome products. Ok pay, good job for students. Caring about youth sports and there community.. cold store In the summer to work"
good,I was CSS and this was the most boring job I have ever had. Besides checking people out and doing returns the only thing I ever had to do was fold/hang clothes
good,"DIck's Sporting Goods has a great atmosphere, especially if you appreciate the outdoors and physical activity. Good environment with manager involvement."
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
good,"I enjoyed working there. I won three main in store competitions. I got the most CC, customer comments, and registrations. Plus I was just happy with customers and other employees."
good,"The company is good company to work for, however the specific store i worked at had terrible management.  If you weren't a favorite of the manager then your weekly hours were inconsistent.  I asked for a higher position in the store and was brushed off numerous of times."
good,The environment is usually laid back. I like it so far I've been there. I have my days when I don't but who doesn't at work? There isn't really a hard part about working there and easy to adjust. I enjoy being solo most of the day.
good,"The job itself was great, although stressful at times, especially during holidays. We had many different managers coming in and out of the store! This made communication difficult. They were only flexible with your schedule if you made arrangements in advance and were not so lenient with call-ins or switching shifts..."
good,"I enjoyed being in a manager role and being responsible for a store full of associates. It was fast paced and there were many times I was the only manager there and was responsible for cash management, customer service, tasks, and hourly associates. I enjoyed the customer service side and working with customers to take care of their sporting goods needs."
good,"During the winter it is very busy and a good work environment to keep you busy, but can be stressful. Summers are more relaxed and may need to search for jobs or activities to do at work; may be standing around a lot."
good,"every day you were working on the conveyor system, moving the maintenance department to a different location, bailing cardboard, loading the cardboard trailer staying busy in general."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical work day at Dick's Sporting Goods was helping customers find sporting products they needed, returning or exchanging items and ringing up their items. The managment was wonderful and the culture was great, especially if you loved sports. On game days they would have parties and let us watch the games while working. The hardest part was having to explain to customers if they got denied a credit card application. The most enjoyable part was spending time with people who loved sports just as much as I do."
good,Dick's Sporting Goods was an enjoyable place to work. The climate there was welcoming and relaxed. We got our work done in a timely manner and we worked well together as a team.
good,The work is pretty easy it just gets old after a while of working there. I like dealing with customers and catering to their needs but it isn't always the busiest so you have to fill your time with other tasks.
good,"Assist with general supervision of department, delegate on-floor work assignments, engage customers with passionate customer service and selling, comply with loss prevention standards and audit requirements."
good,The workplace at Dick's was fun. Working with associates to try and help out customers best was an enjoyable experience. The management was stellar and was flexible.
good,"No two days are the same, and a lot of changes occur daily/weekly.  The best part is working collaboratively with cross-functional teams.  If you don't know the answer, someone will always be there to help"
good,It was a pleasure working for this company. I enjoyed working here the staff was amazing as well as the environment. I would work here again if offered to.

good,I worked there during the holiday season and that would be the only time I would ever work there. Staff were very stood up. No true benefits and you only get like $2 per credit card you sold.
good,"Friendly staff and reasonable company goals. Large focus on the customer unites associates for a common goal. Great family benefits, 401K and health insurance options."
good,"workplace is healthy, and professional. management is mature and very friendly. I am well-respected as an employee by my teammates  and peers and my productivity is excellent only because I feel wanted and I am given appropriate feedback on my performance."
good,"this is your typical retail job. pay isn't that great, but neither is the stress level or expectations. have to deal with the public which can be frustrating."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Dick's Sporting Goods. I worked in a wide range of responsibilities, and was able to improve my people skills and task completion skills."
good,"A typical day of work for me was arriving on time, i would sit at the register all day and just ring people out, their were time where things got stressful because it would get so busy. The hardest part of the job was probably doing returns that were stolen goods."
good,"just depends on management, besides that, its a job. Good discount for clothes there sometimes you get good perks such as pro sports game tickets for certain people who achieve a specific goal"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"As a job its self i love the place. I love the atmosphere and the coworkers around me. Not to mention what athlete wouldn't want to work at a sporting goods store. But, I was promised a promotion that the managers were really wanting me to get, only to find out that they hired 3 new inexperienced people to take the job that I was suppose to get. I would love to keep the job but I'm not sure yet."
good,"If you are given a lead role slack is given to other staff below you and you basically perform at levels expected for a manager role, while performing most of other staff's tasks. Hard to move up without degree or complete devotion to company."
good,"Come in and clock in and work the register or whatever department scheduled, recover area and help others in their departments. Management was good in adhering to employees and it was a good atmosphere to work in. Slow days are hard as it is hard not to get bored in retail. Helping someone find what they need is always enjoyable."
good,"The company provides great opportunity to engage in customer interaction while providing customer service. I enjoy the connection created between customers and employees which allows for a team effort to be taken into account in order to fulfill the customers’ needs. Although some managers are not gracious of success in the workplace, there are others that acknowledge the good service provided and make it a point to make employees aware of good customer service."
good,"Some of the managers are relaxed, others think you're there for a career. Some take the job a little too seriously. But the discount is great, sometimes you can use it on clearance items."
good,"There was a real sarcastic demeanor in the workplace a lot of times, in the way that they spoke to the associates but other than that it was a real flexible, and sometimes joyous place to work."
good,"relaxed work space calm productive but kind of fast paced very enjoyable easy to work and easy to concentrate everyone is very nice, management was kind of willing to understand fully though"
good,"Same tasks every shift, just offering the best customer service possible. This can vary based on customer. Management ranged from okay to terrible, managers seem to come and go. Workplace culture is nice, coworkers in certain departments can get really close which makes for an enjoyable time. Hardest part of the job is working with customers. Most enjoyable is interacting with coworkers."
good,Good Part time job for college students. no more then 20 hours a week scheduled. no benefits  for part time. training is good. management is easy to work with. scheduled 2 weeks in advanced.
good,"For the sports interested, customers ask a lot of questions but easy to adapt. Goals can become stressful but easy work environment. Will be trained in multiple departments."
good,I truly enjoyed most of the people that I worked with.  The location was very convenient relative to where my home is.  One of my strengths is customer service.
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods has been my second home for nearly the last three years. Although I do enjoy my coworkers, I am tired of working in retail. My job is fun but having to deal with a lot of ungrateful people over the last couple of months has been exhausting. I joined the company to talk about my passion for sports as well as selling the best product I could for any type of sport. In the past couple of months, I've noticed that people are really grateful around this time of the year, so that is a great perk of working in retail. However, in a couple of different situations I have occasionally received a bit of grief from a couple of customers where I had to get a manager on duty to help understand. Being in retail made me realize that it's a great job for kids in college who need to make some ""pocket money""."
good,"simple job making sure customers are satisfied , management can be fair at times, somedays under staffed , the best part is the team , they make it a fun and enjoyable enviroment"
good,"I love working here, but you have to be self motivated to be successful.  Also you must expect it to be busy sometimes and not majority of the time, but that is common with any retail."
good,"Not really an ideal company to launch your career, unless you absolutely enjoy the retail industry.  If full-time, there is not a lot of flexibility with your schedule, and generally, may be inconsistent.  You may work the morning one day, evening the next, and then back to the morning the following day, which affects your overall work/life balance."
good,The best part of the job was my coworkers. Overall workload was easy and dealing with customers was not too bad. Good place to work for seasonal employment.
good,"Meeting everyday, 30 minute lunch, different lines each day until you get put on one specific line. Learned about the different lines and how they work. Learned how to unjam different machines."
good,i worked there for 2 yrs the first year i was able to get 30-40 hours a week after my 1st yr my hours decreased from 30-40 hours a week to just 10-20 hours a week
good,its a good work experience for those who dont mind communicating with customers. a normal day is usually slow. most days you would just stock items up and make sure the customer finds what they are looking for.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Retail can be stressful, but sports retail can be fun. It is a fast paced environment with ever-changing goals and responsibilities. The hardest part of the job was the continuous daily and weekly changing of tasks and goals."
good,Working here definitely will have you wanting to pursue a career with Dicks. Fun place to work the everyone is there to help. This job can be super fun if yo manager is a good manager.
good,Enjoyed working at DSG and learned to better handle cash and grasped a better understanding of quality customer service. Typically always had something to do so most days wouldn't drag on. People did tend to butt heads sometimes so steering clear of that was desired.
good,"A typical day as customer service specialist: open the cash office, run on the register, assist cashiers with complicated transactions, handle any unhappy customers, and close cash office."
good,great place to work if your are comfortable working with people. also good employee benefits. great atmosphere to work in if you like to be moving around .
good,Things could be improved here.  I enjoyed the job as a whole but I didn't feel that the managers cared about what was going on with you.  All about the money
good,"good fun working environment not stressful very entertaining fun costumers, good to interact with them and get their feed back on the products. bust at times but not always."
good,"not a bad place to work part time or for high school/college kids. decent discount and hours aren't bad. Only downfall would be holidays such as black friday, but it is an opportunity to make money."
good,Fun place to work. You get to help families outfit the kids for their first sports experience as well as help sports enthusiast find what they need. ots of opportunities.
good,Working here is a very busy and fast paced environment. There is always something to be done and not many chances to get bored. Energetic staff and coworkers make getting through the day easy
good,"Great work atmosphere. The job opens up a different scenarios that you will learn how to work with. If you enjoy sports and enjoy helping others who have questions about it, this is a great enviroment to help those customers out."
good,Great managers and great work experience for basic level sales experience.  Makes for a great college job as an associate level sales position.  Also great discounts.
good,Sometimes it have its rough days when people call out. I have earned most of leadership skills from here. Great place to start building towards leadership. Not everyone their is a great managers but when you provide good work ethic they will work with you.
good,I loved this job. This job is the best environment and loving people to work with. I never had a problem with them once so ever. They were always very loving.
good,"Not a terrible place to work, no real full time workers unless you've been there years. Easy to advance if you are a good worker. Downside is the customer is always right even when they are wrong, screaming, or threatening you. SO if you can deal with customer service in the face of rude customers it is a nice place to work. Must say majority f customers are pleasant though. Pay is barely above minimum, no ral benefits, and they will terminate you immediately for unionizing."
good,Typical retail environment and benefits. Management is ok. Always focused on numbers and not associate moral.Typical retail environment and benefits..
good,"My time spent at Dick's Sporting Goods has been fairly pleasant. Besides the lack of proper training and the high turnover rate, making the days more difficult than they have to be, the atmosphere is exciting. We are also busy doing tasks, which makes the day go by faster, and I have formed many friendships through this company. I have become skilled in many departments and am responsible for many things even though I am not coded as a Lead. Moving up in this company is possible, but difficult. If a Lead is present, even whenever they are not fit to be a Lead, there is no upward movement for reliable associates. In saying all of this, coming in with a positive attitude will always uplift your coworkers and encourage them to work their best, making everyone a little happier."
good,All of the management and employees were great. I worked there when i was in college and enjoyed myself. Very flexible with hours with a lot of college kids.

good,"My only complaint was that you were required to meet a certain percentage of customers that you signed up for their membership card (the scorecard) during your shift, even though the customers are typically skeptical of giving out their address, email, and phone number."
good,play the game in there or you wont go far. other than that the pay needs to be more competitive.I believe its the lowest paid warehouse job in goodyear.
good,always a good time engaging with customers as you help them find out exactly what they need to get them on their way. All of the associates are pretty happy to be there and seem like a family more then co-workers.
good,I stayed busy most of my time talking with cutsome's checking out at register and pointing them in the right directions. When there was a yard sale I would help with those.
good,"The vast majority of peers and management are easy to deal with and get along with. Constructive criticism goes a long way to being listened to, and the work force, for the most part, remains highly engaged and motivated."
good,I enjoy working with the people there at the store. It's a fun environment and you meet a lot of interesting people when you work at a job in which you talk to people

good,"Work with people from different walks of life and sports background. A place to learn new things from different views. One minute helping someone with shoes the next find a tent, bow or fishing pole. The management and coworkers help you learn what goes on to help people in the different department so you can better help the customers."
good,"If I had worked the opening morning shift, we would begin by having a meeting to discuss our store's performance & ways to improve our performance.  On ""Fun Friday,"" we would play a game--such as football tossing."
good,"a lot of operational tasks that need to be completed without the proper resources. All about customer service, but it's hard to provide customer service and complete operational tasks without the resources needed to succeed."
good,Its a great place to work in the retail industry.  Lots of opportunities to see different parts of the retail corporate culture.  Must be able to adapt to changing business environment.
good,"Never really experienced the weird district management conflicts but other than the higher up management, the employees you work with everyday were awesome and i had a great time working around people who love sports."
good,"Everyday was different, some times there was freight, other days I had to do set moves. "
good,"Everyday is something new, you have to stay on your toes. You must be able to multi- multi task. Good benefits when you reach management levels. The people are great."
good,overall enjoyed the experience but the managers like to micro manage. Do not expect this to be a job that you can be independent.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Dick's Sporting Goods is a working environment that challenges you and provides plenty of opportunity for growth and learning. A massive company that management makes seem like a small family.

good,I would work either 8-5 or I would work from 2 until closing time. I learned a lot about how to interact with customers working there. It was really stressful but enjoyable.
good,"This was a fun place to work, but could also be stressful when managers would be on the same page. Everyone there is willing to jump in and help another employee that needed help. They were very friendly and good with customers and made sure customers came first."
good,it was a really nice and easy environment that was very relaxed with very cultured customers. great ac and awesome sports supplies and swimming things.
good,Typical day requires of many tasks as well as helping customers also must sell guns complete all the necessary paperwork
good,"Fun place to work , not paid enough, management is not the best . Would love to still work there part time just make an extra few bucks"

good,"good place to work and shop, management was really nice, built relationship with many great customers, pay not very competitive"
good,great work environment. good leadership and organization from the company. The company is fair and reasonable and you will learn great customer service skills working for this company
good,"Face paced big box sporting goods retail. Upbeat, friendly, team orientated environment. Fast advancement, visual merchandising, sell what your passionate about."
good,"The environment was friendly, although the cash registers are a bit antiquated and frustrating at times to deal with. Many co-workers are college students, and others are older and generally understand of any situations that happen within the store. Mid-level quality of customers, with a few stuck up patrons, and a few that were difficult to remain courteous with."
good,"Very clean, great store to shop at, it's a really good variety of things to purchase, store set up is really good everything section is organized really good"
good,Enjoyed the time I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods. I would tell anyone who is looking for a job to put in application. Good pay for the work you do..
good,"I've learned a lot about retail and customer service.  I learned how to sell merchandise to customers, who were skeptical about buying.  I would have to organize isles every night before getting off, which helped me obtain organization skills."
good,I have worked for Dicks Sporting Goods for almost a year now and have enjoyed it for the most parts. I have had the opportunity to work at different locations and have had great experiences as well as very poor experiences. Some are mainly management problems or just coworkers who are lazy but I have not had any problems with the company.
good,"Good managers and coworkers"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Coworkers were excellent. Probably the best I've ever had. Can depend on 40 hours a week. Great sports environment. Teamwork was highly valued.
good,"if you are a part time worker your shifts are typically a 6 hour shift. Most days it is slow at the Monaca location. They are flexible when things come up, but gain the pay isn't great especially with the amount of costumer service experience I have. But it is a good in between job for students and new graduates."
good,Always focusing on new products that coincided with different seasons of the year.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was interacting with new coworkers and new customers constantly.
good,This was a fun retail sales job.  I worked with nice co-workers and nice management. Helping customers was the most enjoyable part of this job.  I improved my customer service skills.
good,"A typical day at Dick's Sporting Goods always started out with a morning team meeting to discuss each employee's personal goals for the day. Working here with so many amazing unique people I was able to learn a lot and take something from each and every one of them to improve my day to day customer service skills. I would have to say the hardest part of my job was taking on five departments getting crossed trained, though also the most enjoyable."
good,"Overall loved the job, managers had open door policy. Everyone was easy to talk to. Only left for advancement opportunity with another company."
good,"Love the environment, but I was not given the hours I was promised.  Good people to work with.  The job has many facets to it.  I enjoy working in the Lodge."
good,"Golf sales associated responsible for greeting customers and helping them with their golf needs. Performed store merchandising"
good,"It was alot of fun, especially when we did fun activities before opening on Friday mornings. I learned alot more social skills from this job, it brought me out of my shell. Management was satisfactory. My coworkers for the most part were quite alright. The hardest part was dealing with the occasional rude customer(but that comes with the job). The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to really help someone out and try to accommodate everyone's needs."
good,"I love my co-workers and most of the management at Dicks. Sometimes I have too many task thrown on me and it makes it very difficult to get my own job accomplished, but after awhile you get used to it and you just learn to roll with it. I know that so many tasks wouldn't be thrown on my at once if they didn't think I was qualified to handle it all, so it's kind of a compliment, it just gets hard and stressful sometimes."
good,I enjoy my job and the people that I work with at Dick's. My only real complaint is that they cannot offer me a full time position. I work 25 hours per week and my hours have be getting cut to often. I am not able to pay my bills when my hours get cut.
good,Dick's Sporting Goods offers a very relaxed work environment. I enjoy interacting with customers and my coworkers. Management is very laid back yet professional; very personable.
good,"For being a retail establishment, Dick's is run very well. The management is not pushy with pointless promotions that are only going to make customers upset."
good,this job was a temp but overall rating was not organized when it came to running a warehouse so big and getting great production number out.
good,"This is an ok place to work, treated fair, decent hours, pretty cool coworkers. Only downside is working late nights and weekends, which I guess you could expect from a retail store."
good,"I enjoy the fact that I get to talk outdoor activities with customers, specifically firearms and hunting. What is the downside is the inconsistency in hours."
good,walk in to work talk to manger on duty find out what they want me to do and do my job that i am told to do. trucks is what i mainly did
good,"A typical day at work is laid back, particularly during the weekdays. Coworkers and management are very easy to get along with. The hardest part about my job is being the only one in my department, but the most enjoyable part is being able to help customers with their shopping needs."

good,"- Starts off with cash handling, preparing the store before opening."
good,"Dicks Sporting Good was one of my favorite places to work, the management was awesome and so were the consumers. I made a lot of great bonds with co-workers as well as customers."
good,"I reorganize and maintain the apparel, make sure its resized and neat for customers. I open fitting rooms for customer. I am also a backup-cashier, so when needed i also ring up sales.

good,I think the job was very fun and kept me on my feet . The job taught me to stay positive and make the customer always got great customer service. The most enjoyable time was meeting all the employees . The co workers were really nice and helped me so much . This job has a big responsibility and takes certain people to meet the customer upmost needs.
good,It was not a bad place to work. Get a 10% discount. Not a lot of hours or pay. I worked Bikes Fitness and Hard goods so a lot of running around all day.
good,Dick's Sporting Good is a great place to work when you are a student looking for a part time job. They are very flexible with your schedule and they give you very flexible hours.

good,Work hard and play hard. Great team environment and collaboration among groups growth is perfect. Would recommend to friends and family
good,Could be a very fun and loving environment but the time to work is very limited.  Co-workers are very patient and helpful but things can be a lot better.
good,"A typical day includes helping customers and making sure they find what they need. I learned that sometimes a customer might not be the nicest but as long as you do you best to help them they might change their attitude. My managers and my co workers are great, they are always nice and help me when needed. The hardest part of this job is dealing with grumpy people even when you have done your best to help them. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing how happy the customer is when i help them find what they need."
good,"- Team Sports Sales Associate"
good,"Only downfall working there was that they said they are flexible with student workloads, and of course as a student there are some activities that are outside the everyday class load."
good,Enjoyed 18+ years with the company. Full scale big box with many opportunities for growth. CEO is a forward thinker and company will continue to shine.
good,"Then, this is the place for you. I only worked at Dick's for three months, but I learned a lot. I learned how to manage a till, perform exchanges and returns, and provide quality customer service. The one thing that I really liked about Dick's was the support from the coworkers--everyone was helping the other get the job done right."
good,I have a great time with this company and feel challenged everyday when I go to work however there are no opportunities for advancement so I have decided to look elsewhere.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"After working at MC Sports and Finish line, I used my experiences to focus on improving my knowledge of footwear and began meeting with footwear brand representatives."
good,"Most of my days were spent working mainly by myself unsupervised. I learned how to process and package online orders and learned all about their price changing process as well as their sign changing process. Management was okay, I personally found that they were difficult to communicate with, and many issues never get resolved. Co-workers are great, we all share the same passion of sports and a healthy lifestyle and I've never worked anywhere with a more friendly group of individuals. The hardest part of my job was getting everything done by a specific deadline. For example, I'd get a different batch of online orders every day, twice a day. Sometimes the volume of orders is much higher, but with the same deadline time. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to interact with customers. I'm a people person and thrive off of human interaction."
good,"Great Customers who want the ""Nordstrom treatment"" for you to essentially be their personal shopper!! Easy to learn fast-paced environment, with room for advancement for go-getters and hard workers!"
good,"Most of my job was assisting customers, and I believe that it is a great place for teenagers to get a first job and get their feet in the water."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at DSG, If you like sports, it's where you want to apply. The DMs tend to be stingy with hours at times...and by times, I mean weeks with your hours gouged. But other than that, great place."
good,"On a typical workday, I spend my time not only checking customers out in the checkout like, but talking to them, and making sure they leave with a smile or in a good mood. If there is not a whole lot of traffic in the store, I help the apparel department with their duties of organizing and ensuring a clean store. Management at my particular Dicks Sporting Goods is responsive, and is always within close reach when in need. The hardest part of my job is keeping an eye out for mischievous and fishy behavior that could lead to stealing from customers in the store, and then reacting. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to talk to all of the customers and helping them go through their time at our store smoothly. I also enjoy all of my co-workers and their great attitudes."
good,with a little help most employees come in with a smiling face. very enjoyable place to work and lots of chance for advancement.
good,"It is the basic retail environment, Very busy especially on the weekends."
good,"Helping customers was a constant. It made the day go so fast checking out customers or helping them with the products we sold."
good,"I would arrive into work and clock in and get straight to work on the cash register."
good,Looking for some extra cash this is a good place to do it. The discount there is also great
good,Dick's is  a very enjoyable job and fun to be around the sports world all day. dicks maybe fun to work for but progressing in the company is quite difficult and the really do not hire through the company. this makes it hard to move up in the company.
good,"Coworkers were more enjoyable than management."
good,"-either working as a cashier or in apparel"
good,"It's a retail management position, you know what you sign up for. The hours are long and get worse during the holidays, but it is a lot of fun if you're willing to work. Dealing with people and managing associates was great for me and a new task every day."
good,Managers try to accommodate school schedules. Co- workers are usually friendly but everyone has an off day. I learned how to keep a smile on my face. I do not agree with cashiers getting written up for being on the clock too long because supervisors fail to pull the drawer.
good,"I worked as a golf sales associate during my time at Dicks Sporting Goods and I enjoyed every moment. I worked with a good team of employees and a great manager. The hardest part of my job was staying after my shift. The part I enjoyed the most at my job was selling golf products, and fixing clubs that needed repairs."

good,associate are easy to get along with.  Ideal job for a college student.
good,It's a fun place to work. You get to meet new people everyday and share new experiences with your co workers. As a supervisor they look up to you to be a leader. You also have to guide your cashiers to right productive stage to produce for the company.
good,"I was hired in as a lead and was promoted to supervisor"
good,"Dick's was a fun place to work. I'm a big sports fan and it's a sports store. I wanted to buy every thing there. Most of my peers were good people. My immediate manager was so cool.

Answering to their questions, asking if they need any additional help. Offering them our store's credit line. And making sure that they leave with a smile on their face. "
good,"Pretty easy as being a cashier. Some customers are just down right rude. Co-workers were awesome, always helpful. Management was good to their workers."
good,"I spend most of my days working with customers. Also since most of my shifts are afternoon-evening, I spend much of my time cleaning up and fixing up the store for the next day. Most of the management at the store is nice and willing to teach what you need to know. However some of the management tends to micromanage too much from time to time, which can be frustrating."
good,Very customer service oriented. I had to exhibit my knowledge of golf merchandise to help the consumer gain a better understanding of the products.
good,"Great environment. I love my co-workers and I've built great relationships with my customer's. Managers are very easy to work with , they are great leaders."
good,A typical day started by unloading truck before customers arrived and assisting customers and associates throughout the day.  I learned how to coach and train a great team of associates and how to multi-task in high traffic situations.  Our management team was great with focus on business results and taking care of our great team.  The hardest part of the job was the low pay with little room for advancement.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting great customers and training a great team.

good,"A typical day of work at Dick's Sporting Goods as a Golf Associate consists of performing club work (mainly regrips, as well as shaft installations, setting up warranty repairs with manufacturers, shortening/lengthening shafts), customer service (90% of the job is customer service), restocking, inventory, and keeping the department in order/clean. During my time working at Dick's, I have become much more familiar with golf brands and differences between features on clubs/equipment. I have also learned that the customer comes FIRST, then all of your other duties follow. The employees/managers are fun people to work with for the most part. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a million customers at once when you are the only person in your department. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to be around golf merchandise for several hours per day."

good,"As a cashier, a work day would typically go like this: clock in and grab your till. Ring up and cash out the guests, or if its a return, get their money back to them rather its on their credit card or in cash. After the return you would process the item to be put back on the floor if not defective. Other duties would to be cleaning up your registers and anything else you see that should be clean. I've learned about finding tons of extra work to do when you have free time. The management was very understanding and the co-workers made going to work a good time. The hardest part of the job would be if you have to price check, and the employees would take their time to give you the answer. The most enjoyable parts were the fun, regular guests and always finding something to do."

good,"high volume customer service, fun atmosphere if you enjoy sports"
good,"not a bad company make a lot of money, only problem is that they expect the management to work insane amount of hours."
good,A usual shift is eight hours since being there i have grow in several areas especially in costumer service. The other employees that i work with are great people which makes the job so enjoyable.
good,"Although I only worked at Dicks Sporting Goods for two months, in that short amount of time everyone I worked around took to me so fast and made it truly enjoyable to work there. The managers were SOOOO great!!!!! At first it was a bit annoying offering and sort of pushing ""score cards"" on people who dont have them, they teach you different ways in order to keep your percentages up. I'm a shy person and they got me to keep my score card percentages in the 70's and 80's (which is pretty darn good!) If anyone works there as a cashier, remember this... DO NOT ASK customers if they want a scorecard! Simply ask if they do, if no.. then grab one and start asking their information. Most of them sign up rather than trying to fight or think up an excuse! Some dont even know or notice why im asking for their information they just go along with it! lol and their free so your not scamming them or anything! and no junk mail when giving out your email address! Dicks Sporting Goods was a great first job for me and I honestly had a blast working there!"
good,co-workers were easy to get along with as I built a friendship with and kept each other pushing to do more and the best.
good,My store had alot of drama but overall it was a good experience.
good,"fun people to work with, flexible schedule, basic pay, sports enthusiasts dream job"
good,very fast pace always looking to help customers with a problem or product they are looking to obtain
good,"Great, fun working enviroment. Every one is pretty easy to get along with. Short staffed sometimes so you get a little busy but it helps time go by. Loved working and interacting with ppl."
good,"I worked as a part time cahsier. MY duties included providing customer service, operating the cash register and answering questions related to store merchandise."
good,"didn't work there too long, was able to buy snacks to keep with me at my register and espn was always on the TV's which were very close to our registers."
good,i learned how to put shelf's together. the management was very good. the co-workers were good and helpful. i think the hardest part of the job was learning to put the shelf's together. i enjoyed the whole job just didnt like it was temporarily
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Little training time. Good managers are few and far between. Enjoy the atmosphere. Great job to hold while your in-between jobs, but nothing long-term."
good,Management needs to hold everyone more accountable. Some do more than others.
good,"A day at work consists of taking care of our store and customers; being sure that their needs are satisfied as well as the store goals of the day. from this job I have learned patience and the understanding that individuals are all different. The management team is good, with managers that help out a lot and aren't quick to anger at most times. Co-workers help each other but tend to hold anger if something goes wrong with another employee. The hardest and most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying the customer and myself. I constantly set standards for myself that may seem above average. As far as the customers I love to see a happy customer that is sure to return."
good,"Shifts were varried. Typical work schedules varied in hours and days. I learned how to work as a team, customer service and organizational skills. Hardest part was unknown hours. Most Enjoyable part was working with customers."
good,DSG is one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the world. Employees work in hands-on environments and can specialize in specific sports departments and segments.
good,get to rhe store at 5:00am clean receive stock make small repairs buff floars co-workers great management good hardest part of job was leaving company
good,Working at sporting goods was experience. Its just now im looking for a carrer long time were I have time to grow
good,"A few months ago, I did not enjoy going to work. Their logic was you do the job right or you're fired instead of working with people to get with they want.Threatening is not the way to go. And they never had incentives for doing a good job(getting a dollar for each credit card during christmas is the only one I can think of). Though, they have changed their attitudes the past month or so. They had placed a tv into our break room, and buy us pizza if our store has a above expectations performance. This is the way to get performance out of your employees. Creating unhappy employees will only lead to unhappy performance (and unhappy customers!)"
good,As a young high school student this was a great job to put me somewhat on the map for in the sales world. I appreciated the privilage of being able to sit and having my own person work station in the golf department
good,Scan tags and take back refunds. Do cash ins and cash outs. Applied my  general sports knowledge to the customers and help staff wherever hep was needed.
good,Be friendly to customers and fellow employees. It will help with sales and getting help from other employees when needed. Always ask if the customer has a score card or if they would like to sign up for one.
good,"It's an active job and the managers are fun, but they could be better at letting employees know they are letting them go instead of giving them no hours for weeks and not saying anything. Other than that it was great!"
good,"It's a work environment with good people, the days may be crazy at times and the hours are as well, but Dick's strives for amazing customer service. A good place to start in retail, sales and customer service."
good,Being at work is fun at times. But there are also times were it can be boring or not as exciting as it should. Workers are kind and very helpful when needed.
good,Being a cashier was easy. People working there were very cool but the managers were unflexible with scheduling and made rude comments whenever they could.
good,It was a fun job that was okay while I lived near by. I moved and the drive and the hard work there took to much of my personal time and I had to find employment elsewhere.
good,Dicks sporting goods provided a standard work environment. Everyone worked as team to achieve goals. Employees were given proper breaks and rewards for good work
good,"Great work environment, good scheduling, managers are willing to work with you, casual dress is comfortable, fast paced work as well which makes your shifts go by faster, competitive as well"
good,I would say that I received my fair share of hours probably 25-30 hrs a week being a full time student however many workers barely worked more than 1 day.
good,I’ve worked at Dicks for almost a year now and I love it. All the associates are super friendly and make work fun! Mgmt is very flexible with scheduling so it’s perfect for a student or someone looking for part time.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Good place to work, made some great friends, and was a very short commute to and from work. Work Flow has its ups and down, sometimes not a lot to do, and sometimes a lot to do and not enough people to complete the tasks."
good,"Teamwork oriented place with fun staff and relaxed atmosphere. Wonderful management, but does not promote advancement within the company. Training is great and thorough. Very relaxed place to work."
good,I only worked at DICK'S Sporting Goods for about a month or so because I moved out of town to go to college. The time that I did have there was pretty good.
good,Great first job to have that gave me responsibility early on and gained a lot of knowledge of the retail industry. Learned not only entry level but mid level as well.
good,"It's a retail job, what can I say. The people you work with are good people, and management has your back. If you're a cashier it's like any other cashier job. Still has sales quotas."
good,It was a decent part time job that worked with my school schedule. The pay was what you would expect from a retail job. Management was good aside from scheduling. They would change schedules frequently without notice.
good,"This was my first job when i was 18 and gave me a lot of experience with consumer face to face interaction, running a department, and keeping up with the days work."
good,There are some good managers and some that are not so great. About half of them are welcoming and kind and the other half want to get their paycheck and get home so they don't care how you do your job as long as you hit the numbers.
good,this job is good for an in between job or as a starter job but not as a forever job. moving up in the company is rare and they base it more on age than on work ethic.
good,It’s a cool place to work! It’s easy going and you meet really cool people. The pay is decent and they work with your schedule. You learn a lot about the store working there.
good,"It a place where you can build social skills, and great place to learn marketing. There are chances for improvement and can be fast pace. They work around you're schedule and very flexible."
good,"Management is understanding and flexible, as well as highly personable. The job is high-paced and involved lots of customer assistance, but you learn a lot about sports, apparel, and athletic opportunities in the area."
good,"The company is not the best to work for, but it is all about what you make of it as an employee. If you are full of high and positive energy and have good social skills, you can be very happy there. Retail is not the funnest place to work, but it is a very friendly environment and it is fun to be around the people you work with."
good,At Dicks Sporting Goods I feel like the management really pushes for a fun environment and they really do succeed. The store is fairly new and the management and leads still are figuring little things out. I enjoy talking with the customers and my other co workers about what we sell which easy great if you love sports. The only downside for me is the amount of hours they are available to offer and the starting pay if you are trying to support yourself. If you are going to school and looking for a part time this job is great for you.
good,"This is your typical retail job, helping customers, answering phones, signing up people for rewards and credit cards. Dick's Sporting Goods has a ""hassle-free"" policy so customers can basically get whatever they want. We return used shoes and football gloves, take expired coupons, markdown items because the customer thought they saw a sale sign. Dick's is doing a great job of giving away money and it will eventually catch up to them in their sales numbers."
good,"This play is as cheap as they come. One week you'll get 22 hours of work, the next you'll get 4 if any. Your biweekly paycheck looks about the same every week or smaller. Some weeks, I only get 4 hours in total so my pay check is just for that one day."
good,"Learned how to adapt to to situations "
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Working at Dick's had it's pros and cons like any job out there. I think the biggest plus at my store was my coworkers, they defiantly made me not mind going to work and made the shifts a lot more fun. The type of customers that came in allowed me to relate more to them with it being a sport/outdoors focused store."
good,it is good working for dicks sporting goods but a few of my managers make it where I don't enjoy my job and don't want to go into work.  I love helping the customers who come in and ask plenty of questions and tell me their stories.  I was promised a raise and everyone but me got the raise.
good,a typical day was to help and have fun with customers. the managers were cool. You meet a lot of people whether it is co-workers or customers. The hardest part was dealing with difficult customers with no managers around
good,"It was an amazing part time job, as a military person I needed time off for military and they would not allow it. If they would of been more understandable I would of probably stayed with the company."
good,"Work In retail you have to love retail "
good,Great working with other employees in this fast past environment. Each department is somewhat of a small family and all collaborate to help each other. Management could definitely be stronger and communicate more.
good,The pay received at Dicks Sporting Goods is not enough to live on at all. Being there 3 years and only one small raise is not enough even when you are full time.
good,This job has definitely helped advance my working abilities. It has taught me that it is okay to be driven yet nothing won’t get accomplished without a team.
good,"Easy job, difficult retail schedule. managers were great. As a golf sales associate, your time is very demanding. Slim chance for advancement. In order to progress in your job, you need to take a ton of initiative."
good,I enjoy meeting and greeting the people I work with and the customers that I have to deal with on a day to day basis. Being a sports official i like dealing in and helping the people with their needs in sports.
good,Like any corporation as figure heads change so does the culture. Working with company for 8 years they came and went and the focused shifted and swayed.
good,Very interesting job. You get to interact with customers & talk about a lot of sports related conversations while selling whatever product or  merchandise
good,"This is an ideal job for high school or college students. its easy, you wear athletic clothes, and the team is easy to get along with for the most part."
good,"It is a fun and relaxed workplace. But in the position that I held, I did not have the backing of management, or the hours to work to complete what had to be done. A job that required at least 2 people, was done with only one, and things were not accomplished that needed to be finished in order to keep my position."
good,"Good place to work if you enjoy sports.  There are always good deals.  Co-workers are mostly athelets, had a lot in common with them, and made a bunch of good friends."
good,"In foot wear simple job brought out shoes to customers. Worked in the back sometimes fixing shoes. Hours drop after seasonal time, and managers were fair."
good,"The day to day operations is pretty routine.  Each department has their own set of checklists to fulfill throughout the day.  Apparel department is the heart of the store, they cover most of the floor with customer service as well as check fitting rooms and are backup cashiers. It's not a hard job at all, it is just about being consistent and having ""sportsmanlike conduct""."
good,"a typical day at DSG is cleaning when not busy, greeting people that walk through the door and help them find items that they are looking for. after all of that, i check them out and help with them with there stuff to their car if needed."
good,"if you looking for your first job I would highly recommend this place for sure! the environment is great and the people work with are wonderful. but like all jobs, things will get crazy and you will have to work harder than ever."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,I've learned a lot by working in Golf @ Dicks. We always have something to do . There are many customers that stop by and talk about the game we love. The management works hard to please all customers and associates with any problems. We have a flexible schedule .
good,Dicks Sporting Goods stresses great customer service as well as speed when it comes to different tasks. I'm really good at multitasking thus why I got promoted to be a Lead in less than a year. The hardest part about the job honestly is probably just staying composed when it comes to certain situations. The most enjoyable part of my job to me is the work environment and working with a great team which helps us better our store every day.
good,"Usually got there before opening and checked gun inventory, had a quick morning meeting, went out on the sales floor to unpack product and help customers."
good,"Build a couple bikes, sell workout equipment and team sports equipment."
good,Easy job that allows a person to learn about retail as a work environment. Many opportunities to learn new skills and develop professionally. Another good entry-level job into the workforce.
good,"Love the work, very relaxed yet fast paced! The atmosphere the managers set for their employees is a great one! They value their employees highly and show their love for them!"
good,"A great company. Sometimes it’s time to open a new chapter in life. See what else is out there. I have met the most wonderful people, and had the greatest experiences. No Ill feelings about Dicks Sporting Goods at all."
good,"Great first Job. Gave a good understanding about how the work place runs as well as how to handle customers as well as test you on product knowledge. Also gave me the ability to learn about other areas, for example Dicks Sporting Goods trained me, so that i am qualified as a Bike Tech, which entails building, and bikes repairing"
good,"A typical day a work here would be talking to every customer possible, keeping your section clean, having knowledge about firearms that you can reliably pass on to customers that have questions on the firearms or accessories. Also all camping and kayaking equipment is under your belt so you learn a lot. "
good,"wake up head to work looking sporty gym shorts and a comfortable shirt, enjoy taking care of customers, great, fantastic mangers, relax environment hardest part is freight restocking the floor what made it hard is because your coming up with the ideals"
good,Busy place to work during the year. A fun place to work if you're interested in sports. Hours can be flexible at times. The management is the downside of the company. Only make decisions that benefit them.
good,Fellow associates make working more enjoyable and many friendships are developed as a result. Hours are unpredictable and management is strict on associates without adhering to the same rules.
good,"I worked here full-time while I was going to college. The people I worked with were great. The managers weren't always great, and tended to put off a lot of their work on the team leads and on the associates."
good,"I would recommend Dick's Sporting Goods to anyone who is looking for work over the holiday seasons, or anyone looking to move up quickly in the retail business."
good,Dick’s Sporting Goods is a great place to start gaining work experience. It has a great environment and the other associates you work with are great. The hours are flexible and most of the time fit to your availability. Overall it was a good job to have.
good,I like working at Dick's.  It is a fun and exciting place to work.  It gets busy at times but most people are pleasant and understand that it is the holiday season.
good,"Overall it's a decent job, especially one to have in college. I was lucky to have a very good managements team, that made working there more enjoyable"
good,"Very flexible hours for students. Must work black Friday. Low pay. Customer involved. Friendly staff. Strict appearance for staff. Strict sales being met on credit cards, rewards, etc."
good,This was a supplemental job as I was looking for full time employment. It was pretty stressful being I had a large area to cover and a speaker in my ear the whole time. The employees were good and a few of the managers really cared.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"My most enjoyable time was becoming friends with co-workers and being able to work with them along with when little kids would come in to get fitted & set up for the first sport and seeing the excitement in their face!"
good,It's a nice place to work. the most enjoyable part about the job was the employees that I worked with. The hardest part of the job was trying to prioritize your time during the busier times of the year with some of the task assigned to you.
good,"Dicks was a good place to work, I worked in the hunting and fishing department, two of the things I love to do, i honestly loved helping people find what they needed for a fishing or hunting trip, you always have those rude customers who think they are always right but there aren't many so youll survive, but all in all i would recommend working at dicks for a good part time job."
good,"For retail, Dick's Sporting Goods provided a solid work environment. It is constantly busy, but that is expected. The majority of managers throughout my year working there were helpful. The one downside was that my requested days off were usually ignored, which were all 2 weeks or more in advance. Outside of that, I would have to give Dick's Sporting Goods high remarks."
good,Dicks sporting good is a good place to work all tho for the amount of work you do with gun sales and paperwork and the fast paced of it u don't get paid for selling all the products and no commissions on anything. Good re port job but I need to move up in life and I'm a always moving fast paced huh that I could do a lot better in my life with a lot better job.
good,Excellent company but work life balance extremely challenging but this holds true to any retail organization. Collaborative work environment and very team oriented.
good,"I really enjoyed working with this company, I think their training was great and having the opportunity to learn different departments. You also have the opportunity to purchase items at a discount price. A great place to work."
good,i had acquired this job to help pay some bills for me during my time in college. they were flexible with me and allowed me enough hours to manage my bills. store manager was extremely pushy to the point where most employees rebelled. department managers kept that store alive.
good,Good place to work. Just depends on who the manager is that determines how much enjoyment you will have. Good place to learn how to sell things and also converse with people
good,"Good place to work.  Laid back style of ethic with a focus on customer relations."
good,A typical day for me at work is preparing the storage room for shipment trucks the night before they arrive. Besides that I am also responsible for daily cleaning duties and providing customer service whenever called upon.
good,"Worked in sporting goods. Repair of archery and as consultant for hunting , fishing and camping. Loved the work. Hours were not that good. Learned alot."
good,"Overall a good place to work for a student. Flexible with hours, good opportunity for advancement. Customers are always great, no real bad things to say."
good,"Definitely a great job for someone like me who enjoys being busy. I enjoy working on the projects and the employees were very friendly. Overall, it is a great company to work for and I have learned a lot from working here."
good,Lots of teamwork and positivism at this company. Management can be very demanding and lots of product to learn if you want to grow but it can be done.
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods as a whole was a great place to work. The people were great and there was plenty to do as a group outside of the normal work day. i.e. Inter mural sports."
good,I enjoyed working at dicks it was a great experience got to work and even network with lots of great people. Me having play college basketball and sports just about my whole life made it a perfect fit for me.
good,I run people up and took their money. I had to keep the front end neat and sometimes recover the pads. I learned how to multitask and how to deal with people. It is hard to deal with rude customers. I liked the chaos sometimes.
good,"Sales experience with a quick turnover rate in the sales associate position. While support can be found through management, is needs to be sought after and asked for, rather than immediately offered to new associates."
good,my job at DSG was very fun but shorter than anticipated. I loved the environment but the only thing i struggled with was the credit card sales. I felt to pressured to sell and felt bad if i irritated people to the point of no return.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Working at Dick's Sporting Goods is a great experience, my coworkers and managers are wonderful to work with. An average day at work would include an immense amount of customer interaction and recovery."
good,"Not really the best place to work. Employees treat it like a High School with your typical cliques, gossip, backstabbing, snide remarks, and not typically friendly depending on the specific employee. Management doesn't seem to care about employees unless they're friends on a personal level, Customer base is extremely rude and careless to any kind of help given, Rarely ever acknowledged for high achievement, Minimal raises that may boost you up by a few cents no matter how hardworking you may be, and depending on your personal stance with the management will determine whether there's personal growth for you at the store or not."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dick's Sporting Goods. My typical day included assisting guests as they shopped for particular items, I helped everyone find what they were looking for. I gained a great amount customer service experience, and was great at helping people. The management wasn't bad, during the time I worked there they were making changes in management. Everybody in that place was friends with each other, we were all one great big team and loved each other like a family. The hardest part was only when you would spot people stealing and could not stop them from doing it. The most enjoyable part for me would be the times people would come in not sure of what they wanted and asked for me to help them pick out outfits for them to try on."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers and checking them out when they were ready to pay.  If it wasn't busy I would either help Apparel fold clothes or help Team Sports tag certain things.  The management wasn't the best and was very inconsistent, but they always got the job done that was at hand.  I did make some of my best friends while working there though.  The coworkers made working a fun environment and made everything worth it."
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is a top end sporting store that has everything that the athlete of today needs to continue and or improve his/her game whatever it may be. Customer focus is important here making sure they are getting what the need and having all questions answered to the best of the associates ability. Great place to work!
good,This job was somewhat difficult because management had their favorites and did not treat everyone fairly. The customers were the best part of the day becauseI was able to help them.
good,"It can be slow a lot of the time so you have to occupy yourself. Management is great and so are the co-workers. No room for advancement , I know people who has been there for over a year and still a cashier."
good,"I am competitive so I really enjoyed the competitive environment. I started off as a cashier, the supervisor and followed with administrative assistant. After moving from the area, I transferred to another store and worked as a supervisor until I left."
good,"The people there were pleasant to work with.  Much more corporate and rue21.  I noticed more corporate politics than I was used to, but that seems the culture there.  Again it was difficult to move up internally.  They were more interested in bringing in someone from the outside.  New ideas will help sometimes though.  The facility is great and they do take care of their employees."
good,"A typical day at work is usually six to eight hours depending on how many people are employed in your department.  Customer service is #1 and taking care of operational duties follows up as a close second.  I have learned more about customer service in retail during my time at Dick's Sporting Goods.  Management varies from manager to manager; you're either micro-managed and treated like a child or some managers will treat you like an adult with respect and trust you with responsibilities.  My coworkers are great for the most part, although some are downright miserable and shouldn't be in customer service.  The hardest part of the job is Black Friday and having to listen to holiday music every day for two months.  However, the most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job is working with customers to help them find the products they need to excel at their sport and improve their game."
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is a fun and good place to work Part time.  The hours are there if you want them and Have a opportunity to cross train in different departments.
good,"A busy, but controlled environment where an employee can meet new people and learn essential customer service skills. An employee will also learn a lot about the products they sell as well as the vendors that stock the inventory. The days can be long and static at times however there is always something to do at Dick's Sporting Goods."
good,"Go in at scheduled time "
good,Positive work environment and good communication throughout the various departments/positions allows Dick's to be one of the top sporting goods stores.
good,I love sports so I love my job. The management could be better but not to bad. My co-workers are awesome so that is a plus. I work in the team sports section so I know everything about any sports. I interact with customers all day an I love it. I sell sports apparel and sports equipment.
good,"I have enjoyed working for Dick's Sporting Goods for the most part. The managers are nice and for the most part professional, will give time off as requested if given enough notice, and prides themselves for employee satisfaction. Dick's Sporting Goods also give a great opportunity to work with people and help make their day better."
good,"I like the job a lot, wish I was still working there, but management seemed a little young in managing style they liked to pick more of the negatives then positives."
good,"Worked as sales associate, but was promoted to cashier after three months.  Received recognition for most sales per month during time I was sales associate.  Good environment, good boss."
good,"I worked in the Footwear Department my entire career there which was a combined 4 years.  I would come in and before I did anything I would make sure our customers were taken care of. Then I would make sure that the sales floor was properly merchandised and stocked.  Next was to make sure the back stock was clean and properly stocked.  As Footwear Lead my main responsibility was inventory control and troubleshooting any customer issues.  I now have a great working knowledge of most of the footwear technology available today.  Unfortunately there is a revolving door of staff and this includes management.  The only hard part of the job was the fact that we were understaffed.  Without getting too into it, if we could put more people in each department the customers as well as employees would be much happier.  The wait to try on a shoe could be borderline unacceptable at times.  The only other rough part of working there was the completely random weekly schedule.  Prepare to work all weekend and there are times where you would clock out at 11:30pm then have to be back there at 5:30am.  We created the term ""clopening"" to describe it.  All things aside, I genuinely loved what I did.  My first real job was retail and I learned how to sell and sell well.  I really enjoyed helping the customers too.  Of course sometimes the job was thankless as any job can be but more often than not I had great experiences there and was sad to leave but long term I don't see how anyone could have a full life when you have no idea when your time off will be from week to week."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Dick's Sporting Good's is great if you're freshly out of high school and going into college. As a cashier, you have certain responsibilities like making sure you're executing perfect customer service, keeping an eye out for shady individuals, enforcing polices, signing people up for scorecards (whether they want one or not), asking if people would like to sign up for a credit card, opening/closing the front end, etc. There are many things to do, but you soon get use to them. "
good,"Footwear is great, but management is lacking. I enjoy the people I work with and the hours. They did work well with me since I am in college. I feel like they need to hire more people who are willing to work and get the job done. I enjoy working with the public and being fast paced."
good,"One of the biggest problems I had with this particular Dick's was the promise of advancement in the interview for the job that eventually turned into nothing. I was told I would be trained in team sports since I was knowledgeable but when it came time for a new team sports person I was put on the backburner for a new applicant. They made you feel like you were less important than someone new who had started there which is a problem in most companies today. Overall the work environment wasn't bad though, the days generally went quick and the people you worked with were very good and friendly making the experience that much better."
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking the pricing issues of that day, checking for any price changes, checking for and making signs where they are needed.  I learned how to work with people and deal with customer service when I have to cover the shifts at the customer service desk.  My co-workers are very nice and friendly and willing to help out.  The hardest part of my job is having enough time to get all my work done.  I often stay as late as I can to make sure everything is done in my area of the business.  I enjoy how fast the days go because I'm constantly doing something at all times. I'm always busy and always have something that needs to be done."
good,It was a nice place to work and healthy living was the theme of the day. The people wee friendly and helpful. Teamwork was always in play.
good,"Flexible. fun/friendly environment. not the highest pay. good training, always someone to answer any questions i had. co workers always make the day enjoyable"
good,There is a strong culture of teamwork and everyone is extremely helpful.  Management is sometimes distant and unwilling to train.  Overall it is a good experience for a first job or a job during college.
good,Typically the day would be slow and there isnt much to do but point people to the areas they wanted to go. Wasnt truly able to give my insight on certain sports that i know about.
good,"Interacting with many different sorts of customers on a daily basis, ensuring highest level of customer service. Preforming other job duties as efficient as possible."
good,"Working at DSG is not bad. Depending on the store, the management engages its associates well. They set up little incentives to get the most credit card sign ups, like a $10 gift card for every 5 you get or other items like that. Safe work environment as well."
good,"On a typical day as an employee at Dick's Sporting Goods, I enjoy the privilege to many responsibilities. I learned to be able to balance many essential tasks and maintain an attentive reach and support behavior for customer needs. I enjoyed being able to communicate openly with management at any point of the day. If there were ever any concerns that needed confirmation or approval of management they were always eager to offer a hand. Working alongside fellow co-workers in a team like fashion helped turn extensive processes on a long day on a holiday season into moments of pure efficiency. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency with available hours and the pay no longer offered commission with certain sales items that may have in the past. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hands on learning experience that is the retail environment. I have much that I am grateful for as a former employee of Dick's Sporting Goods."
good,I have work for the company for 6 plus years the thing about retail is shift work and a must work on weekends . Dicks is a great place for the sports addicted to work . There is always something new to learn there from hunting to the newest golf clubs.
good,"My daily work day at Dicks Sporting Goods would be to pull merchandise from the back stock and restock my department while helping any customers with any questions that they would have on any of the products that we sold. I worked in most of the departments in the store, but my main two departments were the lodge department, dealing with camping, hunting, fishing, snow and water sports, and firearms and the outerwear department dealing with outdoor activewear for both warm and cold weather and being able to help a customer pair their outerwear with the sport that the sport that was their passion."
good,"There is never really a dull moment being in the retail business, you always learn new things, and you constantly meet new faces. I learned the only way to balance great customer service and finishing your game plans is to, stop everything you're doing and get the customer everything he/she needs in a fashionably timing manor. The only way to give great customer service is to, find out the exact need of the customer, and making sure their needs are met before they reach the checkout or before the exit the store. My job was to be the ""helper"". I love helping people, whether what they need help in is big or small. No job is too big for a person who sets no limits. Being able to work with coworkers is a plus. Its like they become part of your family. You don't have to like people to work with them, but team work makes the dream work! The hardest part of the job is not being able to meet the needs of customers due to inventory of the merchandise. The most enjoyable part is knowing that we don't have the product the customer is looking for, but being able to best match the product with a similar product we do have. I love to be the helper who is determined to make the customers leave happy and make their time with me the most memorable. Customers first , they are always right!"
good,My short work history here was entertaining and fun.  I was the oldest in a group of young 20 year olds but they quickly accepted me and learned skills from me on capturing credit card and reward program signatures.
good,"A typical day at work at Dick's Sporting Goods varies by the time of the day. In the morning, we are typically responsible for putting products out on the floor, managing what shoes go on display to maximize profits, and putting sensor tags on shoes to minimize shrink. During the afternoon and whenever customers are around, we are responsible for greeting every customer and making sure that are their needs are met in a quick and efficient manner. At night, we are responsible for making sure that the store is cleaned and returned to its original state for the next day. "
good,Great place to work with an easy learning curve. Not much room for advancement.
good,"Retail is fun, but the revolving door employment is tough."
good,"DSG has been good to me while I worked to put myself through college. However, this past year, with all of the budget cuts, they don't give departments on the sales floor enough pay roll to actually take care of customers as well as get their tasks done. Want better customer service stories, but give us less associates to take care of those customers."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Great place to sell the things and interact with those who also love
good,"Good people, great atmosphere. A lot of work to be done, but it makes the day go by quicker. A lot of customers so multitasking is crucial."
good,"The work is not hard by any means. I couldn't afford to work here. You will not get 40 hours per week. You will be lucky to get 20 hours per week. The schedule is all over the place, not setup as something you can rely on."
good,Customer service and cash handling were daily tasks necessary for success of the store. Working cohesively with all employees was vital to every department accomplishing all daily tasks of the store.
good,"I have worked more 6 day work weeks here than I have ever worked in retail before.  It is expected to work 5, 12 hr days and most of the time a 6th day.  It is a fun face paced place to work, just a horrible work life balance."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of walking the departments to come up with a task list for the day for each. Getting reports for the previous day, WTD and MTD, running a motivational morning meeting, customer service and tasking, all while running the entire store as the Head Coach. Which consisted of directing traffic, encouraging associates and checking with our customers on our level of service to better understand their needs and be able to redirect to meet those needs. I learned how to balance tasking and customer service better and to be able to delegate more instead of doing it all myself. My co-workers were a very diverse group with a common goal, to be able to help customers with their level of knowledge about different sports and to leave for the day feeling accomplished. The hardest part of the job was that they assign too many tasks and didn't provide enough hours for the sales associates to get it all done and still be able to give exceptional service to their customers, so it ultimately fell on the exempt managers to get them all done, causing every single one of them to consistently have to work 6 days and extra hours every week just to stay close to caught up. There wasn't any one department worse than another, each manager had the same issues with their department. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to train and develop associates and watch them succeed. Also being able to provide a high level of customer service when we were caught up, sporting goods is a great industry, there was never any down time, because there is constantly a sport starting"
good,I have learned many business concepts that I have been able to strengthen within me.  I have learned that you need to be open to the unexpected and flow with each nuance sent your way.  People come with many different personalities and backgrounds.  Learning to read the person is priority number one!  Co workers will come and go and learning everyone's strengths and weaknesses help get you through each day.  There is good in everyone.  It's just learning how to relate to each one that is difficult t first.  The most enjoyable part of my job is most definitely the people I encounter everyday.  Some old and some new!  They make me smile and I want to make them leave with a smile when they leave!
good,It is a fun and productive workplace. Not much room for advancement though.
good,"managing freight, cashiering, covering multiple departments, answering telephones, and assisting customers with their needs"
good,was with the company for 6 years. good benefits loved my job but management not so great. Good discount on items there. friendly co workers.
good,The management was rarely on the same page and tend to pile on tasks while you're trying to finish your own or another manager's task already.
good,Clock in and start helping customers find the right product for them.
good,"I've worked at the Novi, MI (432) one and Northville (96). But I love Novi in Team Sports. Didn't care for some management and department managers were always coming and going and constant new mangers in training. Most of employees are great. I feel that I was underpaid for amount of work and expectations. Been in retail for 6-7 years. Considering going back temporarily. Good customer service training. I've learned to sell what customers want first. It shows if you take an interest. I love being able to help customers get what will help them the most because they WILL remember you and return for repeat business (big goal for company). I also helped out in footwear and golf. Difficult customers will cross your path, keep your head on straight and let them say whatever they want to. Sometimes they walk in angry but leave with a compromiseable solution."
good,"A day of work at Dick's involved assisting customers with whatever they need help with, stocking shelves, and filing firearm purchases. Working at Dick's, I learned a lot about customer service. Making sure that the customer comes first is very important and they are always right. I worked with great people who taught me a lot and were great role models for me. The hardest part of the job was dealing with multiple customers at one time when we were short on help. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and meeting new people everyday."
good,"A typical day at Dicks Sporting Goods.  Depending on the shift I would count the safe and make the tills cashier ready.  Then hand out radios and keys etc.  Then have a morning meeting and start the day.  Management usually talks to me about the day and what our plan in business is and what is expected of the day.  Then u would plan where my cashiers would go to and plan their break times.  If I'm needed to ring up customers I don't hesitate, The customer shouldn't wait.  If any of my cashiers have problems I help them out and take care of the problem as smooth as possible with no hassle.  As the day goes on usually it gets on the busy side and the hardest part of the day is trying to get the customers rung up and out in a hurry, so there isn't a long wait time and everyone's happy.  I enjoy working with the interaction of different people, There are some people that do come back just to see certain associates in the store which is a nice connection we are able to be introduced to working in a retail environment.  As the afternoon and closing associates come in I would let them know which cashiers are at which location through-out the store and which ones need breaks and who goes home at a certain time.  As my shift would come to a end If there were any cashiers leaving the same time I would take them with me to count out their draw and because they have coverage its easier to just pull the cashier to let them go home on time.  Which usually doesn't happen all the time, but transactions and problems occur and sometimes we cant leave on time.  Then going back into the cash office"
good,"dealing with customers who are looking for products and ordering it for them if needed. people i work with are easy to get along with and are skilled in their department."
good,Great way to learn how to interact with customers and sell them what they need. 
good,"Daily activities include interacting with customers, processing merchandise, and keeping up the stores appearance."
good,There are normally 2 kinds of shifts. Morning is 8:30 or 9 until 4 and closing shift is usually from 3:30 until 10. The managers are mostly approachable. They take care of the employees.
good,Fast paced. Easy to stay busy. Diverse customer base leads to many enjoyable customer interactions and some not so enjoyable.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Dick’s Sporting Goods is a nice place to work and provides great benefits . Work is steady with plenty of opportunities for overtime . It’s a nice place to work if you’re looking for a warehouse position.
good,"Got hired as a greeter and they would not want me to work any other position unless absolutely needed. My boss was the best. He made sure we had morning meetings everyday before the store would even open so we were clear on our goals. He helped me move to other positions that would better fit me."
good,"Been working for two years now there, and the staff feel like family to me. It is a healthy and low-stress place to work at, but it also makes you passionate about the things you get accomplished there."
good,It's a great place to work that also has good management. One thing is that the management is just felt like they can do more to help out in the store.
good,"Was a proactive work environment. Very fast paced, and keeps you on your feet. At times you will have to juggle multiple tasks at once. Friendly environment, working with an energetic younger group of people."
good,Some of the managers are on the same page for different events and some aren’t. The managers don’t like to make sure that associates are staying productive. The productive associates get frustrated with the less productive. I like the people I work with because it’s what makes the job fun and entertaining. I just know the retail is not my future. I know that my passion is pets and livestock.
good,"Compared to other retail establishments that I have worked for in the past, Dick's Sporting Goods is one of the better ones. Good working environment. Solid management structure for the most part. Opportunities for advancement are presented fairly often for those who are willing to actually work and aren't just there to collect a paycheck."
good,"Before we open we have a team meeting to discuss the goals that need to met for the day, if we are having any special visitors coming, we are notified as well. In my department which is footwear, I would come in about two hours before the store is open. i would have to unload pallets or u-boats of inventory that needs an assigned location. I learned it all about teamwork, its a team environment. If we are under staff other employees from different departments are always willing to help. Management are fun, cool, easy to talk to and have nothing but the best intentions for you. The most difficult part is trying to tend to every customers needs when busy and under staff. The most enjoyable part is helping a customer walk out with a new pair of sneakers."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced. I start with my normal routines everyday such as checking my email and data entry till my store manager gives me a list of what he would like done before I leave for the day. I have learned many great things at work about how to manage everything with staying organized. I love my management they are always very caring about your needs. The hardest part of my job is how stressful it is at certain times, and how they're not able to give me the pay or hours I need. The most enjoyable part is defiantly the people I work with. They feel like another family."
good,Change is way of life every day and not for the faint at heart. Due to frequency of restructures occurring promotes feeling of instability and lack of commitment or loyalty to employees that have dedicated lives to company.
good,Overall good work environment and friendly co-workers/management. Pay is average at best compared to the tasks asked of team leaders. Understaffed at times where freight needs to be processed and store is high in foot traffic.
good,The job moral was high here and therefor felt good to be there around happy people with positive attitudes. I gained valuable sales experience selling treadmills and elliptical machines some priced over 5 thousand dollars. I also was given the opportunity for Dick's to pay for a personal trainer course for me which I accomplished and became a certified personal trainer and received a promotion.
good,Always a goal to be achieved everyday. Nice people to work around. Learned to be organized and work at a pace that's expected. Hardest part is dealing with customers that is needy.
good,The job was very simple and sometimes fast paced. Being a cashier was easy until I would wake up the next morning expecting to have the day off. I would originally have the day to myself until an unexpected schedule change comes my way. I looked at the schedule as often as I could but they would swap my shifts with someone that didn't show to work.
good,A typical work day varies by position. There is room for growth if that is what you desire within the company. Procedures are in place that enable you to succeed.
good,"Just your standard retail job. If you like to play sports, particularly baseball, football, basketball, and/or golf, or fish/hunt/hike regularly, you’ll definitely be utilized there. But they do like to have people work multiple departments so be ready to run around everywhere"
good,"My overall experience with DSG was good. It has a fast-paced, collaborative work environment and the team shows a genuine level of respect for the customers and each other."
good,I enjoy working at Dick's Sporting Goods because of the organizational culture that it par takes in. The ability to effectively communicate with upper management is key so a successful company.
good,"Working with the company for 5 years+. I have had multiple job titles in the store, however advancing to management feels like you’re being held back."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Dick’s sporting good is a fun workplace, and works around people’s schedule. I have been working here since the store opened in el grove in 2016 and the store discount are a plus."
good,"Fun work place but the mangers were informal and lacked responsibility."
good,"Dick's has a very friendly and fun work environment. The ""Team"" is like a family. The store i personally worked with had poor management but corporate if very friendly and concerned about its employees."
good,"My typical day is either working in the office doing payroll and weekly paperwork or Price Changing ( which is weekly mark downs) or Ship from Store ( which is picking, packing, and shipping online orders).  At this point I'm really not learning anything new.  My new manager has taken it upon herself to do most of my job so I'm not in the office as much as I should be.  The work culture is a bit stuffy when the store manager is in the store.  The most enjoyable part of my job are my co-workers."
good,On a typical day you start with meeting the managers for daily tasks where customers are always first priority. The management is decent for a retail environment however there is high turnover.
good,I work at two different locations.  They were completely different.  The first location was great to work for.  They cared about their employees there.  The second location was not great.  The store manager was horrible to work for if you were a male employees.  The department manager was not smart about the product at all.
good,"Fun place to work, every day there was a new problem that had to be solved, Moved up from a Lodge associate, to a team sports associate, to being the only Bike tech on staff."
good,"overall not a bad place to work. it is a high school/college aimed job with many great people working in the company. management is hit and miss as it is with any retail store. overall, its a fun place to get a few extra hours for supplemental pay. the employee discount could be better but it isn't terrible"
good,The Tennessee store where I worked was ranked #5 amongst all DSG stores in golf club repairs and sales. We had a really good team in the golf department that was committed to enjoying the customer experience as their job pertained to a very fun and challenging pass time.
good,This job is non stressful and a friendly environment.  The teammates are a blast to work with and hang out with and I was stress free while working there and looked forward to going to work everyday.
good,Dick's was a fun place to work. It was relaxed and people were fun to work with. We all worked as a family and upheld the reputation of Dick's Sporting Goods.
good,Tasks where to be completed in a timely manner while making sure to help all customers in or around you. If you had a question you could always get a hold of another associate who had an answer.
good,"Working for Dick's was fun, and fast paced. I was able to interact with customers daily as well as make sales and learn about old and new product. Management was encouraging and helpful when it came to incentives."
good,DSG was an easy albeit stressful work environment. As a footwear sales associate it was my responsibility to understand the product and be able to lead customers towards sales that would benefit them.
good,Great place to work and get started in sales. Structured and provided good training. Difficult to make a living on income unless you're promoted to a manager position.
good,"Had a new manager about 26 years old, never came out of office, was not easy to talk to. He fired me then a few weeks later he was fired and they asked me back but did not accept.Was a great place to work until we received new manager."
good,This is a fast pace job. I learned a lot here and was able to use that knowlege to move up in the company. due to consistant task  the work day goes by pretty fast
good,"Management is a little rough, but overall, pretty good place to work at. Room for career advancement. Competitive pay and overall pretty good working environment."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"working in the golf shop was fun and easy. Managers were always easy going and worked well around my school schedule. Also, made many good friends working there."
good,"During a typical day at work i would walk about seven miles per day."
good,I have gained a lot of customer service experience. I have also moved up in the Lodge area to include the certification to do background checks and handle firearms and ammunition.
good,Working for Dick's was my first retail job. They took their time to help me figure out the in's and out's of working retail. Whenever I had a question my manager or another employee would always be willing to come and help.
good,"A typical day of work would be making sure all customers were satisfied and sales were closed. I learned how to work efficiently with coworkers and all customers that not only came into my department but other departments. Management was fine, they did their job and made sure each task for the day was accomplished. The hardest part of the job was making sure that every single customer was always happy and satisfied with their experience while inside the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing something that I enjoyed. It made going to work so much easier knowing that I enjoy being there."
good,"A typical day at DSW started with the initial work crew pre-shift and the game plan for the day. From there employees would embark on assigned tasks that could range from packing and shipping online ordered products, putting out new apparel and merchandise, all while providing top customer service to customers. The hardest part of the job was always trying to satisfy customers, especially when they can be irate. That's why I am glad DSW properly trains employees to be able to thrive in all situations. The most enjoyable would the moral and love all the employees had for one another."
good,Dick’s sporting goods was a great job to have while I was in school because they did a wonderful job helping me balance school with work. The only issue I ever had was at that there was a shift in leadership and the transition was pretty rough
good,I liked working there. It was very busy and things are pricey at times. Staying late for inventory and closing the store was sometimes  too much.  There was a lot of good team work and communication there.
good,Great company in a fast paced field. The company as a whole works hard and gives back.The office is in a good location with a lot of amenities. The work is ever changing and you need to stay at the top of your game to advance.
good,They really depend on their high turnover rate to keep wages down and there is not a whole lot of ability to advance and get promoted unless you stick around for a while.
good,"I  worked in sales, specializing in apparel.  The company is great to their employees.  The management is great in teaching the skills needed to complete tasks."
good,"Fast-paced environment, management is very supportive and involved. The culture is great and I generally like the people I work with there.  Hours are flexible and they try their best to work around school/other work schedules."
good,"Great opportunity for those looking to get retail experience. Long days on the floor but if you're receptive to customers and have a positive mindset, it will make the days go by quickly. Management pushes goals and shows you how to accomplish them."
good,"A lot is expected of employees as with a lot of jobs in the retail business, weekends are very busy and stressful, although I personally enjoy the job it isn't for everyone."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. Every day was fun to go in and work, the atmosphere alone there is friendly and personable. The store manager was super fun to be around especially on chill days. He made sure everyone got the job done but had fun doing it. He always helped with every department on super busy days and on non-busy days.Overall it was a really cool place to work"
good,I am customer service support  and have managed 6 to 8 cashiers serving sports active customers. The company provides high quality equipment. As css it is my job to solve customers problems with a professional approach
good,Working as an administrative assistant is a new and challenging experience. I loved making my mark in the company and collaborating with the store manager to create a more organized and relaxed work place.
good,"Very flexible on scheduling. Good for students or someone looking for a few extra hours of work. Good managers for the most part. I enjoy helping people who have similar interests, such as sports."
good,The daily work environment at DSG is extremely friendly and family like between the associates and some managers. The hours are highly flexible which is an excellent perk. DSG is a fantastic side job or even first job for someone. I would not recommend it for anyone looking for quick growth. DSG seems to run off of who likes who so management roles and advancement seem to be based off of who is favored by which manager.
good,"They store otself is amazing.  The management needs improvement. I don't know if they have changed management at all, but if thet haven't they sorely need too! They would leave me alone up front at the register the first day and the entire time. They would go in the back and chit chat and say hey she can work shes new , we're tired of doing grunt work. I was happy to bw ros of the people like that but everytime i meeded numbers to finish a transaction, the customer would get mad at me because i couldnt do it and they had to wait for someone else to come up....... VERY VERY unprofessional."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"It is rewarding to work with things you know and love. Going to work is a good thing. I spend a lot of time talking with customers qualifying their needs and wants. I enjoy helping people with their passion. The pleasure received from having a customer return to thank you is really outstanding. I have only been with the company a few months but I’m now the lead golf person. I also help out in fishing and hunting.  One problem is that I spend a lot money on my hobbies now, but I sure have nice toys"
good,A typical day at work is completing a task assigned my a manager as well as providing excellent customer service to customers. I learned the ins and outs becoming a full time employee. It was a very knowledgeable place to work.
good,"i lowkey enjoyed everyone was cool and chill to work with and friendly. its a really good job for someone who loves sport, very good place to work if you like to interact with people"
good,I learned customer service skills. The store was very big so part of my job was making sure the clothes were put in the right places and keeping the racks clean. I also helped create clothing displays. My manager did a good job in keeping everything organized.
good,"Dicks campus is very nice and comes with great ammentities.  You are able to take advantage of an on site Starbucks, Dry Cleaner, full service restaurant to entertain customers, and a great work out facility."
good,Great place to work and had a good time working there. Managers were great and work-life balance was a focus. Would recommend to anyone looking to work in Pittsburgh.
good,"Management could use some refreshment. Coworkers were nice but mostly unhappy with the way they were treated and things were run. Mostly due to understaffing."
good,Dicks was a very exciting place to work. As long as you did your job the best you could then you would get the hours you wanted. The only issue I had was with management whom are all gone now so the power structure is completely different from what I've heard.
good,"As a cashier,it was stressful everyday when I first started!You need to get customers to sign up for a ""rewards card"",if they say no,your scorecard percentage goes down,and you have to constantly fight to keep it above a 75% for the whole day.if not,managers will get onto you and your hours will start to go down.You'll also need to know how to assist customers with an online order(A.O.S),fishing license,and most importantly applying them for a in store credit card.Sale prices are always confusing customers and you'll need a manager to explain to them,Over time you'll get used to it, and maybe enjoy it."
good,I will not start working there till the 5th of December. I have my orientation. I also have a ex co-worker that works there she is the HR. i'm very excited to work with her once again.
good,This is the place to work if you like sporting goods. Discounts galore. They really liked me here at Disk's Sporting goods. I liked my boss too. They treat people good.
good,"very easy to work here, very laid back not sales based for the most part. management when I was employed there was excellent. Large amount of teamwork to get job done."
good,"At Dick's Sporting Goods I have learned how to be a team player, how to work competitively and how to engage with any type of personality a customer might have."
good,Job can be fast paced depending on the season but seems disorganized due to managerial conflict or lack of organization. Loss of employee wifi also a major con.
good,Good management team. Would not recommend for people wanting to further their life long career goal with on the job experience here. Just the basic retail setting.
good,Fast paced environment with a great customer base. My knowledge base of outdoor related merchandise increased ten fold in my time with the company. The store was rather large but had a family feel to everyday work life. Hardest part of the job was when you exceeded all possible outlets of customer service and you still could not take care of a customer.
good,Worked there for four years while I was in college. They were flexible with hours because i really could only work nights and weekends because of my school schedule. But they are very cut throat when it comes to managers because I have over 15 mangers in that 4 years.
good,Meets lots of different people and I have a variety of conversations. Its also an up beat job because the rush hour can come at any time throughout the shift. The job keeps me on my toes.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,This job is a great one to have and the environment you work in is really nice and you make a lot of good friends as well. I'm really honored to work at dicks sporting goods.
good,As an apparel associate I would be the only person working in my department. The store was fun to work for. All of my co workers were great to work with but the turnover was great.
good,The people make you feel welcome and are very friendly almost like family. At first it I was thinking about quoting until my 3rd week is when I really felt welcomed.
good,Enjoyable work place...always something to do in this store...always a challenge and additional deadlines...not hard work at all...customer friendly place
good,"I have been working at dicks for a little over a year. Most of the customers are fantastic but its retail so you always have those crazies but I also love everyone I work with especially all my managers, the store manager not so much but he is ok. I have enjoyed my experience so far but there really isn't much room for advancement at all. I was also suppose to get my 1 year raise but Ive also not seen that yet. they'd much rather higher people outside of the company than advance from within which sucks because the people they hire don't usually last more than a couple of weeks."
good,Great choice of work if you are looking for a retail position. There is a big focus on customer service so you will need to have great communication skills.
good,"easy work but wish it was more of a challenge.could always find a task to complete though.fun and peers were a blast,management could have been a little more hard working.customer interactions were awesome.learned a few new ways of merchandising and a new updated Point of Sale system.hardest part of the job was the physical weight of some freight when truck came.the most enjoyable part were the weeks with long hours for me."
good,"While I loved working here as an apparel associate, some of the management had certain biased and would manipulate scheduling to their favorite employees. Hours were unsatisfactory. While pay was good, it didn't make up for the sufficient lack of hours. Still very pleased with my experience here."
good,"Cool place to work at with sports related people.  If you are passionate for sports, it's a great job for you.  Most people there are cool, friendly and nice."
good,"The people you work with will make you want to stay forever, I just feel like we don't get paid enough for as hard as we work. The company doesn't give out enough money for the amount of work you have to do."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with this company, although I did not enjoy the treatment of my store manager by the higher-ups. My manager worked very hard and cared deeply about his employees and the well-being of his story and the company. The store location and lack of inventory that resulted in poor numbers was the issue. At times we were understaffed, not due to our store, but due to payroll cutbacks in the company. ""Here's a raise! Now, let me cut back your hours!"" The job itself however was fun and most of the time varying tasks and down time."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Dick's, the managers were pretty easygoing and the job was not difficult at all. All of my coworkers were friendly, and it was a great experience for my first job."
good,"Typical day consisted of a lot of standing around near the register waiting for a customer to come and check out, while waiting sometimes we were asked to fold clothes, clean or stock the shelves. Management was nice but some managers could have been better utilized elsewhere."
good,I work in the sports section so it is more fun for me. I help kids pick their first soccer ball or their first pair of cleats it is a fun and exciting experience. I also help in all other sports.
good,Working at Dick's Sporting Goods as a sales associate gave me a broad knowledge of the retail business. Not only did I work directly with the customers and help them making choices but I was also able to learn about visual merchandising with different brands.
good,This is an overall great company to work for. Having a great management team will allow a business to function thoroughly. I highly recommend new associates to get familiar with the Dick's Sporting Goods hand book.
good,"Typical day would have you do projects to prepare the sales floor or back stock. However the primary focus was to help customers with what they were looking for. I've learned much of how the products worked and how to find what a customer needs for his situation. The managers are always flexible with schedules and are very nice. Workplace culture mainly focused on getting your part of the job done so that everyone could leave on time. Hardest part of the job is closing as you will have to fix everything for the morning shift to be ready. Depending on the day, it would be on time or getting out late. There isn't anything that's most enjoyable in the job."
good,"This company was nice to work for however, management and some supervisors clearly had favoritism and promoted who they wanted in certain positions. It seemed to me that men were put in certain departments and it was hard for them to move up to less strenuous work unlike the females who work there."
good,"hours, training, management and employees make this store a great place to work. Best part of this job is being able to assist customer's with their questions and being able to see them leave the store happy. Only con would be the pay"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Energetic work place that keeps you on your feet. It is a great atmosphere for helping friendly customers as well as learning about sporting goods products and management qualifications
good,The dicks sporting goods store I worked at was a brand new store I was there for the grand opening it's a huge new store with great merchandise there are always sales going on and most of the employees are vibrant nice young college students it's a fun work environment but it's not very stable I'm assuming b/c it's a new store overall I liked the store and my job for the time I was there
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods is a great place to work , the job helped me communicate with others and helped me break out of shy character as I helped customers whether it was helping with a shoe or working on the resgister"
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a great company if you're in high school or just graduating high school, not for people that were older than 18. Overall nice place."
good,Through my time with Dick's I have learned a ton about the retail industry and have gained valuable business knowledge that will help me going forward in my career.
good,"I had a great time working there with my fellow co-workers and my boss. The one drawback is that my boss's boss strung me along for two weeks promising my work when in reality he had already cut me from the payroll and did not want to tell me. It culminated when I had to find out through one of the other managers what the issue was. He showed me that I had been cut approximately two weeks, and I had at the time of being there swapped shifts with a current employee. It resulted in no one covering our department for 6 hours. Poor upper management, but the department managers are on point and easy to get along with."
good,"I work in Lodge. The most enjoyable part of the job is the rest of the staff.  My responsibilities are stocking fishing/hunting and selling guns.  The hardest part of the job is making sure all the paperwork is done correctly. I enjoy working with them.  Management is okay, and the pay is okay for a part time job."
good,"Fun place to work if you love sports and the outdoors. I worked with an awesome team.  Great team work, the environment in general is just awesome."
good,"The store is a fast paced environment at times but when committed, it is so rewarding. Having a well rounded knowledge about the products that are available in store is a key factor to being a good employee."
good,Honestly don't remember too much about it. It was a summer job for me and it paid fairly well for retail. I did work in a mall in an upper-class city that had a lot of entitled people so that made it more difficult than the job otherwise would've been. Don't have a lot of good or bad things to say.
good,Dicks Sporting Goods offers great opportunity to interact with a diverse group of individuals. It also offers good opportunity to train in many different fields in order to grow within the company.
good,i liked it for the most part i enjoyed talking to the customers and being able to provide good customer service. i did not like the communication between the workers and management
good,"i would work in footware and help people find shoes"
good,"management could use work but all employees are fun"
good,"Overall, working here is great. Just improvements can be made in the managerial staff. Hours aren't the best. Starting pay sucks, but raises are possible."
good,"Being hired on as a drafter, the overall experience was great. designing new areas in the store and being part of a large team was exhilarating and competitive. As well as the cafeteria, with gourmet meals every day including breakfast. There is a Starbucks and a higher priced restaurant. "
good,An typical day there wasn't that bad I was a cashier but I would rather be in the footwear department or team sports department where I can walk around. The coworkers were friendly and welcoming when I first came there. The management was ok . I would the hardest part of the job was probably on Black Friday and standing in one place for hours.
good,"It's okay for a time being for me. You can move up in the job also. If you want a quick job with okay benefits go for it. They are very flexible and understanding of your schedule and life situations. I honestly like the job while I'm getting through school, it doesn't necessarily pays all bills unless your are full time. And you better served hours august-December"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Of course retail requires a certain schedule but DSG is flexible.  Full time does not mean you are guaranteed 40 hours every week. Management was always supportive and friendly. There is an opportunity to learn a lot in this retail setting.
good,I enjoyed working with customers and ensuring that their experience at Dicks Sporting Goods was enjoyable and informative if there were any problems or questions. I enjoyed being apart of a great team.
good,"Store is overall a great experience, but there are times where people in upper management demand more than some staff can feasibly provide.  Expect a high turnover due to some staff not understanding that they are expected to work and provide customer service and are not paid to just be there.  Also be wary that some training, albeit sparce, is provided but trial and error will occur, you will have to work at some skills to be efficient at them."
good,Work at Dick's Sporting Goods is a really good job for the most part. We get to interact with so many different people and learn their needs and wants. My co-workers are a lot of fun to work with and they work hard to help everyone else out while getting  their jobs done. The hardest part of my day would have to be when dealing with stubborn and unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the connections that I have made with my co-workers and our guests.
good,"Good team to work for, always hours. Never get a day off if you're working with high school or college kids. Management needs to reward more of those employees that goes above and beyond."
good,"love the staff that i work with. Very easy job, and I enjoy talking with the customers. I enjoy learning about guns and ammo."
good,Brand new store but bad management. There was no way get a promotion because they hire outside the company. They were not the best to work for and they work you to hard and you dont get paid enough.
good,"Constant sense of urgency which i enjoyed, managment was at times hectic mainly due to age of managers. Struggled to make good business choices."
good,"Employees work as a team.  Pay is average for the location.  Advancement seems to be slower than average in the area.  After you get the daily routine down, becomes repetitive"
good,"Easy to advance quickly, some terrible managers. Slow to respond on corporate end. Full-Time Hourly benefits after a year, not good."
good,"I learned a lot from all my coworkers. The environment is very energetic and communication is key. With the help of coworkers, no job is impossible."
good,Typical retail management job.  Culture is good and customers are generally shopping for things that they are passionate about which makes the customers more fun to help.
good,"Daily shipping of clients on line ordering and bi-weekly unloading of freight trucks, Processing of the the incoming freight and distribute to the corresponding sales departments. Managing the daily cash office accountability in the morning. Act as a Floor Manager on an as needed basis. Customer Service and complaint resolution. In store on line ordering for customer's. Good benefits package. Vacation is accured for Full time Associates on a Total number of hours worked not on months of service. No personal time given."
good,"I held this job while being a full time student at a public university. Not bad overall, decent pay, okay management. Coworkers were very friendly."
good,A very busy company to work for.  I learned a lot about Customer service and sales.  The management  is very clear what they expect from you. I think the best and worst part of this job are the customers.  You must learn how to deal with irate and difficult customers.  You must have good knowledge of products.  Excellent multitasking skills are essential.
good,No real levels of advancement. No benefits and decent compensation for only working part time. It was a good experience to work there.
good,"its and OK job I don't really care for it to much, but the schedule is pretty flexible. and the pay is straight but your hours are not consistant every week its a good job for a student"
good,All the employees I worked with were great people and we all had something in common. some managers weren't great didn't really care and there employee wants or needs. some customers were hard to deal with but not impossible the best part about the was the people I got to work with
good,Decent place just not much room for advancement. Promote from the outside. Hard to get recognized. They have a good employee discount that makes up for some things.
good,"You wouldn't think that a sporting goods store would be so fun to work at. A typical day would be opening the store, counting your drawer, going to your register, and making sure everything is clean and tidy, the doors open and we wait. I learned everything at Dicks to building shelves to folding properly, putting in security buttons, stocking, dusting the right way and more. The management was extremely nice and are constantly saying hello and asking you if you need anything. The co workers are nice and i never had a problem with any of them. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything is picked up and tidy and organized. the most enjoyable part was learning new things everyday."
good,"Provided customer service to retail customers.  Assisted with inventory and ensured department was well organized and clean.  "
good,"Se trabaja mucho, ya que era temporada y mucha gente llegaba al local, sin embargo el trabajo era bueno, tenia compañeros de trabajo amables."
good,"Never got bored, there's always some kind of work needed to be done. Management was friendly and understanding with conflicting schedules. Many co-workers are entry-level and young, difficult to get shifts covered some days."
good,"i like it alot,just wish i could get second shift,thet train you on multiple areas so you can fill a different position if they needed you to.i think thats like the best thing ever for a job to do"
good,"Working as a cashier at this location was very enjoyable. I love to be in any environment that deals with sports and fitness. I learned a lot from the customers coming through the area, dealing with their specific sport and fitness preferences. There were not a lot of individuals in my department, however, I did a lot of organizing and folding for other departments. I would rate the coworkers very highly. Everyone knew their department very well."
good,"A day at work would begin with cleaning the footwear deck before the store opened and checking that the inventory on the sales floor was somewhat tidy.  Once the doors opened the main focus was the customer; asking how they were doing that day and what they were looking for and offering assistance.  All together I liked working there.  What I didn't like was having to work black Friday's which included starting my shift on Thanksgiving Day and ending it late at night the following day.  Another dislike I had was the new manager of the store.  I thought he was overall lazy and not a team player.  I also was not receiving enough hours.  I decided to quite when I got a look at an upcoming work schedule and saw that I was only scheduled just over 10 hours that week.  Aside from those aspects I really did enjoy working there, under other circumstances I might still be employed there."
good,everyone here is very nice. its a fun place to work. I enjoy dealing with people and sporting stuff so it mixes well with what i do at work.
good,"A typical day at Dick's sporting goods was either very busy or very laid back.  I helped customers and enjoyed beign around the people I worked with.  I learned sometimes you can not make every customer happy but you can always try your best.  My managers helped me out very much.  They helped work around my class schedule and sports schedule during college.  The hardest part of the job was during the holidays because we would run out of certain items.  Therefore, this made it hard to please every customer.  The part I enjoyed most about my job was the work enivironment and the bonds I formed with my co-workers. I was really good at my job and their wasn't a day i absolutly did not want to go into work."
good,Good place to work.  Great talent and good people.  Fast paced and growing environment.
good,"I was just a cashier but everyone i worked with was friendly, including managers."
good,"I love the people i work with, they make working there worth while"
good,co workers were great but management not so great. A typical work day can be very stressful and repetitive. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to deal with many different customers who come from many different places across the world. There isn't one particular thing that i would classify as hard that deals with this job.
good,"Great place to work at for an athlete."
good,I like to learn things that i had no clue on what it was or used for i really enjoying working with my co-workers they was very respectful and always had your back if you needed help in anything very easy to pick up extra hours if needed
good,"Overall, Dick's Sporting Goods is a fun place to work at. The team is great, Management is great and you get to sell what you love. This job teaches you great customer service, along with leadership and team work."
good,"Dick's sporting goods is an excellent work environment with a very loyal customer base. However while working here I noticed that management lacked leadership qualities and was very rarely around on the sales floor. A typical day of work is restocking the sales floor while helping customers, possibly resetting product in a certain area of the store or changing labels on items. This may not sound very time consuming but I reassure you it is because Dick's also stays understaffed for the majority of the year and a majority of the day."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Busy all day helping customers. The store I worked for did mega business.
good,Worked as a cashier and on the floor in  many departments. I was able to learn about different products and how to set up different floor plans.
good,"Great stores, good company.  Has strong growth opportunities although decision making is not always based on sound judgement"
good,"During my work days I would often help customers with questions that they had about our product. Search on our computers/PDTS to check stock in other stores.  Answer any phone calls for my department and check on items for customers on the phone. I would also spend time cleaning the floor, un-box freight,sensor items, and re-stock the floor. I would have to keep up with training on our latest items and be sure that the floor was set to corporate plan. Would also help out freight flow lead work on ship from stores."
good,"Dick's is a great place to work, unfortunately it allows for very little work/life balance.  I had a lot of fun while working there, we were always striving to be the best and not allow other companies like Bass Pro, Cabela's, Academy, REI, and Sports Authority beat us or take our customers.  To do this was tough, and required a lot of extra hours.  I think that poor culture came from the executives at the corporate office. We would get emails stating they were adding new managers and creating new positions all the time, but never adding payroll to the stores.  We would also get direction changes all the time, the company culture is unstable.  My Store Manager was great, he always stayed positive with us and kept the culture competitive, yet fun.  Our District Manager and District Loss Prevention Manager were a lot of fun, they were both very easy to talk to and were always teaching us new things and appreciative.  My store did have a visit from someone important, I think an executive, and he was very rude and did not smile or talk to very many of us."
good,I enjoyed the job but I only made $8.25 and I wouldn't have been able to advance until I recieved my degree.
good,"Sufficient work flow, fast paced working environment, capability to pick up 60 pounds."
good,Good place to work. Good people. Good management. Difficult to find management openings even if you have the training and skills.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering phones when available, directing customers to appropriate departments, addressing customers' needs, and providing them with the products they desire. As one of my first jobs, I realized that customers are also just humans regardless of the roles being filled in a transaction (as am I). Management was friendly and took action as necessary. Management as well as co-workers took responsibility and created an environment of fairness in sales. The hardest part of the job was keeping up to date with new product information for sunglasses and heart rate monitors. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co-workers and learning from each other."
good,On a typical day i woulfd greet customers and assist them in anyway i can. the purpose of this job was to make  sure that each customer has a great experience at our branch.
good,When I worked at Dick's I loved it. I personally had an issue with one of my managers but who doesn't have an unfriendly run in with their boss every now and then? Overall they pay you well but considering the size of most of their stores they should pay you more for the work you do.
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods is a good company for management positions with long hours and hard work dedication being a must. Top down empathy and motivation tends to be absent, so personal work ethic is the primary intrinsic and positive customer feedback is the primary extrinsic. My recommendation for successful employment at Dicks requires being single (not married), operate with high energy and adaptability, and thrive off of an ever-changing emotional culture. Retail is a special environment for managers, empathy and good listening skills will go far at Dicks."
good,"Great place to work, opportunities to excel are definitely afforded to its employees."
good,Days in footwear are usually steady and always something to do to pass time and keep busy while at the same time being productive. I've learned how to create bonds with customers. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy during the weekends and you have to help around 3 to 4 customers at a time. The most enjoyable time is when it's not busy and you get to spend time with a customer and converse while you are helping them.
good,Really liked working here and with all the people. Also liked that it was so close to my house at the time.
good,"fun, good environment, pretty good management, team driven"
good,"Great concientious, fair management staff."
good,Overall I enjoyed working at DSG and the people I worked with. HR could do better by training their corporate managers some compassion and tactfulness toward the basic employees.
good,"A typical day is very customer service oriented and busy. You are usually performing re-stock and helping customers out on a daily basis. Depending on the department you are assigned to or hired for, you usually are kept busy by something you have to do."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"My day consisted of interacting with customers on a daily basis to help them with there athletic needs. I was the C.F.T. ( certified fitness trainer ) in training and learned a lot about fitness. And learned a lot about retail. Management was good and helpful. Made a few great friends working there. When the store was very busy, it got stressful. However it was still fun."
good,"Basically I use customer service skills, as well as complete money transactions, provide change, and answer questions about products, services, and policies. I've learned that you have to motivate/push yourself in order to maintain/expand your goals. Management to me is the seemingly perfect mix. They are stern and laid-back. Co-workers are all fun to be around with. The hardest part of the job is probably signing customers up with our Scorecard. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around my co-workers or just customers."
good,"While the people who worked at the store were great to work with, the hours given were terrible. I was a full-time employee only getting 15 to 20 hours a week while being the lead of my department."
good,i enjoy workin for dicks sporting good because of the customer satisfaction driven structure.
good,"A fun environment where you get to work with a large amount of people with all different sporting interests. If you are looking for a retail job, this is the pick for you. Even if you are not in to sports there will still be a department for you, and the atmosphere is fun and easy going, but there is still plenty to do to keep you busy."
good,"A typical day at work consists of continuously training/coaching associates to be the best they can be at customer service through their passion for sports and product knowledge. As a manager, It is crucial that I ensure and follow-up on all the tasks and projects that need to be completed, while ensuring we are providing Customers with an excellent shopping experience. The location I currently work in has a very positive and energetic staff which makes everyday enjoyable."
good,At Dicks Sporting Goods I spend my days running a cash register. I have learned how to process credit card applications and how to work with tax exempt forms and travelers checks.
good,I worked 9 hour day with 1 hour lunches. If yuo like people it is a good job. I started at lodge and had a blast talking to people about there fishing and hiking and hunting stories. I liked giveing advise and taking it from costomers.Some times it was hard to get the merchandising done because of the costomers but costomers come first.
good,"A typical day at work, me going into The Sporting Goods store clocking in then counting my till since I was a cashier. Basically all I did was stand around the cashier and rang people up. The hardest part was my employers were all not to good or pleasant. So it made my day drag on and I dreaded work. Besides my employers being horrible the job was rather easy."
good,Dicks is a wonderful company to work for. The store support center is out of this world. Play tennis or basketball during lunch or enjoy a gourmet meal in the state of the art cafeteria.
good,This job requires you to know about sports and talk about sports. You meet kids whose first time playing a sport is buying gear and it's fun to help them make their first purchase. Manegement always takes care of the customer and works just as hard as the employees. You also get to meet different sports figures whether they are just purchasing something or signing autographs for the day.
good,"If you work hard, you will end up with more hours. It is hard to get a full time there, they will do what ever power they have to not give you a full time position there even if you work over 80 hours in two weeks. For part timer, you will have no more than 20 hours a week."
good,"Most days are pretty busy especially in the area I work in, Footwear. The manager has a meeting before we open to tell us of the day's game plan and sales goal. I've certainly learned how to multi-task with this job and it's helped me in other areas of my life. My co-workers are just great. They're the nicest people I've ever met, so are the managers. The hardest part of the job would be organizing the stock room while servicing the customers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing how happy the customers are when they find what they're looking for and receive great customer service."
good,"Assists customers and head cashiers, and managers. I have always liked working here and the co-workers are great."
good,I always enjoyed the people I worked with there. People really seemed like they were having fun.
good,"I loved working for Dick's Sporting Goods!  However, there were instances where weak employees were praised and the employees that excelled were pushed to the side."
good,"Hard to move up in the company, but if you are looking for a good job to start out with.. Look no further. This spot is a great place to learn basics on selling different items."
good,I come into work and get some coffee I clock in go to the Tier 1 board meeting here how we did the the day before talk about what's going on and what's happening today and what we need to get through and then we stretch break up and we get to work
good,"Comfortable working area with good hours."
good,It was a great time working there. I learned more about different sports and more about the sports I loved. I also learned how to deal with multiple tasks at once and get all of them done
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,It’s retail but they care a lot about customer service and credit so if you’re good with a credit pitch and good with customers you’re a great candidate
good,My overall experience working for dicks sporting goods was fair. The job itself was really simple and mostly common sense. Management was easy to work with as long as you kept your work done at all times. There wasn't really anything that hard about working here. Normal hours for the most part with some overtime during holiday season and corporate visits. Most enjoyable part for me was my fellow employees that I worked with.
good,it was my first time working at a store like that and I loved it so much. te managers were nice to me and I never had to miss my lunch. they were also flexible with my schedule
good,"I worked for them from the mid 90's for about 9 years."
good,Worked at the columbia and glen burnie locations. Management was always changing so you would have to get used to new people often running the show. I enjoyed my time at Dicks and was happy to be given the opportunity of Lead in such a short time.
good,"people were cool to work with , I was part time and hours would get cut through out the week , which sucked but it was ok job until something else came along"
good,"When I first started working the work environment was great. Also plenty of hours were available, constantly doing near 40 hours during school. After the holidays all hours went away and i was lucky to get a 25 hour week. The management changed and their communication broke down but the co workers were great through my entire employment. Good temporary job but not ling term."
good,"As pricing and signage coordinator my days are pretty planned out."
good,"Dicks sporting goods is one of the best companies I have had the pleasure of working for, they're very understanding when it comes to taking the day off when something comes up or if you just need a mental health day."
good,Fast paced work environment with opportunity to grow within the company. You get to work with great people and learn new skills. If you're a sports fan this is a job for you
good,"I was in college throughout my time at Dick's, and it was fun for the most part. Many of my co-workers were also around my age, so we all had similar interests and became friends pretty quickly inside and outside of work. Dick's compensates their employees relatively well, and the hours aren't bad most of the time. Unfortunately, there were some bad managers that came through and made it harder to enjoy work, but sometimes that is inevitable. Overall it was a fun place to work."
good,Super unorganized and dint care about their employees. Seen them as robots. I like to feel important and they clearly didn't make me feel important along with hours. They want you to simply work and don't care about personal issues.
good,A typical work day at Dick's Sporting Goods is very productive by helping many customers and getting tasks done. The work environment is very relaxed and coworkers are very friendly.
good,As payroll is reduced more workload is put on the management staff. Very strict policies surrounding the sale of fire arms and inconsistant flow of freight that exceeds the ability to store it.
good,It is a fast paced environment a d the work is enjoyable with many great coworkers. Working in the golf department is good for my knowledge of sport. Overall a good place to work
good,"Retail can be a pain, but if you approach it in the correct manner it will make life that much smoother. Not a place for someone who is not prepared or willing to be cross-trained."
good,"When I go into work, my job is to inspire athletes and excite them before or during their season. I try to share as much advice and personal experience as possible so they feel like they can relate to me."
good,"Overall I would say my experience with Dick's Sporting Goods was well. The downside of working during a slow time of year is that they may stick you in other departments to which you have no knowledge about. Management was decent, some managers were easy going, while others were extremely strict. I will give credit to the company for being extremely flexible with school. Hours are inconsistent; some weeks I would work 30+ hours, while other weeks I may work 12."
good,"I believe Dicks sporting goods is a great work environment, my coworkers were welcoming and hard working along with the managers being very informative and making sure that each of us understood our tasks for the day."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"It's an easy job with decent pay if you're just trying to get some extra money. Unfortunately for most, that is not the case. Dick's is not a place where you could live off the income."
good,"I enjoyed working there, although I was not a fan of every manager.  I worked the front register as the customer service specialist.  I helped resolve issues and took care of the cash office.  The initial training was not great.  Overall, it was a good experience."
good,"very fast pace place to work,/ to sale fishing item & guns / I thank we have a great group of manager/ the hardest part of the job is don't a enough time in the day/ the team work & meeting new customer"
good,"great place to work if you like or want to learn about sports. fun environment and very hands on , dicks sporting goods is just one big team. you will learn many departments . sometimes representatives from the different brands they offer come in and teach you about the products and upcoming new products they have coming."
good,If you are looking for  good company to work for as a younger person than Dicks is a good option. It would be hard to make enough to make this job your primary source of income but f you are only looking for part time work then it is a great job.
good,Dick's Sporting Goods was a great place to work. Very fast paced and always something to do. The wages were fair and competitive. The management was fair and easy to work with.
good,"I have had some really good times and really bad times while working for Dick's Sporting Goods. The employees can be wonderful, I've made some of my best friends there. This being said it is also similar to high school with the amount of gossip and negativity that travel around. Some of the managers have either really good or really bad days and there aren't many with an in-between. It is also really hard to be recognized as a good worker or as someone who matters. It's a really mediocre place. It's a good place to work temporarily, but in the long term, it's not such a good idea."
good,As a fitness professional I enjoyed working at Dick's sporting goods. Management allowed me to do my job and also allowed me to find new clients for my training business. An overall win win...
good,Dicks was a normal retail setting. The staff I worked with worked very well together. It was a ok place to work at the time for myself. Management worked well to work with student schedules.
good,"Only worked here for a brief time as an hourly employee. For someone interested in the company this is not a bad place to start. Every department has a structure for advancement, so if you work hard and put in the time, there;s always a chance for eventual raise/advancement."
good,"Management and employees have similar interests leading to a fun and productive work environment. There are opportunities to advance within the company to become department heads, as well as eventually management."
good,"Better get your score card up or you won't last! Managers are not happy to be working there and they are under a lot of stress, mall environment is hard to deal with for most."
good,fast going job that can go by very fast and keeps you very busy. The work environment is very clean and neatly done. the only real problem i would really say is the staff the supervisors don't really take the time to teach you the correct way on how to do the daily work requirements that i feel needs more time to learn.
good,Job is pretty easy. Your goal is to drive metrics and promote loyalty card sign ups. You develope good customer service and communication skills. Management varies from store to store. Workplace culture is diverse as you have people of different backgrounds and ages working with you. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid and interacting with customers.
good,I enjoyed working there a lot and talking with everyone. Was a very family environment and felt welcomed. There wasn't any stress put on us and everyone got along nicely.
good,I enjoyed working with everyone! The only problem I had was not given enough hours as it was my second job. Overall I’d recommend this job to others!!
good,I did enjoy working with the company for the time I was there. After working there for approximately 3 years I learned many skills from all the managers that I had the opportunity of working with. Only down side was the lack of training when it came to new associates. Managers are to be the leaders of the foundation and quite frankly there would be lack of managing.
good,"It was a typically fast-paced environment (providing you did your job correctly). Employees were expected to effectively multi-task while still providing the best customer service possible, even if things got a little stressful. I almost always was busy, so days typically went by quickly. It was a great way to learn how to be a salesperson, and interact with customers to find the best items for their needs."
good,"Customer service intensive, so you need to be open to all types of customers from the friendliest family to the snobby know it all. Overall a fun fast paced place to work."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Was a good job for the most part. Management when I first started working there was not great but they fixed that while I was working there and the job improved quite a bit. The lady who did scheduling was somewhat rude and barely scheduled me but that was the only issue I ever really had.
good,Dicks was great. There’s a Starbucks and food court. Gym.  discounts. Benefits. Everything but the pay(for my position) was great. I’d recommend the HQ to anyone looking.
good,"A typical work day at Dick depending on which department you work in could be receiving the truck and processing all of it or coming in during the day in which there are multiple departments such as team sports, footwear, apparel, front end, lodge and opps. Which all have different responsibilities."
good,Most employees get along and help each other whenever possible. The managers do their best to listen to problems and feedback. The hardest part of the job was running around the store and working on several tasks at once. The most enjoyable part was making customers happy.
good,Good job for college students but its not a career based place. I dont know anyone who wants to spend their life working retail or doing inventories overnight bi-annually.
good,"Working at Dicks Sporting Goods was an overall great experience. My hours were good, and all of my co workers I really enjoyed working with. It was just a temporary job."
good,Overall the company is nice to work for for the most part. My only complaints were the pay and the hours scheduled. There is no real clear cut path to advancing or receiving a raise.
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is a competitive and high paced environment. The management staff is always there to help high potential employees achieve their goals of advancement.
good,"Being a cashier at this store really opens you up to work any other section the management thinks is fit for you. The work isn't hard, it is the constant barrage of customers that really get to you."
good,"For opening the store on an average day, there is a 'huddle' at the front of the store. The meeting is a breakdown of how the day should be looking like, who is tasked with what, where people are going to be for the day, who is taking lunches. Once the meeting is over, we break out to our departments and prepare for a day of sales and work. For bikes and fitness it was a balance between assembling bikes, and new fitness equipment as they change every year, to helping out in other departments when needed, such as apparel, lodge (hunting and fishing), team sports, Front end (check out), and footwear. Fixing the product as the day goes, keeping up with the tasks assigned."
good,its retail but with that considered you do get a good discount as well as pro deal opportunites from various companies.pay is avg but if youre full time the job security is great.
good,"Must be able to help customers by giving knowledge on the latest products. Other task includes cleaning the workspace, or doing any other command that managers request."
good,"Management gives written direction (game plan) in the morning and depends on associates to complete the tasks.  There is little to no follow up and little, if any, accountability.  Some staff works very slow while others try very hard.  Payroll budget hours are always an issue.  The company is more concerned with saving labor dollars and handling merchandise than providing the necessary staff to properly service the customer.  A $20 million location is nickel and diming associates.  They feel an appropriate wage for an assistant store manager who works 50 hours per week is $42-$44 thousand dollars per year."
good,"Fun job, retail schedule, managers were great. Customer service and maintained depts. Fast paced, great co-workers. Team environment. Short staffing limited ability to get work done."
good,I enjoyed working at dicks being able to help customers and talk sports is what I’m very passionate about and I have a great time doing ! Helping them to the best of my ability and giving them exactly what they need made me a happy kid
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is a good part time job if you're looking for flexible hours. The company is very customer driven and fairly easy going. There is always opportunities for advancement.
good,The management staff at my store in Brandon were great. They were always helpful and willing to help regardless of how busy we were. If your looking for just part time work. Dick's Sporting Goods is the pace to work.
good,"Management was usually good but sometimes inconsistent. No pay raises or advancement. Didn't always receive breaks on time, sometimes not at all. Very little training."
good,Dick's Sporting Goods was the perfect part time job for me. They were very flexible with my schedule when I needed days off for school. You need to be able to keep your composure because there are customers that will definitely test it.
good,"I liked it there. There are opportunities to move up, but unless you have a manager that has your back and is looking to help you move up within the company, you get stuck."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,I would arrive at work and would immediately begin with customer service. I would learn about the different types of shoes and feet. I worked with about 3 different managers and they would teach me about how to perform gait analysis. The hardest part of the job was just keeping busy because there really wasn't much to do in the footwear department. The best part of the job was working with people who come to the store for the customer service. Those were the people I enjoyed helping because they were physically coming to me for my help.
good,Working as a team is central to working at Dick's. Each person has a role but we always make sure nobody has too much to do.  One problem is they do not make it clear exactly how to move up.
good,"Flexible schedule, learn people skills and selling skills, different routes of advancement, management programs for those willing to move up, good benefits"
good,Dicks Sporting goods is a retail sports door where they offer a wide variety of sporting and outdoors gear. The management was professional during time time working there.
good,"I have worked for this company for five years and I have enjoyed my time here. If you are looking for a casual every day job this is a great place to work. I did struggle to move up within the workplace and had to practically demand both promotions I have obtained. There were many instances where who you knew was more important than what you knew unfortunately.  Dick's can also be stingy in pay sometimes, although I do feel they have gotten better about pay in the past couple of years. I don't regret working for this company and have learned a lot and gained much experience as well as made many lifelong friendships."
good,I enjoy my job but there is a poor work/life balance and do not follow job descriptions. The PD department always is stressful and unorganized. There is a gym & cafeteria in the building which is nice and inexpensive.
good,Was a good first job. My coworkers were very fun to be around and work with. The energy in there was bumpy at time but overall it was a great experience and a very good first job
good,"Great place to meet people when you are young and the work environment is enthusiast. however, it is easy to get caught up in the idea of advancing at DSG and losing sight of what goals you have. There is constant extra hours available as people callout, etc and they look highly upon you if you do well. "
good,I was a golf technician so I was constantly surrounded by a sport I love and people who enjoyed it as much as I do. I liked being able to share my wisdom of the sport with others.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Dicks Sporting Goods. I am an athlete, so I was very excited to get to see the lastest and greatest equipment offered. Especially with an employee discount. Really need things worth while to work there."
good,I enjoyed my time at Dicks Sporting Goods.  I had great relationships with staff and management alike.  I left the position for family reasons and would love to go back.
good,"I work here while attending college, management is flexible with hours and understanding when it comes to scheduling. Fun place to work for someone who enjoys sports or being active."
good,This was an alright job for someone looking for something to pay your bills. As an apparel associate the work can be stressful and strenuous at times.
good,If you're a sports fan and need a part time job Dick's is your place.  I enjoyed working there other than the fact that the pay was low.  Managers were fair & for the most part fun.  I enjoyed learning about sports that I didn't know about or much about from the customers.  It was fast paced on weekends & during holidays.
good,"I applied for a full-time position, and was hired on working less than 20 hours a week. Had no choice but to accept the job- needed the money. Not a good place for someone looking to get hours."
good,"it is a good job overall, there is just no opportunity to move up. I loved working with all different types of people it was great. I liked the fact the it was fast paced and we had to reach goals."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,A good place to work part time to make some extra money.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I worked with.  Management was nice and the hours were decent.
good,Great place to work if you are looking for somewhere to start out. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Honest people working to further their passions
good,I started working there when I was in college and needed a part-time job. Working there could be enjoyable because everyone is very friendly and easy to work with.
good,"ability to move up within company, great job during college"
good,"great management but high turnover rate, low pay meant not the best employees, lack of compassion, high energy, stressful at times, friendly competitions"
good,"This is a place that you can actually work and have fun. You will not make a lot of money, but you will have a blast with the people you work with. Company is key in this retail."
good,"Fun place, great people. Easy to learn people are great to work with, great training, flexible schedules and understanding managers. Highly recommended"
good,I loved training people on the cash registers and we were like a big family. easy to get along with everyone. The new management was horrible . He made everyone dislike him. His jokes were more like insult. He didn't make me feel at home anymore and I liked the environment we had before he came. We dressed very relaxed and the customers got to know who we were as well. It's a sports store it's suppose to be fast friendly and fun.
good,I worked here part time.  It was a good part time employment job. The work environment was friendly and many of the employees idd get along.  Any question that needed to be asked it was easy to ask.
good,"This job was a fulfilling stepping stone while I was in college to gain experience in management, as well as time management within school and work environment. It isn't a job I would want to work for the rest of my life, but it is a good job that pays the bills and allows you to advance in a company."
good,Great for improving customer service skills. Fellow associates were kind and professional. The culture was relaxed and fun but professional. Employees did everything possible to meet and exceed customer service expectations.
good,"The time I spent working was good and productive, but the duties were simple and I did not learn a ton. I learned how to develop my sales skills, but I would have liked to expand upon my skills in different areas."
good,"A typical day at work would be mostly on the floor managing merchandise and helping customers. This gave ample opportunities to learn about different kinds of merchandise as well as get to know different people."
good,"Entrepreneurial culture"
good,As a retail manager it is  tough to have a work/life balance.  On the flip side the company is driven to grow and strives to promote their associates from within.  I have been with this company since 2009 when they purchased my previous employer.
good,My time at Dick's has helped develop my sales skills as well as my ability to communicate effectively with others. The only downside about working here is the holidays can be a little ridiculous and it is difficult to get time off for real life.
good,Good pay and benefits.  There are great amenities at the corporate office.  Good work/life balance.  Many other great perks working for Dick's Sporting Goods.
good,"I loved this job most days, but like any job you are going to have days where you just don't like your job. They keep this job fun, with all of the different customers you have to interact with, to the things you have to accomplish daily."
good,"It is a place that is good job to gather experience about the retail side of sports. Hardest part of the job is the repetitive nature of the job. The most enjoyable is interacting with a large number of people a day. I have learned how to be more personal and how to supervise a large number of people. I enjoy my coworkers, but i do have some qualms with my managers based on their lack of effort on a day to day basis."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Fun workplace environment. Lots of beneficial training for current and new employees. Easy to move up in the company. Management was good as well. Flexible schedules
good,Dick's Sporting Goods is a nice place to work.  The management and company culture facilitate a good work environment which ultimately helps you serve customers better.  Scheduling can be difficult at times but that is to expect with any retail position.
good,"Dicks sporting Goods prepared me for just about anything that could be thrown at me. It was fast paced, and constantly kept you on your toes. You had to put in the time in order to be successful, as they require a lot of changes, updates and constant pressure to hit goals of all kinds. I would recommend Dick's Sporting Goods because they do care about their employees and are willing to make big changes in order to not become stale in the marketplace."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a great store to work at when it is not a crazy holiday season. During the winter months, often times we, newer employees, were left to figure things out by ourselves. But the management was nice and usually very helpful."
good,Management was excellent and created a fun working environment. I was provided pizza on Black Friday during break for having longer hours than normal due to the holiday.
good,Worked at my local mall which had a TON of foot traffic and was a great place to work while in school. The days I worked consisted of helping parents finding suitable equipment for their children and themselves. Managers were great to work with.
good,"I learned other aspects of Hr such as recruiting and information systems."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a great place to work overall, but their management could use some work.  I often felt like the store associates' and leads' voices were not heard as far as ways to improve associate-customer relations.  They are also very inconsistent when it comes to moving up with the company."
good,Good management that cares how the store operates. Long shifts but keeping busy doing many tasks throughout the work day. Learned good customer service skills and learn about all departments of store
good,Fun work environment. Coworkers are very nice and easy to get along with. Great job for you if you don't mind standing for extended periods of time. Would recommend!
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is interacting with the customers. I enjoy talking with the customers as well as lending a helping hand. Helping customers in anyway i can is the best part of my job.
good,I worked in the golf department so I got to work with the section of sports I loved the most. It was a pretty easy job because I got to watch people test clubs and the only time I was busy was during the Spring and Summer when clubs became important
good,Dick's has a steady work environment that is fast paced. If you are looking to advance within a company that is stable then this is the place to be. In-house promotions are available and the tools to succeed are provided. Great benefits packages with 401K as well. They also have events for associates to enjoy being apart of the DSG Team.
good,"I enjoy working here, the fast pace work environment makes days go faster. My co workers are friendly and willing to switch shifts if necessary. However the management here is not the best and they offer little job advancement."
good,"Fun place to work, very easy to work around a school schedule. Management can be very helpful and teaches you new and creative ways to work through your tasks."
good,Good place to work if you are 18 or older and in need of a part time. They work around all schedules and make every day a fun experience for each of its employees
good,Its a good place to work while in school or for some extra cash. They provide good employee benefits and flexible scheduling as well as the ability to cross train if you need more hours.
good,Retail can be a lot of fun and very stressful at time. Enjoyed my experience there and created great relationships. I wouldn't say retail is the field I belong in but it was definitely a learning experience.
good,"i liked the management i worked with. they made me feel appreciated for my heard work. i have worked for other companies that did not knowledge anything i did, so it was refreshing to have management who appreciated their employees."
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods is a fun place to work and has many different personalities. The environment is organized and layed-back.  It is a low stress job, and applying for 1 position does not limit you, you are allowed to work other departments for experience and learning."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I love working here, there are many different potions and jobs to do in the store. I learn so much and they are very good about cross training their employees. I havnt had one problem with any of my coworkers, everyone gets along fairly well. I like the age differences between all of us. I work with 70 year olds, 18 year olds and everything in between."
good,It was easy going and a steady work environment. The management had the employees in mind. All of my co-workers were friendly and helped each other achieve a common goal.
good,"A fun job for a shoe guy. Working in footwear, I provided information about different shoe types, different styles, and could make recommendations when applicable. Management could have treated all employees better, as HR was there quite often."
good,What i have learned is how to bond with your managers and leads on the outside of work while keeping a healthy style in work. Overall working at dick's was a great option.
good,Typical day is dealing with customers and making sure everything runs smoothly. Coworkers are good but a few prefer not to do what they were hired for. Management can be laid back and most of the time its good but sometimes it means things don't get done.
good,Staff was polite.  I enjoyed working with my staff who were flexible and knowledgeable. Management was not always the nicest.
good,i do enjoy this job but they just dnot offer enough hours for someone to pay bills. You almost have to have a second job so that you can pay bills. other than that the people are friendly and the managers are pretty cool.
good,"A typical day is pretty relaxed if you work smarter, not harder. You learn a lot about other people, most customers.The management stays on top of things and is usually understandable. The hardest part of the job is to not spend all day sharing your passion for the same sport the customer has. The most enjoyable part of my job is the ports environment you're surrounded by."
good,"A good place to get some solid experience in retail and customer service. It's a big store so you'll meet all kinds of people from everywhere. The pay is good with the promise of benefits and promotion if you stick long enough. Expect your day to be busy, you'll have no time to rest or slack off. Co-workers are all cool and for the most part will support you, the management is great and understanding. It's a job that will challenge you, and might not always be fun but guess what? beggars can't be choosers."
good,Working at Dicks you interact with many customers and with other employees. The atmosphere is not stressful except for holiday seasons.
good,I would say the hardest part of working at Dicks Sporting Goods is payroll restraints at certain time of the year. This makes it difficult to balance training and expectations set forth by the company. Although I think this was a hard part it is expected when you are a retail manager. If your positive and have a good outlook on a day to day basis you can accomplish anything.
good,"Typically, you go into work and make sure everything is set up and ready to go. Ringing customers up in a timely fashion especially if there is a line. We always like to get the customers through the line as fast as possible. There are always some problems with coupons, but we normally just take care of the customer to ensure their happiness. Management is very nice and will always help you out if you need it. They will always have your back if there is a problem with a customer. I have met so many new friends and people that I can rely on at work. The co-workers are absolutely wonderful and will never not help you out in any way. The hardest part of this job is just having to deal with certain customers that like to cause problems and yell because pricing is wrong or something was in the wrong spot and still trying to keep a smile on your face. The most enjoyable part of the job is just being able to be in a fun environment where everyone enjoys each others company and is willing to help everyone else out."
good,"Friendly fast pace work environment, with friendly employees. Learned that, Dick's Sporting Good's has one of the highest turn overs for employees in retail. They have a no tolerance policy for being late. If you are late 3 times you are terminated. I on the other hand was never late once, in the entire time I worked there. I have excellent attendance. If you are on looking for a place to work where its slow and there's nothing to do, this is NOT the place for you. There is always something to do at dicks sporting goods. If you don't think there is something to do, you're wrong, and someone will find something for you to do. TRUST ME. Must be able to stand on feet for 8-14 hours a day without any problems. Customer service is basically what your dishing out 24/7. You are signing up to work retail. Live it, Love it, or Don't Apply. That's Dicks. :)"
good,"I swiped in, grabbed ear piece and went to footwear floor.  Checked for new signage to be displayed, or if new promotionals to be set up.  Walked to be sure display shoes, boxes and accessories were proper regulation and looked presentable.  Stayed moving to ensure customers were attended to.  Helped with advisement on shoes according to what they needed them for (walking, daywear, running, marathon, cleats, etc) Grabbed shoes from stock room and directed sales to front, unless shipment orders needed to be made.  I would check local stores if we were out of stock and order online, on the spot and print receipt.  I would answer phone and do the same for other stores to check if we had shoes for their customers as well."
good,"Good place to work and get started in customer service and sales. I enjoy working there, but I am looking to further my skills in a higher level position."
good,"My experience has been up-and-down mainly based on management. Having a store manager who values their employees creates a great work environment. Unfortunately in retail, there is so much turnover that your likely to experience some awful managers as well"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Fun and decent company to work for. Just dont see it as a life time goal for me. I just feel they pay the workers a little bit lower then most deserve, and the schedule is not advanced enough for the workers."
good,fun place to work management is ok could be better the pay was good and the staff was friendly. I enjoyed working there and they were pretty flexible.
good,"Great place to work.  I enjoyed going into work every day and interacting with the customers and fellow employees. Sometimes scheduling was a little rough. Not enough employees to cover breaks and although my title wasn't cashier, I was ringing customers up the majority of my shift. Management needed work, but while I was there, they were going through a whole new transition which is totally expected, Over all, I thought it was a fun place to work."
good,Though we often had bad management and some less than desirable associates the good ones bonded together to work through challenge and change.
good,"My job at Dicks Sporting Goods is very fun, I am just looking for new opportunities.  During my work days all employees join for a morning huddle and we start our day as a team, the management is very organized recently and improving very much.  My co-workers are very lively to work with and make work days go very quickly."
good,Learned how to work well with others in a high paced environment.  A typical work day included keeping area clean and safe as well as assisting customers with my knowledge of items.
good,a fairly laid back job with good coworkers with little workplace drama. most days you just help customers with the occasional project. the hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers. management is good and they will try and help you succeed.
good,"very customer focused driven company"
good,management is terrible but other than that you will love working here. it is a super fun place to work and mostly all customers are super friendly and love messing around with the cashiers.
good,"Everyday was a different day.  As a front lead we assisted guests; handled large amounts of money; and kept the front of the store up to par.  When guests who had complaints came into the store, what the cashier could not explain or do for the guest, the front lead would step in and assist.  "
good,"Just as in so many other retail organizations, the typical day at work is never typical. Always an opportunity to learn something new, and always something atypical occurring. The associates here are passionate about their sports, so wonderful to hear them helping and encouraging those who may be starting out in that particular sport. Seems to be a disconnect between upper senior management and store level."
good,"Everyone at Dick's really feels a very extraordinary sense of pride to work for the company, and it's an incredibly cool sense of camaraderie."
good,"•Interacting with customers and ensuring the best possible experience. "
good,Was hired to work in the operations department. There aren't many hours and really don't give you an opportunity to cross train into other areas.
good,"Dicks thrives to provide a safe work environment. There is a lot of opportunity to cross train, however little room to advance."
good,great place for a student to work.  Mostly part time positions with lower pay. Laid back relaxed environment
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,an equal opportunity employer. Provides all the benefits to their employees.
good,I loved the people that I worked with. Although this company may receive some low reviews every now and again I truly appreciate that they were willing to work with my college class schedule. This is your average retail job but I learned a lot in the three years that I was there about management and how a business must operate in order to be successful. I was at the mall of Georgia location and I saw a lot of people come and go but the atmosphere was wonderful for me. I got to meet and talk to people all day long. I may not have been compensated for going above and beyond what was required of me but I was never reprimanded for it. So I was able to use my creativity and knowledge to grow my understanding of business and competition.
good,"Excellent place to work, management cares about the staff and clients."
good,"While working for Dicks Sporting Goods, was a fast and fun culture. Advancement with the company is there but limited, and the pay is average."
good,"I enjoyed everyday of working at Dick's Sporting Goods. Along with advancement within the company, my managers also cared about my well being. I considered everyone I worked with a friend and would highly recommend anyone who loves sports to work here."
good,"Keeping a clean and high paced work day was a must."
good,"easy place to work, fun environment, laid back approach and you get to educate the customer"
good,the work was steady for the most part sometimes the work load was irregular in regards to the amount of freight you might get one day versus the next. People I worked with were usually old and cool down to earth management was sometimes uncaring of personal situations and took personal problems with people that didn't relate to work.
good,"A typical day at work consists of unloading a truck full of merchandise and sorting it onto separate pallets, after that we censored all product that need to be censored and properly stock the merchandise on the shelf's. When all the product is stocked we are to help with any extra tasks assigned by the manager such as sweeping, vacuuming, cleaning bathrooms, mopping floors, etc. At Dicks sporting goods I learned how to work as a team and be flexible. My co-workers where all down to earth and very relatable and in turn that made them easy to communicate with. This job was not difficult for me to handle. I enjoyed this job."
good,Very structured work environment with constantly updated goals and objectives to achieve.
good,"I love the job and learned the most about management at that time. I drove sales, credits while maintaing a high level of customer service for our customers. I was responsible for the operations of the store and also the merchandising. We were the main Hr representatives in the store. I was also the shrink coach for the store. Had to write the shrink plan for the store and ensure that it was followed."
good,"I would work either mornings, evenings, weekends and holidays.  I would process and merchandise the product on the floor.  There were planagrams to follow.  Product needed to be folded everyday and straighten.   Helpings customers everyday with their purchase and adding on to what they needed for sports or workout/fitness.  I had to sensor the product and make sure they had price tags and were on correct hangers with right size rings.  The mannequins had to be dressed accordingly to the pad that they were sitting on or near.  Management was laid back, you had guidelines from day one to follow, so if you followed them management would not be a problem towards you.  I got along with all my co-workers.  The ages ranged from 18-65.  The hardest part of the job is when you would have a customer with a chip on the shoulder or theft in the store.  But I still enjoyed working there."
good,"As a CSS for Dicks Sporting Goods, your day starts a little before the rest of the staff with the exception to the opening manager and the OPS team. First thing you do is the morning deposit and audit the paperwork from the day before, then you prepare the tills for the day. After all the tills are prepared and in the registers, the front end needs to be stocked and all excess clutter and returns need to be put away. Once the store is open, depending upon how many cashiers are on shift the CSS will either be on a register until a cashier comes in, or will be around the store helping other associates as well as keeping an eye on the front end. CSS' are responsible for authorizing register errors, verifying employee purchases, and covering associates breaks. Through out the day we have several shift changes and it is the CSS' job to make the front ends shift changes go as smoothly as possible. The CSS receives all incoming mail and shipments, and delivers them to where they need to be throughout the store. At the end of the day, it is the CSS' responsibility to count down all open tills, do the cashiers paperwork and have it signed as well as prepare the cash office for the opening CSS the next day. Also they make the sure the closing cashiers cleaned up the front end and restocked everything for the opening cashiers.  The hardest part of being a CSS is dealing with customers who are frustrated with company policies as far as returns, stock availability, and sales limitations. The best part about being a member of the Dicks Sporting Goods team is essentially being a member of"
good,"For retail this place is pretty good. Great group of people, awesome training, along with job advancement. The only downside is the pay and hours."
good,"At typical day at work would include: getting customers, keeping store clean, cleaning fitting rooms, processing returns and putting back on sales floor, do store-to-store transfers, put out the new clothes, wall/floor displays and layout, and occasionally cashier. I learned to always maintain a positive attitude in all situations because sometimes you get overwhelmed. The managers are all very helpful and do their job great. The hardest part of the job is making the store and recover is excellent and putting back all the fitting room clothes and returns. The more enjoyable part of this job is working with the other employees in which we all work as a team. I really enjoy working with most people there and also made a lot of good friends."
good,"I love working here, I love who I work with and everyone who works there is an athlete. Most of my managers are amazing and as nice as can be. However, our store tends to be a little unorganized and just needs a lot of work, the customers sometimes,  tend to be moody, and rude, so being able to hold your own is a must when working here!"
good,Every day was different. Most satisfying part of the job was being able to help customers find what they needed. I was able to make a difference in the appearance of the store by using my merchandising abilities.
good,Working at dick's sporting goods was good. It was easy work.
good,"i loved working for dicks sporting goods, it was a fun place to work. management was great and everyone i worked with was a hard worker."

good,If you love sports you will love working at Dick's. The environment can be demanding and fast paced at times. Most employees are required to know/cover multiple departments. The managers are all very nice and knowledgeable and co-workers are AMAZING!! The company places a high regard on its customers and most leave satisfied. 
good,"When beginning at Dicks Sporting Goods my skills and knowledge were minimal, compared to how much they've grown and evolved in the last 4 years. My experience there taught me a lot about the retail life and life itself. Mostly I learned that it is possible to adapt to any type of situation and utilize the skills I have or challenge myself to learn something new. "
good,The average day of Dick's Sporting Goods is consisted of working with customers and doing projects. I learned more of the Logistics systems and distribution. I respected and liked everybody who worked there. Some people i wasn't fond of but that didn't bother me. The hardest part of the job is trying to fulfill every customers requests. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with others.
good,"I start my day at work by making sure there is no new bikes to build and get ready to sale. The next step is to fix any bikes, order any parts I need for the bike. I also help costumer in fitness, baseball, basketball, football, and boxing. By the end of the day I make sure my department is cleaned for in the morning."
good,"At Dick's Sporting Goods, the sales floor is where the ""action"" happens. My job was the sales floor position in the team sports section which included sports such as, football, baseball, hockey, tennis, basketball, soccer, and just about any other team sport you can think of. My priority was to sell the equipment in this area of the store and also guide customers to the area they might be looking for.  Whenever I closed the store, we would take inventory of the expensive items (usually contains the ink/alarm pin) to see how many we sold that day and make sure we weren't missing any. Opening the store, I would check the inventory from the previous night just to double check their records. Management was always helpful with any troubles I may come across such as a disrespectful customer or helping me find or locate and item the customer was asking for. My co-workers were all very friendly, helpful people. The hardest part of the job was trying to persuade a customer to buy a piece of equipment. That being said, the most enjoyable part of the job is when I was able to sell an expensive item."
good,Operated reach trucks filling orders for outbound loads. Line picked products to and from conveyor systems.

The management was very serious about the work they expected from their employees, but were also very personable. The fellow workers were wonderful and driven."

good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Good solid store and work environment. The management can sometimes seems a bit strict but if you put in the work they will see that and will reward you for it! They love to crosstrain employees so you can know how to do a lot in the store and feel comfortable with lots of tasks.
good,The people and the effort this company puts in its outstanding. Weather it’s preparation or customer satisfaction they are always on the top of there game. Footwear manager could b a little nicer and more welcoming but otherwise excellent
good,Not a bad job if you are just starting out. The hours are not a lot but if they like you then they increase. Hard work does get notice their. A lot of fun if you know anything about some of the departments.
good,"semi fast  paced  work environment/ easy work , people were nice to work with, clean job ,never got dirty  never bored at my job, but their was a tremendous amount of walking every day .On average I walked  3 to 5 miles so make sure you wear good supportive shoes"
good,Dicks’ Sporting Goods is a very fun and friendly place to work. They care about making every associate comfortable in the environment and is able to do their job to the best of their ability.
good,Very good company to work for. The company is growing and the executives understands the consumer and the direction the consumer is headed.They are very in tune with changing operationally to run more efficient as a company. They know how to make money.
good,"The management is super encouraging and is relatively flexible with availability, however you have to be able to work weekends. As a footwear associate, a typical day includes straightening the shelves, assisting customers with size and style selection, and also making recommendations."
good,"Dick's in my opinion is a good place to work if you like the retail setting and you have a passion for sports/the outdoors. In my experience, the people I worked with were always great and the management was very down to Earth."
good,Dicks Sporting Goods was a good place to work. They offer many opportunities for advancement. I learned how to redesign apparel departments when new merchandise arrived. Enjoyed working here.
good,Coming to work everyday always put a smile on my face. Great staff of helpful and friendly people. They're Family oriented and bring changes to the community. Good pay rate.
good,Working at Dick's Sporting Goods is a unique environment.  You're able to meet and greet a variety of individuals on a daily basis that become family.
good,"They take time out of their schedules to ensure that you are getting the training you need. Not only do they train you in your own department, but they also train you in others to help you get a better understanding of the whole store"
good,Management team was very strong. Thorough training. Staff was friendly and welcoming. The pay was good. Overall a great experience working there. I was sad to leave.
good,great place to work if you have a passion for sports and helping customers. the only real problem with working here is a lot of drama is created between co workers.
good,Dicks is a fast paced job that takes energy and patience. It only takes a few days of training to learn your job which is great because it takes less of a toll on you.
good,"Responsible for overseeing what product comes into the store and, helping customers find the right apparel for the sports that they are joining and offering "
good,"hands on training was a little lacking, it was gone over quickly and then left alone in department.  fellow associates have been helpful in answering questions.  But overall pleased but hand on training needs improvement."
good,"It was a good environment to work in.  Management was pretty good for the most part.  I wanted to work more but instead of giving me more hours, I got my hours due to a problem caused by the scheduling manager."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"The Customer Service Specialist position was the first job I had after graduating from college. As a lead on the floor and at the register, my duty was to provide excellent customer service to our shopper and maintain cleanliness throughout the store. The work environment was always positive. The hardest part was performing our duties during the holidays with the increase in customers."
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is a very fun place to work at. This is by far my favorite job because everything is so relaxed. there is no uniforms we have to follow and the associates and management are all cool to work with. I'm looking to grow in a company and it has no opportunity to grow for me.
good,The company had its interest in helping me climb the ladder. However the new manager had gotten incredibly angry with me and attempted to fight me. I left because of that. He was terminated shortly afterwards.
good,"Very interesting place to work. It is a great place to work as an introductory to retail because you will be taught and experience many things. A typical day at work is busy, there is never not something to do. As a cashier, you are required to keep your work station clean and organized while assisting customers with transactions, questions and needs. You typically work a 6-8 hour day with two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. I've learned a lot from working here. This includes inventory, how to fold shirts properly, how to operate different technology platforms and plenty of merchandise knowledge. They will train you thoroughly on everything you need to know about your department, the store and most importantly, customer service. Management at this location, is mostly amazing. We have multiple managers who are on top of their jobs but are also personable and reliable. The hardest part about this job are the customers and the hours. The best part of the job is the working environment because your teammates become family. We all work together to get things done."
good,"It was a great place to work if you love sports and anything athletic. Got 25% off on everything in the store, so it was basically buy one get one half off on everything, which was nice. It was slow on some days but the busy days definitely flew by. Once you are there for a little while they will start to teach you other departments. Within 6 months i knew how to operate every department in the store, gaining me more hours and more knowledge which was very nice to have."
good,"Working as a retail associate for Dick's Sporting Goods was another excellent position for a young college student like I was at the time. Fun working environment, great work life balance, & flexible scheduling. I didn't experience much opportunity for advancement during my time there, which is ultimately why I went elsewhere."
good,"The pace depends on the day and time of year so there are days that aren't very productive. It is a very hands on job and you learn consistently about products. It's an easy job, but it can be fun and the management in my particular store has always been phenomenal."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dicks sporting Goods, the people i worked with were friendly and the management was fun to work with as well. The culture around the workplace was fun and there were in store employee competitions to keep employees motivated"
good,"As employees at Dicks we got all our work done in a mannerly time, having fun doing it along the way. Management were very much like parents, there for structure, tough when need be, but glad to be there non the less."
good,The team members collaborated daily to meet goals and perform tasks. We were always competing with other stores' sales numbers. I learned the value of teamwork in a workplace. The operations manager was a bit unprofessional/rude but not unapproachable. Everyone helped each other out and stayed positive through the shift. Operations team stayed active by lifting many heavy objects every day.
good,Quality customer service is at the forefront of the employees in the store and creating an inviting shopping experience for the customer. It is fulfilling to see a happy customer walk out the store!
good,"Fast pace and involved with everything going on with customers, employees, and corporate.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting with customers that share the same passion that I do."
good,"Company is very good for working with people flexibility. You have to be willing to work. If you're lazy and you are not a good team player, your hours will suck"
good,"In a typical day at Dick's Sporting Goods I would arrive, clock-in, and head to the golf section of the store.  I would then begin re-stocking shelves in preparation for the guests throughout the day."
good,"Excellent example of a Specialty Big Box Retail Company. Dicks is the leader in the Industry for Sports related gear, clothing and equipment, and they prove that every day."
good,"It was a very relaxed place to work, my coworkers were all great.  Learned a lot of interpersonal skills while employed there. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great job with great perks and a chance to advance."
good,The hours are extremely flexible and the managers are willing to work around almost any schedule. Both the managers and co-workers always have an upbeat attitude and are happy to help the customers as well as each other.
good,"Depending on the department you are you, your work day is based off what is needed that day. You learn what is needed for your department and at times what is needed elsewhere in the store. Management are good at working with any school schedule you may have. The hardest part of the job is sometimes helping customers that are unsure of what they want. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great people."
good,Great place to work if you can handle the newly changing politics of the market lobby. It makes no sense to me or others that a company can actively sell firearms and place stipulations up the sale that alienates the base that has made the company great.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical day at Dicks Sporting goods would include me getting there at 9 am, unpacking the goods onto the shelves before it gets busy while still assisting customers. Then I would clean my area and assist customers and hopefully get them to fill out a survey regarding my performance. "
good,Met some cool people while working for Dick's Sporting Goods. I would recommend this company for others as there is a huge opportunity for career growth and potential
good,more a place for teens to earn some cash or if you have a low cost place of living. good place not hard to get down and learn the lay of. everyone is pretty easy going
good,"From general fitness to sport specific fitness, DSG had most of what you would need for striving to be the best in whatever sport or fitness category you are interested in. If you want to learn more about a certain sport or area of fitness this is a great place to grow and learn."
good,"Managers are laid back and fun, but also know when to be serious.  The people I worked with made me not dread having to work every day.  Willing to move people up within the company if you show some effort. Great flexibility, and would be an awesome part-time job for kids in high school or college.  Company is pretty stingy with over-time and people labeled as ""full-time"" employees because of benefits.  Their transfer policy is completely laid back.  Don't need to work at your location for any certain about of time to transfer, and the transfer part is so easy.  You won't have to lift a finger."
good,"Not a bad place to wrok, people are fun and interesting.  Nobody steals anyone stuff in the break room.  The managers are all pretty nice and so far I like it."
good,"I worked as a lodge associate for about 6 months. Overall the environment was great, management was awesome, co-workers helpful and friendly, and the job was easy to learn. That being said, it is still retail, expect long hours especially if you close, expect difficult customers every now and then, and expect to be working in a fast paced and extremely busy environment. I enjoyed the job but the pay wasn't great at 9.75/hr. and its hard to make ends meet when you combine that wage with the fact they will only hire you on part time unless you are a manager type."
good,"The management did what they had to do, but it was the team of associates that made Dick's Sporting Goods a place I wanted to work. The teamwork from most the associates created an environment favorable for any management team."
good,Through working with the customers you are able to make friendships with your coworkers. I've made some very close friends at Dicks Sporting Goods. It can be a chaotic time during events/holidays but it is a great place to work.
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods was a temporary job that I required while in school. A normal day of work was fairly laid back. The typical work day consisted mostly of interacting with customers and organizing/stocking different departments around the store. The management at the work place was very easy to talk with. They were always polite and flexible. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance my normal 20 hour week while still attending school but, it was enjoyable to work with most of the staff members during my shifts."
good,"Fast paced, friendly environment. Management is great and the discounts are awesome. Many different departments for everyone to work at so whatever fits your style best."
good,"This was my job when I was working through college. I worked the receiving department. I arrived at 6am, unloaded trucks and packed out freight until 2pm. IT allowed me to pay my bills and go to school at night. I met some really good people there that I am still friends with to this day."
good,"Maintain your department is a big role, constantly cleaning, stocking and pricing products. The second biggest role was interacting with every guest and providing the best customer service possible to help the find what they are looking for. We worked as a team so often times I would work two or three departments during my shift as well as working the cash register."
good,This place is a fun place to work especially if you're into the outdoors and sports. For a kid who grew up playing sports and hunting I really enjoyed my time working at Dick's.
good,I have only been at Dick's for a few weeks. The work is easy although the selection is limited. Management is easy to work for and respect the employees and there is a family and friendly culture. if you enjoy working with the public this is the place to do it.
good,"I started working there my freshman year of college as part time. It’s a great job to have to help balance out responsibilities like school, phone bill, and gas to get around. Management is understand and flexible when it comes to making the schedule. Work environment is fast, and there’s great people to work with."
good,this is a fun place to work for any sports enthusiast. If you are passionate about sports the management will work with you to insure that you are working in the area of your expertise. Management is fair and the benefits are good.
good,"The work was fast paced and busy, but at the same time everybody got along with each other. I was always smiling as were my fellow workers. We are all close knit like a family."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,I enjoyed working here the management was very friendly and caring I enjoyed working with people and it was hard sometimes being on my feet  for long periods of time but it was a very high energy enjoyable environment to be in
good,"The Champaign store was great, well run, great environment, very understanding managers.  The Bloomington store is the worst store I've ever been a part of.  The managers are incompetent and the store is in total chaos."
good,"The staff was wonderful and always will to help. I enjoyed working with most of the people. One of the managers was always rude. Overall, it was a great place to work."
good,Great managers who will work with you at all cost. Always willing to let you try different things and a huge opportunity to improve your human communication skills.
good,"Although there were a lot of sales each workday and excellent customer service, the management team behind the scenes is not always on the same page. There are multiple managers and sometimes can create conflicts between Operations manager, Store manager, etc."
good,"Fun place to work  nice people good work team good benefits work your way up in the company really fast, people are full of love and fun. Management is good leaders."
good,Worked here while in college. As long as you stay busy you should get along with management. I worked in the backroom unloading trucks and doing store processes. Early mornings but definitely the best position in the store in order to stay busy and make the time go by fast.
good,"all around great place to work. from the co workers to managers and guest you feel safe and comfortable. you get to see new things, learn new things and grow"
good,"Fun place to work, but work life balance is very difficult. If you are willing to relocate, then you can advance your career very quickly. Overall, this is a good retail company to work for."
good,Managers treated me with the most respect as well as other employees. I will be working for dicks again in the near future. I would recommend this job to a lot of people.
good,"I worked as a Team Sports member and was cross trained in other departments. At my location hours are available to those who work hard. The job itself isn't hard, but again it is retail and sometimes the job sucks. Lots of merchandising and cleaning throughout the day but again that's retail. Pay is a bit more than minimum wage but enough. No real benefits for Part-Timers, and most people besides management are part-time. Very Flexible with school and allow you to work anywhere between 15-32 hours a week. Very understanding about you having a life outside of work. Yet sometimes management can be a bit unrealistic with projects when you are the only one in the department. You only get a 25% discount off of the Original MSRP, customers at times get better deals, on golf clubs and big ticket items it can be up to 10% on certain things you get nothing off. If you Love Sports this is a great place to work and makes the job easier."
good,"I was a cashier and overall it was an easy job and the pay was decent. It is a good part time job to have. You help customers find what they need, sign them up for scorecards, answer any questions they may have, and provide a fast and friendly checkout."
good,"Lots of customer interaction. Lots of opportunity to develop sales and customer service skills. Product knowledge is KEY. The more you info, pros cons, advantages and benefits, options you can tell a customer about a product the more success you'll have and the more satisfied they will be. An informed customer=makes the correct and appropriate purchase=satisfied=more sales $$$, more commission, sales goals met, promotions, raises, SUCCESS. If you're a passionate athlete with gear knowledge, experience in a common sport, and a caring attitude to ensure beginner-advanced athletes are prepared, protected, and correctly equipped to succeed and excel than this is an awesome job for you. Definitely need to think and react on the fly, be confident in your knowledge and experience, and be friendly and helpful. While i was employed at Dicks I didn't see a whole whole lot of advancement or promotion so I think it might be difficult to advance past the sales floor without having years with the company. But its really fun, you meet a lot of cool people, get cool rewards, perks, benefits, and the management is encouraging, motivating, helpful, and consistent. I mean, what's not to love?? You get to talk about sports all day!"
good,"A typical day at Dicks sporting goods is offering great customer service to customers, and having fun with team members. Management is good. Hardest thing about work is nothing I cant handle."
good,During the week it's pretty slow unless it's summer time. Weekends are pretty busy since there are sport games in the area on the weekends so parents or athletes come in to buy equipment. Overall a good place to work at.
good,"Fun environment but very stressful without proper management. I had a great time overall but, felt like our leads where not supported how they should have been."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company but found that their pay was low and opportunity to move up was far and few between. They were unwilling to allow you to transfer to other stores in order to pursue a career with them. They did allow you to work closely with customers and really make that connection, but staffing was often an issue. When fully staffed, it was great but due to constant budget cuts it was difficult to stay fully staffed which meant too much pressure elsewhere and good customer connections were hard to make due to too much workload."
good,"A typical day as an apparel associate includes may different tasks. "
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Dicks was a fun place to work, I love to golf and being around it was nice.  The people I worked with were friendly and I enjoyed it for what it was, pay wasn't great but it's just a retail job so can't expect too much."
good,"I was an order specialist for adecco. My job description was to send out spare parts & missing parts. In addition, i had to place orders for customers and also assist with account issues."
good,"I do not have a comment regarding this company, I would just like to apply for a job.  This was a part-time job that I needed.  Do not know what this has to do with applying."
good,Everyday is a fire drill and have to always be on your toes. Some days are easier then others. Always a training moment and always learning something new everyday.
good,"An average work day would consist of helping customers with their choice of proper footwear and footwear accessories for the sport or activity that they will be participating in."
good,"-easy work day"
good,"Working here is something different every day. it is great getting to sell a child their first bat, or glove. Seeing the joy they get when they are just starting a sport for the first time."
good,Management is very flexible with everyone's schedules outside of work.  Employee's have fun while diligently working. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers but we do everything we can to make sure we make them satisfied with our company by the time they walk out of the doors.
good,If you like sports it is a great place to work. The discounts are good for employees. Flexible work schedule is good for young people that would like to enjoy life.
good,Bikes and fitness full-time  laid back sales environment no pressure to sell more personally. Team oriented and people would help if you ask. Chill place to work as a bike tech if you are young and can do basic repairs on bikes. Also spent some time in hunting i think the job will be better if you know(Play/Do) what sport your talking about or selling
good,the co workers was so amazing glad i had the privlege to work with some. typical day at the job was fun times with female co workers
good,I worked in the hardest/busiest area in the store. I dealt with a lot of customers on a daily basis and learned a lot about great customer service. Great discount/opportunities as an employee.
good,"At the store that I work at, the managers are extremely friendly and always appreciate what you do to help the store out. They want you to have fun as long as you get your work done. I have learned so much working at this store just from management. My co-workers and I are extremely close and we are practically family. The hardest part of the job is associating with the customers most of the time because they can be a hassle with certain things they are looking for. I enjoy working with my co-workers and managers the most. They are the ones who get me to come into work everyday. If they weren't the way they were then I wouldn't want to work there."
good,"Retail work"
good,"Typical retail structure, the managers make or break the workplace.  Great job for a college student as the hours are extremely flexible and the managers are accommodating to class schedules.  The people are fantastic with the only downside being unrealistic customers."
good,"Nicke place to work. Besides the tons of people that walk into the store and steal, it is a sad thing to see. But overall I love working here, and will work here part time for a while."
good,Very good place to work for younger people. If you have product knowledge of any of the items they sell they train you to learn more and excel. Plus management are usually friendly.
good,"Dicks was fun to work at, the customer base was easy going, the managers were relaxed, and everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs. Sometimes shipment can be a little overbearing, and the amount of signs that had to be put up per week were overboard. The best part of the job was the firearm sales. Engaging with the customer about something that interests you is always a great time. Employees there were fun to talk to and you make a lot of friends there."
good,"On a daily basis, everyone came in and just got straight to work wether it be training or setting up fixtures. Management had no flaws. Very down to earth people. Hardest part was the sorting the amount of supplies you would recieve. Most enjoyable would have to be working with a sport you love."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical work day at Dick's Sporting Goods is no longer than 8 hours, if you are full time. It consists of customer service, merchandising, and team work. I learned a lot about myself and my ability to be a team leader. I also learned a lot about customer needs and customer satisfaction. The revolving door in retail is just that, it keeps turning and co-workers come and go quickly. It can be hard to train continuously and find patience to keep teaching new-hires, but it can also be the most rewarding part of the job. When someone accomplishes something, you can have the satisfaction that you thought them how to do that."
good,If you love sports you'll love working for this company. Management was a little weak but the job was still enjoyable and there was always work to be done or a customer to be helped. I learned a lot in sales at this job and as a young person it helped me create social skills. Co-workers were all enjoyable people. The hardest part about the job was offering credit cards and surveys.
good,"You learn a lot from management and fellow worker."
good,"Employees help each other out when needed. Everyone helps with the phones. It can get pretty busy. In apparel, customers most of the time leave stuff in the fitting rooms. Customers also return things that we have to put back out. On days we have a truck we do our best to put everything out from the truck that day."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods has a very friendly and relaxed working environment. All of the employees show respect for one-another and are able to work together without issues. A typical day (depending on the shift and department) usually entailed unloading the morning truck and restocking the floor before open. It was important to make sure the floor stayed clean and organized and each customer was greeted and assisted. Management was friendly, reasonable, and enjoyable to work with."
good,"A typical day in the Dick's Sporting Goods facility is a lot of maintaining the store to make sure it is clean and presentable to customers. Then, I find other tasks to do, so it gives me a lot of freedom during my shift. I find out what promotions or sales we have going on that day from my managers. I have to have good communication skills, as well as good people skills to be involved with the customers. Having a lot of freedom during my work day means I have to be independent as well. The managers do a great job with helping the workers, including myself, if it is needed. They also continuously check on customers to make sure they are satisfied. The hardest part of the job would have to be checking on inventory and keeping everything up to date. On the other side, my most enjoyable part of working at Dick's Sporting Goods was meeting the people I have met. Whether it is a customer or a co-worker, I have met and interacted with a variety of people who have taught me different ways to interact with different types of people."
good,i loved working at dicks sporting goods in the recieving department but i wish it was a full time job and not seasonal. i also dont like that they pay you the minimum for retail. i worked great ours with overtime. management was good for the most part some things didnt make since because different managers tell you to do different things. great discounts and enviornment to work and make friends
good,"straighten out your area at beginning of every shift, proccess truck weekly."
good,Dick's Sporting goods provided a nice retail work environment. Customer service was the main priority for the company.
good,I was employed at this establishment for over a year. This job required me to be a problem solver in tough situations and settle customer complaints. I was a lead and dealt with large sums of cash and supervised cashiers.
good,"Better than most typical retail jobs."
good,"I worked there for a short time, but I can guarantee that I enjoyed my time there. Very productive and a fun place to be with the customers you run into constantly"
good,"Loved working in all the departments. So much to learn and so much to teach. They really wanted us to demonstrate our products and go out of our way to help people. Setting ads was a bit sluggish. we would constantly replace paper with he same paper with different dates. It could be a bit tedious. Floor sets are fun, new product demo's are always fun. We also had to clean the store ourselves at the end of each night. And I mean bucket and mop and bathrooms. No janitorial service. It really isn't that bad. It was required and we did it."
good,"On a typical work day, I would open up the registers, sensor or de-sensor clothing for apparel. I learned how to sell items like credits cards or warranties. The management was awesome they worked with your schedule if you were in school or had doctors appointments . I loved my co-workers. They always helped me when I was new and still are helping me move up in the company. The hardest art of my job is to have difficult customers who are unhappy but i manage to pull through it with a smile on my face. The most enjoyable part of my job is really helping a customer find what they are looking for or help them with information that they are looking for."
good,"- There was always work to be done so you were never bored."
good,The management was very good at keeping my school schedule in mind when creating the work schedule. I very rarely had a scheduling conflict. There was nothing too hard about the position.
good,"Keep apparel pads clean, process freight, backup cashier, you must have a general idea of what gets security tagged, re-merchandise pads"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"A great company to work for if you're looking for an entry level, first job. They offer great schedules and decent pay, plus they will promote from within if your work ethic is there."
good,"A typical day would include doing returns, transactions, and cash handling in the back office; counting the safe and registers."
good,"Managers often expected their part time student workers to have the same level of dedication to the work place that they did, while this helped provide great customer service it often placed a strain on employees trying to balance school and work."
good,"Varied from store to store.  I worked in two stores and i could see a significant change as to how my responsibilities varied greatly from location.  In the bigger store i was treated more as a regular employee with not as many responsibilities, but when i went to the smaller store i was expected to know how to do a lot more than my prior store.  Also i noticed that the company as a whole likes to look outside for management positions instead of hiring from within."
good,"Pros: working with diversified and interesting clients."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be coming in and either having shipment from the day before, or the shift before me and I'd have to be the one to put it away as well as my own shipment I had to organize for the entire day. Then I would try and talk to as many customers as I could, maybe make a couple of gun sales and go home. The people here are great, I am just not someone who can be inside for that long with so little to do. I didn't feel challenged or like I could do anything wrong, as the tasks to do were such easy ones. I really enjoyed the discounts on fishing equipment, but that's about it."
good,"On a typical day I can be all over the board, we can be calm and steady paced with customers throughout the day. Or we can be exceedingly busy, with many different things happening at once. During the course of the week I am typically managing the entire cashiering and customer service are independently, ranging from regular ringing customer up to running fishing licenses, as well as keeping up with phone calls. I am also responsible for the opening and or closing of store's cash office area, handling deposits, arranging register drawers, filing, inputting info into the computer system. Weekends I generally am still managing front end as well managing other coworkers on front end and customer service in addition to previous stated duties. I've learned a number of different talents and skills anywhere from managing nearly any customer issue, to simple store operations, counting large quantities of money quickly, organization skills, great multitasking ability, management of others, etc. The hardest part of this retail based job is the never consistent job schedule, up and down hours. The most enjoyable part is being able to find out what the customer needs and help them in as many way possible to achieve that."
good,"Great place to work, lots of opportunity to advance within the company. Gained experience with payroll and store budgets and goals. The bad part of the job it was a privately owned company and payroll had its ups and downs and made it very hard to get work done in a timely manner."
good,"The management was great, the workers were awesome, was a very laid back place to work in but we all worked as a team and got the job done. "
good,"A typical day would be to make sure everything in the Footwear Department looked presentable and handle customer service. I learned how to multi-task and to stay professional, even when customers would give me a hard time. Management there was good, I got along with everybody. The co-workers just made showing up to work fun, throughout a typical workday there would always be something to laugh about. The hardest part about leaving was, leaving the people I had known for the time I was there. The most enjoyable part was showing up and doing the job."
good,"Loved it. Decent pay, fast tracked into management when my skills and ambition were recognized. Only quit because I wanted to move back to my home state and there wasn't a DIck's in the region I was moving to."
good,"A typical day started off by counting your money drawer, making sure your work space was in order, and then checking out customers. When the rush would die down the job consisted of teaming up with other department employees, or other employees that were cashiering alongside you, and doing miscellaneous jobs; Hanging up go-backs, putting sensors on things, replenishing the refreshments in the front, ect. I felt that communication with management was off at times, considering that we would have 1-4 managers on duty at a time. Aside from the occasional communication hiccup, I enjoyed the position very much. I have to say my favorite part of it was being able to meet people that made you fall in love with them withing thirty seconds. I met some of the most special and giving people and that job in particular taught me how a simple few kind words can change your day, and how you feel about yourself. Overall it was an extremely rewarding experience and I feel like I learned a lot about myself, as well as interaction in the professional setting."
good,"This was my first place of employment. I was able to learn cash handling skills. There wasn't much training. It's a sink or swim environment, but my coworkers are friendly and made it a comfortable place to be. I eventually promoted to my current position where I spend most of my time doing price audits, price changes, verifying proper signage for our ads, and packing items for shipping. I enjoy the people, but find my job to be monotonous."
good,I was a team lead so everyday that I worked I had to assign duties to the other employees.  I had manager duties and override capabilities.  The management was friendly and available.  Hardest part of the job was not becoming friends with the people that worked under me. Most enjoyable part was being able to dress in athletic wear in a friendly environment.
good,"Typical day at work entitled a few customers we were never really busy except on weekends, I learned a lot about sports and hunting equipment, management was decent, and my co-workers were awesome. The hardest part of the job would be all the pressure on scorecard numbers which was the company's reward card. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be the customers never a dull moment."
good,"know your sports, be knowledgable of the merchandise within the store."
good,"The management here was great, you get to meet lots of new people. It was a very fun environment, and fun place to work."
good,Great company to work for with sporty atmosphere that energizes their employees.
good,"customer service is job one, sales goals are achievable, staff is usually up beat, its great dealing with the general public helping them meet their needs. Direct management is easy to work with and are very helpful. Hardest part of the job is dealing with low hours and wanting to advance with in the company. best part of the job is the customers"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Overall, I enjoy my job. A typical day at my job, I arrive at my store, usually 30 minutes early to get everything I need to start my shift immediately at clock-in time.Then I quickly count the til in my register to ensure accuracy, if there are any discrepancies I bring it to a mangers attention as I cannot begin to ring out customers until my til is correct. Throughout the day I ring out costumers for their purchases quickly and accurately and do so in a friendly, up-beat manner. I remove security sensors only after payment has been accepted, I check all shoes to ensure they are in the correct box, same style number on both shoe, same size, there is a left shoe and a right shoe, and that there is nothing inside the shoe. I enjoy talking to my customers and helping with they're purchases. I like smiling and being friendly. I am quick at finding solutions to issues and not afraid to ask for help when it is needed to ensure customer satisfaction. In between transaction, the front end cashier staff and I are responsible for cleaning; we organize paper work, stock all registers with supplies such as pens, register paper, counterfeit verification pens, stabler and stables, brochures that provide information pertaining to our store's reward card program and our store's credit card, as well as blank reward cards to sign up new customers to our program. When cleaning is done, I help to return items to correct locations throughout the store, help the sales floor staff clean and organize their departments, monitor dressing room flow, and help customers locate product or assist with finding"
good,"A typical day at work is full of energy and customer service, between the customers and your co-workers/management. This job is perfect for any college student looking for anything flexible and fun. I enjoy working for this company and would recommend anyone who is looking for a new start. If you enjoy customer service, and interacting with people and having fun while doing it this is the place to work. Its Young, new and full of energy."
good,"a great environment and great co workers."
good,"I really like the people I work with as well as my managers. The only gripe I have about some of them is the fact that, seeing as how it is an entry level job, there are several people who don't care enough about the work they are doing and only give a 50% effort. This quickly gets frustrating. There is ample advancement opportunity as they typically promote from within. Daily tasks involve a lot of customer service and interaction. I find that part of it very satisfying in most cases. Overall Dick's is a good company, and it has been a pleasure to work for them."
good,"Great place to work, very fun learning environment. Excellent place to share a common love of sports."
good,Great place to work love interacting with associates as well as customers
good,"Enjoyed coming into work everyday. worked there for a few months, and everything was pretty much slow pace. The co workers are very cheerful for the most part, we all bonded in a short period of time. it was very hard leaving them. The best part of the job was playing with the walkie talkies and playing soccer with the children that use to come in."
good,"My typical day would be me, counting the drawers and getting them ready for that day. Making sure if we needed a change order, to get that done, too. I learned to count multiple drawers down, really fast before they opened and after they closed. The Management was pretty nice. I enjoyed the Co-Worker. They could make you laugh if we was having a bad day. The Hardest and the Most Enjoyable part of that job would of been some of the Customers."
good,During my time at Dick's I learned so much about retail and the sporting industry. I worked at the register as well as in all departments as needed.
good,"Developed great interpersonal skills as i worked with customers everyday to meet they're needs and answer any product related questions.  "
good,"My typical day started at 8:45 A.M and ended at 5:45 P.M. this has proven to be a bit different from my 13+ years as a Head Golf Professional, where my day began approximately 7:00 A.M. and ended when it ended."
good,The day goes by at a casual rate. The management is easy to work with yet very proficient. Mostly athletes working there. The hardest part was working with tricky customers. The best part was that it was sports related.
good,"Asked to do multiple things but that's not something I mind.  Overall, not a bad job and easily accessible"
good,"This is a great place to work with a great management team and co workers.  Here is where I really learned to hone my management, organizational, and time management skills."
good,"Busy and exciting work place, constant flow of new customers wanting to purchase sporting goods."
good,"I enjoyed being in retail. I was hired as a cashier but was advanced to become an administrative assistant to a GM and 4 assistant managers. My co-workers were all great, fun, and diverse people. We all brought our passion for sports to the company and because the sport was more like a hobby it made the job easy to help customers find exactly what they needed. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with retail demand and producing the product to the customer from outside vendors or corporiate stores when the product was not available in our home store. I enjoyed sharing my passion of football and fitness to customers as well as helping them at the same time."
good,Dicks sporting goods is a great place to work. Management is fair and not overly strict.  Co-workers are team focused and willing to help at any time.  Hardest part of the job is getting enough hours.
good,"I love working at Dick's Sporting Goods, wouldn't want any other part-time job."
good,The company has a very good benefits package. Chances for advancement are limited. In my opinion there is too much politics involved in getting promoted.
good,"Every time I would work, I would go check in then put my tag on. Usually, the day would start out slow then get really busy and then slow again at night. I would have to fold clothes a lot, do run-back from the changing room to where the clothes were suppose to be located. I would have to greet and help customers find what they need. At night we would straighten up the store and clean. The hardest part was when it was slow, it would be hard to concentrate but the co-workers were definitely the most enjoyable part."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,DSG was a great company to be employed with. Everyone works very hard for the success of the stores.
good,"I will be honest this was my first job out of college and I am ready to move on. The hours and the pay are not sufficient enough to ""support life"" and pay the bills."
good,"my day consisted of customer service and building bikes. I've learned alot while working here. The management is very at team efferts. I liked working with everyone. Lifting was pretty hard but, help poeple find what they needed was great."
good,"As a person that enjoys sports, fitness and the outdoors, Galyan's/Dick's Sporting Goods was a great place to work. In addition to the ability to be surrounded by my hobbies all day, I enjoyed talking to hundreds of people a day. As a front end coordinator I tested my problem solving, organizational and diplomatic skills each day."
good,I liked working in the day time. Management was pretty stern. Co workers were friendly. Most enjoyable part was the discount.
good,"I am an absolute sports fanatic. I could talk all day about what is new in the world of sports, so working at Dick's Sporting Goods was an overall fun experience when the atmosphere revolved around the same subject. I was a temporary employee for the holiday season so I wished to stay longer, but my time there was well worth the process of getting in. The staff was really nice and I was able to work multiple areas including the shoe department, team sports, apparel, outerwear, and kids apparel. It was a great working experience."
good,Management needs to get better. Co-workers are fun to be around. Enjoyable part of the job is helping out the customers.
good,Great environment to learn the retail industry. Advancement opportunities if you are willing to relocate. I developed my management skills here and learned that a manager needs to develop different styles for different locations and staff.
good,Great atmosphere and environment. Co workers and management are great. Good rate of pay. Very little hours and to many broken promises by management
good,"A typical day at work was comming in to fun loving people. Towards the end of the day things get hectic,and people get stressed. We worked very well as a team which benifet the customers a great deal.The worst part of the job were the hours;they were very unpredictable."
good,A wonderful group of people to work with.Always happy & willing to help customers.
good,"I ran the office and reported to the store manager. I was responsible for daily tasks such as; monitoring payroll budget, employee hours, paying store invoices, Human Resources functions: scheduling interviews/interviewing candidates, hiring/terminating when necessary, processing new hire paperwork. I also was responsible for Loss Prevention theft control, employee attendance records, assisting customers when I was on the selling floor, and any unexpected situations that came my way. This job was fast-paced, professional, and a position where I gained trust and respect from all employees. I learned this position was not the same very day and that if I was working on a project I could be pulled off it due to any customer situation that needed my assistance. Management relied on me for many things as I always carried a positive attitude and a can-do attitude. I always looked forward to going to work every day because of the variety of things that I did for this company to run a business successful every day. It was all about establishing a positive experience for our customers so they would want to return to our store to shop so they would continue a relationship with us."
good,"Kept shelves stocked with merchandise and assisted customers with information of products and the sale of products. Having to greet every customer that approached your area of work created great customer service and taking initiative and learning about the products allowed for confidence in the sales process as well as the customer service. Employees enjoyed their job and enjoyed assisting customers with the merchandise. Educating yourself on different merchandise was the most difficult part, but was also the most benefiting. Interacting with a multitude of different people was an enjoyable part of this job."
good,You have to lift heavy things alot and it gets better when you start running a forklift.
good,"A typical day at Sporting Goods consisted of the following Customer Service, answering phones, changing signs, restock merchandise."
good,"I really enjoyed all of my co-workers there. There were some issues with one of the managers there, she was the type who would just fire you instead of talking to you about thing. Also the company did not allot enough hours for good coverage of the store. We were always short staffed, it was very stressful at times."
good,"A typical work day for me usually includes having to manage my own department, along with almost every other department in the store. I manage the apparel section, which comes with having to process and put out the truck, do the mark downs and ad for the week, give excellent customer service, set ""game plans"", and making sure the department is clean and straightened (by size, brand name, and colorized). Along with the duties of my department, I also help on the cash regisiter and also help the footwear department. My managers call me a 'team player' because I normally bounce from department to department all day everyday, all while still maintaining my own responsibilities for my department."
good,Operate register

good,"Working at Dicks Sporting Goods was an excellent job opportunity for someone like myself who loves sports and desired to work in a athletic and team oriented environment. A typical day at work involved helping customers in the footwear section, as well as working as a cashier. I learned how to operate in high stress situations with calmness, and how to multi-task with assigned work. The workplace culture was very team oriented and very much resembled a athletic team. The hardest part of the job was helping multiple customers at once with shoe orders. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is the culture and connecting with my co-workers."
good,I really enjoy working with Dicks sporting goods. They have a good working environment and Management and also treat their workers good.The benefits is better too
good,"I always know when I come to work I can count on the people I work with to get the job done, and help with whatever I may need. Fun environment has made me want to stay with the team I have."
good,Working at DSG was something I truly enjoyed. A lot of the work was easy and management was very good. The work environment was always pleasant and those who cared did a fantastic job. Corporate and management have very different goals and it effects the work relationship of you and your coworkers. Punishing team work. The company would rather you sell a credit card than make the customer leave happy.
good,"Laid back at times, but when needed very rushed. Customer service is priority. Anyone with knowledge of sports will thrive. Easy scheduling for your needs."
good,"A typical day of hard work"
good,"fast paced, fun work enviroment. managers expect a lot but if you can work fast. shouldn't be an issue. Dicks is customer service driven, customers come first no matter what"

good,"Dicks sporting goods has been a good place to work. I started as a part time employee, and quickly was promoted to  a full time position. The schedule can be difficult at times because you work multiple days a week including weekends. Over all the job has been a good one."
good,I enjoyed my time at Dick's Sporting Goods. I was hired as a Customer Service Specialist and was given the opportunity to transfer over to the Golf department and eventually lead the department. I was grateful the company first chose to hire from within as opposed to looking for outside candidates. I would say I left the company at the right time. The top-level management of the company did not seem to priorities their Golf departments too highly. It was extremely difficult to get necessary product in the store. It made the golf department look bare and disappointed customers when we did not have what they were looking for. I would caution future candidates for the position to seriously consider how committed the company is to their Golf departments
good,Great place to work and learn about retail.  I loved my co workers and the management was great too.  Overall was not a very stressful occupation.  Very flexible when it came to weekly hours.

good,"There is always something to do. "
good,Work was always fun there. Everyone gets along well. The job is pretty easy and there's no way to really mess up what is going on there. The only downside is that it can get really slow.
good,"Working ten hour shifts comprised of nothing but tedious physical labor is about as much fun as you'd expect. However, the working conditions were good, the managers down to earth and understanding, and the people friendly and overall fun to be around. Being able to listen to music on portable speakers was a big plus, and made the time go much faster, and the breaks were long enough and frequent enough to get me through a shift. Plus, free gatorade."
good,We had a lot of work to do here always. I enjoyed working pretty independently as well as with a team. Most of the work you do is small projects on your own.

good,learned great customer service and multi tasking. I learned how to run a register and learn a lot of different things. At dicks sporting goods you learn about different clothing lines and sports.
good,This was a pretty easy starter job. You get treated well. You're on your feet the whole entire time. Usually short staffed so you have a ton of work to do.
good,"i think that dicks was a great place to work at, it taught me a lot about communication skills and how to work well with others. I appreciated the time spent there and those who taught me a lot about myself."
good,"Easy job. All positions were simple, management is efficient. Great location. High flow of traffic. Closes at a reasonable hour. Many staff members make it easy to work during holiday hours."
good,"Most of the people working here are young and athletic which is a plus. Dicks sporting goods does sponsor the Pittsburgh Marathon, as well as sponsors teams in your neighborhood."
good,"Dick's is overall a great place to work, the staff is fantastic and very friendly. You will need to be able to work at a fast pace and be knowledgeable in multiple departments"
good,"On daily basis in charge of ensuring staff has tasks for the day ,   must motivate team to uphold company metrics, and ensure customer satisfaction, Most enjoyable part of the job is having the satisfaction of helping customers that appreciative for you help and insight of helping them, worst part of the job is the constant theft that takes place and the fact that this company has not put enough time and money int protecting not only their product but more importantly their staff"
good,We have a great team and the training are very good and keep yo up to date. the commissions are acceptable and sometimes even an extra bonus is oofer based on performance.
good,Working at Dick's was a mixed experience for me-- I loved my coworkers and we all felt like a family there. The customers were also very interesting and I met a broad range of personalities throughout the day which was nice. I loved merchandising--that was really fun to be creative. The hardest part for me was cleaning up after customers (sometimes they were extremely messy) and also management was not always easy to work with.
good,"Working at dicks was very fun and stress free! You airways have those customers that are unhappy in life, but the management was very understanding and everyone made it fun!!"
good,The most enjoyable part was being able to serve the costumers and getting them satisfied with that shoe. It was always the best when I would make a kids day. I always made it my goal to make the customers feel like they were the number one priority and I was not going to stop helping until they are satisfied.
good,"Management style is good for the most part. They do seem to care about employees and customers. If you are looking to move up in the company this is a good place to do it. They give you good opportunities to do so if you put the work in. This is a very competitive place though, I think it's because it's a sports store. But overall. good place."
good,"Dick's, was a fun and energetic place to work. A typical day consisted of tasking making sure the store looked presentable along with helping customers day in and day out."
good,Most of my coworkers were very friendly and sometimes went out of their way to help me out when I first started the job. Also the store upkeep was very well done compared to most stores that I have worked at.
good,They had Slow Days and Fast Paced days but there was always something to do or a project to work on. I liked that I was never bored even when it was slow. The co-workers made it a fun yet efficient work environment.
good,Unlock draws. Put money in draws. I learned how to deal with unhappy customers and find prices without a UPC. workplace culture was very diverse and everyone got along. Getting good to meet new people and getting to know customers.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Fast paced, learned how to be a cashier and work in a retail structure. Enjoyed helping out customers with their problems with returning items and finding things in the store."
good,Going into a day at work its like going too an extended home or working with family. just a bunch of laughs while also getting work done. My manger always said to never treat the job more then what it is.
good,I Love how Dick's Sporting Goods is full of sport oriented people who all have an athletic background. I work on the sales floor so I have the opportunity to share my enthusiasm with customers.
good,"I actually liked to work at Dick's.  Management was the best thing working there.  Of course, not all assistant managers were able to manage employees performance.  However, they all were quite proficient in their duties related to store sales performance."
good,In retail you must be knowledgeable about the products in the store and must be able to help the customer find what he/she is looking for. You must be able to read body language to relate to them while assisting them.
good,Great place to work at for staring job. Gives you opportunity to move around to different job responsibilities and was respectful of schedule choices. Always costumer oriented
good,"Lots of fun people to meet and work with, management is relaxed and easy to work with and for. Overall beside the repetitive nature that was working in retail, working at Dick's Sporting Goods is a comfortable high school. college job to have."

good,"The first things I do on a typical day would be to check the matrices, to see who needs help in their customer services score cards, sales, and any training opportunities needed."
good,"This is a great first job for someone. The starting age is 18 because they sell guns, but the cashiering aspect is easy. The location I worked at was very slow so the pace was never really busy but I’m sure a larger location would have been much crazier."
good,"I enjoyed for the most part working with almost everyone around me. All my managers we're some of my favorite people to work with. Everyone has a similar background with sports, so no one is embarrassingly unrelatable. It will always depend on position and location, but overall my experience was very positive."
good,I have put in 4+ years with this company so I suppose it is a good place to be employed. They keep up with employee training with various hands on videos and tutorials. I have had a lot of respect from managers and fellow teammates.
good,Really fun place to work if passionate about sports. Other associates are really friendly and fun to work with but sometimes management and corporate policies that have to be enforced don't make sense and make day to day work more difficult for employees.
good,"Easy to talk to, lots of advancement opportunities. Flexible hours especially around the holidays. Promotes within. Upper management is generally easy to talk to and communicate with"
good,"Working at DSG was very fun majority of the time. I was able to help customers with finding their sporting goods needs and if we didn't have the exact item they were looking for in store, I would offer to order it for them off of our website with free shipping. One of the negatives was the hourly rate. I felt as if I worked a lot harder for less money than some of the other people. They also worked with my schedule and were able to give me Sundays off. The only reason I left was because our store was closing and I wasn't able to relocate to a nearby store because of the long commute. All in all, I would recommend working here."
good,No day is the routine.  To be successful you have to be flexible and find creative problem solving skills to adapt to a changing priorities.  With that said there are weekly and monthly collectables are requires.  Time management skills are a must.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Good coworkers to work with.It was long and my hours were weird. During holiday hours closing at 11 seems to be not a good idea, and thats about it management was ok."
good,Fun company to work for.  Surrounded by sports and other activities I enjoy outside of work.  Not much else to say as I barely remember working here. Filling review space
good,opportunity to move up. if you work hard in this job like i did you have the opportunity to move up. a lot will come down to how persistent you are. good pay once you move up
good,Working as a sales associate I saw everything. It was always a good time working there and I enjoyed helping people. If you do not like helping people than this job is not for you. You are always asked to put the customers needs first. I learned a lot about customer service and how to talk to people who do not want to be talked to or helped.

good,Great place to work. There are a lot of paid days off and time off around all holidays. Lots of benefits and employee involvement. Easy to move around with in the company.

good,"My associates and managers were fun people to work with. My managers were very understanding and were willing to work around my class schedule. Overall, I'm very happy that I got the opportunity to work for this company because they taught me very important skills that I still use and will continue to use in my career."
good,A typical day at work for me was ringing up customers and making sure the metrics for the day are being met. I learned a lot about myself working at this job. I realized how much stress I was able to handle trying to juggle work and school. The hardest part of my job was trying to meet metrics on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to work with my friends that I made while working there.
good,"This was one of the most...fun places to work for learned a lot about all types of sports and guns, not much to say, it was ok...……………………….……………………………………."

good,A day in the life of working at Dick's involves short bursts of customers flooding the department to a steady flow to a ghost town. Depends on the day of the week and time of day. When it's busy it's very fun to be able to engage with customers.
good,Great atmosphere for any age worker. Easy and flexible scheduling makes life easy to work around. Workers make it fun to be there and benefits are a plus.

good,"overall good job, pushes you to be the best customer service representative you can be. A little strict in some areas that they don't need to be. I would help customers find the perfect shoe and the perfect fit. its always encouraged to do socks on a box."
good,Typical day in footwear is walking around the footwear deck and helping customers by recommending and bringing them shoes as well as just cleaning and restocking items. Hardest part of the job is dealing with a lot of customers at once if there's a staff shortage.
good,I enjoyed working at Dicks Sporting goods because of the atmosphere and culture of the people. It was fun to be able to work with products and equipment geared towards sports. Management set up the work culture like every day we were playing a sport and all your co-workers were your teammates.
good,Fast paced environment and a fun place to work. It wasn't my intention to leave as soon as I did but I had to relocate. I would definitely work for this company again!

good,Faced past but fun environment to work in. The shifts were long and sometimes started early or went later in the night. But overall I enjoyed my time there.
good,I have worked part-time at Dicks for nearly six months.  I have been promoted twice and received generous raises both times.  I enjoy the interaction with the other employees and customers.  The managers treat me very well and trust that I will make the right decisions when dealing with customers and administrative responsibilities. I throughly enjoy working at Dicks Sporting Goods.
good,It is a good place to work.  The employees and management are great to work with.  I would recommend working here if you enjoy sports and sharing that passion with other people.
good,relaxed 
good,"Overall, DSG is a nice place to work.  The hours are quite inconsistent and sometimes hard to come by.  This is definitely not a job to rely on if you have to pay rent and do not have plenty in savings.  For example, last week I had about 20 hours, not too bad, but this week I have none!  The only reason have not left is the people are great.  I have always been an athlete and so have most of my coworkers.  We all seem to get along for the most part and everyone is nice on staff.  Management is great, which can be hard to come by in the workplace.  I would say DSG is a good place to start."
good,"During the weekdays it was a slow paced environment, where if you was a cashier would just be standing there with very few customers. If there was a sale going on the weekends than it could become busy for a cashier but that's it. The management is very outgoing and understanding about shifts. I'd recommend this job to someone who's currently attending school!"
good,"It is a good job, and i would recommend to others. it provided a good learning experience in sales, customer relation, and marketing. "
good,It is a good job if you are looking for a part time job. It is hard to advance in this job. But good work environment above all. I would recommend to 18 year olds or college students.
good,"The job was really easy but with the job being retail, a slow day could quickly turn hectic in a matter of seconds/ minutes. The managers and coworkers are really nice and easy to get along with,"
good,"Help lead a team to provide a great shopping experience for our customers.  From knowledge to suggestions,  interacting with the customers are always the best!  Also driving the team to meet deadlines and executing task on a daily basis."
good,"Good place to work.  Especially for younger people. I’m just in search of looking for a better job and one that is full time. A typical work day is cleaning off shelves, stocking shelves, assembling firearms and putting them on discplay, spoiling fishing line, and customer service."
good,Laid back working environment. Co-workers and management made the day go by quickly and efficiently. Easy job and maintained steady pace throughout the day.
good,Great experience working here. Flexible hours and opportunity to grown within the company. The company made sure to train everyone and help allow you to become trained in other areas
good,No issues time time to move on. I really do not want to write a review. I just want to be happy and I like the people I work with. Life is too short to be at a place you don't like.

good,The opportunity to work for Dicks Sporting Goods was impactful. The network and relationships i created throughout my ten-year with the company will stick with me for the rest of my business career. I am very thankful and privileged for all the oppurtinuites Dicks has given to me.

good,My time at Dick's Sporting Goods was a very good and I learned a lot from the managers there about sales and communication skills. Dick's is a low paying job if your looking to support a family unless you get up into management. I would recommend working at Dick's if your trying to start out in sales.
good,Dicks  Sporting Goods is a very good place to work. They gave us many great deals and discounts on the product in store. But the company lacked for very little advancement throughout the job.

good,"I actually enjoyed working at Dick's. I found the job pretty enjoyable and the atmosphere was pretty good. I always worked a variety of hours but they always went pretty quickly as I enjoyed my time. I worked as a seasonal employee over Christmas time. Management had told me that if I wanted to stay on as a part-time employee then I could, and I really wanted to. Well after my last day as a seasonal employee I came in a couple of times afterwards to talk to management and they said they would call me once they figured it out. More than a month later and still no contact it was clear that they had given up. I had contacted them but they never contacted me back. I never had a problem with them up until then.

good,"I love working here the environment"
good,"As with any job, a little bit of effort goes a long way. As I write this, I have just completed my 7th year with the company with many positive things to say and few negative things to say. Management at my location has been very flexible with balancing work and school schedules for me as well as any emergency situations that may have come up outside work. In terms of workload, any position below management is very manageable if you don't succumb to stress easily. As is the case with most retail jobs, there are good customers and awful customers. As long as you don't allow bad experiences to get to you, your job is safe and so is your mental stability."

good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a very big company.  Their stores are also vey large.  Almost everything we sell, I want to purchase!  One of my favorite things about working here is getting to help  families that come in to buy equipment/ clothes/ shoes, for their children because they are starting a new sport or season.  The kids all love our store, so they are always so excited to be here.  The hardest part of the job is to keep freight out of the back and onto the floor in the proper locations while giving your customers an enjoyable experience shopping there."
good,A typical day at work was a task of things to do that our department leader would leave for us to do under the supervision of the managers. I've learned how to handle adversity and long hours of hard work. My co-workers were very nice and were always willing to help me with assignments. The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping a customer with what they were looking for and keeping them happy.
good,Great Work Environment. The company does a lot for the community. Over all the people I worked with were fantastic very welcoming. The managers were not very welcoming or understand when it came to getting time off when requested a head of time.
good,Having specialized staff in each department help the work flow much more balanced. Management was always very helpful and always put the customers first.
good,"I liked dicks sporting goods along. Great place to work, nice space, and a great discount. The people I managed were great and the upper mgmt was good as well"
good,"Friendly work environment. Allows for advancement if willing. Communication is always open. As the apparel lead I am in charge of all the apparel in the store and my managers back my decisions as well as give me suggestions with still keeping my ideas in mind. A typical day at work is running new apparel to the floor, rearranging items, cleaning up the racks, and making decisions since I do have manager numbers. I learned to trust my decisions and speak up for what I want and believe is correct with reasoning to back it up. I started out nice and understanding with co-workers and they were completing tasks but not to their level of ability so I began to get more strict and noticed more things are getting completed. The hardest part of the job is taking in what customers say and they could be wrong about an ad but telling them in a way to where you understand what is going on but it is incorrect. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting those customers that are happy and point out that you are doing a great job with assisting them. As well as writing a survey saying how great you were and how they will be back to see you. Those moments are great."
good,"A typical day at Dick's Sporting Goods involves direct customer service work, project deadlines and inventory management and control. While at Dick's Sporting Goods I have learned to manage people as well as valuable merchandising skills. I have also learned many loss prevention skill and techniques used to protect retail merchandise inside the store. Management changes from store to store are frequent and the turnover rate for hourly associates is high so training is a daily task. The hardest part of the job is meeting corporate deadlines without sacrificing customer service scores or sales numbers with minimal payroll. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customer base and providing excellent customer service to each and every shopper."
good,Working there for seven years you get a lot of customer service experience. Being in the front end you are the first and last line of defense to make the customers happy.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."

good,I had a good time working there. the only reason I left was to return to school to further my education. the work atomosphere was conducive to productive working.
good,Dick's Sporting Goods is a productive and fun place to work at. All employees are very friendly and management is helpful of working around schedules.
good,"My typical work day depends on the time of day and which day of the week which determines how many customers we might have in the store.The most stressful part is closing because of the many different responsibilities I must complete before being checked to leave. Average closing day is until 11 am, usually depending on the turn out of the whole store and its recovery status. The more there is to do, the later I get out. It is a sincere environment and very goal oriented. It is a driven company with many goals and confidence in succeeding. The coworkers are easy to get along with and work with. Most enjoyable part is being able to help the customers and making them leave happy and satisfied. The hardest job would be maintaining the floor as well as possible and having to recreate the floor at the end of the night."
good,"Fun, fast paced retail environment with passionate and knowledgeable employees. Great place for both part time workers and full time employees looking for great benefits and opportunities for advancement."
good,"Manage a team of 15 closely"
good,". Helping customers find the best fitting shoe"
good,"A typical day at work would be me doing my Ship From Store. Which is where our customers order something online and I go find it and ship it to them. This job requires me to multitask and pay close attention to detail. My co-workers are amazing ! They help me find anything that I am having a hard time finding. The hardest part is actually finding certain items. Due to our store being a high theft store, makes it difficult for me to send product. I enjoy packaging all the packages knowing I just sent someone a Christmas present or a birthday gift. It is very rewarding."
good,I worked there through my time in high school and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. It has enabled me to gain some very valuable skills at a youthful age.
good,"Definitely a good summer job. I wouldn't want to work there for a career or more than a part time job. It is your standard retail job but all about sports. I love sports and working in sports made the retail aspects a little more bearable. The store mangers are great, district manager can get a little too uptight and serious but it was a really good job!"

good,"Dicks sporting goods is a good job for someone who is involved in sports and outdoor activities. The available hours aren't there for someone looking for it to be their only part time job but when the are hours available for you to work, it is a fun place to be."
good,"Its a great place to work depending on the management. I have worked at two different stores, and the experience was completely different."
good,"A typical day working at Dick's Sporting Goods would consist of many different job tasks, a very upbeat work pace, and something new learned every day. Whether that be from management, co-workers, or customers. There are many days, more frequently during holiday season, that the work day can include many stressful obstacles such as consistent long lines, rude customers, an overwhelming environment, but I believe that can be any job at times, especially retail. The hardest part of working at Dick's Sporting Good's would be that the employee's, including management, are never consistent, meaning they are always rehiring new staff very frequently. The most enjoyable part of working at Dick's Sporting Good's is every day there is something new to learn whether it is for the benefit of yourself, your co-workers, or your company."
good,A good place to work. Dicks provided me with many opportunities and a overall professional environment

The work hours were good and the pay was decent making it an ideal summer job in a department of the store that I actually enjoy.
good,I lover working here. It really satisfied my OCD. My co- workers and managers were pretty great.

good,"Very laid back environment , its like working in sports heaven ! A typical day at work was assisting customers who most of the time know what they came in to purchase. I learned alot about other sports ! Most of the co-workers either plays or played sports at some time and are typically always talking about sports all day. The hardest part about the job was unloading the store truck. The most enjoyable part of this job is to get paid to just about talk about sports."
good,easy part time job had a great employee discount only problem is you work with younger kids
good,"The biggest part about my job at Dick's Sporting Goods was customer service.  I developed good customer service skills and enjoyed talking and getting to know and help out customers.  I learned many things as well.  One thing i learned was how important communication is in an organization.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see kids and helping them get their equipment for the sport they were involved in.  Seeing the smiles on their face and to see how happy they were to play, made me enjoy my job.  It allowed me to relate back to my past and relive all my memories about sports in my childhood."
good,co-workers are really enjoyable and the work environment is fun and productive.  managers are really welcoming and flexible to meet the workers needs.  the most enjoyable part of the job for me because i am a people person is the customer interaction and i love meeting all of the new people that i do.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Glad I had the opportunity to work there and would stay if I had more hours.  Unable to make a living with my present hours.

good,greet customers handling money transactions management is create a fun friendly environment hardest part is rush hour enjoyable part is learning something new everyday
good,"This began as a seasonal position, however I was later asked to apply for a part-time position. The position required customer service, handling cash, and maintaining the floors. My extensive knowledge of sports allowed me to further assist customers."
good,Dick's is a very customer first type company...They do whatever is needed to be sure the customer leaves happy!!! A great crew of associates to work with...
good,"Enjoyable atmosphere, changes are frequently made in reporting structure"

good,"It's a good company to work for. I learned about being humble and learning from mistakes. Management and the co-workers are nice, friendly individuals who know their craft. There is nothing hard about the job and the most enjoyable part of the job are the people you work with and the customers you're around."
good,This job is great for anyone that loves dealing with customers... Has a passion for sports also... But great set of mangers crew gets along their like one big family... So two dumbs up
good,Friendly staff and customers. Nice place to work daily. Would work there again if needed.
good,"The customers area are all nice, I liked working with my co workers and management."
good,One of the best companies I have worked for yet and one of the jobs that I really enjoyed coming to work to! I started as just a regular sales associate but was able to gain knowledge in other departments allowing me to experience other departments and giving me the opportunity for growth and advancement. Everyone I worked with at this location all enjoyed their jobs and it made it for a positive experience everyday. I was able to go from sales to merchandising in my own store to being able to travel to other stores opening and assisting other stores in remodels of their own.
good,very long days dont really get any breaks and the customers that come in always try and use expired coupons
good,The value and workings of sales. Typically helping customers find a certain product.
good,Dick's Sporting Goods is a store that in completely focused on customer care and satisfaction. You learn a lot about sporting goods and how to sell the right products to customers.
good,"Was my first job when I was in high school. My responsibilities were just to the footwear deck. I sold shoes, maintained stock in the back, and kept a neat, clean and orderly footwear deck."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Typical days at work are quiet. People usually show up on time and get right to work. Jobs are not left unfinished or sloppy.
good,"The floor was a lot of the times slow, but busy hours picked up. Your main job was to help a customer if they needed help. Other than that you were restocking and cleaning up."
good,I enjoyed being a sales associate. The position gave me retail skills and allowed me to help the customer with interests in certain products. I also enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,Cashier Customer Service ClerkMonitored inventory.Aided customers with questions and their final selections.Maintained appearance of store and work area.
good,"I enjoyed it, a bit too easy for my liking. Needed something a bit more challenging, they wouldn't let me work in the golf department even though I increased sales there in the one weekend I worked in the department."

good,"Most days started with the unloading of the truck with merchandise. Helping customers with all styles of footwear. Always trying to upsale with accessories. I really wasn't there long enough to appreciate the value of the job. I know that every time I was able to help someone find what they were looking for, it made me feel very good."
good,"Very stable work environment . I really enjoy the the off day's as well , work 4 and off 3 .... good deal ."
good,A typical day would consist of completing various tasks while balancing great customer service. I have learnt how to manage difficult people and situations. The management at our store is very focus and goal orientated. My co-workers are of similar background as myself and work hard to earn their money. The hardest part of the job is being in the middle of a rush alone. Being able to multi-task while making sure every customer is greeted and taken care of is critical to success. The most enjoyable part of this job is being surrounded by sports.
good,Great company i learned great skills and how to run a sales floor.
good,Very good company works good for anyone going to school anf they work well for your schedule.
good,"I work as a cashier and it is a fairly easy job. The only thing I hate about it is constantly harassing people to sign up for things like the score card, credit cards, and the surveys we have to get people to do. And you even have to talk a certain way there like not being able to tell people to “have a nice day” but you would have to thank them for coming in and tell them to please come back. I feel like a robot most of the time. The hours were really good until after Christmas. Then I went from 34 hours a week all the way to about 7. I do have to say though I really appreciated the managers, they always helped me when I needed it and were really nice to work with."
good,"A productive workplace and a great place that does achieve their work as a team, however, has the higher-ups in management do tend to fail at their positions."
good,I had so much fun working here and had no issues with management. I did have to quit but only because I had to relocate. I would definitely reapply here.
good,Was a great place to work. All of the coworkers are polite and knowledgeable on firearms. The managers ensure the store is running at maximum efficiency.
good,Loved all of my associates. Management works with you and is patient to ensure both you and the company are successful. Flexible hours when you need time off.
good,Great place to work if you have a competitive spirit.  This company is not for the weak at heart!  We are go getters and butt kickers!  I enjoy every minute working at dick's sporting goods.  My only complaint is lack of work life balance for managers.
good,"It is an easy job to learn and my coworkers were great, I really enjoyed working here. Management was good for the most part although I would get scheduled on days I could not work (we filled out an availability sheet when hired). The worst part is the long hours on your feet but you will get that at any retail job."
good,"Very fast paced environment with pressure on driving sales, delivering standards and performance in order to create a sustainable brick and mortar company."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."

good,I work for a year at Dicks while I was finishing up college. They worked with my schedule gave me the hours I wanted plus made some good friends. I would recommend working here if you want some extra side money plus the employee discount is very good.
good,"Fun place to work if you’re at all into sports or outdoor hobbies. Fair employee discount offered. Very flexible hours, good place to seek pet time employment."
good,"Dicks Sporting goods was one of the most relaxed jobs iv'e had. when the job had to be done it was done. The pay was pretty fair for what i did. Management was great, i loved all of my managers except for one (but no one like him)."
good,Better than typical retail. Fun environment to work in.  Unrealistic sales goals in some locations.  Good people and very knowledgeable.  Sporty persons dream job.
good,Great company for retail professional. I could not handle the lifestyle of working nights and weekends. Management wanted you to succeed and benefits were great.
good,Dick's Sporting Goods is a very fun and exciting retail environment. Your typical day involves setting merchandise to company-directed plans and being highly involved with customers. They give you every opportunity to take steps up the corporate ladder as long as you are willing to buy into the company's mission and training programs.
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is a really good company to work for as a Paralympic athlete. They were completely flexible with my training and/or competition schedule. I learned a ton on the job and gained tons of confidence in my ability to help incoming customers.
good,"The management team was really nice and approachable. The training isnt really provided but its retail, you expect being thrown out there yet my managers were supportive. Pay was good when I started since it was based on my retail experience. At that time they hired a lot of students so mostly are PT yet 40hrs was never given to FT, they said because it depended on the sales/wages.  Its a good place to work for if you dont need FT hrs."
good,"If you have a love for sports, DSG is the place to work. Friendly work environment and an overall good work environment. The discount is very reasonable, and it makes for a great place to be. Pay increases could be more frequent and worth more, but its still a great place to work with great people around you."
good,"A lot of fun interacting with customers , you always get some customers who really don’t know why they feet are hurting so it’s a good feeling that you’re the one who providing them with good shoes"
good,"I'm the type of person who likes to stay busy. I always ask for something to do and am always willing to help out. Its the same with my co-workers. Management treats us with respect and the store manager goes out of his way to buy us breakfast and lunch on busy days as well as keeping the breakroom stocked with snacks and drinks. I as hires as a CSS part-time seasonal and they kept me on when the season was over. They are now training me in other departments. Sometimes you get aggravated, rude customers but that is normal in any business."
good,They are always willing to work around your school schedule. The pay is not great but the company is heading in the right direction for the future. As long as you do not mind helping customers this is a good place to work.
good,"Workin here is very relaxed. Good pay, good hours, good discounts, you get commission. Great boss. Would want to work at Dicks Sorting goods again!!!!!"
good,Fun and relaxed workplace. Great first job or if you are looking to gain more retail experience. You'll meet a lot of cool  people and can learn a lot along the way.
good,"Best to start working at Dick's Sporting goods when you're young and work your way up. If you have a good management team in place, it makes it a great place to work."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,Overall the atmosphere of the supervisor to staff ratio was great and we all got along as equals.  I could see the bond managers and long term staff have with each other which was great to see.
good,I really enjoyed working at Dick’s Sporting Goods. One of the reasons was because they recognized my hard work I was promoted for my performance there. The Managers were very understanding of our personal lives and treated everyone fairly. Every day felt like a team effort you didn’t hear comments like “that’s not my job” we were all willing to work as a team and help out where we were needed. It was a friendly work place it taught me how to easily interact with customers and make their shopping experience a good one. We were the top store as far as sales go in our state every month that I worked there and I think it was due to the team effort we all put in and our great managers there.
good,"A typical work day consisted of putting away clothes, cleaning fitting rooms, placing orders, assisting customers, and backing up on the register. I learned to work quickly and efficiently. The workplace focused on being a ""team"" and working well with all your teammates and coaches. The hardest part of the job was just the time crunch you would be in by the end of the day to get all the merchandise put away."
good,"If you have the slightest interest in sports, you will do great here. The job is very chill, especially if you are a cashier; the only exception being the holidays. Just note that it gets pretty sluggish right after the holidays (around January) and they usually don't schedule as much."
good,"- A lot of costumer service required"
good,Dicks Sporting goods was a great work place with fun employees to work with. Management at my store were great but they did seem to clash with each other. I feel they could have done a better job looking to promote employees from within and gave them more opportunity for growth.
good,Company is very pro-employee. Individual growth and internal promotions are very important. Dick's continues to move into a pro-customer atmosphere by re-thinking tasking vs services.
good,"I love my job here, I just hate we have to stand for so long. the work life balance isn't that great but I don't mind. im lucky to have a supervisor that approves days off as long as we request them on time."
good,Fantastic place to begin and/or further career. Work culture heavily promotes teamwork and doing more than just working a 9-5. Both permanent and contracted positions offered.
good,"Wonderful working environment, great management, but limited available hours.Would not even consider leaving if full-time position was available or if management training was a current option."
good,Long days. Always something to do most of the time you never get in done and have to stay late of finish it or do it the next day. Very stressful with customers and all the project you have to get done.
good,I was a cashier at Dick's Sporting Goods and the time I worked there was good. It is a good Summer job and I would recommend this job to anyone who wants to makes some money in between semesters of school.
good,A typical day at work was always fun even when we were very busy. I have learned a lot about the perfect shoe for a customer. The hardest part of the job was pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a lot of new friends. Management was great.
good,"you earned your hours,pay,raises,promotions,equally based on your productivity,customer service.  Management was viewed by those that didn't understand the above unfavorably, but once you bought in the corporate culture, you then earned your stripes!!!!!"
good,"I enjoyed the time I spent with this company. I was not there for very long; however, while I was there my coworkers did their best to help me through any questions or concerns I had while learning to do my job."
good,Helped the customer find desired products and provide excellent customer service. Go above and beyond for the customer even if the product is not in stores.
good,"I only worked at Dicks for a little under three months so i did not work there not enough to give a lot of detail. My dicks experience was good, mainly because i knew most of my coworkers very well. I also enjoyed my managers and the environment."
good,"I love working at Dick's Sporting Goods, it is a fun place to be and I love my co-workers and managers. The pay is only $9 an hour, but it is a part-time position so I don't expect more than $9 starting out."
good,"Hiring athletes definitely benefits this work place. I had a good experience working here. My management was very capable and understanding. Each manager had their own way of doing things that bred positive results. We kept the place clean as a team, and were required to watch each others backs. This job taught me repetition can give different results. Repetition is how athletes become stronger."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a good place to work, because they push you to be better. It can be a good place to work your way up, and it is a great learning experience."
good,dicks sporting goods was a fast pace company. i was a cashier that promoted a lot of gift cards and also accounts. the team member with the most accounts at the end of the month would get an extra bonus.
good,I thoroughly enjoy working at this establishment. It is a great environment that really allows me to be myself and to work freely with my other co workers.
good,"Great management, flexible hours, helpful staff, it's a great place to work and shop at. The discounts are reasonable. Staff is very friendly and nice"
good,a typical day at work could be anything from unloading trailers that are all floor loaded to making boxes for shipping outbound freight it all depends on what department you work in
good,"The job is very fast paced and results driven.  It pays well for the role you are in.  As a salaried manager, you work long hours including most weekends and nights."
good,"I've been at Dick's for almost 4 years now and it has been everything I could have expected and more. From day one i've never hated going to work because it honestly doesn't feel like I'm working most days. The store has a family-like atmosphere and we all have a good time while also getting things done. For an entry level job, I've gained numerous valuable skills that i will definitely carry with me to the next level of employment."
good,it is a fun place to work with a bunch of great people. footwear gets your walking steps in and it is always a good time helping someone find the right shoe that fits them.
good,"Every day is different due to the amount of customers that come into the store. During the day, if there was a shipment of product that came in, we would have to work the product into our inventory. If a customer were to come to our designated area, we would stop working on the freight for that day and focus on the customer. Customer interaction and satisfaction is key. I learned personal interaction with customers and knowledge on the products that we sold. The managers that are staffed at the store are all excellent. Our store is a training store, so we would have a few newer managers coming in and out of the store being trained in certain areas. Everyone who worked in the store worked together to give the customers the best experience they can get. We worked as a team and were always communicated if needed. The hardest part of the job is customer satisfaction, finding the customer the right product or product that they will be highly satisfied with. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers. You do not know who you are going to meet or what questions they are going to bring to you so every interaction was different than the last."
good,Very easy-going place to work. very customer oriented which is great. if you put in effort there is plenty of room for advancement. Your hard work does not go unnoticed at this job.
good,Management is very caring and willing to work with your schedule. The workplace culture is very fun and makes it easier to get through the day. Get part-time place to work.
good,I had a great time working at Dick's Sporting Goods. I worked there for three years and went from part-time to full-time rather quickly. I was also promoted during my time there. Great way to learn skills and you can move up in the company fast.
good,"Great job to work at to get experience for future jobs they you might want.  Work/life balance is great, you get done what needs doing for job then able to live your life when you get off of work."
good,"Its a pretty good place to work. The days vary depending on what days you work and what is going on sales wise, and department you work in. Management is management, there are always good ones and bad ones, my store has pretty good managers. Hardest part of the job is the customers can be pretty demanding and sometimes the work itself can be a bit repetitive and hard to keep your interest. But the best part is the people you meet and the friends you can make."
good,Dick's provided a great environment and good management which made work that much more enjoyable. I got the opportunity to work in the golf section which was great as well.
good,Dicks sporting goods is a unique retailer since they sell many sports and team related products not found anywhere else.  The working atmosphere is very high paced yet enjoyable
good,"It's a hard working environment where you are constantly on your feet and moving. There is a lot of opportunity for growth in the company if you want to stay within. "
good,I cannot say much bad about working at our particular Dick's Sporting Goods.  It is a corporate atmosphere which can make change slow and difficult but their philosophy is consistently about the customer and I have not see any waiver in that.
good,If you are looking for a fun and fast paced/laid back environment to work in then Dicks Sporting Goods is the place for you. Management is normally pretty flexible with the scheduling and the starting pay was way above average upon employment.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I like my job here and interacting with customers but I am looking for something more. I am looking for more pay, and more benefits. Managers are great, employees are nice."
good,I had a great time working at Dick's. The main negative I found was that management was very hit-or-miss while I was there and it seemed numbers came before associates at times. The pay was above average and they were usually willing to work around your schedule.
good,People are great to work with. Atmosphere is laid-back very casual very open and fun. Management is great very understanding and very laid-back. Attire is very sporty.
good,"Working at Dicks Sporting Goods was a great experience to get myself started for other occupations in the future.  Great manager(s) there as well, they really helped and cared."
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods was a fun atmosphere. I enjoyed the benefits and perks of the job. I learned a lot form this job. (Sales, merchandising, loss prevention, inventory ordering)"
good,"Every day is different. Some days are dull and slow other days are so busy there's hardly time to breathe. Working here has taught me team work and to keep my head up and push through even when times are stressful and not so great. The employees are friendly and supportive and are willing to help where they can but due to under-staffing it is difficult, at times, to get help. The most difficult part of the job is realizing that, no matter what position you hold, the job is never really finished. One of the best parts of the job is the people you work with."
good,"Great place to work and friendly and personable managers.  Ranking very high in the district most of the time, the managers know what they are doing and can task very well.  Unfortunately my position makes it hard to advance and the benefits offered are poor."
good,"As a cashier at Dick's Sporting Goods I'm required to handle all register functions. I typically ring up 50 to 100 customers a day, where I have to ring up their items, make sure the price is correct, provide excellent customer service service, and promote our store programs. Store programs include: our rewards card, store credit card, and warranties on particular items. Our management is very friendly and helpful, taught me how to interact with many people and work efficiently in a fast-paced environment. Co-workers are very hard working, ambitious, and team oriented. The hardest part of the job is having to resolve customer conflicts, to best satisfy our customers while making sure I am following our company policy. My most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I helped satisfy my customers by helping them get the right products, and provided a very friendly interaction."
good,"The Hoover ,Al, location of Dicks Sporting goods had a fun work  place and the employees as well as management were the most professional and understanding people I have worked with."
good,"As a cashier, I stayed in one position most of the day other than to assist costumers when in need. My co-workers had positive, upbeat attitudes and overall it was a good work environment."
good,I loved working here! My store manager was a fair man and offered over time to those who deserved it. I loved meeting new people and being able to bounce around to a few of the different departments. I least favorite thing about this company is the pay rate. If there was more room for advancement and the pay was better I would have stayed.
good,"The store let me be me while fulfilling the company’s defined customer experience by being a friendly, available, customer focused, excited team member."
good,"If you love interacting with fun and upbeat individuals, this is the place for you. I left this position as the management was not the greatest."
good,I loved coming to work everyday. Being able to converse and engage with the customers about sports made my day enjoyable. Management was decent. Most of the managers cared about your well being. My co-workers also made the job enjoyable. All were very friendly and we had many things in common since we all loved sports.
good,"-One flaw they have is the are not as technologically advanced as other companies I've worked for."
good,"This is a great company and great oppritunity. But, you must be a good worker because it isn't all fun and games. I would recommend it though, love it here."
good,Working at Dicks Sporting Goods allowed me to grow and enhance my customer service skills while providing general knowledge about sporting equipment to the general public. I've enjoyed my experience as an employee while working for this company.
good,"Load and unload store merchandise twice a week with friendly, supportive co-workers. most enjoyable part of this job is being able to fulfill customers needs and request to the best of my ability."
good,There is room for growth and the benefit options are wonderful!! I enjoy having a 3 day weekend( when available). 2 nd shift works 4 10 and anything after that is overtime (awesome). The company feeds employees on mandatory fridays. oh yeah!! The company is paying for all employess to attend the company picnic at Six Flags!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Mostly a relaxed environment, depending on management. Otherwise a great place to work. Employee friendly environment with a mix of great, returning customers"
good,"I loved working for Dicks sporting good, the employees were very helpful and welcoming. Had good interacción with alto of customers. Learned alot of new things working for them."
good,"A typical day at work consists of a team meeting before opening talking about today's goals and jobs to get done before the end of the shift/ end of the day both department wise and company wise.  Since I have been working here, I have learned about all types of equipment and apparel in all the departments and learned how to be more personal and open to new ideas.  The management team is a great group of people who you can count on when you have an issue or a problem with understanding any of the services we supply.  Along with management, the co-workers are very helpful and encouraging on the floor with hitting our goals for the day and to keep the experience positive for both the workers and customers.  The hardest part of the job is getting yelled at by customers for something we cannot personally control.  For example, the company no longer accepts coupons from retail sites and retail apps due to fraudulent coupons being set up.  That is not something I can personally control.  That issue is something corporate has put together.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you can help a customer out and make them want to come back with giving them a satisfactory experience.  The absolute best part of the job is when you have customers come back asking for your specific name because you gave them such a great experience in their first visit."
good,"Cashier, Inventory control"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dick's. Lack of attention to detail with management. HR doesn't pass along information well. With that being said, I loved the crew I worked with, just wasn't able to advance."
good,A rewarding career professionally with a company that expects it's teams to deliver strong results year over year.
good,I am overall pleased with my experience at Dick's Sporting Goods.  Compensation may need some work though.
good,Our store is very customer service oriented. We focus on the customer and make sure we do everything we can to make their visit quick and easy. Management is pretty good.
good,Atypical work day includes helping customers while exhibiting exceptional customer service. I learned about sports and how to set an ad as well as setting up the store using a planogram. The job wasn't hard at all and I enjoyed every part. However the managers had a hard time understanding that I was a student first and an employee second.
good,"I've worked at Dicks Sporting Goods now for almost 3 years and its safe to say I've just about done it all. I started as a Cashier which progressed quickly to Customer Service Specialist. I love working with people. I enjoy making people happy. As A customer Service Specialist I would not only cash people out but I would take care of there exchanges and returns in the proper manner. I was also in control of the phone lines, answering them and distributing them out to the correct department. As my interest grew I was moved to an apparel associate. As an apparel associate you are constantly adding product to the floor and displaying the new product on a daily basis. Dicks Sporting Goods recently added a new position to the company known as the Price and Signage Coordinator which is my current position. Sundays I would verify that the weekly TAB prices were signed correct, along with our In Store Specials. I have Mondays off, Tuesday I receive a weekly list that tells me what items in our store are getting marked down, and change the prices. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday I audit each department. What this means is I scan every department looking for pricing errors. If a department reaches the maximum amount of errors they fail and have to fix the pricing in their department. As you can see I have learned so much at Dicks Sporting Goods and I owe it all to my co-workers. We are family. We help each other out whenever anyone needs a hand. We know when to joke around but when to get things done as well."
good,"Typical Day."
good,"DICK'S had a very organized way of managing their employees. Each department had a list of objectives to be completed per work day. The store could be defined as tedious, but overall if you were able to manage your duties, the work period would go by quickly. All of the employees were very friendly and helpful which made work a lot more enjoyable."
good,"Provide daily forecasting and development through upgraded systems such as WMS, BOREAS, RLM, and SCI, as well as Microsoft Office Suite. I work closely with management and i am involved with every department in the building. I have to think on the fly and use my time effectively."
good,"very laid back, but still get work done.  customers were kinda mean"
good,Fun to work at Dicks and love helping others. Alot of room for advancements and promotions. Poor pay but overall not too bad.
good,"My co-workers were awesome. We had a lot of fun but also buckled down when we needed to get our work done. I learned a lot about different sports and out-door activities working there that I did not know before as well as the history of Dick's Sporting Good store. That was interesting. My typical work day included ringing up customers, making sure they had a good experience and get them to want to come back more often. Helping out apparel as much as they needed me to. I loved meeting new people and talking to customers all day."
good,A very fast paced environment. Help customers find what they are looking for. Sign them up for a rewards card. Had a daily quota of 5+. Management is very good. Managers care about personal life and for the most part go off of your availability. Co-Workers are a fun group of people who work extremely hard. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is sending the customer out with a smile on his/her face knowing that you completely helped them out and satisfied them.
good,"The best part about my job was the ease in which I could stay busy...."
good,"I've worked in Sporting Goods retail for 7 years and when I moved to Dick's Sporting Goods 2 years ago, I thought the issues I had at a small time sporting goods store would be behind me and I would have the big store budget and payroll issues would be solved. Silly me, they are still inside out on being simple.  You would think a store like this would be worried about sales and customer service, but no only with the second district manager did they finally have a focus on sales.  I am proactive in asking every customer in my department if they are finding everything they need okay, yet there is a million projects to fix, and not to mention the projects you have just completed the store is poorly restocked.  If I sell 15 pairs of a certain batting glove, you would get restocked on those batting gloves right? Incorrect, you get the ones you already have 87 of, and they wonder why the gameplan isn't set properly.  Well if you were in here 3 days ago it would have been full. This actually wouldn't be a problem to just dummy certain pegs out of other merchandise, but the fact that every peg has to have a shelf label is the real issue.  If they were just plain pegs and having all the merchandise priced itself, then it would be simplified.  Certain people are never penalized for not being able to learn to do the gameplans, so I am usually the one who stays overnight to pick up the slack of others, and luckily when you stay till 3 in the morning, you only have to be back to work around 12 to close the next day.  Managers seem to spend a lot of time in the back with an influx of very"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"At Dick's the day starts with doing the golf counts to make sure nothing has been stolen. We then would have to check to see if there are any golf or tennis services, such as; re-grips and re-strings, that need to be done. Then we  get to help customers find products and answer any of their questions so they can walk out of the store with the best item for them. Throughout the day we have to maintain a clean workplace for our customers and other employees. The most enjoyable part of my work is being around sports and having a good group of co-workers. "
good,"I always built and sell bikes to customers. I also, sell fitness equipments such as treadmill, elliptical, recumbent bikes, and many more. Whenever, there is down time, I need to reorganize every shelves and label price tags on the items. "
good,"Selling firearms was an enjoyable experience, as well as learning the from the customer what I didn't already know. There was never a boring minute, always busy, and management never neglected to help. I did not enjoy the randomness and lack of confidence in available work hours."
good,Cant complain. They have been good to me. Usually just help customers and do little projects throughout the day.
good,"A typical day of works involves opening the store, taking care of customer questions/satisfaction, and excelling at reaching company goals for sales, etc. The management team is very friendly and easy to work with. Co-workers are very close and demand a lot from each other in terms of production. The hardest part of the job would be the stressful grind of the day. It is a non-stop work pace. There must be focus and attention to detail ALL day."
good,"Its a great job, not too stressful, good pay for someone without any college degrees, but for someone looking to advance and have a career not exactly some where I could stay forever."
good,"During a typical shift at Dick's, I would greet customers and also run the register. I would also check fitting rooms and re-fold clothes and have the store looking neat. At the end of my shift, I would gather all the clothes hangers from all the registers and take them to the back room for re-use. Then gather all the trash and also take it outside. Then once that was done I would then help my co-workers clean up their area. The hardest part of the job was getting people to sign up for the stores credit cards. However, I did enjoy my co-workers. Often some of us would go out for lunch together which was usually an hour long."
good,co workers were awesome but after management change the place slowly started to die. Style was different and last time I went in roughly 8 months after leaving I saw one person I recognized. Ruined a really fun place to work and sales numbers didn't even change. Why was it worth it?
good,Great Place to work and help customers. You will enjoy the work environment and the store if sports is one of your hobbies. I also enjoyed helping customers find what they needed out the store and also able to see kids smile leaving out store.
good,"Typical day is helping people with returns, exchanges, and ringing them out. Management is cool and very willing to help with anything they can. Culture is very chill and happy. Everyone gets along and are friendly."
good,"I love working at Dick's! Everyone is friendly and helpful and the days when work stress is overwhelming your coworkers know how to make you laugh and free the air. Management likes to have fun but they also expect you to work hard, especially during the holiday season. A typical day at work means you're doing the same thing over and over again, but occasionally you are given little projects where you are allowed to use your creativity. Most importantly, to work here you need to be self-sufficient or unfortunately, you will not be given many hours."
good,"Great management wonderful people and environment to be in, There wasnt a day i wasnt excited to go to work and see all the familiar faces and customers that come through the doors"
good,Dick’s sporting goods was a pretty nice company to work for. They were pretty flexible with hours and availability. Managers were usually approachable and willing to help
good,"There were a lot of good reasons to work at Dick's Sporting Goods. The company makes sure that you have knowledgable employees in place for all departments. When a customer came in they knew that they were being helped by a person who knew about the product from either  playing the sport or being given the product knowledge to help the customer. The company encouraged the team to be competitive with each other in the store and with other stores within the district. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing kids coming in for their first bat, first glove or football shoes. They were so excited. It was fun watching and helping them. I learned a lot about different sports and the apparel. Overall, it was a enjoyable company to work for."
good,This has been a great place to work over the last 5 years. I had needed a simpler role to help my family through a few tough times and this fit the mark. I have enjoyed my time with Dick's and although I am exploring opportunities I am in no hurry to leave unless it's the right opportunity. I have found myself craving more multi box adventures again to enhance my professional satisfaction. Needing a challenge
good,"I've only worked here for a few months, but I'm already completely adjusted to the environment. They're welcoming and friendly and flexible; they understand that we're human and treat us as such."
good,Dicks is a very fun place to work.  If you are a college student it gives you a great flexible schedule and a nice discount to keep you set all year long.
good,This job has been a great help with both communication and multi-tasking. Retail is a cooperative effort and is best managed when all employees work in unison to provide the best possible customer service to everyone within the store.
good,"Retail, is retail, is retail. But, if you like sports stuff and want to work in a solid store DICKS is a good launching point. With retail stores having problems nation wide, DICKS still has a strong foothold in the sporting goods community."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."

good,I work the weekend shift friday-sunday 12 hour shifts. The pay is 14.50 to start out you get yearly raises. Full medical dental vision benefits with paid days off with vacation days as well.

good,My typical day at work is just watching outerwear making sure nothing is stolen. Learn how to do online pack package and special order web order. Harder part of the job is not knowing what are the online deals are and matching the product online. I enjoy watching the NBA and NFL games some of the college game to. The work environment is awesome knowing that you around thing you can enjoy talking about to the customer
good,Managers are understanding and notice hard work. Very flexable with my school and kids scheduale. They notice hard work and will give more hours if they see your hard work.
good,I was a cashier at dicks for a short period of time before i moved back out to Arizona for school and I really enjoyed this job. the management and team members made me feel welcome from the moment i got there. would highly recommend this job to anyone
good,"They need to implement better training "
good,"Easy to get along with the management and most of the co workers there.  A place that will actually listen to the employees, there concerns and will do something about it unlike most retail places."
good,"I like working because of my co-workers and management is great. Day to day operations is great, it doesn't matter what time you start you're in for a treat."
good,"the people and managers are really nice making it a great environment to work at, they always bought food for us for breaks and lunches and the accepting of coupons was consistent with managers."
good,It's a really good summer job. the management is really good and you quickly are working with team mates and not just co-workers. The associate discount isn't anything spectacular because the items are pretty pricey but other than that it's really good!
good,Nice environment to work in. Management is awesome working with customers and employees. Training prepares you very well and supervisors do help you along the way if you ever need help with a situation.
good,They have awesome incentives as well some pretty good benefits to the job. The people are very friendly and also you get to wear workout clothes such as leggings but only black and comfy tennis shoes and sweatshirts!
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."

good,Definitely enjoyed working in a fun and friendly environment with people who cared just as much as I did to keep everything looking nice and make sure the customers were satisfied.
good,"Dicks sporting goods was a great place to work if you knew alot about sports and outside activities. I have never been into sports very much other than weight lifting, so at times i had no clue of what they where talking about, but i quickly adapted to it. Team work was great and management was very informative and well trained. The  only problem i had was with my training in specific. I am a hands on person so when they put a 700 page book down in front of me i was worried. I barely recieved any hands on and there was never a person on hand to answer questions i had. Other than that, it was a very enjoyable experience."
good,I worked as a cashier. I handled money and talked with customers to make sure that they were happy with their experience at the store. I learned how to work with money and I gained communication skills. Management was relaxed for the most part.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is merchandising and inviting customers to shop the apparel based to color stories. The hardest part is dealing with the limited work staff and hours.
good,Fast paced job with friendly co-workers. everyone is willing to help at anytime it is needed. many new faces to meet everyday
good,The atmosphere at Dicks Sporting Goods was very fast paced. the other employees were very nice and willing to help others employees. and customers.

good,"The greatest part of being able to work at Dick's Sporting Goods, is always keeping busy and productive. Being able to meet new co workers and being able to work as a team with great management. I learned about everything from fitting customers for golf clubs, up to managing a freight team within a year. The hardest part of the job is time management, being able to get so much done within the planned time frame. The best part about the job is just being around all sports products, and being able to learn about any new products within the company."
good,"Flexible working hours.  As a cashier you have to issue out customer loyalty cards; easy, but some people fight them.  You just have to have a passing percentage by the end of the day.  Management is great and encouraging.  Co-workers are like teammates, you all work together.  Hardest part of the job is staying motivated on slow days.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the job culture.  Who wouldn't want to work for one of the leading sports stores?"
good,I love being able to help people get better in sports with everything I have learned while working for Dick's Sporting Goods.
good,"Able to reviewed previous days business and to plan current days work loads. Preform any correspondences need to other store, customers issues, District Management, and /or Corporate communicate. I have learned how to be the most productive as one can be. I always had the support of upper Management and a good response from staff due to being able to gain respect from all. The hardest part of the job is that I have been in Retail for so may years that I am wanting to do something different. Merchandising is by far the most enjoying part of my job."
good,"Co-workers were amazing to work with and the managers were understanding and willing to teach."
good,"Dick's sporting goods is a great company to be involved with.  I have worked there for almost 5 years now.  It is a fun and enjoyable environment to work in.  I work in the golf department and I am also an experienced high school/collegiate player.  I have learned many things, especially the behind the scenes look into how the company is run.  My co-workers are great and so is the management.  The only downside is the availability of hours during certain times of the year, especially for part-time employees like myself.  All in all, I have enjoyed my past 5 years with the company."
good,"The company Dicks Sporting Goods is a very good company to work for. I have worked there for almost 4 years and have no major complaints. I started working there right out of high school and learned customer service, money management, operations, customer standards, and even job appreciation.

good,"Typical day involved assembling store bicycles to be put on the sales floor, as well as repairing customer bicycles. Customer service and shelf resets were also part of the job. Management overall was above par and made the job enjoyable."

I have learned how to be the best customer service person ever, I enjoy working along side the associates and making the store the best I can by having well trained associates and a management staff that works together as a team. I have had the pleasure of working side by side with very fun, hardworking associates. I don't know what I would say is the hardest part because I enjoy what I do. I would say working with the public and having a good staff makes the job alot of fun."
good,A Typical Day at Work Was Basically Assist Customers Who Were Looking at Products in The Fitness & Outdoor Department.
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods was a good place to work, however it was only a part time job."
good,"On arrival to work, I would organize my department (fitness) making sure that everything was neat and presentable. We would then have a employee meeting where the manager on duty would go over the goals for the day and the week. The management is very laid back, but keeps the store in order. The hardest part of the job would be unloading merchandise trucks and spreading the inventory throughout the store. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the feeling of satisfaction that comes after helping a customer find everything he or she needs."
good,"didnt work there a long time because i went to college, but it was very friendly. if you work hard they will initiate it."

good,"It’s a great place to work "
good,"I have learned a lot from working for DICK'S. I would however like to increase my pay and find a stable full-time job (Monday-Friday). I have learned How to manage and supervise associates, Handle work situations, customer situations, train others, multitask and so much more. I provide excellent customer service and help them in every way I can. I want to provide my experience to another company and continue giving my all to help others."

good,"Dicks was a great experience for me because the store was always so crowded, so we really had to work. Also, all of the workers were really nice, and made me have fun while I worked"
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a productive workplace with plenty of room for growth and development. In my departments, my hope is that by being friendly and informative, it will help the youth athletes become the best athletes possible. There is a sense of pride helping others in this company, seeing the happy faces of others and helping them on their way. My Managers are firm yet kind and fun to be around. They help sort out moments of overwhelming amounts of people. We all are able to communicate via radio and ensure we are all up to pace."
good,Great place to work. Coworkers are very friendly and the management team is always willing to work with employees. Its a fun work environment and does not feel like a job. Coworkers are always willing to help each other out and share knowledge.

good,I had a good experience working at Dicks Sporting Goods. Great co workers with excellent communication. Great managment team and the store is continuously improving.
good,"I started as a cashier where I handled money, accounts, and customer service phone calls. I learned so much from working here. I learned how to balance store improvement percentage while completing store goals and my personal weekly and daily tasks. I now work in the department that handles customers online orders. I think the hardest part of my job is getting things done without the correct told needed to do the job and the lack of communication between associates and managers all the same."
good,"I applied as a way to earn some extra money while in school. The people are great and very much not like a stereotypical retail settings where the managers are mean. The managers here are great people and are extremely approachable with anything. I've never had an issue approaching them to ask even the simplest of questions. They value their employees, which great, especially in a retail setting. Getting a day off here and there is also very easy to do. Hours are extremely flexible. I'm only able to work in an extremely limited time frame because of my school schedule and they easily accommodate it. Definitely a great place to work."
good,"Upset they changed business plan and released all PGA Professionals. The hours were great, pay was good and the people were fun. I enjoyed learning about the merchandising practices."
good,"Working here was amazing! I truly enjoyed coming to work every single day. The shifts werent too long, and the schedule always made sure to stick with my availablility.

good,"i have learned how to use new sports equipment, as well as how to explain them to others. the most enjoyable part of my job is engaging with customers and learning new things"
good,I got to talk about one of the things I love all the time. Fishing. I love fishing. Management was awesome. they were friendly and would talk with you should you have any issues or need help with anything.
good,"DSG is a great place to work. The management is friendly, the staff is fun to work with, and it is relatively easy going. You do have to get your work done, but as long as you're doing what you're suppose to be doing, you can joke around and have a good time."
good,The management you have can either make or break your experience working for Dick's Sporting Goods. I had two great managers while working there and my third and final manager just totally took any sort of joy out of working there.
good,The company strives itself upon internal growth in the company. If you work hard and are dedicated you are sure to advance. Great communication from all company levels. excellent benefits.
good,"The people that I worked with were very friendly and helpful with everything I needed. Top of the class work-environment where people put the customers needs first. Management was great, in which they kept us busy with work that needed to be done. However, the management spaced the work out between employees so everyone could get his or here job done effectively."
good,a typical work day consists of putting the customer 1st that is the main priority. As an Apparel associate my duties include working out freight from the stock room on to the sales floor and re merchandising up the store in the apparel department. They also include markdowns and mark ups the store has and setting the weekly ad in the news paper.
good,Helping customers  the right shoe for their needs. I enjoy working will all my managers and they are great role models for my future.
good,"Great company, teamwork, great pay. Company was purchased, so it was a top retail store"
good,Really relaxed fun job of your into sports gives great knowledge on every sport and your around other people who have the love as the same thing as you
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I loved my job , going to work meeting the customers helping them out . and the customers and associate we would talk sports and games and about athletes etc. a normal day was getting our name tag putting it on and going to help out"
good,Fun to work at have great energy with a lot of nice people the hours are pretty good only bad thing is not as many workers when it gets busy but it could be worst
good,"Once you get comfortable with everyone you realize it's a pretty easy going job."
good,The dynamic of the store as a whole is a very tight knit family feel. This helps to make you want to go to work and put in extra effort because you know the people you work with and for appreciate it.
good,"To come work at DICK's Sporting Goods will have to probably be one of the best work environments I have ever worked in. If you are an athlete I believe you will love working here because it is DICK's Sporting Goods! And if you are not an athlete I believe you'll still love it. The company offers flexible work schedules for everyone especially students as we are restricted on time due to class. Although I did not work for an extremely long time here, I gained friendships with my co-workers in which I enjoyed working as a team to get through the day. To work here at DICK's Sporting Goods teamwork is a very important factor into your everyday work tasks. Although many tasks you can handle on your own, many others consist of cooperative teamwork with your co-workers to take on certain tasks."
good,Have learned a lot in my 7 years. Have gained a lot of experience working with different kinds of people. Fun people to work with. Didn’t know anything about any of the brands that I work with and now I have 3 District Managers that love what I do and how I manage my position.
good,As my first job this place was a good place to work while in college and they worked with me to be able to go to school. Management was really good when I was working there.
good,"Great team atmosphere. Team effort great staff , management was nice knowledgeable. decent benefits, management and staff relations were close open door, and lots of room for advancement. cons would be short breaks, not enough pay hourly."
good,"my typical day at work includes morning tasks, a trip to the gym during lunch to work off any pent up stress and to get away from my desk and the afternoon consists of more tasks.I have learned several key leadership competencies and important computer skills that I can take with me as I move on. The retail industry is constantly changing, so you must  be able to adapt quickly and react on the fly. The workplace was very conducive to a younger workforce and I really enjoy everyone I work with. Upper level management builds teams accordingly to have the most productive workforce. People's passion at Dick's Sporting Goods is overwhelming and that is what helps them in being the number one sporting goods retailer in the world."
good,"Great, very comforting team to work with. Everybody works together to make a productive store. Most enjoyable part was to be able to walk and work with others in  friendly environment to get the store moving"
good,"A very fast paced, positive,dapper type of environment everyone works as a team and loves to work diligently.My bosses are vey nice & humble and motivational! Everyone conducts there self as professions and gets the job done!!"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Dicks.  The only issue is the low pay they give you.  You also start off as part time which doesn't mix well when you barely get paid anything to start with.  If you want you employees to be happy or stay, you should be able to have full time and better pay based on experience."
good,An awesome place to work with awesome people!! This was back in 2011 when it first open. Totally different people there now though. I miss working there and I miss those faces!
good,"I worked in the golf area, that was one of the least shopped areas so I also helped out in all the other areas. Other than selling and maintaining the golf area, I would do different tasks around the store."
good,"I loved working here. The staff was amazing and all the managers cared deeply for their employees. I was sad to leave. The only bad thing was that it was retail and subject to the ""what can we cut?"" mentality in regards to staff/hours."
good,Being applied here I was excited it seemed like a good job to have. I quickly found out it wasn’t for me after long hours of just standing around doing nothing I became quickly bored and the hours would go by so slow.
good,management could have been better but for the most part not a bad place to work. laid back culture. learned a  lot and worked in different departments.
good,I like working here and most supervisors are great.  Problem is they will not transfer me to an upper possition or to another department.  They say I'm am an asset because I am good as a cashier and also helping in appereal.
good,"Highly stressful Without possibility of advancement. Position includes functions in human resources, operations and loss prevention.  Company expectations include working 50+ hours a week and available hundred % of your off time."
good,"Dicks Sporting goods is a wonderful company to work for , Safety is the one thing that will get you dismissed from the job."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,It was a good company to work for. Room for growth. Must be a hard worker.  Company is extremely adamant on credit card sign ups!  Loyalty Program is also a must.
good,"a typical day is long and sometimes stressful "
good,"learned to serve customers, "
good,"Great Benefits,"
good,"Went in punched the clock,grabbed the handheld and went to the front of the store where I greeted people til the end of my shift."
good,I start out looking for merchandise and then once everything i have to find on my pick list is found i go to the back and start getting all items ready for packing and then package them to be ready to get shipped. I had to learn how everything was packed so it was all corrects so nothing gets damaged in the shipping process. My engagement is very helpful as long as you ask for help and don't just go ahead and do it how you think its suppose to be done. The hardest part is making sure you have enough time to get all the packages done before your shift is over.
good,"It is a good place to work. Hours are not reliable though, some weeks I would get 25 hours, others I would get 10-15. Management was awesome. I had two very close family members pass away unexpectedly within 2 weeks of each other and they were so understanding and I am very thankful for them."
good,"Very nice company my work was seasonal. The staff is great. Christam for the best and fun time of the year to work for a company as large as dick""s. I loved my opputunity"
good,"I loved working for the company the 1st 3.5 years. Was promoted quickly in to managment learned alot about the business and trained in great employees. "
good,Dicks Sporting Goods is a awesome company and peers great benefits. The only down side is the hiring process is bad which makes business bad. I love working here but can't stand picking up slack.
good,"A typical day at work was calm, not to much business on the weekdays. The weekends was pretty busy! "
good,I like the people I work with better than I like the actual job. Dick's is a good place to work though if you are just working through school
good,Each morning all team members would meet for daily expectections.  We would end the meeting with a chant and clp. It really rallied the troops.
good,I enjoyed working at Dicks however compensation and advancement opportunities are lacking for associates. Hours can vary a great deal from week to week which made factoring pay difficult.
good,"The over all company of Dick's Sporting Goods is great, but there are some issues within our specific store that is inappropriate and hard to work with. I have learned a lot about visual merchandising, and I love creating a ""wall"" full of our new product making it eye catching. The hardest part is all of the negative vibes from certain individuals."
good,"No job security and unstable hours. It's a nice environment to work in and great mentors and leaders. Managers give great support, feedback and learning tools to help you succeed."
good,I wanted this to be my career however it was more geared towards college students.  I learned to get along with many personalities and customer satisfaction.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical day: at first, just being in apparel, going around folding clothes. As my time at Dicks wore on, however, it included manning the door, and greeting people. I learned how retail works, and how many hours a typical 40-hour week felt like being on my feet for all but forty-five minutes (taking a half-hour out for lunch and taking 10 minutes for a break; this was also my first job). The management was weak (everyone except for the store manager did a bad job of managing time). The workplace culture was friendly. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we got % off apparel and footwear."
good,"while i'm not a huge fan of the structure of the company, the employees create an excellent, team and family like environment, which makes going to work that much more enjoyable"
good,The job was not good. People were very rude to customers and staff. As a supervisor I did things I was not getting paid for. Worked more then asked but never noticed for it
good,I liked working there but all they pushed for was credit cards and protection plans if you got those they didn't bug you which is good and bad as when a bad assoaciare gets a credit card the manager lay off of him so he doesn't do nothing that day because he thinks he already did what he needed to which I didn't like they let people get away with a lot of stuff and put more pressure on other people to do work that knew they would do it so too much lack of management skills.
good,I loved my job it was just time for me to move on. Many opportunities to move up in the company.
good,I really enjoyed working as an apparel associate because it allowed me to organize a lot of the store and learn a lot about the merchandise. I enjoyed recommending items and helping customers meet their needs and navigate the store.
good,The pay and hours varied way to much. I worked for this company for 5 years and worked in just about every Department. I loved the people I worked with and management was pretty amazing for the most part. Busted my butt the entire time I worked there! With very little raises.
good,"During my time at Dick's Sporting Goods, I learned the importance and value of providing exceptional customer service. A typical work day consisted of face-to-face customer interactions. My goal was to provide customers with a positive in-store experience."
good,Everything about the job was easy going. You could dress in any clothing you want as long as the store sold that brand and for the most part the customers were nice and never really needed help.
good,Good environment and good people to work with. The work is not that hard but is a fast pace environment. The benefits are good and the supervisors are friendly
good,"loved working at three different locations across the US in Colorado Springs, CO, Pocatello, ID, and Danvers, MA. All managers and coworkers were fun and helpful."
good,They were a great company to work for and I would go back anytime. I enjoyed both the managment and other sales Associates. They gave opportunity to move and grow with the company as well.
good,As a cashier I spent most of my time speaking to customers. I learned how to restring rackets. Management was understanding and did whatever they could
good,Fun all around employees always willing to lend a helping hand! Organized and very motivated workers to make the best possible experience for athletes and customers.
good,"Days working at dicks was very fun you could interact with different people and just share some common knowledge about shoes, clothes, sports, anything. Just helping those athletes was very interesting and fun"
good,Its been fun nothing really too bad maybe just some customers that will be trouble but thats pretty much it also the employees are really helpful with a-lot of thing
good,Very nice people and great management. They really care about you and your success. They also allow you to leave for college and come back to work on breaks!
good,"You need to be willing to work hard, since it’s a big store there is always so much to do. You need to learn how to multi task because there will come a time when you are doing multiple things at once."
good,"Dicks is a great company to work for, all the team mates get along and help each other out with anything. The managers are great. Have fun at work!!!!"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,It was a great opportunity to work for their company. They were very well organized and good about working with your schedule. I have no complaints about the job in any way.
good,"I love the atmosphere working for this company,even with Dicks being a business the managers genuinely care. I could write a book on the perfect service that they require from you as an employee,and it helps the business to be looked at as a great place to shop. An most importantly provide all your shopping needs."
good,I have enjoyed ever minute at my store. My manager is extremely flexible with giving hours and is always able to give advice whenever you may want to hear it.
good,I really liked working there. The pay wasn’t really that good though but I liked the people I worked with. We all worked all together and we were always competitive.
good,Working as a cashier is fun when you are working with someone you like. Black Friday and holidays are fun because you are always busy. I love working here.
good,"While working at Dick's I had flexible hours and got to work with great people every day. There was never a boring day, even when it was slow, because the people there were just great."
good,I loved working here because I am a huge sports person. I also love shoes and I worked in the footwear section. I was really good at selling Brooks to people.
good,sometimes the workload is alot for the pay but loved my coworkers such a teamwork atomsphere. but the pay wasnt that great wish i got more because it is a good company
good,I loved the people and the environment I worked in. It was lively and the attention to detail and customer service was phenomenal and was more then I expected when getting hired.

good,"Very pleasant work enviornment especially for sports enthusiasts, even if you are not that into sports, it's still a great place to work and learn all about all types of different sports."
good,I think it was a great place to work. I was a part time worker here. I helped process online orders and pick up orders as well as prep those orders for shipment.
good,"a lot is expected with little to gain, It is a very customer service oriented job that will test your ability to interact with customers and help them choose an item. Shoplifting is a very popular problem that is managed very poorly at this location."
good,"It was a positive experience for me.  Loved the flexible hours and room for growth.  They worked well with my college schedule, and management was encouraging and positive."
good,"I truly enjoyed working for the company, however the travel was very hard on my family. I needed to be close to my family in the time of my career. I miss working for Dicks Sporting Goods."
good,Not good for a full time person only good for kids that's in school schedule changes all the time no set schedule  not the job for me I want a full time job
good,I worked there for a short time before going back to college. Everyone there is friendly and is will to help you if you have any questions. The pay is good and the management is great.
good,"Made a ton of friends working here, would definitely recommend it. Most days you are kept busy which makes the time go by, but there are some slow days. Managers are very interactive on the sales floor with customers."
good,well before you start work they a short team meeting to talk about the days plans and goals you need to check the store for cleaness and nothing on the floor
good,"I worked there part time back home in Michigan during high school and some college, they were very flexible with my school schedule and super friendly."
good,It was a great experience working here with the management and staff. It is an enjoyable time and they are willing to work around your schedule. Great place.
good,"This is a pretty good place to work. As long as you are doing your job, management will watch out for you. The other employees are also really nice to work with."
good,"They should Increase the starting pay, and give more hours. When I worked there they only gave me one day a week and it was not enough to live off of so I had to find something better."
good,"Footwear sales associate. In charge of helping customer find shoes, socks, or anything else shoe related. Often changed displays, worked with PDA guns, and learned to print and make labels."
good,"Everyone working here is very nice and very knowledgeable.  Management was behind the work being done on the project, and gave it a lot of support.  I recommend working here."
good,"Dicks Sporting Goods has a lot of options in crosstraining, and has several managers. Holidays are the hardest to overcome, but they do staff up. Fun job"
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a seasonal store of course. During the season of all the sports is when you can count on all the customers to come in. During the summer, it is more relaxed because kids are out of school so it is more based on summer fun. It is a very interactive job with customers and co-workers."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. This particular position is no longer available. I did this job part-time and enjoyed it while it lasted...........
good,"Directing employees to complete daily task with a focus on sales goals and customer service. As a lead I interacted with customers, other employees and mangers on a daily basis."
good,"At first I liked working there.  However, as time went on I learned that they really only care about making money.  They allow the customers to speak to employees any type of way."
good,great job that paid very well and let me learn the customer service business in a way that i never knew. i got to make a lot of good friends that i will.
good,As an apparel lead I was responsible for the merchandising aspect as well as helping customers on a day to day basis. Customer focus was a big part of being apart of the sales team.
good,Working at Dick Sporting good was a lot of fun but yet kind of hard. You are on your feet till you have lunch and you must be able to handle customers that are rude and upset that you don't have what they want. But the bright side is that you will have those people that are VERY thankful for your help.
good,At times can be stressful but overall great work environment. Managers are easy to get a long with and other employees were awesome. Business can go from dead to insane pretty randomly so you always have to be prepared
good,It's a good place to work. I am only working there at the moment to have some spending money while I live away at school. Dick's has a good working environment.
good,"easy, fun, good first job, flexible and good management. would recommend. fun experience. always able to watch the games as the tvs are always on. no drug test."

good,"Nice place to work.  Fun environment.  Enjoyable coworkers and managers.  Fun to work with sports, which I love.  Like being able to help customers out with their needs."
good,Helping the customers is the most enjoyable part of the job. I get to teach people about things they need to know before they buy it. I enjoy working with people.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"The days were relaxed and coworkers help each other out, and sometimes we got lunches when we hit our goals for the month. It was hard to get over time most of the months."
good,"its a great job, lots of fun people to work with, everyone was amazing to work with, lots of team work and lots of good connections to the job. great reliable job"
good,"The people who work at this location made the job. Everyone is there to work and have a good time, the company does a great job a balancing both. The only problem is the management because the location has a high turn over rate that you never truly feel stable."
good,"Good job.   great company   management was supportive and encouraged growth, teamwork.   flexible hours  Jobs security  minimum wage pay.   room for growth"
good,Great overall place to work. Managers are extremely nice and know how to get their team working. The incentives you get upon performing well are nice and definitely adds to the work experience.
good,"Working at Dick's was a fun, albeit dead-end job for me. Had I wanted to stay I could have become the lead of my department, and possibly a manager much further down the road, but it was a nice summer gig."
good,During a typical work day we are doing a lot of merchandising the front of footwear and organizing the stockroom. I enjoyed the upbeat work environment and the staff.
good,"Clock in ready to work on sales floor in full uniform. Communicate interact with customers, help answer questions find products, and redesign and clean sales floor."
good,"Always a great day at Dick's Sporting Goods! An upbeat, supportive team playing environment is always a great opportunity to be apart of! Highly recommend the company to start off in, and continue to grow your career!"
good,"Great place to work through college and even after if you decide to make a career working there. They have many different departments you can work in with passions from hunting and fishing, sports, golf, and apparel. This company also provides great opportunities for advancement offering lead positions in departments and also management positions."
good,"One must be willing to take on the job of others if wanting to work here. Do not expect much thanks for doing so because it's not asked, it's expected."
good,good place to work. good place to grow expecially if you want to mov up to management then they will place you depending on your work ethic. if you love people its a great place to work
good,its a good company but it is a retail job so it is alright. late nights and no weekends because you are working but it is a temp job for me until i find another
good,"Great opportunity and was grateful for the position. The staff was very welcoming and loyal. Everyone was always positive and helpful for the start to the finish,"
good,"Everything went smoothly, and everyone was friendly. I worked an average of 10 or fewer hours a week. I befriended everyone I encountered at Dick's. I recommend working there!"
good,A typical day would be to wait on over 100 customers on a Saturday and Sunday. I learned to always smile and laugh.  The management is pretty good.  Depending on the Manager the CSS can be in charge. The culture is pretty good. It is retail.  Sometimes it is like a Soap Opera on TV.  Their are no secrets. Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers. I love to be able to meet and talk to many different people.   It shows you how small of a world we really have.
good,I enjoyed working here loved the managers and employees. Would recommend this job to alot of people. Always willing to work with your schedule and that was greatly appreciated.
good,"Ever since I started working at Dick's, everyone has been very nice and helpful. We all work as a team no matter what department we are in and it is a very stable work environment."
good,"Although they do not pay a lot and hire only at a part time level, Dick's is on of the better places to work in retail. The managers are quite understanding if you cannot come in and you can always go to them if you have a problem or question. They want you to succeed. There is a touch of micromanaging from the store manager, but it is his store and I think anyone would do the same if it was their store. The employees are a younger crowd, but they are really cool to work with. You may have to pick up their slack at closing time, but who doesn't have to pick up slack at any job."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,I worked in the footwear department so every morning the back stock would be filled with brand new shoes. The hardest part of this job was when sports seasons came around the store.  Its incredible how busy it can get.
good,Fun place to work but each management have their strengths and weaknesses. But great company with great customer service training and offerings. I would recommend and work there again.
good,"Mostly worked with people my age, fun environment, the managers were very relaxed and laid back, but could be stern and strict when necessary. Overall, great place to work in the summer"
good,The environment was great! A very fast paced work environment and high call volumes.  Customer had to be number one priority while I worked with this company.
good,Worked as a team to provide excellent customer service and golf knowledge to the consumers. Full of learning experiences and a great workplace culture
good,The workers are friendly and the work environment is easy-going. It's a good place to work for high-school and college students
good,"Meet and greet customers when they came into the store. Helped market new items within the store through displays. "
good,You will surely enjoy your job if you like being busy and talking. The management makes you work for what you do make which can be both good and bad. Good luck!
good,Co workers are amazing! Everyone works together to make sure all requirements are made. Not only am I apparel lead but I have also helped out in other departments.
good,Improved my knowledge of the company by working with very intelligent managers that prepared me for every situation.  Was able to communicate and help customers on a daily basis with the help of co-workers as well.
good,Summer Internship. They did a great job at teaching me everything about the business side of retail and taught me a lot about people skills and workplace environment.
good,did not really like the job only because i did not know too much about biking. however the coworkers that i had here pretty entertaining. the pay was okay but i felt i deserved a little more.
good,"Corporate ran, managers and employees often recieve free lunches. Lots of oppurtunities for over time work. Employees from all departments are good at working together to ensure store is clean and pricing is accurate."
good,I was very successful in selling guns and camping equipment.  Getting to sell outdoor equipment was a wonderful job to have.
good,Dicks Sporting Goods has just opened here in folsom.  Its exciting to be in the opening of a new store. The management has som issues  getti v staffing due to know information of the sales of the new area
good,"Typical day at work was great."
good,Getting things done and customer servers. Putting things away early mornings. I work hard everyday and get things out or whatever needs done on that day. I keep people happy and laughing
good,Working at dicks sporting goods is a very entertaining and friendly place.  Anyone who has a passion for sports and outdoor activities would love it everyone is friendly and kind.

good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,A typical day at Dick's Sporting Goods starts of slow and progressively gets busier. We make sure that everyone is properly trained to do their job. Management is always available for any reason.
good,work was alright for just out of high school. I maintained and cleaned my area at the end of every shift and assisted customers in finding the appropriate equipment for their needs.
good,"I was educated here with the right information to talk to customers about the products we were selling and the benefits they included. I was also trained on how to make suggestions for customers when they asked my opinion. Management is friendly, and they want you to stay! Managers will order lunch every now and then on a busy day, or on a day where teamwork is at its best. The hardest part of the job is dealing with other associates not showing up on time or at all for shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is to turn a customer's rotten day into a bright one, keeping a life time customer to return again!"
good,"management is amazing eventhough store manager can be a little rude at times"
good,"Good job for a full time college student. Fun environment to be around, especially if sports is a passion of your's. Dress code is awesome."

good,"Price and Signage Coordinator."
good,"Dick's is a good company to work for.  They are customer oriented and take excellent care of customers. Working for Dick's Sporting Goods I learned (as I already knew) that no matter what, the customer comes first."
good,"At Dick's Sporting Goods, everyday was filled with hard work and customer satisfaction was at its finest. I really enjoyed being able to assist and relate to customers with whatever they needed in the store or with advice. I had wonderful coworkers that loved their job and would always support and encourage each other daily. The hardest part of the job was pleasing the most customers as possible equally while allocating time to other work obligations such as building and repairing bikes or working in operations. I really enjoyed the amount of customers I was able to assist. Making their day easier while they were shopping was very satisfying and many customers were grateful for the extra effort."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. My managers were very good to work for, and they always had their employees in their best interest."
good,Great company to grow with. High Energy and Fun people to work with. Management team really works with you to help train and develop.

good,"Fun place to work, great co-workers and easy going atmosphere. Enjoyed going to work everyday and helping customers. Plus great clothing!"
good,"Everyday would switch between phone agent, chat, or email as call volumes would jump. I learned how to operate multiple computer systems, and customer service skills to keep a returning customer. Associates all got along great, especially with management as we all had a bond with one another, which made work very enjoyable. The hardest part would be operating 6+ computer systems to assist one customer, but I love to train, work, and push myself to overcome any obstacle within my path."
good,Lots of customer service skills needed very upbeat job.  Very knowledgeable about sport.  High traffic/ intensity sales.
good,"Great people, Great environment. Make you feel at home when you are there. Benefits could be better though. Nice job. Recommend it"

Then off to bring the tills to the different kiosks for all of the cashiers that day. Opening up the store for the customers. Handling customer comments or issues and guiding them to happy experience in the store. I've learned that everyone has a story including customers and they just want someone to listen to them.

Unfortunately, the pay was not competitive at all I feel as though for the amount of work we did we were not paid well enough for it.

A day at dicks sporting goods was pretty typical just maintaining an orderly store for the customers and providing them with great customer service."

good,"My job duties for Price and Signage Coordinator can be overwhelming at times. However I enjoy the busy work schedule. There are set tasks that need to be done on each day, and that never changes at all. Besides the normal duties of this position ( ensure all items in the store are accurately priced, correct signs are up for specified items, and to audit each section to ensure that price accuracy is at %100), I am responsible for the graphics for each department and have to set up the displays for each section / brand graphics that need to be displayed. And the best part of it all is the Customer Service. Part of my duties is to ensure that any customer(s) that I see are being taken care of, and if the item they are looking for is not in the store then I will try and order it from the website. The hardest part of the job is my hours constantly being cut. When you get a schedule and it shows 32 hours for that week, and by weeks end almost %40 of those hours have been taken away due to lack of payroll. However the best part of the job is interacting with customers, meeting new people, and to see a customer leave the store with a smile on his/her face to me is Priceless."

good,"You will be asked to assist in multiple departments, regardless of where you are designated to. And will be in a faced paced and busy retail environment."
good,"A great place to work part time while you finish your college degree but the pay is not a livable wage. Would continue working here if was being offered a competitive salary . The balance between your personal life and retail is non-existent, you will work nights, holidays and weekend but the managing staff is amazing and flexible to work with. The most enjoyable part of working here was being cross-trained in multiple departments and being able to work in any department in the store so it was never a mundane place to work, very fast paced in holiday season and fun to learn about different products."

good,Dicks is a place that is perfect for my preferred line of work (golf). There are many options for everyone to fit right in to their preferred type of work
good,Worked at Dick's during college and right after graduation. Great summer employment. Advancement opportunities into the management level seemed to be few and far between.
good,There is always something to be done. Everyone is fun to work with and make work enjoyable. Hardest part of the job would be managing tasks and customers at the same time.

good,Fun and relaxed environment. Good benefits and friendly co-workers.  Longer store hours than the mall is open which can create long working days.
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods is a great corporation to work for, however movement within the company is specifically based on need, luck and availability. I unfortunately want to grow my Career in Miami, New York City, or LA. These are cities in which I could use my international background, skill set and fluency in Spanish to the best of my ability."
good,Culture of fear from the district manager in taxing however the people you work with on a daily basis makes it ok. Very difficult to advance and it is a very silo esque work culture.

Day shifts run by pretty slow, as I just sit in the box office, selling tickets to those who come and answering phone calls, answering customers questions. Game days are more busy. I sometimes do will-call or I sell tickets to fans. It's a pretty nice job. Not oo difficult.

As long as you do your job well, you'll get along very well with the other employees. The managers are really on top of things and although usually very busy, very willing to help when needed.

good,As a seasonal hire i was only there for 2 months but in those two months i started out as a door greeter and after 2 weeks they moved me to cashier and stock.
good,"I work with customers face to face which I am really good at. I also work with sporting goods and I've been playing sports all my life so I'm working in an environment that I am really comfortable in. My coworkers are great, everyone has a passion around a sport and more of the employees still play their sport of choice so there is always a topic to talk about and to support the other person in their sport or activity. The hardest part of my job was putting the store together. I was hired when Dicks sporting goods was just build in Gainesville, fl. I was hired, and helped receiving the products for the new store. That was pretty tough, but it was still a good time. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction that I get to have with customers and helping them find equipment that cant help them with their passions, be it fishing or weight lifting."

good,This was a perfect job to have while completing school.  Great associates and manage team.  Fun atmosphere and very busy.
good,"Working at Dicks is my first time working in the retail environment. It is a fun and easy going atmosphere considering the store sells sports equipment and apparel.  In my department, I'm a golf sales and repair associate mostly but I do help out in other departments too. The customers for the most part are in the store buying something for a sport or activity they enjoy doing in their spare time. We don't receive commission, even though I wish we did, but it does make for a less pressurized working conditions which the customers can feel. Overall, it is a fun place to work, there's excellent managers and co-workers. The only thing that would make it a better place to work is if we received commission for larger sales and if we were to get a bigger discount on things we wanted to buy."
good,"Fun, working environment! Learned many new things, such as outdoor activities and new things about sports. This is a perfect position for someone who enjoys sports and outdoor activities."
good,work was fun the co-workers was nice great customers management was good my day was never hard I enjoyed helping my customers
good,"My typical day as a cashier and sometimes a footwear sales associate at Dick's Sports Goods was a very great experience. My duties as a cashier/footwear sales associate were to operate the register, help customers, sale men, women, and children shoes, put up stock, and displays on the sales floor, clean my workplace, and operate orders through our online website back in the footwear department. By working at Dick's Sporting Goods I learned the different types of hunting games and outdoor games there are, as well as how to sell hunting/fishing licenses. The management that I worked under was very great. All managers were equal to everyone in the workplace as well as very nice. They would not tell you to do something that they wouldn't try to help you do if you needed help. Co-workers that I worked with sometimes would make indirect comments about other co-workers which I thought was very rude. There wasn't really anything to hard at Dick's, besides trying to get to the shoes and items that were very high up for displays. I enjoyed working at Dick's Sporting Goods because the management was outstanding, the job was great, and it's a sporting retail store considering that I play softball and basketball."

good,"Customer Service and checking out guests at the register, as well as managing cashiers."
good,"This is a company you are always moving, always something to do.  There is rarely a day there is not something to have flexed, stocked, cleaned, or maintained.  There is a philosophy to not have any empty shelves."
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed working for Dick's Sporting Goods.  The environment was always pleasant and encouraging.
good,"A typical day at work was easy. Selling shoes to customers, Employees all got along for the most part. The downfall was the management, for they were very unorganized. The hardest part of the job wasn't very hard but i would say remembering where certain shoes were located in the back-stock area. The most enjoyable part would be the laid back environment as well as meeting new people and communicating  with customers."

I enjoyed helping customers putting a smile on there face when they finally found what they have been looking for."
good,"I am a cashier at Dicks Sporting Goods. I help and assist customers with any questions and a quick and friendly checkout. Our goal is to have the customer leave with something and have a great experience at the store and want to come back again. I have learned to work together as a team and everyone gets along with each other great. The hardest part of the job is when customers get mad and angry at me and there is nothing I can do about it, usually about a item priced wrong or moved to wrong shelf. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting knowledged my the customers about the sevices provided"

The hardest part was becoming adjusted to all the new types of materials we would have to stock on a weekly bases. My Co- workers was very fun to work with, as well as managment. I learned a lot working at Dick's, I learned how to deal with presure under a time fraim and become very peoductive within the time fraim.

good,"The best part of the job was the fellow employees. There were only about 20 employees in the building, so everyone worked together often. There were many ""regular"" customers, which allowed you to build a rapport, and better help them out."
good,"I worked in Glenview IL as the fitness department lead/bicycle tech between 2013-2017. I loved it! We had an amazing, helpful,& funny crew with probably the best managers in the company.

Not too many customers and on busy days, you'll be overwhelmed but it's a good balance. They give you free food one day a week. You learn some new stuff on the job. Work here for a good job!"

good,"A typical work day involves ringing customers up on a daily basis when they are ready to check out. I have learned that you always need to be calm when handling a customer that is screaming at you, even when they are calling you foul and unnecessary names. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the people that I have befriended while working at Dick's."
good,"I enjoyed my time at dicks sporting goods overall. Since I was a younger kid, I always enjoyed being around sports. I am currently going to school to be a coach because I love sports so much. Being in that emvironment was enjoyable because i got to talk sports with customers all day and customers quickly learned who I was as well. I fixed golf clubs and whenever I did have other associates working in my department with me, I sometimes had customers who would only bring their clubs to me to get fixed which made me feel really good about how well my work was. My managers at the time knew and would acknowledge how hard I worked especially whenever I had to stretch myself out to help other departments."

good,"If you’re an active athlete, you might as well apply here! As an associate, you automatically get 25% off everything that isn’t Golf Clubs, Firearms, Kayaks, Basketball Systems, or Weight Sets.

good,"While I was there, and it has been some time, there was a great team culture between all the staff. Communication was fun and the job itself simple. It's a great part time job for a student, especially for athletes. The discount wasn't all that great though."
good,Great management team. Fun company to work for. There are legitimate chances for advancement if you earn it. Working there was good experience for building my customer service skills.

good,Management makes it very comfortable and provides great sales tips each day. Working at Dick's gives me a chance to meet people from all over rather tourist or local residents.

good,"This is one of the most stress-free jobs I have ever worked.  Not labor intense except when unloading the freight twice a week.  Just have to make sure that my area of responsibility is tidy and products are in correct placement.  I love being able to interact with strangers and suggest products based on their needs.

good,"fun place to work, specially if you are interested in sports. Pay was average, advancement is easy if you show up and are dedicated to your job.  Managers are fun to be around."
good,"Dicks SG was a good job, they pay well. They care about the employees and ensure the customers are always happy. The pace of the job depends on the time of year. Dicks is a great place to work, you would honestly prefer to be having s busy day than slow."

good,Help customers find the correct shoes for their requirements. At times I would have to up sell a customer on a certain shoe. Help set up for the day or help tear down for the night.
good,"Each day was as unique and inspiring as the day before. The management was very understanding to students working part time and allowed students to dictate their own availability. Being a sports medicine major myself I learned as much as possible about every sport, even the ones i didn't play. the other associates always supported each other to get the job done, even when the days like the weekends would feel overwhelming and never ending. The best part of the job was the different athletes and fitness enthusiasts you would meet and talk to. Hearing how sports and exercise effected their life. Same with my fellow associates and how the sports they play drive them further and further in life."
good,"I worked at Dick's for over three years as an apparel associate and even though there were times I was frustrated, overall it was a wonderful experience."

good,I absolutely love working for Dick's Sporting Goods. The company and management were so great to work with and the staff was always very nice and respectful.

good,"Working at Dick's Sporting Goods is pretty enjoyable. The management there is very nice and understanding and as long as you work well, will hold you in high regard. They always appreciate work that their employees put in and will recognize it as well. Since it is such a big store, the hardest part for me is recognizing that I can not answer every question and do every task. Luckily the co-workers there are very team oriented and are always more than willing to help out one another in anyway."
good,"Dicks sporting goods is a great starting job. You meet new faces and management makes the job fun with new activities, and helping customers have a great shopping experience."
good,"I grew up right down the road from Chick's and was always excited about there yearly Summer Tent Sale. Chick's was my first job. I worked as a cashier and was trusted with handling large amounts of money and preforming a cash drop at the end of each shift. While I was working at Chick's it was bought out by Dick's Sporting Goods, during the change of ownership there was changes to the work routine and how things were run. I ended up leaving the job to focus on my schooling."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"I enjoyed working there, staff was very friendly and would help you out if you didn't know how to do something or understand what computer was asking you to do."
good,"Hours Change Frequently, Customers are awesome, Management Team has its pros and cons, Limited room for growth but does promote from within."
good,"Each day there is lots to do, busy with customers or daily tasks. Most co-workers are hard working and reliable while some are not. But it is retail and that is what is to be expected especially if lots of workers are part time."
good,"Overall this is a great company to work for. management is fairly new which is always interesting."
good,"customer service, cashier. help customers with shoes and etc. cash handle, scorecard. sales"
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, that is a hard thing to find , a job that you loved doing. "
good,Normal days consist of recovering aisles and setting new displays as well as offering excellent customer service.  Management is good in the sense that they help out with the simplest of tasks and do not feel that they are too good for helping customers.  Upper management beyond the store tends to micromanage and not worry too much about customer service but more about getting tasks done as quickly as possible whether it is done correctly or not.  Hardest part of the job is having to do trucks at 3 am in the morning on fridays on occasion when needed as coverage.  The most enjoyable is helping customers and seeing them learning so much about the sports they enjoy.  Seeing excitement when trying new products is a reward in itself.
good,"To many managerial turnovers, everything else was up to me to make the best of what I had."
good,I actually like my job. Not always the people I work with but its been educational. You don't know how much work goes into a store until you work in retail. And DSG pays very well.
good,very friendly co-workers. caring and understanding management. hardest part of the job is putting away shipment while providing excellent customer service to everyone. most enjoyable part of the job is just showing up to a great staff and environment.
good,"This is my current work place and I have to say I have never had more fun at work than when I work here. The employees are all welcoming and friendly, the management is friendly and understanding of my school/work balance that I must maintain in order to have a successful time as a student in college. Good place to work for college kids."
good,"Great experience in retail, involves a lot of work but it is fun at the same time. "
good,"I Enjoyed working for this company, I got to meet a lot of players from different sports, the manager was very friendly and helpful"
good,"A typical work day starts by visually scanning shoes to make sure the right shoes were in the right boxes. If there was an error found we had to fix it. Most days there were serval tasks that had to be completed in the stock room away from the customers eye so we would have to balance our time to make sure we can complete the tasks while also servicing our customers. I learned how to manage my time a little better and also i learned a lot about how shoes can affect a person's whole body. Management changed from time to time. For the most part the management was laid back and trusted people to do their job, when they had to empahsis certain things or even correct the employees they were stern but fair which I really respected. The hardest part of the job was maybe the simplicity of parts of my job, for instance after making sure all the shows were in the proper boxs we had to count all the boxs in the section we covered and in one section there were hundreds of boxs, while it sounds and is easy I at times got distracted by customers and management and lost track of the count and had to begin again. The most enjoyable part of this job has to be the poeple I came in contact with, not only the people i work with but also the customers made my job enjoyable."
good,Everyday has similar tasks. Very repetitive. Customer Service is by far your number one priority. One advantage to working here is you get to show how passionate you are about sports.
good,"I loved my job, I learned more about football then I though anyone could. I also learned about sports I had no clue existed..."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is providing help to young athletes by recommending products that satisfy their needs.
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical day at work is doing little jobs around the front end and helping customers. I have learned how to lead people and motivate them. The managers are wonderful, down-to-earth people. They are very easy to get along with. My co-workers are great. There are the really good ones and then there are some that are not so great. The hardest part of the job is keeping my cool and being patient with the customers. The most enjoyable part is the job as a whole and the people I work with."
good,"A typical day at work involves janitoral cleaning, store walking, cashier, stocking and unloading, and also helping customers."
good,"a typical work day was busy from start to finish, as associate we were never left out of the loop as to daily goals and how the company was doing doing as a whole as how we compared to the other distribution centers. teams were competitive and that made for a fast day and good number . we had a a basketball court outside and their were always raffles, family fun days, and good attendance awards amongst others. the most enjoyable part of my job was my schedule it allowed me to get ample rest to be productive the next day even if i had other things to do before work."
good,good part-time job or career
good,It is a good company to seek footing in as the company is constantly growing and there is room to move up.
good,You really get a sense of family when you work here. Managers are understanding and friendly but at the same time push you to achieve goals there. Constantly gave you opportunity for more hours and gave you things to do throughout the day.
good,Very good place to start and work your way up was only there two months and moved up to a group lead position loved the management HR the controllers workers just an overall exciting great place to work
good,"During my time at Dicks, I was able to make lifetime relationships with some real genuine people. Some days were busier than others but the staff was always equipped and ready for the day. The hardest part of the job was dealing with frustrated customers who weren't getting their way. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smile on a customers face when you helped them find that perfect pair of shoes."
good,"While working at Dicks Sporting Goods in Rockaway I was provided a exciting work environment that allowed going to work to be enjoyable. The management was fantastic always making sure we had everything we needed and checking in on us, while also providing a great customer service environment. The employees were always friendly towards customers and were always able to meet the companies goals by the end of the day. It was a great experience to work here."
good,Great work place with great people. Many different chances to advance and learn within new departments of the company. Great job experience and culture.
good,The environment at the Florence location was overall good.  The management there as far as the General Manager was excellent.  Very straight forward and consistent.
good,"I will be going into my senior of college in the fall and working at DSG this past summer has been a great experience! Going into the summer I had no idea what software/frameworks I'd be working with, but the team I was placed on was super helpful at getting me up to speed and giving me the space to ask plenty of questions."
good,"It was a fun place to work. You can meet everyone in the other departments as well, so it was new everyday. They will work you a lot if you want that so its nice."
good,"I have worked at two separate locations in two separate districts and both were great. I wish I would have picked this as my first job (but I picked Starbucks and that was HORRIBLE). But if you are looking for a place to start working for the first time, this is defintiely an option. I will say though, that the bigger the store and the more sales it makes, the more laid back it will be because they can afford to have more people on the floor to divide the work load. If the sales are not as great, or its a smaller store, be ready to run around a lot. If you are looking for a job where you get to stand around all day and do nothing, its not Dick's. There is always something to fold, hang, fix, or someone to help. It can be fast paced at times, depending on the sales going on, time of year, and hour of the day. But the management is great and they work with you. They let you know how to improve, instead of just up and firing you. There's also an employee discount: I got 25% off everything except bikes and workout equipment, those are 10% I believe. They reward you and recognize you for reaching marks in sales and customer reviews. They sit with you at the end of the year to go through evaluations and give you a raise if you did well. So you dont have to worry about staying at the same pay. I left the company to focus more on my degree, but if I could go back to work there, I would."
good,"Working at DSG was always exciting, a fast-paced job, and helped me hone in my customer service abilities. Overall it was a perfect starter job and helped set a strong base for my professional career moving forward."
good,I liked the staff and everyone was very friendly if not a smidge backhanded in their words about other workers. This is to be expected when the workers are a little younger.
good,"It is a very fun workplace! I love conversing with the customers, as it is always good to see a familiar face who strikes up a short conversation duribf the transaction!"
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Everyone does their share of work and helps each other for the most part. It is a great work environment and not too stressful. It is pretty laid back and the work is easy, but occasionally gets busy and fast paced around holidays. They are flexible with work hours and school. Definitely recommend to a friend."
good,Made some great people there who are fun and awesome to work with. It is a place I would recommend to someone who loves sports and a nice place to start working.
good,Dicks was a very good warehouse it was well organized and rule regulated. Fast paste but manageable. Dicks is a great place to learn and utilize warehouse skills.
good,Helping customers find what they need. Ringing them up if the line got to long. Fixed the department according to planograms. Management was very friendly. Fun place to work the employees are all nice.
good,"I love working with my customers, co-workers and peers.  Great environment and clean.  I've learned how to do inventory and store settings.  Only fault is not enough hours."
good,if you need a part time job. Full time? Maybe after a while. but otherwise good atmosphere and lots of great great great employees to work alongside...
good,"Working at dicks is a very fun job. It teaches you leadership skills, organization skills, time management, money distribution."
good,"Everyday at work is fun and fast paced. there is never a dull moment on the floor! If you love sports, and have the desire to work in  a sports themed environment, then this is the place you want to be!"
good,Excellent work experience. Great first job for anyone. Loved the environment and loved helping people find their perfect pair of cleats or perfect pair of gloves. Would recommend to anyone
good,The corporate facilities are amazing. The employees are very helpful and care about the work that is done. Everyone takes pride in their job and cares about their peers.
good,"I absolutely loved working here. The people were friendly, and the pay was decent. I would definitely work for this company again. I learned how to upsell products and how to pitch things like credit cards and warranties."
good,"This retail store has by far been my favorite of any retail store that I have had the pleasure of working in. I was able to work in every department, so I got to engage in many different types of customers. This store had many items that I would use in my personal life because I am a big health advocate and sports players"
good,Enjoy the work environment and awesome management. Hardest part is dealing with moody customers some don't understand when were busy and staff is trying their best to assist everyone but they amount of customers we have obviously they greatly out number us. (for some reason customers hate having to wait 3 minutes in checkout line which we can't help when theres only so many people we can pull from the floor to help out with the rush). Wish corporate would give us more hours to better staff for busy times of the day.
good,Dick's was a great place to work always willing to push you in your job desires willing to work with your schedule. I would do anything and everything that told me to do. I learn how to treat and work with a customer so they walk out of the store not only happy but with what they were looking for and anything else they could think of. Management was good most of the time someday it seemed like they were not all on the same track. Overall a good place to work.
good,They have extensive customer service training that you must complete before they will put you on the floor.  I learned a great deal about how to deal with customers effectively and how to handle difficult people.
good,"I truly love working here its fun, everyone is very nice, the costumers are very nice as well but you have to be patient with them. The store works fine but the management is weak at least in the I worked in."
good,"Run a box of $25,000,000 in sales both sales and Operations, Stay on top of top 100 sale items order additional goods, train associates to achieve great customer service and maintain margins."
good,"The average day at work was fast paced and enjoyable. The coworkers where a blast. I learned how intense a busy work environment can get, great customer service tips, and the ability to adapt. Management was very numbers focused, as they should be. They consistently brought out the best in their employees. This was definitely the most enjoyable, difficult, and fun job I have ever had."
good,"The average day was wonderful with coworkers, you wanted to pursue success and so did your coworkers. The managers were strict but fair usually. You always met your hours."
good,"On a regular day I would start off with imputing the deposits from the day before, make sure tills were set to the right amount, and front end was stocked with this needed throughout the day. I would deal with any issues customers had with sales, coupons, and returns. I was the head cashier and made sure everything went smoothly throughout the day. Did hourly metric updates informing staff where we were at with sales, reward cards, and credit cards. I absolutely loved my job, I had been there for 3 years, but felt like I was stuck with the company which didn't provide me a place to grow."
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in and always organized with friendly staff and team members. The customers are very diverse and are interested in working with the different members of the team. Ever since I was hired, I have had nothing but positive outlooks and experiences from the job"
good,The people I get to work with every shift are fun and determined. We know the perfect balance of customer service as well as having fun doing it. The managers are also very nice and understanding if something comes up last minute. The scheduling is something that needs to be worked on. There has been a bunch of times where I have requested off and it has gotten approved but they still schedule me for that shift.
good,"I love it great atmosphere! The employees are great the service and attention is awesome, and they are very knowledgeable."
good,"Merchandising training program - Rotational program which gives comprehensive experience in Buying, PD, Planning and Allocations and Replenishment. "

good,It is a fun atmosphere and the coworkers are so understanding! The managers are also understanding when it comes to certain things that go on in my life.
good,"overall it is a very good place to work. I work as a cashier as well as occasionally in apparel. My co-workers are great, they are fun to be around and for the most part help make work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is trying to get people to start scorecards and credit cards."
good,Communicate with Virginia State Police to complete firearm sales while maintaining the ATF guidelines. Work and manage as the lead associate overseeing the lodge section and ensuring customers are happy and will return. I make hard sales while providing customer service and keeping up with corporate standards.
good,I started working here before the store opened.  I loved coming into work every day.  The managers are great and so are the people I work with.  They're all so friendly.
good,"the company was great to work with, you learn about alot of different departments also team work, there's good people around to work with and you can learn a lot of responsibility, etc."
good,"I have really enjoyed my time at Dicks Sporting Goods. The management team has always treated me very well, and my co-workers have been great. Everyone is always willing to help each other and offer advice when needed. Setting high goals and expecting you to achieve those goals are things that the management team and corporate office expect of their employees."
good,fun environment helpful workers and learned a lot good training but could be a little more training and a little more help would be good as well
good,"Easy and fun, worked with great people, management wasn't bad. i had fun, its a great job if you're in school, which most people were."
good,Meeting new people on a daily basis and the majority leaving with a smile is always rewarding.  The management and the co-workers at this particular store are all a great group to work with and I haven't had a day yet where I have regretted applying there.
good,"While I attended school, Dicks was able to accommodate for my school schedule and work me when I could. When I needed days off, Dicks didn't have a problem giving me those days off. The atomsphere is always great."
good,"Love the people I work with. I enjoy coming to work knowing I will have a fun time with everyone. "
good,"•	Maintained stock and processed inventory "
good,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Since starting my employment with Dick's Sporting Goods in May 2013, I have become strongly developed my skills in customer service, cash handling, time management, multitasking, and organization. The first task I finish after clocking in is recovering my department. Upon completion of the recovery I either build or repair whatever bikes are in line while interacting with customers in the store. If there are no builds or repairs to complete I either assist other coworkers in their departments or do a task assigned to me by a manager. My managers are just as eager to lend me a hand when I get in the weeds which makes for a great, friendly workplace. Most of my coworkers are a direct reflection of management so going to Dick's Sporting Goods each day isn't seen as a chore but more of a chance to engage customers, exhort coworkers, and learn something new. The most difficult part of being an employee of Dick's Sporting Goods has to be competing with other stores and figuring out how to better ourselves as a team and individual each shift. The days I enjoy most are the ones where I get to build a few bikes, teach someone how to ride a bike, then sell one or two combined with as many accessories as needed and extra insurance to protect the customer and get my name on a board for providing excellent customer service."
good,"This isn't a career for me but going to school, it is one of the best places to work.  Everyone there looks out for each other and management doesn't look down on you or want you to mess up they actually help you."
good,"My recommendations would be a good place to work. Everyday a new challenge in a industry that is constantly changing and growing. The training you received is first class and the associates look forward in learning new and better ways to improve their work performance. Your success with this company is in  the hands of the associates, how well they can follow policy and procedures determine their future . Great people to work with that knows their job. Do to job turn over make the work challenging for one to do their job effectively."
good,"I assisted many customer's in the best choices for athletic apparel.  Prior to that I assisted my internal customer's with payroll questions and HR support."
good,"I enjoy working with my staff, and my piers as well as the senior management team to achieve our goals as a store."
good,I absolutely love Dick's sporting goods and awesome company to work for and the management team is awesome!
good,"Set schedule, weekends off, great supervisors, nice employees,"
good,"This company has taught me the true meaning of taking initiative and has pushed me to better myself not only as an employee but also as a person. I enjoy taking on more responsibility because I know I can handle it and complete all of my work in a timely manner. I also enjoy customer service and making sure all customers receive outstanding customer service and leave completely satisfied.The best part of my job is when customers come back into the store asking for me personally to assist them with anything from picking out items on their shopping list, to processing their return on the register because they trust me with their transactions. I enjoy all aspects of my job; however, I do not enjoy when I see emplopyees that do not take pride in their job and the company they work for. I believe in integrity, a positive attitude and outstanding customer service."
good,"Besides working with the public and trying to fix the complaints of the customers, the managers were extremely helpful and kind. The workers there were friendly and easy to get along with. That is what, to me, is really important. Having a place to work where the environment is stressful but the workers who are in it with each other are supporting each other."
good,"I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods for a year and had the opportunity to work in multiple departments throughout the store. Majority of the management started out as a store associate within the company and now they're department, store, and district managers.

good,"There is a strong emphasis put on quality customer service and employee morale. There is always something to do. If you are looking for a place you can kick back and earn an easy check however, this is not the place for you. It's fast paced and there is always a project to work on. People who aren't people persons usually don't last long either as negative energy is not received well."

good,"While working at Dick's Sporting Goods, I gained experience and many skills that have helped me and continue to help throughout my retail career, such as customer - associate connections and the ability to move throughout different departments in the store. This allowed me to become more versatile. The management was great and very understanding toward students, which made up a majority of the staff and made me feel right at home. The hardest part of the job would be an instance in which we were not able to give the customer what they wanted, but that rarely happened because of the surplus of resources the company and store provided."
good,Working at Dick's was my favorite job i've ever had. The training was fun to go through and they threw me right into the mix early which i wasn't expecting but it worked. I loved the environment and the people I worked worth. Excellent establishment and managers I highly recommend!

The company is full of excited, kind, and dedicated people and the culture is amazing. It's laid back but also fast-paced and challenging. As an intern, I was placed in a Buying role, but was exposed to different areas of the business as well. A large focus of the internship program is your final project, which is presented during the last weeks of your internship. Overall, this was a very valuable experience and I feel very lucky to have spent my summer here!"
good,Great people and great leads willing to  help you whenever you needed. Fast paced job if your a sorter or time management if your loader but they will work with you if your not good in one position they will move you to another section. They won't just fire you.
good,"The Environment was so easy going and fun. Great co workers and fun, but strict management. Learned a lot of new thing and made great bonds.

good,Great place to work. It's fast paced and demanding but the staff is always friendly. They were very welcoming on my first day! I only left because of not getting enough pay for the extra work I was doing.
good,"DSG was overall a great place to work at, but the store manager that was active while I was there was subpar. A typical day at work involved quickly helping multiple customers at once and juggling their needs. The hardest part of the job was handling a busy customer flow while trying to do resets."

good,"In the golf department you constantly need to keep up with your knowledge for the new products that come out.  I enjoy working with the employee younger generation. You need to make sure that you greet every customer that comes into your department and offer assistance.  The hardest part of my job would be standing on a concrete floor, without being able to get off your feet occasionally.  The most enjoyable part would be that you keep up with the new equipment that is a constant changeover, and help customers find the product that would benefit their own game.  I love my manager!  She is an extremely hard working manager who expects her employees to meet her expectations in doing their job."

good,This is a great starter job for high schoolers and college students. It teaches you basic professionalism and cash handling skills. There is also lots of room to grow.
good,"Dick's Sporting Goods gave me an opportunity to manager a team of 16 associates.  I learned a great deal about systems and system implementations.  The people I worked with were great.  The company was aggressive and always looking to improve and get better.  During the time I was at Dick's Sporting Goods the company store count grew by a multiple of 10.  The work was both challenging and rewarding.  Through automation the Accounts Payable Department was able to manage the store growth without adding staff in the analyst ranks.      "
good,I love it. Management is very well put together and organized. Environment is great. The people I work around is great co workers and I just found out that I probably will be getting a promotion soon.

good,"My experience with this company is almost inexplicable. This was my first job and they worked with me with my college schedule and even allowed me to relocate when I transferred schools. This company has done nothing but allow me to flourish and grow as an adult. I joined this company when I was 18 and I was promoted to a leadership position early on, something that was difficult to tackle initially, however with the guidance of other managers and superiors I was able to learn to lead and guide others. Very fast-paced environment that requires an attention to detail at times and requires good communication skills."
good,"Great place to work, alot of team work, while communication needs work,the general attitude between people both associates and management are fairly easy and simple."
good,Helping customers everyday and selling shoes. What could be better then that? Always room for promotions. Work hard and you will get somewhere with that company.
good,"Simply put - I love my job!"
good,"When i was hired, it was an amazing job, but when i was let go i was told i would be rehired 3 months after, and i was never hired. I was led on and horrible management led to me never being rehired. They had made claims of how they couldn't wait to rehire me. The issue was they overstaffed and never had any available room to rehire me. So the trust of the store managers were lost."

good,Job is a stressful job if you make it one. Often busy because of the size of the store. co workers are cool and friendly. Best part of the job for me was to see all the sports merchandise we had in store.
good,I liked working at dicks sporting goods. Its was a task to learn everything but I love the challenges.  What I enjoyed most about the job was my co workers . They were like family .  And helping the customers.  Customers are always number 1.
good,"My header says it all. From the co-workers to the management to the overall job tasks I had, Dicks Sporting Goods was hands down my favorite job. Not only was it fun, but it taught (management/procedures) how to manage my time wisely, be productive, responsible, give better customer service, and a taste of how retail works. My managers were all like friends and my co-workers became my close friends outside of work. The only hard part was having to do inventory overnight."
good,I love my job everyday! The place is just a fun laid back place to work but when it's time to get stuff done it gets done successful which I like a lot
good,Each location I've worked at has great management and great employees. Going to work is fun. It's not stressful like so many retail jobs can be. 10/10 would recommend.
good,"Fun place and people to work with"
good,"I would go to the back where I would get a radio and head set before work so I would be able to communicate with other employees if needed. I would get to the register and make sure I had to full set up. would work with customers throughout the day. when it would get slow , I would put returned or unwanted items back and would make sure everything was cleaned and well kept in the front end. Everyone was super nice , well respected and worked well as a team."
good,"This store has the absolute BEST GROUP OF ASSOCIATES working in one location and there is at least 50 Employees that work there (if not more)... Never a Dull moment .. Customers are also great.. I Absolutely LOVED every minute working here, with an exception of the hours and pay,,, I have 2 boys ages 12 & 10, so of course retail hours was a little tougher and pay wasn't near enough to be a single mom and having a $5.00 an hour PAY CUT from what I had received at previous job."
good,I enjoyed watching and handling children all day. I do it at home so it wasn't hard for me to do it and get paid. I've been a member of the YMCA since I was 12 so it was a great experience being behind on the front end running the show.
good,"Great company, flexible hours, great work / life balance."
good,"A typical work day at Dick's Sporting Goods would consist of plenty work, productivity in a good way, and a lot of learning experiences. The management was always hopeful and would add input with no hesitation. The co-workers provided a friendly working atmosphere that made it fun to be at work. The hardest part of the job would be the departure once the season was over and what I enjoyed the most was being knowledgeable about different sports and outing events."

good,"A typical day at work for me is clocking in on time, perhaps a couple minutes early, helping 50+ customers and collaborating with my fellow employees to get a few tasks done through out the day. After my duties have been completed i proceed to clock out and look forward to what the next day beholds for me."
good,I have learned to communicate effectively with others also how to work independently with making deadlines set by superior. I have also learned to create and maintain spreadsheets.

good,"I begin by walking the floor to gather information from the previous shift and read my pass-off emails.  Communicate with all department managers to review the business needs for the day.  Prepare the daily budget and put a plan in place to ensure that we exceed budget.  Communicate all information with my supervisors and leads that needs to be covered during the start up meetings. Then I would attend the start up meeting.  Ensure that all associates report to their work stations in a timely fashion. I then would attend the daily managers production meeting. Review the prior day's department and associate production reports. Meet daily with the safety manager and review new guidelines and safety topics for the following day's start up meetings. Attend any scheduled meeting with the GM.  Review all disciplinary actions that were handed in by the supervisors prior to turning them in to human resources to ensure accuracy.  Attend daily afternoon managers meeting with all outbound up to the minute reports to cover with all operations managers and our GM.  Plan the first two hours of the next shifts production.  Ensure that all areas are clean and setup for the next shift so they are able to begin production right after their start up meeting ends. Review supervisors pass-off information, ensure all supplies are ordered and attend the second shift pass-off meeting.  Communicate all areas of improvement, special projects and call off's.

This is usually by helping fold new clothing, hanging clothing, and ticket various items. You learn to multitask if you don't already, but also how to manage you time more appropriately through the day. All the co-workers are very friendly as well as helpful with new hires. The hardest part of the job is being able to a provide speedy but accurate check out while needing a price check. Co-workers are usually fast about price checks, but this does slow the check out process down. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that the company is flexible around my college course schedule, but also providing excellent assistance to a customer and being commended for the hard work."

good,"Working as a bike tech gives me plenty of experience working on and fixing bikes. When not offering excellent customer service, tasks include building and repairing bikes, and cleaning and organizing various departments. The management is very understanding and is willing to work with you on many topics, work and non work related. It is easy to communicate with them and get your point across. Initially assigned as an apparel associate and moving to bikes has given me a solid grasp of everything in the big, two story store, from camping equipment, to bike accessories, to water sport items, to football and soccer equipment, and different clothing and footwear needs. Being at the store for the time I have has allowed me to improve my time management skills and meet deadlines when necessary. The other employees are easy to get along with and talk to. Since customer service in the primary focus, employees are personable and articulate. On any given day, there is maybe an hour or two that can become really hectic. This small time span can be filled with an endless stream of guests with various needs while managing other tasks assigned by management. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a satisfied guest pleased with a huge smile from the service you provided. The discount is also a bonus incentive."

What I learned at Dick's was to always keep a positive attitude. Your most angry customer can become one of the nicest people once you figure out the problem and help come to a solution. I learned how to take lead when needed and to not be afraid at the task at hand. The management is pretty reasonable and they really do have their employee's in their best interest. They do what they can to work with a schedule to best fit your availability. The hardest part of the job is to keep busy when we aren't so busy. We have such a great recovery team that there isn't much work to be done when there are no customers to assist.

good,"Working at DICKS DC has been great so far, they have and maintained a very safe working environment along with a friendly and positive one. Have learned to do and work in all of the positions (receiving, loading, clerical, processor). Typical day at work would be the fact you are active all day, moving from one side to the other, working with others and learning new things each and every day. Getting certified on the heavy equipment that is offered to use when doing certain tasks in the warehouse, learned to use all the machines also. Hardest thing while working here would have to be is loading, considering you have a certain amount of time to unload a 7ft pallet in a trailer along with play Tetris in it to make sure items are received in excellent condition to the stores. Most enjoyable would be the people you meet and get to work with in the warehouse."

I learned a lot about how to sell what was more beneficial, as well as specific details about certain products. My managers were the best people, they were always willing to help out and never made co-workers feel as though the management was ""better"" than them. I loved being social with customers, even if they didn't buy anything. Often customers would come back and ask just for me to help them because they loved the customer service I could provide."

good,"Working at Dick's was an amazing experience. I've worked with plenty of different personalities, but it worked out quite fine. The store is big and unique with plenty of strategies to woo their consumers. They never do the same thing every day. It's always something new like a new look or new products. I've learned how to work with different types of attitudes when dealing with costumers. Some were very nice, and some were rude, but I didn't let that stop my great costumer service. I've also learned that hard work and dedication really pays off. My co-workers were lovely. I got along with everyone, because I'm such a people's person with a lovely spirit. My co-workers loved to see me walking in the door and they made sure I knew everything they knew. Any mistakes that I made in the beginning, they were there to help me along the way. The managers were very sweet also. They made sure everyone was doing their job, but didn't hover them too much.The hardest part of my job probably was not being able to provide the costumers with proper information on certain things that they might have questioned. I never wanted to not have an answer for them. My most enjoyable part of the job though, might have to be being able to properly assist the costumers with what they needed help with, and being able to interact with them and co-workers on a family fun day. We were allowed to play basketball and ping pong on those days. Overall, my experience at Dick's was exciting and different. I got to meet new people and enjoyed every bit of it."

good,"I love working here. My co workers are great. Our CSS's are awesome and very helpful. Management is great. They show great appreciation for putting in your best work. My first couple months into working here, picking up extra shifts, coming in when I was called in, and helping out where ever I could earned myself employee of the month. Which will look good on a future job application. I don't expect to be here forever.. Unless I get a major raise. It would be nice if part time employees could receive benefits. I love my work family. It's like we're mostly a team. You know what I mean, every team has that bad apple. But you learn to grow past it and not let it bother you. For the most part, I love my job!"

We were a family there."

good,"The managers, and co-workers were awesome!! We all contributed working together as a team getting the store opened. Dicks Sporting Goods is a fun environment to work in if you're into sports! The most enjoyable part of working at Dicks, is that you share your passion with each and every customer who walks into the store. The hardest part would be the recovering after and before store opened. Our managers would make us refold each and every piece of clothing that was unfolded during the day because we know customers love to walk into a clean and organized store where its easy to find what they need. Also the managers are very understanding."
