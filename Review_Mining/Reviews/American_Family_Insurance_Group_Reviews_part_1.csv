rating,review
bad,I have worked for amazing Agencies and not so great agencies. Surprised to discover there is no reprcusissions for illegal activity within agencies. They're all independent contractors and allowed to do unthinkable things if they produce business. Hostile work environments are not uncommon if you choose the wrong agent to work for!
bad,The agents in this company are weak.  They will look to you to carry the load while they do nothing.  No benefits.  You just get completely taken advantage of.
bad,Company does not represent to the employees what they sell to their customers. I would not recommend anyone waste their time trying to become a insurance agent at AMFAM
bad,I would not recommend working for American Family. I worked there for over 15 years and they did not care about me as an employee. Was terminated for being off for Personal Reasons.
bad,"Unqualified people get hired while qualified people get pushed aside.  I saw several people who had no business get interviews and hired, while people who were far more qualified didn't even get an interviews.  When those qualified people asked management why they were hired, they were told they needed more experience, while others who had no prior experience get those open jobs."
bad,More training for certificates and under staffed. Manager was out of the office frequently. Clients did not receive insurance cards or call backs. Hours where not convenient.
bad,"Lomira  location was terrible. Owner/ Operater expected newly "
bad,"American Family is a good place to work or, however they are always changing agent's which always makes the centers have to change workers and they are always having different people all the time."
bad,If you’re on a call for a lengthy amount of time and/or need to go into make busy to finish up your call you will receive a skpe asking why?  Your manager has little to no contact with you.  Their always in meetings or staring at their computer to see how long you’re on a call.  Worst place I’ve ever worked.  It’s a call center and the quality of some of the people they hire is questionable. Lastly changes in procedures comes in the form of an email and they bury you in emails. They’re more worried about quantity of calls you take then quality of service.
bad,My supervisor was distant and unsympathetic when family issues arose.  He was a micromanager who made you afraid to go to the restroom.  Worst job experience of my life.
bad,"Awful "
bad,This agent was quite particular with the right personality match could have been a great boss. However with her inconsistencies and rapid mood changes I quickly learned this was not the right fit for me.
bad,Insurance is a very dry business.  Lot of terminology.  Small office worked part time.  The  Agent relied on myself and the other officer worker to build his agency even though we were not in sales.   Glad I left before he was asked to leave the company.
bad,"Management was very rude, was constantly stressed out and took it out on employees. Pay was very poor. made it very difficult to work there and for the amount of work you did you could not get done in the 40 hours and would not allow overtime which made you very stressed out."
bad,"I worked for a agent that was very unorganized, unprofessional and hardly worked in the office. Always an excuse to get her out of the office. not dependable at all"
bad,"A typical day at work would be at your desk, you cannot go to the restroom unless you're on break. It is really hard to move up in the company unless you know someone."
bad,"I had been with american family insurance for multiple years, and honestly I loved it at first but before I know it i was been used and abused, working 14 hour days 6 days a week for a 28k salary."
bad,I didn't not have a good experience. The agent I was with was an alcoholic and the agency closed shortly after I left. Compensation was low and sales goals made it impossible to get commission.
bad,If your into sales great. If not this job is certainly not for you. I had to call people to try to sell insurance who were angry they were being contacted and when i wasn't doing that it was stressful dealing with all the claims and legality that went with them.
bad,My local agency is what is throwing me off. the owner of the agency doesn't care about his employees let alone his customers. never calls them back which in turn made the employees look bad. never treated them right. called the company about things agent was doing that were illegal and the company just gave him a slap on the wrist.
bad,input information and changes to pending check disbursements verified checks typed policy numbers on checks input amount into cash system completed deposit slips and answered telephone with computer database to answer questions.
bad,A typical day at work consisted of answering inbound calls and assisting the customer to the best of our ability; if the situation was unable to be managed there were always other avenues.
bad,"Simply, not a good place to work if you would like to be valued within a company. It is difficult to receive unbiased feedback and there is no room for growth."
bad,"This may have been the worst job I ever had.  Company is not ethical, my agent was incompetent.  Software was horrible, still using the DOS system.  Always felt I was misleading my customers."
bad,"Consultants were brought in to cut corners and save money.  First line leadership is not empowered to make decisions, they are not trusted and everything is dictated from exec level.  For example, leaders cannot review or rate their own employees, they must calibrate with director level and they must agree with your ratings.  Metrics are typically inaccurate or non existent.  Decisions are made from the top without consideration from the folks working the jobs.  Transparency does not exist any longer.  Company is following the Liberty Mutual model for the most part, and we have abandoned being ""Customer Driven"".  Tenured/experienced employees are being pushed out for cheaper replacements, who do not have the skills to handle claims.  Talk to your people who work the jobs day to day, listen to their input, it's the most valuable feedback you will ever receive."
bad,"Shift in culture and upper management. Cuts being made across the board so that execs can secure their 7 figure bonuses. Reduction in roles in the claim department, struggling to staff appropriately. Adjusters are drowning currently and morale is at rock bottom.  Think about the impacts of your changes before implementing them. We are in a maddening vicious cycle of change, and continually end up back where we started."

We are in a maddening vicious cycle of change, and continually end up back where we started."
bad,"Culture has changed to quantity over quality. Grind front line adjusters into the ground, churn and burn mentality has taken over. Droves of experienced adjusters have left and walked out tons of talent going to competing brands. Claims remain understaffed and focus on the customer is truly a dying brand"
bad,"12 hour workday"
bad,"I don't have much to say about this company other than they fired people on a monthly basis.  The leadership wasn't professional, and they were not honest."
bad,"No one wants to train or help you, but then criticizes when errors are made. Rampant unethical behaviors and no one does anything about it! BEWARE-RUN!"
bad,"This is a good place to work if you want to make above minimum wage and are in your early 20s.  If you have a degree and want to have advancement opportunities, then keep looking.  This is not the place for you.  Coworkers are okay, but managers are relatives and very old friends and they do show a lot of favoritism or singling out people.  Its a terrible culture.  For a company to have the word ""family"" in their name, it's really a joke."
bad,"Great selling all the product that are offered. Recommending the right product for the customers. Helping employer with any other "
bad,"Corporate promotions are completely based on who you know, not what you know. Promotions are definitely not based on your job performance. In fact, many manager and director positions are never posted internally … just shared with one or two people to ‘apply’ to the job. "
bad,I worked for two agencies and middle management closed both
bad,Temp to hire position in Billing with very little training before released onto the floor.
bad,"Prices are not competitive in the insurance market. Computer systems are antiquated and difficult to use. After being hired with the assumption that I would start the agent-in-training program in four months, I was told that I could not be employed by Am-Fam due to a misdemeanor charge from eight years ago that had been expunged from my record. I had disclosed the charge on my application prior to accepting employment with Am-Fam, and was told by my hiring agent that it was not a problem. I had already obtained my P&C license and had been working in the insurance industry for more than two years before I became employed with Am-Fam. After working for industry giants like Farmers, JP Morgan Chase and BBVA Compass, I've found that Am-Fam is still the only company who has had an issue with this. After some confusion, Am-Fam's legal department said that all issues were cleared up, but the district manager pressured my sponsoring agent to fire me anyway. Eventually I was ""laid off,"" along with the agency's other employee, because the agent could not afford to pay my salary. A year later, while employed with another insurance agency, I got a call from an employee who worked for the same agent and was going through the same thing- getting laid off because the agent couldn't afford to pay her. That agent has since left the company, claiming they didn't pay what she'd been promised after she inherited a book of business from yet another agent. I later worked with a successful personal banker who had gone through something similar with Am-Fam and had been forced to shutter her agency"
bad,I worked at this company for about 8 months and hours got cut and wasn't getting paid for the hours worked.
bad,Agent was difficult to work for-she took me from full to part time in a month due to not enough work. Not a positive working experience
bad,"That is the only good thing I can think to say about working here. Good snacks during training. The agent /owner I work for-with  was very toxic, not the place to work if you like decent people"
bad,Stay away from this company. You will work late or early to finish your daily assignments. You will not get compensated for working extra hours every day. Human Resources and management do not care and if you speak up would be terminated and replaced. This is very typical in claims units no time to work and have fun while doing it. Management typically spend the day watching employees from their computers and having long lunch hours and useless meetings while you are out working the streets.
bad,First off I worked there for a little over a year which was supposed to be taking payments and answering phone calls entry level turned into cold calling for sales and etc. for still only $9/hr!
bad,Would not recommend (at least not in Illinois and the management at the state office.  Typical day is very busy and management does not really help or care.
bad,They set their employees up for failure and the management is never available for questions or assistance of any kind. The computer system goes down on a regular basis.
bad,"This was one of the worse jobs I have ever had.  Management deliberately caused tension between co-workers, he was completely incompetent, would talk down to his all female staff as if they were stupid due to their gender in front of clients, even though he was unable to actually perform the basic duties himself to run his agency.  He was unprofessional and blamed mistakes on his part on others.  There were no benefits and low pay. You never knew what you were going to walk into on a daily basis."
bad,"Unstable job, closing and consolidating offices displacing employees with little notice and no options, expensive insurance, low salary, lack of communication from management and leadership, no value placed on support employees."
bad,The legal staff is small and the management can have a level of favoritism. There is very little training once your in your position and there is a lot of non legal minutia that gets in the way of getting your job done and is held over your head and use as discipline.
bad,"If you want a manager to tell you, you can have a 45 minute lunch with a 15 minute morning break and a 10 minute afternoon break  OR you have take a 70 minute lunch and no breaks except to go to the bathroom, no socializing. I had to be at my desk and ready by 8:35am, twice I was walking in at 8:37am and was called by my manager asking where I was. You MUST be at your desk 5+ every day."
bad,"If you don’t mind a company that plays favorites and only offers opportunities for the favorites no matter how competent, micro managerial, file audits that are degrading and demoralizing and a culture that struggles to keep not only employees but now managers with no plans to replace, only add the work to those that are there, then I would caution a candidate to get what is promised in writing and have the mind set that you can not honk for yourself and just say yes to what is told to you then you might be a good fit for this company."
bad,I would not recommend very stressful . Management just walks around to get steps in. Managers play favorites. Felt manager was racist. People got away with stuff that they should not have manager not good at confrontation. Unprofessional  and fake. You will only advance if in the click but no growth opportunity. High turnover.
bad,The area office does not share leads with agents. They keep them for themselves or give to their favorite coordinators so if your coordinator is not a favorite then you are out of luck.
bad,"American Family management is behind the times.  The old boys' network reward who you knew, not what you knew.  Incompetence rose to the top and employee morale sunk to the bottom."
bad,"Helped me get p&c license and thats about all that was good. Management would not help what so ever, They will blame their errors on you and throw you under the bus when their error is brought up by the customers."
bad,The company is struggling to find their way to keep current with claims while cutting costs. There is a vision but no plan on how to get there.  They make changes before they actually make a plan.
bad,"long hours "
bad,"sweat shop, forced unpaid overtime, clickish envirnment"
bad,I enjoyed working with the people there. There was no room for growth and the company was not professional including management.
bad,"This is an awful company to work for. It used to have a moderate work/life balance but has changed to a 60hr/week job with zero advancement opportunity. What's worse, when someone does advance it is usually based on nepotism versus actual merit."
bad,"Very toxic place to work, The work life balance is a joke, they expect you to work 10-12 hours a day and on weekends, where is the work life balance there.. you never have time for your family. Management show favorites towards employees, They also pay claims based on the customer, I have seen them pay a claim with the same loss details they denied another- based on the customer. so wrong "
bad,"Managers are in meetings or off celebrating something.  Calls holding in queue & they never help. Lots of judgement, little encouragement. Pressure! It seems you have to either know someone or sleep with someone to get ahead.  If you question anything,  you will not advance."
bad,"I have been here for 20+ years & I quit because they treat employees like dirt. It is not worth the stress they put you through. You are disposable. The culture has changed dramatically over the last 2-3 years. It is open season on the front line field adjusters. They have large territories & claims are dumped on them especially when there are storms. 12 hour days are necessary to keep your head above water. Adjusters are required to issue a payment within 10.5 days of receiving the claim. If not, management will come down hard on them regardless how far you have to travel or even if there are legitimate reasons for a delayed payment. Your name will be on monthly reports regarding your time standards. Management will audit files quarterly & they look for any minor infraction to document & put it in your file. They also have a dept. that randomly calls customers & they evaluate the adjusters service. Their opinions are used against you & again, there are reports that show your ratings that are reviewed every week at your weekly team ""huddle"".  The weekly ""huddle"" is used to display reports and show who is dragging the team numbers down. To keep our sanity, these weekly meetings were referred to ""the weekly beatings will continue until moral improves""."
bad,Territory doubled in size just after hire average drive was 2 1/2 to 3 hours one way.  Co workers were great. Lots of over night travel to fill claim quota.
bad,Thousands of agents who built large successful agencies from scratch were abruptly cut off as a change in contract came. Dig deep do your research and hire a great lawyer to review any contract.  Never trust the district managers words. The goal is to have you build the list of clients and take it away and leave you with nothing. 1099 treated as an employee. If they are willing to give you money up front there is always a catch. Business owners do not get paid salaries. Read the fine print. Contracts even say we can make changes to this contract for any reason at any time. Thus canceling out the entire contract at their will and discretion. There are large forums discussing this company find them first.
bad,Things went downhill pretty quickly after working at American Family for some time. If you can enjoy being tied to your desk in a corporate environment then this job is for you.
bad,I up and relocated only to be fired 6 months later due to sales. My manager who I will not name was not willing to help me and showed favoritism towards certain agents. I only had 2 weeks to turn my numbers around when everyone else had 3 months and I did not start with everyone else. I see exactly how cutthroat corporate can be and this was the worst experience ever. I was not even allowed to post for a different position. I am truly disappointed with my experience with this company and how unfairly I was treated.
bad,"This company is slashing staff in order to meet long term expense reduction goals. Years of slashing expected ahead. Management is very weak and scared to death of losing their well paying jobs. Claims leadership is a circus, and front line staff are being beaten down so bad they are leaving in droves....crushing workday hours required......no integrity left with American Family anymore. Morale is horrible in all offices. Other major carriers are grabbing up ex-AmFam employees everywhere."
bad,I worked here for seven years and never felt secure with my job. Laying off/forcing people into retirement regularly. Poor and unprofessional management.
bad,"Low pay, no benefits, minimal opportunities for advancement. I left a job in which I was making over $75K to try a new career. At AmFam I made $24K plus 4.5% commission with no benefits. I was OK with that if I would have an opportunity to eventually own my own business, which they told me could be 2-3 years. Then, after two years of working my butt off, they said ""we're downsizing so it might be 7-10 years."" Great. I'm 47 years old."
bad,"They make you think it's going to get better, high turnover many people left, they did not plan for the turnover so had to wait for replacements mean time, you were over worked more...it was just insane working expectations...."
bad,"The negative reviews about this company are true.  Recent upper management changes have led to a culture that does not care about it's employees, rather, how much money they can make.  The managers are too busy with meetings to be there for their employees and the branch manager level and up are so out of touch with how to handle claims they are ineffective.  They have created a hostile negative environment.   It's all about who you know not what you know, nor how well you do your job."
bad,"The culture of this company has changed with new management.  Excessive workloads, very high turn over.  Poor leadership has resulted in very poor morale.  The only way to keep up with the workload is to work a minimum of 50 hours/week."
bad,"This company has planned in and out the door dates  Saw it happen to 3 people. Management in Denver is poor and worse in Madison WI"
bad,I had a new manager that didn't know A thing about managing! I got no support from him at all. Stay away if you want a career as a property adjuster....
bad,"There is no job security anymore, they are doing more out sourcing from other countries"
bad,"I have a  severe disability which I do my best daily to not let define me but American Family Insurance never once let me forget how they wished to portray me.  The biased decision making where situations with me were handled differently than those of my peers, the constant haranguing by certain levels of management, and their clear lack of knowledge with regard to any semblance of professionalism and bedside manner in dealing with someone who has a disability. After I received FMLA and they had found out the reason why then were asked to make some minor accommodations, they put a target on me as I found out later they had done to many other individuals with disabilities. American Family Insurance made it known on a routine basis that I was different, that I did not count. they made me stand out, apart from everyone around me. American Family preaches diversity and inclusivity to the public and internally they prey on anyone that doesn’t fit into a little box that can easily be checked off. Although they could not come out and say it, that they made me out to be a monster because from the moment they knew I suffered from Bipolar II disorder they considered me a liability and it came to a head when I was brutally attacked in my home in November of 2017 by someone else who suffered from Mental Illness. The perpetrator was immediately apprehended and eventually convicted but the company chose to recoil then strike, treating me, the victim, like a criminal. American Family Insurance tried every trick in their corporate playbook to get me to quit and I ended up excelling in my position"
bad,"Their rates are high.  Underwriting is a joke.  Their claims dept. Is rated at the very bottom of top 30 insurance companies by J.D. power.  To sell a product, you have to believe in it.  Constant rate increases.  Won't stop cramming life insurance sales down your throat, when their rates aren't competitive.  No room for upward mobility as they are downsizing and not growing.  Even if you have a good month it doesn't show in your paycheck.  Half of these posts on here is home office trying to get the negative posts away from the top.  People are nice there and it has a good work life balance....for sales or agents, but they cut corners in the claims dept and work them way too much.  Claims take forever leaving unhappy customers. Executives make way too much money when this wasn't the case in the early 90s.  They used go make 250,000/ year....now they make 10 million a year. The list goes on."
bad,"Unclear standards, favoritism, unprofessional, just to describe a few. This was not the case for all managers. Numerous incidents of manager speaking poorly about other employees to co workers"
bad,"Managers in other work groups were intelligent and helpful. In IT, there seemed to be negative competition and trust issues. Management has changed since time of employment. Hopefully things have improved, but that starts at the top."
bad,"I enjoyed my work, worked hard to help build book of business.  Back stabbing CSR that did nothing but talk negative about the agent.  Agent really gave no motivation and did not want to work and piled everything on everyone else's desk.  The agent drove expensive cars and had big homes but couldn't pay his producers when ask several times. Most have no respect for employers such as this.  I would never recommend anyone to do business with amfam  or certainly not work there period.  The area managers don't care either.  That's why Amfam is where they are in the Insurance World."
bad,"I worked at American Family Insurance for almost 20 years.  They don't like when you get in the 10-15 year range because you cost them money.  You can work hard and have great reviews but they will try and find something wrong anyway.  So basically you are expected to work to death just to keep up with the demands if you want to be a top performer.  Than they will ask for more!"

bad,I would talk to my team in the morning to see if they needed any help from the day before and the new day. Then I would  have to write reports from the reinspections from the day before. I learned the company has people in upper mangers positions that have no experience in the job they are in. The hardest part of the culture is they do not like people from the east. When I finish a job task that has taken me a week or so that the task would be changed at the last minute to have to re do it and resubmit it the next morning. The best part of the job was helping train the staff and settle hard claims.
bad,This company is downsizing. Manager did not communicate with his staff. Never knew when manager was going to be out.  My coworkers were a pleasure to work with
bad,"Very upset in getting laid off after 30 years. I gave everything, my life to American Family Insurance and hard worker and helped them with CAT losses and other things and WOW they laid me off,  I put in 30 years of my life and I am a hard worker and go over and beyond for a company and get laid off."
bad,"I was expected to know everything eventhough  training was  for a few days, when it was supposed to be for a whole month. Got thrown to do the job with very little training, training of like 3 days. Nobody  had patience when I would ask about something I didn’t  know. I got thrown tasky I had no training on at all. Didnt get trained on the system. "
bad,Company aggressively searched for ways to limit or deny claims rather than look for ways to provide coverage for losses that had occurred. Pay level was high.
bad,The opportunity was awesome however the management was extremely bias and disrespectful. Not the best insurance company for females. I should have done more research on the company before working there.
bad,Will not be compensated for time. Not good pay. Bad management. Poor training. Waste of time. Will not be able to support your family. Not recommended to work here.
bad,"Sales ware down on the mind. That is what caused me to leave and seek employment with the USMC. With that in mind, if someone has a knack for sales, they can make great money selling insurance."
bad,"Don't care about customers at all. Terrible hours and just a rotating door of new people coming in, because the new changes are strictly to save money."
bad,Enjoyed the role I had at American Family.  It is a good company however transition over the past couple of years and management changes proved to be difficult.
bad,Overall good experience in insurance and working with customers on issues of billing and resolving insurance problems.
bad,The agent I worked for was incompetent and it was a difficult situation. I was expected to bring in all the business and often times the policies would not be written correctly for the customers.
bad,The office was drab.  The Owner/Manager needed training on how to manage.  His office and attitude was horrible.  He didn't speak well of or with his clients.  Had no supervisor skills.
bad,"Most managers have been with the company for 18+ years and have never had any other job or attended college in over 18+ years, if at all and therefore, live in a box. For these types of managers, they believe that fear creates engagement and control. They don't understand fairness, positive engagement, team building and leadership. Usually, this is a gossip community of managers that have all crawled up the ladder together and are threatened by anyone that has more knowledge or education than they have. "
bad,"You work 6 days a week, not  much opportunity for overtime.  It requires tons of hard work, not recommended for someone who is struggling- but encouraged for someone who has a strong drive."
bad,AmFam is an old company doing things old ways. They should invest in their management and provide continuous learning opportunites.
bad,I learned that I like the business world from this office position.
bad,"The company outside of the claims department might be a good place to work. The claims department is over worked and under staffed. No work/life balance, management seems to have a ""burn 'em and turn 'em"" attitude, there is a very high turn over rate. The pay for performance ""raises"" are a joke when the max you can receive is .25 cents. The only good thing about working in claims is the job security, but I would recommend doing so with a different insurance carrier."
bad,"Slow office environment. Quoted insurance for P & C found best rates to fill customer needs. Often was out quoted by other insurance companies. Solved billing disputes, called on past dues. Setup Customer reviews for agent to go over coverages,  and sell Life insurance. Processed payments. Performed changes for customers policies."
bad,The pay was low and there was no growth.  There  were no training opportunities.
bad,"Working for an agent was great, learn a great deal working within a small setting, the customers was great to work with, the negative part about working there was that I wasn't offer any benefits."
bad,"I will not elaborate on the working conditions culture at AmFam."
bad,The employees that I worked with we're totally awesome. My manager was horrible.  You get punished for using the bathroom as a claims Care representative. It's a very unhealthy environment to work in. Upper management sacrifices the employees for their own advancement in customer Care
bad,"As per above, spent many hours learning products and then turned loose to wing it.  That's it. A very poor working experience in transitioning to Arkansas."
bad,"Their policies do not make sense & when you question them, you are considered a trouble maker. You are expected to do what they say & just be quiet. You are not valued as a thinking person."
bad,"Favoritism and cronyism are the norms. Cut-throat environment created lots of back-stabbing. ""Pay for Performance"" adds to the negative environment. If you are making under the mean for your position, you are guaranteed a raise. If you are making above the mean, you will NOT receive a raise. If you are in the mean range, only then does pay for performance come into play. Plus, their HR will tell you ""you are not employed there to be a good parent, you are employed to be able to afford being a parent."" Thus issues that may arise concerning your family and/or their health are expected to be ignored during business hours, regardless of importance."
bad,I learned a lot about the insurance industry by working for American Family. It's a great place to learn customer service and sales skills. The negative side of American Family was that they didn't seem to care about you as much as I felt they should.
bad,American Family Insurance and is an organization that cares about protecting ones dreams.
bad,"I really thought this would be a great opportunity but the agent training didn't prepare us for the real world of selling insurance. "
bad,Very poor management at regional office.  Very little respect for employees.  Very negative and cynical culture.  Worst insurance company that I ever worked for.
bad,"My experience at American Family Insurance was beneficial in the sense that I gained a lot of experience in a professional atmosphere. However, ethically, it was one of the most negative experiences I have had."
bad,"Nice people, unrealistic expectations "
bad,They are trying to stay cut cost in the wrong way. They will never be an industry leader treating their employees this way.
bad,"Anyone who has any understanding of work flow and clams processing would be able to identify that managers have little knowledge of the full claims process. "
bad,"Managers are horrible at every level. So much nepotism. Your whole day is scheduled including short breaks. You are punished for going off your schedule, punished for talking too long to a customer, punished for not being able to complete all call work including the actual call in little time. Your job is based off surveys. If a customer is having a bad day regardless if it doesn't have to do with you, another employee, or AMFAM all and decides they want to give a 1 out 5, you're stuck with it. Management makes up policies that don't work and reps suffer the consequences. Software is outdated and slow. CEO seemingly only does podcasts, other forms of social media, and greet celebs. HORRIBLE PLACE!"
bad,"It was a great place to work.  The claims departments is not a positive work environment.  Other parts of the company may be as the company has a great mission, vision and values.  They are not followed by the claims department."
bad,"I would never work there again. the Agent in charge, expected me to do all the work without the compensation. Typical day, input all data, meet with clients get them in and out as quick as possible."
bad,"my boss kept a camera pointed at my desk at all times, i have never been micromanaged before.. my boss was nice but hired me to be her assistant, and then expected me to do sales without paying commissions."
bad,The workplace culture was very clickish. It was very obvious that new co-workers were not welcome. Management was very poor at communicating expectations. Expected duties changed from one day to the next.
bad,"A big office with lots of opportunity to be micromanaged from multiple levels of management. Direction is confusing and at times not clear. "
bad,"It's not what you know, but who you know and if they like you.  They could care less about your degree, work ethics and what you bring to the company.  They do not care that you exceed all goals and have a very pleasant demeanor.  What matters is if they like you or their manager friends like you that determines if you succeed into another position.  The call center in Maryland Heights is very unorganized.  One hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing.  There are no checks and balances in place.  Upper management doesn't care about the culture.  Family members are promoted faster than anyone else."
bad,"Great employees and co-workers!"
bad,"I enjoyed working for the company, just not the agent that I worked for.  "
bad,"I worked 70 to 80 hours per week in the field , I got a condition wear I could not climb roofs because of the heat up on the roofs during the summer. I asked for a desk job because there were openings at that time. My reviews is 2013 were one of this highest in the four offices, but during a meeting we were talking about all the hours we were working and I brought up the hours I worked for great customer service when upper management told me in the meeting in front of everyone to put a gun to my head, pull the trigger and be done with it. Every one was shocked , They told me that I did not meet the criteria of a property adjuster because I could not climb roofs. They let me go in an e-mail how impersonal is that."
bad,Office was a sexual harassment lawsuit waiting to happen.  Horrible management.  Transferred in manager who had no knowledge of Oregon law.  No one respected him.
bad,"Management doesn't care about employees. ""Restructures"" and ""layoffs"" are the buzzwords of the day."
bad,It is a fast paced work enviroment. They people are great but the atmosphere is disorganized.
bad,"Poor working condition, very little training, very little support. No manager support."
bad,"High pressure, tasks never end, more work than able to manage within normal time-frame, and micromanagement. Not growth-oriented, many people on mental health medications in order to comply with job expectations."
bad,"The position that I worked is no longer available, it was not a very good experience, mainly because of the management, not the company, local management did not follow up on promises"
bad,"Working at Amfam was highly stressful like most call center jobs."
bad,Depending on the day this employer was great. As long as you did everything he expected as he expected before he expected it to be done. No sick leave or help. Frustrated staff.
bad,The agency was taken over by a new agent and I did not agree with their work ethic. He was very sneaky and lacked respect for staff. He took advantage of a situation that would end up working in his favor.
bad,"I left a good job that I liked for this opportunity. I wanted the chance to work in an agents office and see what being an agent is all about. The agent I worked for made for a very uncomfortable environment. She was mean and rude, and talked about her customers and employees behind their backs. She also had unreasonable expectations that I should never make a mistake, and know everything about the system and processes with little to no training. There was a huge amount of downtime where I had nothing to do, this also upset the agent. Overall, I hated the job and wished I would have never taken it, although it would have been a lot better if I had worked for a decent agent. Also, no benefits, zero, zilch. When she finally let me go for God only knows why, it was actually a huge relief."
bad,horrible place to work. very rude to their employees and to visitors. I would not recommend this place to anybody for working or for their insurance needs
bad,"Plan on working more than 10 hours per day and some weekends.  Current supervisor wishes to hire young blonds and train."
bad,They pull the rug out from under you. I had a growing Agency and they downsized. NAIFA report showed their managers got bonuses for cutting agents and closing offices.
bad,"While I would have previously suggested this a good company to work for, at this time I would not. The changes American Family are currently struggling through have made the work environment very uncomfortable for the employee. There is a constant shortage of qualified available adjusters, therefore placing an unreasonable work load upon the employees. This then affects the ability to provide the excellent customer service that is sought. American Family has changed from caring about the employees and a positive work environment, to focusing on numbers. As a company, they now miss the big picture."
bad,I have nothing negative to say about American Family Insurance.  I had a 22 year good relationship with them and now I am ready to move on.  I have learned many skills with them and believe I can apply my experience and knowledge over to many other careers.
bad,If you like to deal with calling people to remind them to pay thier bills then this job is for you. If your into selling insurance products then this job is for you.
bad,"Work long hours expect to always have all requirements increased.  There is a class action lawsuit currently for the way they treat agents.  Beware, of how they will treat your clients."
bad,Everyone says they care but they don't they are worse than being in elementary school. They will get rid of you if you are not apart of the elementary school click.They will put in absolutely false complaints to human resources. This company by far is the WORST environment. EXTREMELY DYSFUNCTIONAL AND DESTRUCTIVE ATTITUDES.
bad,This company has a history of terminating older workers who file workman's compensation claims.  Even employees who have successfully been productive for over a decade are not assisted to remain on the job.
bad,Transferred insurance agents for different purposes. Examples agent is moving or retiring his clients need to be placed with new agents.
bad,"I typically worked from 9 AM to 6- 7 PM daily."
bad,Took a promotion from a very secure job to help start a new unit.  Had job less than 3yrs and then the position was cut.  Not offered old position.
bad,"Operations services work was challenging, but computer system is outdated with many work-arounds, making production frustrating at times. Co-workers were very nice and supportive of new employees. MIddle managers, for the most part were uncommitted to their staff and unavailable. This area needs to be addressed to combat moral problem amongst employees."
bad,"There was a day when management really did care and would listen. Now, negative as opposed to positive reinforcement is the acceptable norm. This kind of management style can be very hurtful especially when it hits below the belt. The best thing that ever happened was the lay-offs."
bad,Very unreasonable expectations for the amount of work required with unrealistic audit expectations. Upper management was not willing to consider the employees demands. They were not flexible or transparent. Very inconsistent expectations and demands from upper management.
bad,My management staff there was horrible and very selective on favorites. I never had any chance to advance as the manager was more worried about her advancement than my own.
bad,"Under the information system through contacting consumers of properties owning timeshares. Typically, I specialized in utilizing relationships building cliental by insuring proprietors rental and sales. Using marketing strategies like non-teleprompters, instead discuss real profit gains."
bad,"I can only speak from the agency perspective and working in an agency is really hard work with very little chance for advancement. Since agencies are their own businesses,  you do not get the opportunities you get if you worked for AmFam corporate. Obviously, one can always apply for corporate jobs but there weren't a lot of corporate jobs with AmFam posted for my state of residence. "
bad,Spent hours of cold calls and simple tasks. Agency owner was performing questionable tactics in order to gain further clients. Relationships between employees and agency owner was poor at best.
bad,"Worked Claim Call Center"
bad,"The company has great benefits for the employees, however it is very difficult to balance work and life as they have a very strict schedule with limited opportunities for time off."
bad,I learned a lot about insurance for auto and home.  I enjoyed working with people the customer service end of the job was by far my favorite.  My co-worker and management was hard to deal with.  The hardest part of my job was learning all the laws of insurance.
bad,"Great hours and benefits, however the training was lacking and lots of negative feed back from employers"
bad,"A typical day involved answering phones, working with customers, writing policies, troubleshooting with current customers on policies, troubleshooting with current/past customers on billing questions, taking payments, filing claims, following up on claims, setting up appointments with the agent and cold calling.  The hardest part of the job was cold calling.  It just felt very impersonal and it felt awkward trying to make a connection with that person.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the experience that comes along with working in that environment.  "
bad,"Opening, answer phones, input data, payments, faxes, pictures, getting things ready for different marketing events, translating."
bad,What I learned at American Family is that they are most interested in
bad,People in the NOC are arragant and the workplace abounds with double standards for all full time AMFAM employees. They will never hire you on at AMFAM if you are a contractor or consultant. They are replacing entire IT department with contractors.
bad,The insurance market is very competitive. The pressure to get and retain customers is very high. The compensation package is set up in a way that there is a diminishing income.
bad,"Unrealistic work product expectations and lack of support staff to carry out functions of office demands.  Its more about productivity and less about quality.  In the legal department it is not about the client it is all about the insurance company, internal reports, and statistics."
bad,"With different phases of knowledge, was very easy to assist our clients in all faucets of their needs.  A Very enjoyable aspect."
bad,Decent company with average pay and decent benefits.  Not a bad place to work.
bad,"I worked as Claims Support in STL for 7 months. The job itself was fine, I loved the people who I worked with who worked out in the field. But the people I worked with inside of the office all but a few were fine to work. But my manager, her two favorite employees and the Branch manager were terrible. They made life h-e-l-l for me and others. I say if you want to work in insurance work at another company this isn't what you want. And it wasn't just my department, the other departments are dropping and loosing employees like flies in the winter time."
bad,"Started out a pretty good place to work for but there was a leadership change, values changed, and with those changes the company started a downward trend."
bad,"Personally, sitting at a desk and selling insurance didn't make me happy. There was something gross about selling insurance that never sit well with me. It always made me feel like I was doing more damage to people's lives rather than actually helping."
bad,"I grew up in Madison, Wisconsin where American Family historically had an excellent reputation as a great employer. For many people, particularly those who have a good boss and are somewhat insulated or in tactical roles, it is still a great place to work. Unfortunately the culture has declined in recent years. Promotions are given to friends of executives and many great contributors are left to stagnate in their roles. We lost several extremely strong Supply Chain professionals during my years at the company due to inconsistent leadership, and the politics are at a Game of Thrones level. Sadly, I would not recommend this employer for Strategic Sourcing, Purchasing, or Supply Chain professionals."
bad,Good company but the management need a lot of improvements. You have to have a personal relationship with the managers in order to move up even if your results are in top shape.
bad,Toxic environment with little direction in training. Your responsibility is not provided and clear lines are not drawn on who does what. Your growth is not discussed with you but behind your back. Loved working in insurance though. A lot of self teaching.
bad,A lot of restructuring is happening - future state is unknown.
bad,"It was a nice place to work. Just depends on where you work, i worked around the asian community so it was kinda thought to understand at times. They were very flexible with hours and you did what you got paid to do, so $9.00 was a good starting pay."
bad,"Agent I worked for did a lot of illegal things. From sleeping with her married customers to showing accounts paid when then were not."
bad,"no benefits"
bad,"While working there I had a lot of fun, however I was a temporary replacement till the Senior agents could find a replacement agent for their office. It was a standard desk job. I would call customers, handle documents for processing or filing, and made sure customers had their policies up to date, signed, and payed for."
bad,"American Family Insurance is a fine place to work. Management is decent and the culture is ok. I was still in training when I was let go, so I don't have a real solid opinion."
bad,"I worked for them from home, when I had my son, I loved that flexibility.  However, I have switched over to a new full time, in the office role and the income is not going to be change at all from working part time."
bad,"The typical daily duties, varied, based on what was the owner/agent's business goals.  Primarily, providing insurance quotes and addressing service issues."
bad,"A nice place for pre-retirement,  No job security it. Nice life balance.  Take time for delvierable and change all the time.  A good place for slow down and take break."
bad,"American Family Insurance, is not the employer, it is the agency owner. The company doesn't pay for salary or benefits, the agency owner only pays for salary, no benefits of any kind. There is no guaranty of employment, if the owner leaves or moves up the corporate ladder, you are left with a big UNKNOWN as to if you have a job or not. The company won't even talk to you."
bad,"Apply payments to the right policys and the right customer it goes to -- i have learned alot at this job "
bad,"Would not recommend working in the Claims department. Employees are salaried and very over worked, often expected to work over 50 hours a week with no overtime pay."
bad,"Most work was performed in the field, finding clients.  Phoning in questions not commonly asked.  It was difficult getting a hold of someone whom might answer compliantly.  As I recall it was a very impersonal Agency."
bad,"Pay is good, but employees are totally expendable. As long as you sell you are loved, but if sales drop just a little you can expect threats to follow. The low supervisor and appropriate training is provided.  One is expected to work after hours for networking event."
bad,"Started with lots of promises. But as typical in most insurance adjusting fields you will experience times of overwork, However when offices are having walkouts and they say thank you so much for working so hard but 1 or more people on each team must be rated as below target despite being understaffed and over worked for several years. There is no work life balance. once you stop seeing lots of openings in claims, that may be when things have turned hopefully for the better."
bad,"Responsibilities included database management,  customer service, office management to include - but not limited to - opening/closing office daily, phone/inquiry management, case review with recommendations.  I enjoyed learning office systems and making recommendations to enhance operational performance and increase the bottom line!"
bad,"I would open the office, check messages, run reports, return customer calls.  Call customers in reference to payment.  I didn't not have co-workers in the office.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customer."
bad,"I became licensed to sell insurance and never was trained to do so.  Everyone was too busy.  Answered telephone and processed payments.  The hardest part of the job was the frustration with not being trained to sell insurance after studying to take & pass the state exam to sell property/casuality/personal lines and crop. Agent was very cheap, required staff to print on both sides of the paper, provided no water or coffee for staff or customers. Office staff was wonderful and had way too much to do with out compensation to match.  Greatly enjoyed the people that came through the door on a daily basis."
good,"Relating to people one on one to help them become more informative so they know what they are buying and why they need it. The conveniences offered hopefully provide excellent customer service, such as paying over the phone, or paying right at the office, picking up a reprint of an insurance card, bringing in something they need a better understanding of"
good,"When I worked for them, I was getting paid but under the table. If you were to call them as a reference they would say I never worked there. I was a very quick learner and wrote a quote for someone when my boss called and asked me to give him a quote."
good,"The job overrall was great and the customers were too! Looked forward to expanding there but the agency it's self wasn't great ! ""Lots of un kept promises and things not handled properly"
good,The work was very rewarding to do.  So many different tasks meant the day flew by very quickly.  The coworkers were knowledgeable and very helpful.
good,"overworked, nights and weekends required just to keep up w/ workload 11 months out of the year. Poor engagement of claim employees due to being overworked w/ no management support."
good,My Agent isn't in the office very often so bringing up issues is an issue. No support at all. Just supposed to take a shot in the dark and it's always wrong.
good,Always looking to decrease staff.  The managers are looking for reasons to push people beyond their limits and put people in difficult positions to do their work.
good,"American Family Insurance is a great company to work for, but in the hiring process make sure your agent is a good fit. I am currently in a situation where I feel like there is no room for advancement at the agency I am currently with."
good,"The company is a great company, but like any corporation it has both good and bad attributes"
good,"Long Hours, enjoyed working from home. Management team was in transition and seldom available. I enjoyed I did not have to work from a corporate office and could work from my home. I enjoyed helping people after they occurred a loss get they life back in order."
good,"Sr. Claims Adjuster in the Casualty Department"
good,"A typical day as a sales associate and customer service representative involves making a high volume of phone calls, organizing incoming billing questions and information. Additionally, answering emails, obtaining referral information and making new connections with incoming and potential clients is a daily and overarching goal as an insurance agent. Co-workers are typically there for moral support as sales are a very individual position. The hardest yet most enjoyable part of being an insurance agent is going beyond just making a connection with a client which involves building a long lasting relationship in protecting what matters most to them."
good,No for me. Small agency with little advertising to draw customers
good,The office culture is nice and so is flexibility to work from home. Work life balance is a challenge with so many tasks that you can take or assigned to you. Training is available and career improvement is a big challenge. Don't expect a career improvement in here till after 7-10 years in the same position. Unless you apply outside the company.
good,"My typical day at work is getting 5-8 new claims and answering phones every time. We work on other people's files if they are not there. The culture there is that no one cares if you work 50+ hrs. There is absolutely no work/life balance when you are salaried. The raises are minimal , unless you are a director or above. The hardest part of the job is trying to meet all the metrics when my claims inventory gets 2 or 3 times what it should be because of the workload and lack of new hires."
good,I do not like sales I think Insurance is high pressure for everyone. I have always been running an office.   Since the economy change I had change careers to Insurance because I was promised a job.  So 3 years later I see the pressure of sales and I do not appreciate this line of business
good,I did alot of the work along side the secondary agent as my boss was never actually theree.
good,"I am not a salesperson. That said, it's a nice office environment with supportive staff. I just don't belong there. I'm doing it part-time until I can get on full-time someplace else."
good,"Action needed: Confirm your email Make sure your uploaded resume looks great to employers searching our job seeker database. Confirm your email to view and update now."
good,This was a fast pace office that was very busy which was nice  cause it made the day go by fast which is something that i enjoy about anywhere that i work
good,"Super busy, very Stressful , not enough time to breathe!"
good,I am very thankful for time at The Raja Mourey Agency Inc. with American Family. The staff was extremely kind and understanding.The Company culture was that of family first. I felt that the hardest part of my position was not not being given the opportunity to Market and sell our product in order to increase my overall income. As I was salary plus commission based compensation employee..
good,"Very busy office, office manager always looking over your shoulder!  Too many job task to do with constant customers calls and walk ins."
good,Job security is a concern because of decreased business. We currently have too many employees and not enough work to go around.
good,"Be prepared to be micromanaged to death here. Every part of your day is monitored and tracked. Also, you are pretty much set in whatever shift you start at. I was on the same shift for two years after being promised that I would be moved to an earlier shift after six months."
good,I did not have a very good experience with this company....I have friends that have been with them for many years and love it.  The new management is not as trustworthy as it was back several years ago.
good,Hardest part of the job is meeting sales goals.  Best part of the job is being your own boss.
good,"Sitting at a desk 10 hours a day taking complaints about insurance billing and cancelations, learned a lot of state to state guidelines and billing processes for auto and home insurance billing. Management seemed not interested in helping you advance and progess with your career, a lot of favoritism played between salary managers and hourly employees.  Hardest part of the job was being blamed for others mistakes.  Most enjoyable was I knew my job and knew it well.  I was able to help many people with problems they had with their billing."
good,Family is not at American Family.  They think more about the hire ups income than the employees that do the work. They hire people that dont know the job and too much turn over due to work levels are too high
good,I learned a lot about running an office with a manager. The hardest part of the job was learning that the agency was closing and I had to look for another position.
good,"American Family Insurance provided several contests or ""campaigns"" to earn money and/or prizes as a bonus throughout the year. The main company was good about having various people to answer any questions that came up during quoting, writing or servicing policies."
good,"-pays well enough, benefits and time off are nice."
good,"Its a good place to work, if you want a relaxed environment. Career growth might be quite slow and the salary is not too competitive. Depending on your team, you can enjoy a good work-life balance"
good,"Bad Management, unreasonable work load, long hours, way to big territory, no tools to do the job, closed local office and moved twice in 5 years,no chance for advancement"
good,"I enjoyed working in the fast pace environment of the insurance world. I would help customers with their insurance needs from start to finish. This would include but not be limited to writing applications, doing land survey reviews, setting up online payments ec"
good,"I worked in an agent's office. That agent determines the pay. If they do not want to offer increases, PTO, sick time- they don't. This agent required that we become licensed in Property & Casualty.  Once I accomplished this, I was offered .50 more an hour! Enough said."
good,My typical work day included answering phone calls and providing exceptional customer service. I was responsible for investigating and making liability determinations.
good,"I like to work at the American Family office that I worked for. I was able to obtain my Property and casualty insurance license. "
good,"Field tech with company owned vehicle going around southern Indiana to agent sites to make sure they were up and running. Learned server replacement and configurations on the job. Management was more hands off which gave us the freedom to do our jobs. Hardest part of job was the long day at times since I was a field tech I was responsible for many sites at all times, at one point 105 remote sites was my responsibility. I enjoyed the agents most of all and the work environment was very casual. The workplace culture was very casual as well and easy to work in."
good,"I found that the company's intranet training was informative and beneficial, clear and concise, and gave a valuable statement of what was expected when working for American Family. My advice would be this: You should definitely choose to work for this company as the inherent culture is good and stable, but just as important is that you should carefully research the agencies to see which one will be the best fit for your personality."
good,"They focus on selling home, auto, and life insurance.  Its a never ending grind, corporate expects certain production levels each month.  They are a credit based insurance company, if your prospect doesn't have great credit, probably not going to save them any money.  Older agents are helpful and always willing to share what's made them successful.  Its hard to beat State Farm in their home state and the dozens of other fly by night insurance companies in Chicagoland area."
good,I enjoyed working here for the most part but felt that the way things were ran could have most certainly been improved upon. Overall tho it was a pleasant experience up until the last few months.
good,"Worked in sales and service"
good,"policies, make outbound telephone calls and report log using CRM dialer program. Resolve complex issues regarding pendingUsing CRM dialer program to contact Insurance leads, data entry, assist with activation of auto  applications. Daily clerical tasks."
good,"Challenging work as every claim is different."
good,was not a good fit for me and my family.  I think they can definitely excel with an upgrade to their technology and processing procedures.
good,"Company changes forced offices to close 14 of 20 offices.  Changes in workload, adjuster morale, very poor work/life balance.  Burnout."
good,"Write applications, contact customer about insurance needs, wants. bill collecting,"
good,Maintaining relationships with current client base as well as trying to grow new business. Reaching out to centers of influence. Working internet leads. Very important to develope systems for both current clients while maintaining a good follow up system.
good,"I have a terrific boss, but the teaching methods are very poor and there is no procedure manual.  The hardest part of the job, is understanding the procedures and I am discouraged from taking  notes.  If I ask a question, I don't get a direct answer.  Instead I am answered with a question, followed by a lengthy discussion of various situations. This disrupta my original focus, and I don't really learn anything this way.  When I ask a similar question again later, I get a lecture and I still don't get a direct answer.  Even though I enjoy working there, I don't feel I'm an asset until I have a full understanding of the procedures and I have tried to discuss this, but nothing changes. I would love to become an integral part of this office, but I don't think that will happen as long as current conditions exist."
good,"I was a contractor for 3 months before my tenure was ended abruptly. I was brought to help with the work load, and I was never integrated into the team. Got a call at 8 PM and notified that my contract had been ended. Not very professional in any way."
good,"I have loved this job/employer for a long time and felt it possible to advance.  But, management values friendship and tenure over results and ability.  Those that recognize and voice concern over problems are punished for it."
good,"It started out to be a great place to work, but they started closing claims offices and not telling the employees what was going on. Employees were nervous about loosing their jobs, so job security was an issue."
good,I started as an Administrative Assistant and was promoted to Paralegal.  There is always something to do and I learn new things all the time.  I enjoy working with my teams which consists of 2 attorney's and 2 legal assistants.  The hardest part of my job and the most challenging is keeping up with all of the work as each paralegal has close to 150 to 200 files.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing how all of your hard work pays off while helping our client's though the legal process.
good,Working at American family was great. I love the company and its values. Loved working with customers and providing service
good,"Hardly room for advancement, salaries are universal and not based on individual merit. Unable to advance in current role without nepitism. Management acts like they are doing employees a favor when we work harder for them without additional incentive. Terrible work life balance, you can leave early if necessary or take fmla but you are made to feel guilty about it and other managers have a bad idea of your work ethic"
good,It was a stressful work environment. The dept i worked in always seemed to pick up everyone else work. The agents do what they want and expect you to clran up they mistakes
good,The claims department is like working in a prison. They treat you like children. The trainers are of no use and are hesitant to help. I would not recommend this.
good,I didn't really work directly for American Family but I worked for one of their agents part time.  It was a good position at the time.  I was needing to get my son into school FT before I could take a full time position
good,I couldn't get any help once hitting the floor. The supervisors seemed to be out of the office most days and the training was not adequate for the actual job.
good,"American Family was under poor management and recently got all new, which I believe is improvement.  So many changes in the company to keep up with todays corporate world that to much at once was being handled and not correctly for the employees, I believe they try and are working hard to get a handle on issues.  "
good,"I worked in what was called the billing call center, it was a fast paced environment. Answered questions from insureds about their bills via email, instant message and letters as well as live phone calls."
good,Commute time is too long from where I live which effects work/life balance. Work is rewarding as it offers an opportunity to help people during stressful time.
good,"Great relationships with customers and the agent. "
good,"American Family Insurance allowed me the opportunity to get my feet wet in the insurance business. It was my first time being in the insurance business,and it gave me the opportunity to learn the ropes of the insurance business, however, the agency wasn't generating enough business and sadly had to close it's doors."
good,Was glad to move on in life as it was very disruptive  for family life and compensation  was not what should have been. Would not recommend  to anyone.
good,"Being a Consumer Sales Representative (CSR) can be a really great job, but I think it all comes down to the agency you work for, or start at. I have been with the company for a few months now, and everyone is really nice and caring. From a culture standpoint it is a great company. I have met some people in ""higher up"" positions and after only meeting them once or twice I would say I feel completely comfortable reaching out to them for any help or advice."
good,"A typical day consist of receiving incoming work through emails, calls, fax and mail. Meetings just about everyday from team, sales and vendor meetings. Constant communication with team members to better service our agents."
good,"Started with office with no experience, ability to learn quickly and ""on the fly"" was essential. Ability to learn new systems on own and in person was very helpful. Increasing knowledge of industry is a must! "
good,"If you are a salaried employee you are expected to work extra hours to get projects done within the timeline set FOR you by managers that don't know all the aspects of the projects. Employee engagement is lower than what is advertised as employees rate the questions higher so there isn't as much extra work to do. "
good,"Corporate should really pay close attention to Mangers.  There should be consistency among all.  A lot of favoritism and labeling going on. They should treat everyone equally, which they do not."
good,As most companies who have needed to make changes in a evolving market place Amfam has had really no direction in any positive form.
good,Not the same company as when i started.  I currently would not recommend this company to work for.  Amfam changes course several times a year....no direction.
good,"Selling insurance was never a dream of mine but when my father asked if I would be willing to get licensed and help out with his agency, I couldn't refuse. I thoroughly enjoyed working with customers and helping them protect their assets. It made me feel good when American Family was there to help people during some of the worst times of their lives, but a salesperson I am not. I was able to work part time for him and make enough money to survive, but I couldn't ever get excited about the job. Wouldn't change working with my dad all those years for anything and for that reason, the position I held will always be priceless."
good,"Training is more than adequate."
good,"For the area, the pay was good, but the job did not provide healthcare benefits or compensation for purchasing on your own.  The job had very limited sick pay and leaving work when ill was not an option.  It was nice to be close to home with easy access to other local businesses."
good,"I worked for an agent in Parker and the learning experience was great, but over all the agent was degrading and disrespectful to employees and some customers"
good,"Not a bad place to go to everyday, but the raises are small and there is little opportunity for advancement."
good,"This company pays competitively, still offers benefits, a 401K and a pension plan. The managers are overall competent, but in the past I found them to kind and considerate whereas in recent years I came across a few who were heartless and/or doing the company's bidding without compassion for employees. The company culture changed for the worse and it became a matter of piling on work for claims employees, losing or firing staff along the way without replacing them when necessary. I liked my managers for the most part, but they had a difficult task in these last few years. The co-workers were professional and nice people for the most part. The hardest part for me was handling the heavy workload and the best part was helping the customers."
good,The pay is low and no benefits when working with an agent. The work can be very busy or slow at times. It seems a few agencies are overstaffed. Some have family flexibly. Usually time off was okay.
good,"No opportunities to advance unless you move to Wisconsin. This is the most stressful office is have ever worked in. Management needs to recognize that they are going to loose some good people due to the stress, and trying to change too much at one time."
good,"You are tied to a computer monitored schedule where calls are received through a ""queue"" based on first in, first out. All calls are voice and screen recorded."
good,"Working as a temporary claims processor was not a hard job, and the pay was very good.  However, I was constantly working overtime, and felt as if all I was doing with my life was working at American family."
good,. Was a great place to work for years  Company has great benefits program. Collaboration of all was very good from all levels to improve servicing for insured's..
good,"Agency is a better pace, allows you to work independently, unfortunately there are no benefits at the agency, only corporate.  Agent is great at work/life balance and making sure you have what you need to perform"
good,"Court filing, draft and answer discovery, legal research"
good,"People are extremely nice and thoughtful. The day-to-day work can be busy and hectic, but it is not complicated work most of the time. High-volume and fast-paced. The culture, unfortunately, is at times a little bit toxic. This is because of the drastic differences in treatment between ""employees"" and ""temps"". Temporary workers, while it is understandable that they will not receive the same benefits as full employees, are treated as second-class individuals overall. They are not given the same consideration as fellow employees for important office events and announcements, including those that would affect their jobs."
good,"Corporate positions are hard to come by. Currently they are restructuring. Essentially required to be an agent before advancing to anything else. This can be frustrating for people looking for advancement doing anything other than sales (ie HR, public relations)"
good,"I has come from an agency that was not a direct writer,  so it was a bit jarring to be with a direct writer.  The agent that I worked for was NOT a good insurance aent.  He was unethical and broke the law multiple times.  I was glad to leave, I liked the company, not the ager."
good,I love working here but I wish there was more training. Sales can be hard to get without marketing. So you have to know what you doing to get the business.
good,"Morning shift, money handling and customers. Learned to keep calm in stressful situations. Managed escalation issues. Co-workers were helpful. It was hard to see people hurt with money situations. I enjoyed that everyone worked together as a team."
good,"For people in the insurance field, this job can be rewarding and  time consuming. Hourly plus commissions are a plus. If you are an office manager, majority of your day will be answering call, taking payments, handling customer disputes and running quotes."
good,The best part about this job is my co workers and overall work environment
good,"American Family has gone through recent changes in their management structure.  This included closing offices and laying off employees without any consideration for the workload it would create for remaining employees.  At lot depends on what part of the country you work in and how your manager treats you.  There is room for advancement if you are willing to move.  Also, there is little to no expectation of work life balance.  Workload is unsustainable and has lead to the loss of many employees recently."
good,"I was hired to do admin assistant work, answer phones... etc. Few months later I was pushed to take an insurance agent test. I didn't mind selling insurance I just didn't want to get the license. "
good,"Basic office environment, boss and co-works were great, learned alot about insurance!"
good,When it is busy this is a job that is not too bad. It is a very small office which can be both good and bad.
good,"However, many benefits have been reduced and restructing has contributed to loss of jobs for some employees. The company has focused on growth and reducing expenses. Which will ultimately lead the company in the right direction."
good,Requires insurance licenses and customer service. Its includes regular office hours. A great company to learn the basic of insurance and sales.
good,Stressful yet rewarding atmosphere. Co workers great to work with; management would rather not be bothered. Constant turnover in workers and management.
good,"There were 2 systems that supported policies. I wasn't sent anywhere to get training of any kind, and the other person in the office beside the husband and wife wasn't keen on training me. I was there in May of 2017 when there was a costly hail storm that affected just about every policy holder under the agency. I took 95% of the calls and directed them or counseled them as necessary. After 6 months, I decided it was time to move on."
good,Good company foundation and structure. Continuing education to help new agents get up to speed with the administrative tasks of the position. Awesome trainers!
good,"The program is simple at American Family but the manager had communication problems.  The company is great and dealing with the people was nice too.  I would love to work at American Family again but with a different agent.  The agent at these insurance places is what can make the difference whether you can tolerate their ways or not.  I had one that just exploded for everything that didn't go his way and he yelled a lot. On a typical day I would go in and just start doing my activities and answering phone calls, giving quotes which is simple at American Family Insurance."
good,"I worked at American Family Insurance for around three and a half years. I left the company due to my Sales Specialist position being dissolved. I started off as a Customer Service Representative for the first two years, and enjoyed what I was doing. I wish I never transitioned into the Sales position."
good,Working for American family was challenging in a good way.  I learned that I was good at sales and I also learned how corporate america works.  The downfall was the Agent i worked for was not a good team leader which led to the downfall of our agency.
good,I do not want to complete this section. I have worked for American family for over 14 years and I would like to visit other employment options at this point in my career.
good,As an agent it is a full commitment to be involved with the community to provide services. Meetings are a must building rapport with local business and banks near your area of business. Expanding your network is a matter of survival in this business.
good,"Typical biz hours 830-5"
good,"American Family Insurance offers great pay, benefits including 401k. Recently, the company has changed management that has resulted in a huge turn over rate."
good,"AmFam is a great place to work in general, various kinds of cases and good benefits.  Training and management is currently lacking in certain areas and they tend to follow what other insurance companies in the industry are doing instead of leading."
good,Individual Agent office. I was under the impression I was being hired more so as a sales Agent and was to be reimbursed for reinstating licenses which did not happen. I felt there was no enough opportunity to advance.
good,"I worked for an independent agent with American Family Insurance, I am grateful for the opportunity to learn the insurance business; however I was only offered part time employment and i needed something full time."
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy meeting numbers/metrics.  Pay is great.  Work Saturdays and evenings starting off.  Great employees, and great managers depending on who it is."
good,"Management was kind, thoughtful, helpful and professional. Nice small office that was relaxed, yet worked hard. Treated their clients well, they have many fans!"
good,"I had asked for assistance in training on how they handle their workload, and was not provided same. I would come in early, stay late, & was never able to catch up."
good,"Day consists of answering phones, answering questions, redirecting calls to proper departments or adjusters, filing claims,and maintaining a claim inventory. Pay is decent but its a VERY stressful job. Processes are always changing, not enough training for new procedures or systems. Limited time to work claim inventory when its not canceled."
good,"very stressful job, with a workload that was impossible. Too bad. It used to be a great company, but they cut their workforce and make those who stay too hard. I loved this job for years, but hated it the last few, Had to get out to save my sanity."
good,Great start to my career. Grew and learned a lot about the insurance business. I would do it all again under different management. But the experience there was great.
good,Standard Personal Casualty Customer Service Representative was a new field for me. Learned Insurance business from the ground up. Used this position as a stepping stone
good,I learned how to manage a business and all the ups and downs that come with it. For me the loss of time with my family was not worth the opportunity. If you dont have little ones at home this could be a great career path.
good,"Most areas of the company are severely micromanaged.  To the extend of being told when to use the restroom, when to take break and when to take lunch."
good,"Loved being an Insurance Agent, but the number one thing they wanted you to sell was auto insurance. We were not competitive at all so it was impossible. All other lines we were competitive in. Fellow employees were nice and professional."
good,"American Family let a bunch of contractors go recently, some of which were with the company for 15 years or more! It may be an okay place to work if you are an employee but be leary if you're a contractor!"
good,"Next thing I remember, I was running for the door. I had to find the passage back to the place I was before. ""Good night' said the night man, we are programmed to receive"
good,"Company is generally decent to work for.  As long as they are fully staffed.  Knowledgeable management.  After losing many employees, they did not re-hire and work load was left to a few."
good,"Good benefits. Beginning to show signs of innovation, customer driven. Usually was a follower and is now a leader in the Insurance and innovation. Still have room for improvement."
good,"I enjoyed this job, although the actual Ins. agent was rarely in the office.  I did receive my Oregon Property & Casualty license while at this job.  It has since lapsed, as I was unaware of the requirements to keep it current."
good,"A typical work day was high energy."
good,Again I do not care for insurance. I was proving a point to myself that I could do it and I did. I prefer bookkeeping over insurance.
good,Normal work environment. Meeting and helping solve problems for new and existing clients.  Learned how to analyze insurance guidelines as the apply to individual concerns
good,Very demanding job.  Insurance customer can tend to be either quite needy or demanding.  I enjoy the people I work with and for.  Sometimes find it difficult to balance empathy for customers with the restrictions of the job.
good,"Employees are very helpful and friendly, and most of management is also. The workflow is high. There is a lot of interdepartmental work, but the varying departments do not work together or communicate well."
good,"Hard to move up; very political but ok to work at. The benefits included the in house cafeteria, the underground parking, the bonus when the company was profitable."
good,"Answering phones, greeting clients, getting quotes together!  Fun place to work, liked the interaction with the clients.  Fast pace made the day go faster!"
good,"American Family Insurance provides the following products: property, casualty, life and retirement plans. Their pricing is not as competitive as other insurance companies.  Their marketing is not as strong as other insurance companies."
good,"I hate reading reviews that don't say much. Here's an honest assessment. The company overall is a good company. I have worked for some poor companies in the past and this is much better than all of those. The frustration with the company is that in its regional offices, there is very limited opportunity for growth and movement. Once you are in the casualty operations, there are rarely positions that open for growth and when there are, there about 25 people going for one position. And they usually hire based on tenure and how well the person is liked by management; it is not based on talent and performance. That becomes very discouraging. If, however, you're willing to move to the Midwest; namely Madison where the company is based or Minnesota which is a fairly large hub office, then you have opportunity for growth and advancement. The company does restructure and reorganization frequently and people get displaced. In fact, my current department is experiencing this and we all have to reapply for our current jobs. There are now only 23 positions available and 26 current adjusters. This seems to happen every couple of years. "
good,most days a good. learned how to run the front end. Front office mgr is nit picky. hardest part is dealing with angry customers. I liked meeting new people or establishing relationships with return customers.
good,A typical day is taking claims reporting the first notice of loss. I learned to be very empathetic to individuals in their time of need. I really enjoy my coworkers. We help one another. The hardest part will be adjusting to new hours that were chosen for me. With having a small child I will not get to see him much. The most enjoyable part is helping others
good,Great place to work at as an intern also lots of advancements with the company and chance to open up your own branch if desired
good,"Consult with small to medium sized business owners, CFO's and/or HR management on strengthening current benefits package offered to employees. Educate above individuals on how AFLAC can help their business on improving productivity, lower costs and attracting/retaining employees."
good,"Customer Service Agent for Property and Casualty (which I have a license for).  Mainly dealt with customers over the phone--very few came into the office except for our Hispanic customers as we had a lady who was Hispanic employed in the office.  Responsible for viewing and updating the report for the agency on a daily basis.  Reported rate increases to the sales agents as well as delinquent accounts on the commercial side of the business."
good,"I work at the front desk so I am the first person people see when they walk in the door. On a daily basis I take payments, process claims, answer policy questions, change policy information, fax, email, set appointments, and answer the phone. Also on a daily basis, I perform all the service work and marketing. I send out mailings and make phone calls. A couple times a week I will also meet with current or potential clients."
good,Products are not the most competitive.  It is very difficult to start a new market and be successful.
good,"long days on the phone. very stressful, compensated well, but need a special person to handle the situations."
good,A typical day at work would be answering the telephone and helping the customers out.  working with my co-workers was fine.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to solve a problem
good,"Flexible schedules "
good,Amazing coworks. A lot of long hard working hours with very little return.
good,Little to no career advancement opportunities were available at this company.
good,"Busy,"
good,"The job is not a right fit for me with my past years of medical billing and training new hires."
good,Very diverse company with great pay. they also have great benefits
good,"My only issue here was a language barrier."
good,"Extremely intense and busy environment with 5,000 base clients.  I love helping people plan for their futures with the best rates available."
good,"Not a lot of support from the corporate office, but for those that are self motivated there is potential to make a lot of money.  Subsidies help cover the costs of running an agency."
good,Assisted the agent with making calls to secure new business. Sold porperty and casualty insurance. Serviced existing clients.
good,I like American Family.  I handle WA/OR claims.  I have learned a lot handling homeowners claims and personal injury claims.  I like the fact that they split the investigation portion and we focus on the injury aspect of the claim.
good,"There are so many facets to insurance everyday I learn something new. My days are filled with daily paper work tasks as well as soliciting and writing residential and commercial policies. Each business type requires different kinds of policies and coverage that need to be researched before writing. There are many stipulations to what the client or business can and can't do to be eligible for insurance and I find the researching of this to be the hardest part of the job. As insurance is so important I would never want to write a policy that was incorrect or didn't provide sufficient coverage for the client."
good,"Typical day was setting appointments, handling customer service needs, managing the staff (4 people), and I directly handled most all of the marketing efforts. These included door to door flyers, contacting mortgage broker and lenders in person to solicit business and generate leads for the staff, and inspecting properties. My District Manager was a gem and I enjoyed working with him and making my successes, his successes. The hardest part of the job was when Am Fam decided to credit score everyone and it resulted in abrupt changes in premiums at renewals. Dealing with this change was stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job was going to the District meetings and cleaning up at awards banquets."
good,"During the time that I worked here, I was able to work multiple different positions each week. I loved that they offered change, that way the job never felt repetitive."
good,Flexible schedules is a plus but they will not hire additional employees when needed. work on average 50-60 hours per week without overtime. Everyone is a salaried employee.
good,I only worked in American Family for about six months before figuring out that I am not much of a salesman.
good,It was fun working in American Family Insurance. They have a great office and people are friendly. They are always looking forward to new technology and trying to use them to improve customers' experience.
good,Great training program and good pay. Products not very competitive so hard to compete with other insurance companies.
good,"Good company, lots of changes that are hard to keep up with. Lots of re orgs and it was hard to see lots of people go. Suppose that is happening with lots of companies though."
good,"I worked as a contractor so I wasn't involved much in daily business of the company. Supervisors and other folks were real nice, pleasant to talk to."
good,"A typical job starts with a few phone calls from the insureds to make their payments, checking voicemails and some filing. During the day there is plenty of downtime which can sometimes be quite boring. I have learned various things on Microsoft Word and Excel as well as increased my typing and data entry skills. As far as management, the agent spends the majority of his time outside of the office recruiting business leaving me at the office with no co-workers. The hardest part of my job was probably remembering the different codes and discounts that are available to the insureds. Although I really enjoyed meeting our new clients, typing and answering the phones."
good,"-I didn't receive health benefits b/c I worked for the agent, not the company. I worked in a small office with a great manager"
good,"very reactive company, not leading industry in anything other than work load and reducing claims staff. Good people, good local managers, poor senior leadership at HQ. The pay is very good, pretty good benefits, but amazingly high work load."
good,"I was working for a Spanish lady I’m black. Everything was going fine until she hired more Spanish workers and started to discriminate me. Every day she picked on me, even blamed me for the power going out in the middle of a storm."
good,The benefits are great.  The claim center is very micromanaged.  You get used to it after a while.  The goals are not always easy to reach and it seems like they harp on you about reaching them.  It never seems like you can do enough.  The training however is wonderful.
good,I enjoyed my time as an agent for American Family.  I relished the opportunity to help people with their insurance needs.  I was disappointed that I was terminated when I felt that I did a good job from the company and the people I represented.
good,"Great job to get your start in the insurance business. They paid for licensing. A good training program, but could be better. Staff at other agent offices are very friendly and helpful.  Once agent is comfortable leaving you on your own you will be at the office by yourself.  You will learn something new everyday. Support staff at call centers was very helpful and friendly. For the most part all the clients are enjoyable to deal with and pleasant. I enjoyed the job."
good,"I provided general office support and assisted clients with changes to their policies."
good,"Meeting with customers and assisting them with their insurance policies. Working with a diverse clientele and listening to their concerns and daily lives.  "
good,"This company has good pay, good benefits, but the room for advancement was not high in this location. The more desirable advancement opportunities required you to relocate to their home office in Wisconsin"
good,"My avergae day at work was fairly simple. I would arrive at the designated time of my shift and head to my station right away after getting settled in quickly. Whatever my employer needed me to file away in the filing cabinets I would recieve directly or at other times I would hand her printed paperwork that she would request. While management was as good as I could judge at the time, the workplace was dreadfully dull and unmotivating. It was a stiff atmosphere, friendly, but stiff and rigid. There was nothing more enjoyable than break time of course, where I got to wind down for a bit and recover from the first period of tedium."
good,"It’s a really nice job where you have management, but you kind of do your own thing, and just ask for help when you need it. It was a great experience to be able to work at this company."
good,"American Family is a good(not great) place to work, benefits are good and pay is above industry average; however, if you're looking for a place to advance your career this is not the place.  "
good,I enjoy working for American Family but I would prefer if they would get rid of the contractor to full time employee ratio restriction. I feel if that you have a good employee they should feel that they have a chance to stay with a company and advance after showing that they are a reliable employee. The management is great and they are always very caring and understanding when issues arise at home and in someone's personal life. Great experience but unfortunately opportunities are limited.
good,"Overall the company has come a long way.  Their new vision is a lot more solid, but there is still a ton of nepotism.  The culture makes it hard to break into management if that is your goal.  There is plenty of lateral movement choices."
good,"Having an opportunity to work in the insurance industry can prove to be lucrative after many years of hard work. However, there must be a definite passion for insurance in order to make this career work."
good,Management when I worked here was not effective because most were not cross trained in multiple disciplines. Therefore many regular representatives had more advanced knowledge than management. This created a few problems when trying to properly interpret policy and caused the company to lose some people who would have been great managers if the existing ones did not feel threatened by their presence.
good,"Excellent work environment and on the leading edge of technology.  Have moved claims to 6 locations nationwide, thus lots of displacement.  Also if in one of those 6 locations, great chance of advancement."
good,"Due to the difficulty in communicating with customers, this was not the best fir for me"
good,A typical day at this job was very similar to every other day.  Our job duties were to take physical copies of insurance policies and convert them into digital format.  Following we would receive more physical copies of policies and convert them again into digital formats.  The job itself was consistent but monotonous.  I worked the job for 2 years and left when i was given an new opportunity.
good,"Answering phone calls "
good,"Depends on the part of the company you work for, but management styles vary and it is difficult to advance unless you play the ""yes"" game.  Not encouraged to be ""out of the box"" thinkers.  "
good,I love working in this field because I get to met amazing people but there is no benefits in my current postiton. I have numerous degrees and I would love to grow with a company that will utlize the skills and knowledge I have to offer.
good,"A typical day at work usually involves responding to emails, phone calls, working with body shops, independent adjusters, tow yards, salvage yards and customers in order to resolve claims quickly. At my time at American Family Insurance I learned to be organized & detail oriented. I learned to be persuasive. I gained important experience working within complex computer systems. I learned how to negotiate and be an analytical person. My management helped me learn from my mistakes and become a better employee. My co-workers were very helpful and kind. The hardest part about my job was denying claims due to lack of coverage or no coverage on the policy. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people get through tough times."
good,Job reviews . Flexible work schedule. Job training. Employee engagement promote from within . Employee empowerment American family insurance employee empowerment
good,"American Family Insurance was an incredible place to work at. The team was made up of two families and myself, but they ended up making me feel like family. We were all very close and it was an amazing experience getting to better the piece of mind of the lives in my community."
good,"The company is in need of some enhancements in benefits, otherwise it is a good company to work for. They had a family friendly environment. Job in included making outbound calls and visiting customers and cross marketing with other companies."
good,"Impossible attendance policies."
good,"Field Adjuster duties included scheduling appointments with customers, estimating vehicles, reaching agreed prices with body shops for repairs to submit to central office."
good,"AmFam was a nice place to work, but simply wasn't meant for me. If you want to work in claims, underwriting, or customer service, then the Eden Prairie branch is for you as that's all that office was responsible for. "
good,"I did not enjoy working in a call center or working second shift. You work less than an 8 hour day, but work every other weekend for the most part. The positive side of that is you have a day off during the week. Training was so-so, but the management were all super nice! During training they pay you to study to pass your property and casualty exams. The insurance benefits are great, but the job itself was not rewarding or pleasing at all."
good,you can have plenty of free time if you want to fail. This job is for the zealous money maker that wants nothing but success. The company will surely reward you!!
good,"I absolutely enjoy my job and the interaction I get with the public.  I've learned how to write policies, quote, type much better than I could before and build important documents."
good,The company truly cares about employee work/life balance and benefits.  The employee experience program is amazing and really hits the mark for new and existing employees.
good,"Pay could be much better. They are excellent with family life and understanding sick kids, etc. "
good,Ideally I would like to work in a flexible enjoyable environment.  Some place that stays busy and with a positive attitude.
good,"Outbound calls to delinquent customers."
good,"I was only a part time marketing representative but in the few months I was there we had multiple system changes.  They supposedly had just spent billions on a new quoting system that was supposed to be more accurate, but it didn't seem so.  Drivers with bad driving records were getting better rates than before, but the good drivers premiums seemed to increase."
good,I had great coworkers that I truelly enjoyed working with. Very relaxed style of management not a lot of micro-managing.
good,"The claim volume has been excessive"
good,"Answering phone calls and problem-solving with agents is what i did on a typical day. "
good,sales driven - meeting ones monthly goals are important especially since AMFAM is pushing life insurance products over the auto and home. Management also likes to push higher liability coverage to their clients.
good,"Great coworkers and supervisor, but during certain times of the year, it can get very busy, causing employees to work longer hours than they are scheduled for."
good,"I learned a lot while I was at American Family and I am very thankful for all the learning experience. If you are looking to gain more experience in customer service or sales, this is a great company to do so!"
good,"Answered phones, greeted customers, filed customer folders. Worked with owner in marketing and advertising for her company."
good,I was a support person for 12 adjusters and 2 managers. I also ran the supply closet for the entire branch. It was a nice job with nice people to work with.
good,"a typical day at work would be clients coming in to make payments on their insurance or to get insurance and i would process their payments and file their documents accordingly. i learned how insurance works and how to provide great customer service. my management was great, they were very flexible with me because i was still in school. i would say that the hardest part on the job would be the high volume of phone calls from customers but you get used to it after a while. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping people and offering a great service to the customers."
good,It’s beneficial to work here and there’s lots of opportunities to grow IF you are interested in a career with insurance. It’s harder work than what it seems when insuring people’s lives. But if you don’t plan on getting licensed I wouldn’t pursue.
good,"Great benefits, competitive salary and opportunity to work from home. "
good,"A typical day in agency consisted of checking emails, Returning responses to customers and corporate.  Delegating emails to staff for policy changes that needed to be made or for return calls for follow up.  Answering phone calls, calling prospect lists, following up on past appointments, greeting customers that come through the door and helping them, sales appointments, taking photos of properties for homeowners insurance or commercial insurance and writing policies."
good,"Providing excellent customer service to the insureds, answering calls, multi-tasking between 3-5 programs while helping the customer."
good,American family is a great company to work for. The medical benefits are one of the best I have ever had. Personal time off accumulates throughout the year and allows you more personal time off if needed.
good,"I enjoy coming to work in the morning and working with my clients, management was under a lot of pressure but I enjoy working with them, I didn't find anything to hard about the job, My most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help clients in their times of needs,"
good,"Answered Phone Calls, Filed Papers & Cleaned"
good,fast paced work enviroment with supportive staff. I have my last employee review which was above positive. I liked working around people and taking care of customers
good,Flexible work hours make it great to not miss family events. Compensation is excellent as long as the work is put in to earn it. Management is great as long as you are placed with the right leader.
good,"A typical day in agency is looking at what is happening in the agency.  Looking at policy lapses and cancels and calling those people. Following up with people we had already met with to see if we had earned their business. Checking emails from corporate as well as customers.  Following up on leads and referrals and scheduling appointments for potential new customers.  Delegating tasks to staff.  Meeting with staff to see where we were at for the week on our sales goals.  Meeting with customers that came in for questions or were paying bills.  Answering many, many phone calls.  Following up on claims with customers to make sure they were being taken care of properly."
good,"If you love insurance, it is a great company to work for. I tride to make it work but insurance wasn't for me. Experienced insurance agents would thrive there. Insurance wasn't for me. I gave it a shot but it's just not me"
good,This job was not the best job as the person I worked for was not going by rules of employment due to being hired because I was a client of his. I didnt have to actually fill out an application.
good,Increased my knowledge of working residential fire and tornado claims and customer relations
good,"It was a family run business.  I was the odd man out and didn't feel welcome at times.  Many times they were unprofessional by cursing while I was on the phone with a client, or yelling from office to office while i was on the phone.  Your breaks were never scheduled and their was no uninterrupted lunch.  There was no yearly salary incentives, no paid sick days, he lied about how many weeks of vacation I would get. and they yelled a lot in their attempt to correct and it was scary and made me nervous."
good,I worked for Amfam for over 10 years.  The culture there appears to be family orientated but you are constantly worried when the next reorg is going to happen.  Great place to work but keep options open and dont get to secure in your job.
good,"I disagree when companies ask for high pressure sales and ask for heavy cold calling . There is limited retirement options, and limited sales support"
good,"Management needs to be less sensitive, listen to your employees. Good talent is not cheap and cheap talent is not good. AMFAM should have a bar that needs to be met in order to apply and or work their, rather than a warm body that meets their diversification goals. Many incompetent adjusters who work their, because of lack of standards, such as a 4 year degree, some experience, industry education, great people skills that can negotiate, employees that are competent in many states, ones that work hard."
good,"American Family's vision is to be the most trusted and valued customer driven insurance company and has many exceptionally talented employees.  Employee expectation within many divisions is high.  Projects have extremely aggressive deadlines which requires a minimum of 15 extra hours each week, making it difficult to have a work-life balance."
good,Being a regular CSR in an agency is great until the agent dumps the entire agency on your shoulders without a pay increase. There are so many opportunities to be held liable for little things and eventually the stress becomes health issues. Be prepared to work long hours and not know what the next day will be.
good,Great place to work.  Lacking in pay and benefits.  Feel my great experience with data analytics slipping away and that is what I really enjoy.  Selling insurance not so much.  I like helping people as the  claims expert and customer service is my forte.  I have built great relationships with our customers over the years.
good,"The company is still a great company, however the agent I worked for turned out to be very shady and mean. Just make sure you always check your bills when they come in people."
good,"Answering phone calls, taking payments, answering billing questions, quoting insurance, setting appointments."
good,"If you want to start your own company, insurance sales is a great way to go. I didn't learn too much about the culture, but each office had their own. The agents were great and supported each other."
good,Worked to many hours and was not paid for additional hours worked. Eighteen hour days and weekends to keep up with the work load. Sad but true.
good,Depending on your role American Family can be a wonderful company.  I was able to build a strong network across all roles to assist with effectively leading my district.  I learned and built tremendous skills in my field.
good,American Family is good nice place to work. If you get the right management who help you succeed. Its all about team work and if applies agency can become very successful.
good,"It's a good place to work but no benefits, it was to far from my home  and everyday there was changes  you learn how to do something one day and the next  there was new  changes"
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company everyday. I felt proud of my employer. Only downside was not getting adequate pay for my experience and no Medical or Life insurance, or a 401K for my family."
good,Was the a very good company to work for when started & has now become less employee & more data favorable. Front line manager was great to work for & peers very helpful & service oriented.
good,"American Family is a great company, but the work/life balance is way off.  As an agent in training, the expectations were beyond what was portrayed in the interview process."
good,So many changes in the company. New goals requested to meet every month.compensation based on the company commissions set forth..hard work and right decisions of hiring within your agency to make it work.
good,Overall good company to work for but my positions was fairly new and under developed and still learning what exactly the position is. Overall it a fast passed environment that forces you to be organized and plan you day to the best of your ability. although the is no set work load your day can range from 5 claims to 18 claims per day.
good,Very corporate environment that treats contractors like dirt. I'm the only technical person in a Marketing department and I need to be in a technical environment
good,"As an agent, the main focus of this position is to protect others with insurance products offered. Solutions for the needs of insureds is the responsibility of the agent. A continued education of products and industry changes is necessary. Customer service oriented individuals will find this a very fulfilling career."
good,"Manage your time and production.  I have a great partner to work with. Everyday is a learning curve meeting new client and solving their needs."
good,I learned to research claims and denial for car accidents. I spoke to providers at hospitals about claim status and also members about the payments for claims.
good,"This is a good place to work.  Lots of organizational changes make it a little uncertain for long term advancement.  Overall, this company is a good place to have a stable job."
good,As an agent AMFAM provides excellent training. Hours are set by the agent. AMFAM can provide many opportunities in insurance. Not many benefits as an agent.
good,"For the most part a great company, but the area I am in is not stable. Changing schedules each year is not ideal for most families. Entertaining looking for another position elsewhere."
good,"The people are nice and personable, but they always struggled with employee levels and overload on work due to terrible staffing levels and turnover rate. They promised certain benefits and I never received any time off or paid vacation time. During my pregnancy and the time I missed they docked me pay when I had no choice but to go to the doctor. And they didn't have a good chain of command communication."
good,Easy going office environment. Manager is flexible with hours for the most part. Good support staff. This is not a high traffic area so you are not overwhelmed or overly busy at any given time. Obtaining your license is a must and allows you the opportunity for commissions.
good,Over all it was great to work there but because of wages being to high employees were targeted or weeded out for termination for anything. I lasted a little over 6 years.
good,"Great co-workers and some good benefits. Many, many changes going on with the company which is concerning for job security and/or advancement."
good,Helping people to feel confident in how they are protected by there insurance company is important to me. I found that giving them piece of mind in life was fulfilling.
good,"Great Place to work at Amfam. Its Productive and Learning technical workplace. manager and team helps  are really encouragive."
good,"At American Family Insurance I was my own boss.  This position allowed me to use my degree more than any position I have had.  I was responsible for my own budget, hiring process, marketing and other business aspects.  The only reason I left is the income was too unstable and at the time my family needed more stability."
good,"Above average pay for call center work. As in any call center metrics and key performance indicators(KPI) are crucial. If you can maintain adherence, attendance, score high on customer service touchpoint surveys then you will be a star at this job"
good,It offered a chance to create your own business from the ground up while at the same time receiving monetary help along the way. Unlike most in the industry where you would need to essentially buy you way in otherwise.
good,"I was licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in the state of Indiana for 4 years after passing the state exam. In addition to selling and writing policies, I also performed many office manager roles for the agent that I worked for."
good,Amfam is an awesome place to work if you like to stay in the same role and have no desire to move up or laterally. People stay in the same roles for 10+ years and are very content. They treat you well.
good,"Good company to work for, but they have their ideal customers .  If you don't fit the mode as the customer they are looking for, the rates are not very competitive.  Tough to explain to long time customers why they are paying so much more, just because they don't have great credit."
good,"Amfam as a whole is decent, however, the particular agent I worked for provided no training or pointers that corporate requires her to do as the agent."
good,"Busy environment, lots of call volumn and variety.  Good salary and possibility of commission. Nice people.  Offer good service and good products. Management is good to their staff."
good,"Worked at  American Family in Minnesota before moving to Iowa. Typical day was opening mail, requesting police reports from various Police Depts, pulling files for the underwriters, answering phones, I was just about to learn how to micro-film  (yes that's how long ago it was)  when I moved.      "
good,"I worked a few day per week during my last semester of college. The agency was flexible in helping me with work and college balance, I am grateful for the opportunity afforded to me."
good,I love the company but feel like I am being pushed out for not conforming.  There are many roadblocks that I never figured out how to get through. There are too many reorgs and turnover.
good,"Required overtime we were not paid for every week, meetings once a month on the weekends we were also not paid for. I took a few classes for life insurance that were supposed to be paid for as well (came out of my own pocket)  The agent was usually out of the office and I was the only other one that worked there so I was required to run the show and was only paid $11 an hour. I received no commission for the sales I made. If we wanted to take a lunch we had to come in even earlier to do so."
good,"great people to work with"
good,"Worked in a concept project in which management changes happened too frequently and led to the failure of the project to produce results that were very achievable.  In a period of 4 years I had 6 direct managers, 4 middle managers and 3 division managers."
good,"Fun Place to work, Management is really cool and friendly people to work with, Got to learn new tools and techniques. It was real good experience working environment is always fun."
good,"I worked as an office manager and sold insurance when my agent was out of the office, I did property, home and auto.  I filed claims and took payments, opened and closed the office"
good,"Amfam is a solid company with a lot of great people.  Competitive rates on home, auto, & life.  I write new business so I made lots of calls and prepared tons of quotes each day.  I learned a lot about how insurance works."
good,I was contracted. Good place to work if you can get over corporate politics. Managers and teams are better than awesome. Great atmosphere to work in..
good,"Ok for the most part. Limited opportunity to work your way up. Lack of management in some respects. Sometimes long hours, travel, and long way from home some nights."
good,"Typical work day for an accounts receivable clerk consisted of invoicing receivables, ensuring clients where made aware of existing invoices and following up on aging invoices."
good,"Family friendly, a great place to work while you are raising your children.  Provides access to continuing education and additional training.  Committed to the communities they serve."
good,American Family Insurance truly cares about providing excellent customer service. No matter how good a company is there is always room for improvement. I'm sure there are policies and procedures that can better assist adjusters with their time and work flow all of which is intense due to the volume of claims verses number of qualified adjusters. Company has great benefits. 401K and retirement. Resent College graduates looking to start a career should consider starting with this company.
good,"Completive pay, hires from within, great work life balance.  Managers are willing to help if needed, co-workers were great."
good,"Usually the same thing everyday. Didn't come in to any surprises, knew what to expect for the day. Management was nice and there to help with any questions."
good,"A typical day was quite hectic at times but with strong teamwork, we managed to get the job done. We worked hard but found time to enjoy ourselves as well. I enjoyed correcting hard billing issues and being able to have the client understand and be happy at the end of it all."
good,"Unfortunately my position is being eliminated but I love the company.  "
good,"My boss was awesome.  I would do insurance certificates, quote and write policies, do billing emails and collect payments."
good,This is an awesome and laid back place to work. Agents/Staff are friendly and very helpful with the learning process. I have learned a lot about the insurance industry by being employed with this company. I would highly recommend this company to anyone just starting out with learning the trades of insurance.
good,"Good company, good management. Pay was good, considering it was an entry level job. Room to move up. Would definitely recommend."
good,"Great place to start a new career. Job,work balance, environment and compensation and benefits really all depend upon the Agent."
good,Assign claims to independent adjusters and coordinate with other workers regarding claims. It is a fun place to work for and employees are taken good care of
good,"Ran the day-to-day business, sales process throughout, hired and trained my sales associates.  Ran a successful business with the help of corporate"
good,"good benifits, hade good work schedule one week 4 days one week 5 dats.  good pension, inside work not much travel.  good training, company was well respected"
good,"Provided customers with best quotes for homeowner, renters, auto, and commercial. The most enjoyable part of insurance is the point of sale, you want to make sure quotes provided are in customers best interest."
good,Michael Hamilton and the portland team are a great place to work and place to work and provide everthing you need to be sucessful
good,I always say that the two best things I did for my career were starting to work for Enterprise and quitting working for Enterprise.
good,I would make and take calls concerning customers insurance policies
good,"As a receptionist at American Family, I would answer phones, submit insurance forms, collect payments, keep up on emails, faxing  and filing papers, making courtesy calls and double checking all work. I learned so much at American Family about insurance, but most importantly you can't be afraid to ask questions. The hardest part of it all was trying to remember everything about insurance, it's a lot harder than people think. The experience was nice though!"
good,"On the job working with insurance my typical day was answering the phone and either fulfilling the clients request or transferring the call to the appropriate person.  Worked on billing doing late pays, cancellations, and any other issues concerning a clients account.  I would help the other fellow employees with various responsibilities such as setting up folders and mailing out temporary insurance cards."
good,"American Family Insurance is a great company to work for. As an office assistant I am not qualified for quoting or creating policies, but I typically am involved in data entry, answering phones, organization, and a lot of computer work. The management in my office is very nice and accomodating to my life schedule. The co-workers are always very friendly and helpful. I've learned a lot about the importance of accurate data entry. The hardest part of the job is staying organized between all of the client policies and paperwork. I have also found this to be my favorite part of the job because I love to organize and I enjoy seeing how it helps my co-workers and manager work more efficiently on their tasks."
good,"I love working in the insurance industry, licensed agent in property, casualty & Life"
good,"This is a company that has many opportunities for different careers while maintaining your benefits.  As a long term employee, I've had great opportunities to learn and grow through experiences in different disciplines.  These various roles provided a broader perspective of the organiation which helps me make more informed decisions related to my current role."
good,"Learned the American Family systems and products the most enjoyable part of my job is talking to the customers and solving problems in product, billing"
good,"Follow on past and present leads."
good,The company was great to work for; however the local office was not a suitable fit. I enjoyed the customers and assisting them with billing. I felt very confident in myself for acquiring my KS state insurance license.
good,"As an Agent In Taining (AIT), I've learned a lot about insurance sales. I've been able to sell muliple lines of insurance to both current clients as well as prospective clients."
good,The company has a rich history of taking care of its employees and customers.  The dedication I have seen to ensuring ultimate satisfaction of customers has been the driving force of why I have maintained my employment there for so long.  
good,"Company is great but the compensation and benefits lack. Also if you plan on moving up in the company, the only option is to become an agent or find a position to become a Manager."
good,"It is incredibly fast-paced and very demanding due to having 4 agents in one office, it was a very difficult transition going from one agent to four. "
good,A typical day included managing relationships with existing client base while also effectively and creatively prospecting new clients.
good,People are very approachable and friendly. Great working culture.
good,"Typical day was reviewing accounts, helping people understand their ins."
good,"Worked as an independant contractor for American Family Insurance. No benefits, a lot of red tape and rules to follow, it was nice to have a flexible schedule but I was still working 6 days a week. At the end of the day it is a sales position and with the tough economy when your client can't pay their bills and the policies cancel, you lose the commission you earned. The pricing is not as competitive as it could be. Unless you have a large center of influence or a lot of friends and family who will buy from you it is tough these days to build your business."
good,"no work life balance, te money was great started at the company making over $35,000 at age 26. You learn a lot of aspects in regards to insurance"
good,"opened, answered phones, took claims, did filing, ran front desk, closed at night"
good,"While I was working for this company, I was comfortable with the agents. They trained me on how to do quotes, and what it is like to go to properties and view what they have to view as far as letting a customer to receive insurance on a home. I was treated with respect. I felt part of the insurance family."
good,enjoyed selling insurance related products and providing customer service.
good,"Fast paced, managers very helpful. Good benefits. Customer focused."
good,The management created a positive work environment for the staff field adjusters.
good,"Direct Management show genuine interest in your development."
good,"I love working here! I do wish and hope someday that we can be offered affordable health care, 401k, and yearly raises.  Also , more competition bonuses would be nice!"
good,"American Family Insurance is a good place to work.  I believe permanent employees are compensated well.  As a consultant your rate is determined by the recruiting company you work for.  Great group of educated, intelligent people."
good,"Independent agencies, so independent operations an office work environments vary. "
good,Managed Excel template for claim payments. Daily assembled payment packages to send out in a timely manner. Reconciled paid checks to account payable databases.
good,"Steady paced & helped a lot of people. I was offered the opportunity to add training & certifications, but the office closed before I had the opportunity."
good,"Work Life balance, "
good,it a good place to work its fun and the customers are very nice my co worker is awesome. We answer phone quote make changes to policy put payments on  for the customer and basically help the customer
good,You would need to be self-motivated and self-taught.  The position was learn as you go with very little training and little understanding of expectations.
good,Insurances  can be difficult to understand so lots of questions from customers and agents how to process or understand the billing. Amfam gave more directions on how to improve your job setting as well and was asking for input to increase daily productivity or how to improve .
good,"I really enjoy my job at American Family.  I was allowed a lot of freedom while on the job.  I was allowed to come and go as I please for appointments.  Training was confined to modules and could have used a little more hands on training.  Overall,  a very nice place to work."
good,"With downsizing occurring, adjusters pending claims. were transferred to others and claims and call volumes were becoming unmanageable. Total breakdown in management. Employees were knowledgeable and extremely friendly to work with"
good,Would like to work for an agency with stability and security. I started my insurance life in 1980 as a rater and worked my way up to underwriter. Went into the agency life to help and support our community in making sound insurance choices.
good,"The local claims management team was good to work for. They were flexible and cared about the adjusters, as long as you did your job well you were left alone no micro-managers here. On the down side pay was low, raises were small, and not much room for advancement."
good,Over the 12 years I worked for them I had 15 managers and all were great except the last one that was very difficult to work for. He was judgemental and against women in the field. this led to us not getting along and ending my employment with them. The last BCM of our district spoke good words but did not stand up for his employee's. this was in 2016.
good,Difficult to review the company as a whole as I worked for an individual insurance agent. Great agent with fresh ideas. From my experience American Family Insurance supports hard working self starters.
good,"They have the best benefits out of all personal insurance carriers, flexible time off after reaching a salaried position. "
good,"it was like working in a small office. Everyone got to know one another very well. The office was a little disorganized, it needs some structure, and there was a lot of work to do it was a bit overwhelming at times, but was a great feeling when things came together."
good,Great Team and environment. Call center environment with little room for environment.  You are on the phone from the time you clock in till you get off. Great team and everyone seem to get along well. Awesome committees to be a part of
good,The most enjoyable part is coding and wrap up meetings in the company during Fridays. My co-workers are good as well and we will take any task as challenging.
good,"Field all vehicle rental calls from customers, operations, agents, vendors and third party administrators."
good,American Family is a good place to work although it seems they can't find direction they want to go and stick with it. It seems they are always changing. It seems they are trying to copy other companies instead of doing what works for American Family.
good,"Basically managing and operating a small business , has it positives and negatives. Not many vacations but ability to take an afternoon off."
good,I appreciated the supportive work environment. Staff were always ready to work together on group projects and willing to answer questions when needed. As a temporary worker it is sometimes hard to garner relationships with other colleagues but they made it a welcoming environment and I would recommend it to others.
good,"As retail jobs go Home Depot is one of the better stores to work for. If you are lucky to get the ""good"" department manager it is a fun job."
good,"It is a nice job, just the office size is small, hard to promote and raise."
good,"I really have enjoyed working here.  The job is always changing, which keeps me on my toes.  I have learned how to deal with many different personalities of those that I work with.  I have learned how to motivate and train someone to be successful.  My co-workers are the best.  We have an awesome support system between us and I know that I could ask any of them a question about something and one of them will know the answer and vice versa.  I have never had to be afraid of being judged.  Management is good.  The hardest part of my job is to see someone not succeed.  The most enjoyable part of my job is to celebrate the successes, big or small."
good,"This is mainly a sales job, and I learned that I am not a salesman. I learned lots of office skills and customer service skills, as well as how to sell things. It was definitely a good opportunity and I dont regret it, but like I said I am definitely not a salesman and now I know for sure."
good,"Most of the day is spent quoting potential customers and calling them. There is so much time on the phone following up with potential customers. I ran 0-5 new-customer appointments per day and sometimes marketed to the passer-by outside our office. I was always a temp/fill-in person but I generally liked my boss/co-workers. The computer system crashes a lot and is slow. This job was not at all difficult, I just get easily bored with really repetitive things."
good,I worked there for over 35 years for the great benefits and salary.
good,"Workload was always disproportionate to the staffing available.  More work than was manageable.  People were great.  When workload wasn't overwhelming, it was a great and fun place to work.  Senior management was not responsive to problems with staffing."
good,American Family enterprise companies are embarking on optimizing business performance and alignment of skills across operation companies. Exciting times.
good,The commissions are being reduced and the pricing for their products continue to rise. The management is somewhat supportive but they do not have  any control over pricing.
good,"This job has been a good learning experience. However, there really isn't any room for advancement. The company seems to be heading in a direction that doesn't make it competitive in Georgia."
good,"Life Department talking with customers, helping them with their needs, updating the information. "
good,"American Family Insurance is a great place to work if you are okay with working on a Contract. I believe that if you are a full-time Employee you are compensated with some pretty good benefits. If you are a contractor your benefits are decided by your contracting company. So there is that, but everything else is great."
good,Office is small so all the employees are in. Very close work environment which makes it difficult sometimes when working. Manager is hardly in the office also which isn’t the best case scenario.
good,Challenging and rewarding work environment with access to senior leadership team.  Strong culture and commitment to employee development.  A growth company continually looking to expand its operating territory.
good,"I enjoy working for this company overall.  It offers great benefits.  It is a large company though, and is not always agile.  Management can take a long time to set direction and make decisions."
good,"The company is great to work for and you do see people stick around a long time.  The one issue is that your ability to move up completely depends on your manager, which at times can be frustrating when you repeatedly receive good merits and get some lousy excuse for why you didn't get a promotion.  The expected amount of work is low due to long time spent in planning but you will get really busy when the planning pipeline unclogs and everyone is expecting to use the extra budget left at the end of the year to fund their projects.  They do offer you 9 hour days with every other Friday off and a lot of other great features."
good,I have learned a great deal working with American Family. My co-workers are very nice and accommodating. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers. The hardest portion is the micro management of the schedule.
good,"It is good company."
good,"Being an office manager a lot of times I was left to run the office alone, opening and closing duties. Answer all the calls and assist all needs from customers that need to be met. Most of the time is stayed busy, customers would also come into the office for their needs or to make their monthly payment. I was responsible for making bank deposits as wells and writing new insurance policies."
good,"I enjoyed my time at American Family.  The atmosphere was Zen, the workers very friendly and kind.  They pay more than competitively, and they are concerned with an ergonomic environment."
good,company is getting better with the benefits package offered with flex time off schedule. management is good. they have a new claims system they are working through. some things could be better.
good,"Part of the stresses of working as a contract employee was to be let go unexpectedly. I once spoke to my manager who promised me that she would speak to me before anything like that would happen. after the new 3 year rule was implemented, she said that everybody would get a months heads up if we were to be let go because we were at our 3 year bench mark. I did not get any warning. I had a meeting with my supervisor, which went very well and he was happy with me. I went home and got a call to not come back. I would hope to return, but am hesitant to do so as well"
good,I've spent a lot of time working for the company in various roles. The company is customer focused and has a great vision. I have enjoyed my time there and the benefits are also a great perk.
good,"Typical day of production underwriting"
good,"I was a part time office assistant for 6 months. It's a good place to work, but being part time and not licensed was boring. The office manager and agent were both very kind and relaxed with me. They were greatly impressed with the work I did, and let me know in a constructive way when I did something incorrect. A big part of my position was dealing with billing and setting up yearly reviews, so there was a lot of customer contact."
good,American Family is a good place to get started if you don't have the funds to buy an exsisting agency. The Company has a great finance plan to help get you started.
good,"Building is very large, recently put in a new cafeteria with expanded library, fun seating. Can work in a variety of areas without losing benefits/salary. Definitely has a large corporation feel to it."
good,"they are very family based and take the time to properl ytrain employees. Management is fair and unbiased. The environment is diverse, very diverse. The atmosphere is easy going and steady pace"
good,All agencies are different. Our agency is very happy upbeat and we ladies love each other. We've become very good friends! Our agent is very responsible and kind. He's a good boss to work for!
good,I really enjoyed working there but there was no place to advance. I learned a lot and had a lot of training. Company supported agency staff.
good,"typical work day, learn new skills"
good,"Fast paced, big company that felt like small environment. Good cross team communication and assistance. Great opportunities to cross train"
good,"Coworkers and managers are positive and supportive, however the work itself can be difficult because often people disagree with you and feel your assessment is inaccurate.  If you enjoy arguing with people this may be the job for you."
good,"Handled first and third party losses-wrote estimate for the damages to all types of motor vehicles and was at the time a all lines adjuster."
good,"I genuinely enjoy insurance and had planned to work for this company in hopes to further my career. It is not the company itself I dislike, it's the individual agent's way of running his office. I prefer to work for someone (and for a company) tyhat appreciates their employess, treats them fairly, and sets them up for success."
good,"I enjoyed it, had a terrible boss, but absolutely no reflection on the company. Great place to work."
good,"Own, operate and manage a business while maintaining a customer retention level of 89% and a customer satisfaction score of 9.6 out of 10 Sell and advise businesses and individuals on various types of insurance products, including home, auto, life, business, annuities and health Hire, train and manage a licensed staff."
good,"In a large company, such as American Family, I appreciated the flexibility to change jobs within the company."
good,"Good company. Constantly training. Insurance rates may not be the most competitive. 1099 employee as an agent, no healthcare or company benefits."
good,This business is good for motivated and driven people. Cold calling sucks but is a necessity to be successful. 
good,Most of your day is spent on the phone assisting customer needs and making first contact on new claims.  The hardest part of the job is the 2 hour contact on new claims while required to answer phone and assist on other adjusters claims.  Can present a challenge sometimes.  The best part of the job is knowing you helped someone who has just been in an accident and hopefully made things a little easier.
good,"Licensed sales representative looking over personal lines applications and quoting them up for western states."
good,"AmFam was good to work for while I could. I worked in the Iowa branch claims office in West Des Moines. It helped me launch my career in P&C Claims and they had great computer systems and technology compared to two other companies I've worked for now. Unfortunately I had only worked for AmFam 1.5 years when they announced they be closing their branch offices as part of a cost savings initiative and moving the claims jobs to their 6 regional offices in Phoenix, Denver, St. Louis, Madison, Minneapolis or Milwaukee. We were all offered positions in those offices from the 11 closing branch offices. I chose to stay in Des Moines because there are plenty of insurance companies to work for here and found a new position in claims very quickly. It was at least nice of AmFam to give us all 10 months of notice before the office closed. "
good,"OK place to work. The claims department was going through a major reshuffling closing/consoladating all but 6 offices nationwide. Given that, the past year was very stressful with no replacement of turnover."
good,Company is in the process of reorganization to ensure stability in the future. One of the insurance industry's leaders. Learned the insurance business. Enjoyed dealing/negotiating with people. Had to develop skills to manage my time because of the workload.
good,Good company to work for expect office is closing. .........................
good,Nice to be a part of such a well known company. Isolated job as a transcriptionist. Manager played favorites and allowed childish behavior to occur in department.
good,"!2 Plus hours a day and cannot catch up, Volumes of large Claims mostly Total Losses, Cutting Adjusters work load stays the same with less Adjusters, High expectations"
good,"My manager was amazing and took a lot of time to teach me and made sure I felt comfortable. He never threw me into a situation without making sure I knew what to do. However, the other girl in the office was awful and made my working life terrible"
good,"A typical day at work for me at American Family consisted of answering customer calls to enter claims, and to input data. I learned how to manage files and build customer relationships over the claim period. Management when I first started American Family, actually valued their employees, but as time continued, management became more strict and more goal oriented, thinking less about the value of their employees. Coworkers were very nice to work with and easy to build friendships with. The hardest part of the job was being timed on talk time and call handle time when each call is different and different customers require longer talk times than others. The most enjoyable part of my job was being around team members who could relate to everyday challenges and be there to support through the process."
good,A typical day at work involved field adjusting.  Management was from the field mostly. Workplace culture  was  family . The hardest part of job was meeting the metrics. The most enjoyable part  of the job was meeting the metrics.
good,"This is a great company with good managers.  Growing pains with buidling the company include very long days, alot of travel due to poor distribution of claims, and alot of really important short notice mandatory trainings. Overall good company with alot of potential."
good,"Maybe its just the place I work, but management does not really respect young people. Even though I have a license as an agent, the respect is not given where it deserves."
good,"Diverse but limits on advancing unless you want to relocate. Most of the opportunity is in the corporate office in Madison, WI. "
good,This company was great to work for! Very kind and customer centered. Great people! If you want a job or good insurance company this is the place for you!
good,"The goal of the claims department is too assist our insured customers through the claim process. This entails investigating coverage under the policy, investigating the motor vehicle accident, paying what is owed under the terms of the policy and coverages purchased by the customer."
good,"A good 40% of a typical work day is spent marketing, prespecting,"
good,"It is a good place to work. Mixed culture. Nice ,clean environment. Not much more say about it."
good,Nice people and successful business and morals. Ultimately needed more pay and needed to stay home with our new baby. I'd recommend working with them to anyone who was interested in that field.
good,"As with all companies, times change. American Family used to believe in the word ""Family"". They seem to go through a restructure once every 3-5 years. You might have to re-apply for your current position.  Benefits were great. they are currently re-structuring their whole Commercial program."
good,loved being able to do the work on my own instead of always having a supervisor there. Boss was very accommodating with the schedule. Learned more about auto and home insurance
good,"Insurance agents assistance, process payments, receptions duties/answering phone calls, filing scanning, face to face customer interaction"
good,This was not a routine jobs each day was different which made it better to come to work everyday.Co workers always helped if you had any questions with new procedures.
good,"Working at American Family Insurance was such a good job , it gave me the opportunity to get my insurance certificate.Its a laid back job just like any receptionist job."
good,"Yeah this is an awesome job. I love the company, but I am looking for other opportunities else where. Hardest thing about job....maybe how there is fewer people to do more work."
good,"A great company to work for. "
good,"I would come in and file a stack of papers of clients portfolios. Stamp and send out mail, sort out incoming mail for my boss and other representatives. I would make appointments, answer phones, and take messages. I also set up birthday cards for clients. I didnt have co-workers really, they just handed me papers to file. The hardest part of my job was not having any person to person contact. The most enjoyable part of my job was making appointments for clients."
good,"Enjoyed educating my customers so they could make informed decisions to protect their assets.  "
good,"It is a great opportunity to manage a large block of clientele, staff and day to day business operations.  "
good,"Overall, a nice place to work.  The management I worked with is very supportive and great to work with."
good,"Home office, great benefits, company auto, some evening work"
good,"Scheduled appointment for the agent. Made contact calls to current and potential customers. Gave quotes for home, auto, boat and life insurance. Wrote policies for new and current clients, then input all the information into the computer systems. It was a very small office. Management was great. The hardest part of the job was making the new business quotas for each month. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you got to know the customers and create connections with them."
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers with the decisions they needed to make concerning their insurance needs, whether it be how they were going to make their payments or what type of coverage they were going to need for their future."
good,"Great staff of people to work with, management is impeccable, however, the case load is not manageable when you handle all general adjusting and large loss adjusting as well. Claim response times are greatly reduced due to the case load. "
good,"I started this job very confidently and persevering. I would always do my best and worked very hard to complete each task and as well go above and beyond. Unfortunately, I was not trained well enough and I was under-qualified for the job. I have not had much personal experience with insurance because I am young and still learning. It was great because I love helping people and giving advice. I would call about 50 people a day for insurance, and 1/10 of them would answer and I would quote them. Other tasks were taking payments and notifying people of past due, cancellations, and updated insurance requested. I worked 8-9 hours a day and my coworkers was basically my boss, and he was busy a lot. Management was unsteady because my boss had to leave out of town for a couple weeks when I just started. When he came back, he went out of the office a lot of times. I learned much about auto and property insurance and how to communicate with people for their best options. I enjoy learning and showing individuals that people really do care about their well being such as insurance and any other vital advice."
good,"Created print advertisements that contributed to audience awareness of our agency "
good,"Great place to work. Very diverse, even if they don't practice diversity, they preach it and welcome all kind of people. Managment is great, smart, confidence and open mind leaders. They encourage all employees to continue to learn and educate themselve in whatever the employee desire."
good,"A typical day of work involves sorting our work to the appropriate folders and then pulling working to process. "
good,"American Family is a family oriented place, they pay fairly and offer great incentives. It is a great place to work if you would like to work in insurance."
good,"As someone who didn't strike out into the workforce to work in insurance, I can say that American Family has done well by me."
good,Loved the job but economy went down the agency was not doing so well
good,American Family Insurance is a good company. The specialize in having a diverse environment and take really good care of their employees. To advance with the company you will need to be open to relocate. Most people who have worked there have moved and had to relocate several times.
good,"I enjoyed the complexity of type of automobile claims. The leadership that my managers exhibit. The mulitple projects involved in, mentoring of co-workers with liability decisions, injuries and negotiations."
good,"Applied payments for insurance policies, answered phone calls and questions from clients. Called Mortgage companies and updated declaration pages with them. Sent out mailings to help create new business."
good,"American Family Insurance is currently going through a lot of change. It is a good organization and a lot of good people work there. While some aspects of the change have turned into churn, there are some good directions. AmFam values customers and employees, however the good intentions of the top management don't always filter down consistently throughout the organization. AmFam also needs to update its approach to younger potential customers. Having said all that, it is still an excellent organization and a good place to work."
good,"Love the people and the work, company is changing though and jobs are not as secure as they once were.  There seems to be a lot of disconnect between the top and the workers."
good,I worked at American Family as a contract Project Manager.  The executives that I worked with were driven and fast paced.  The peers that I worked with were supportive of each other.
good,"The work environment in the dept. I work is good.  However, once someone is in the Support Center, it is hard to advance out due to the Support Center being such a needed part of the structure."
good,"Great Corporate Culture at American Family Insurance. "
good,Was a good company to start off as when a Sales specialist. There is time to grow. There just needs to be better benefits for someone who is starting a family.
good,"American family is an above average employer with good pay and benefits but is not without its faults. The middle and upper management are competent but have very high expectations of their employees and at times it seems they don't hold themselves to such high expectations. "
good,"Great benefits! you didn't really know what to expect from upper management. They seem to do something new and then after time decide it isn't working and go back to the way things were years before. Not cutting edge, more of a follower than in industry leader."
good,enjoyed the culture at American Family.  I received good pay for the expected work.   I enjoyed helping customers get quality repairs done.  I learned many skills that I have been able to use in my career.
good,"Nice that there is little supervision, so no micromanaging. Not much room for advancement in the warehouse, and not much ability to grow your wage. Fun people to work with."
good,"The company has great benefits and competitive wages in the job market. The culture is fun and underwhelming. Advancement is harder to do. Not enough cross training in the company to offer advancement. "
good,"Great training, opportunities, and team culture. Many staff events and activities. Lots of recognition with great communication. Well-trained management and very caring."
good,The company is a great company. I enjoyed working there. I worked for an agent. I would answer the phones and help sell insurance. As well as help with billing questions.
good,Great hours. Management works with your schedule. You have the option of a 30 or 45 min lunch which was nice.  This was a position through a temporary agency so it didn't last very long
good,Work balance is the main reason I came aboard. No struggle in getting off or having time for family or vacation. Everyone works hard to achieve the sales goal and you are awarded for hard work!
good,"Great work life balance but a lot of old management.  "
good,It is easy to want to come to work here. There is a lot of ongoing change to continue improvements and make us best in class.
good,This is a great company and people here are very nice. I have been interning here for 5 months. The only problem is about the efficiency.
good,American family is a great company to work for. They do care about their employees and are consistently improving employee engagement. The only cons I have is that I am located in a smaller office and there is not much room for opportunities.
good,"AmFam is working towards being a national company. With any company that is growing, you get growing pains.  All in all AmFam is a great company to work for."
good,I truly enjoy all the clients I have in the past 24 years.  I need to be thinking of my retirement future - this is why I am looking for a job that has those benefits.   This is in a work place of an agency - not directly with American Family -
good,"Very intense, stressful environment."
good,The work environment along with the staff is what keeps me coming back every day.
good,"I would process insurance claims, set-up new policies, daily contact with insuance agents locally and all over US.  I like the Customer Service contact with clients and agents and was able to become more involved in multi-tasking and enjoyed the position."
good,"Typical day at work is following up on previous sales calls, placing new sales calls and organizing ""drop off"" material for potential new clients. Also, managing sales team and developing new agents."
good,"Quality company with good benefits, pay is less than market."
good,"A typical day involved direct contact with each of the directors and the associate vice president to discuss the upcoming work day and what was scheduled. Basically it was to be sure that everyone was up to par as to what to expect for the day. I learned how to manage others' schedules and to focus on others' needs and make their needs and wants a priority. My co-workers were great, got along well with everyone. The hardest part of the job for me was to leave work on time at the end of the day rather than stay late to do extra work to be sure that the next day was going to run smoothly for all. The most enjoyable part of the job were all of the different people that I got to work with and the variety of tasks that I was able to take part in each day."
good,"Like to work downtown Iowa city. Nice walk to the Ped mall or from classes. Did a lot of cold calling for new prospects. Good upper management, just had poor supervising agent that is no longer with the company."
good,Great learning and Great place of work.Nice colleges..lot  of learning..new technology implementation and Nice leadership  and management.comfortable work environment
good,"I’ve never work as a claim adjuster and it was a adjustment for me and new experience, I did like it but the days were long because your on the computer the whole time and I wasn’t use to that, but overall it was a great job."
good,It is a very fast paced job. It keeps you on your toes but that is the thrill of it! You never know what the next call will be like coming in. The test to become licensed is difficult but you just have to set your mind to it.
good,"Co-workers were amazing, managers were super understanding of any situation you couldn't work, but there was a lack of advancement in the company, other departments would usually only hire and interview people who had like 5+ years in the company."
good,Positive work environment.  Variety of different types of positions makes finding a niche job.  Competitive compensation packages with nice benefits.  Good people to work with.
good,The company offers great benefits with company match 401K. My manager is very easy going and eager to help you advance. The company tries to listen to employee concerns and take active steps to address them. There is a lot of work in the adjuster role and some of the expectations are not realistic
good,Very information and good work environment. Good work experience and helpful employees that's willing to help when needed. Customers were very happy with my help.
good,A typical day at work is very fun because it's competitive and positive. I learned how to hold people I work with accountable to the job at hand.  MAnagement is great he is kind but very honest and pushes others. nothing is too hard. the whole job is enjoyable.
good,"Sales driven culture, great people and staff to work with.  Ongoing training and classes.  Flexibility in schedule and making own decisions to get the job done."
good,It was a very quiet environment that allowed me to experience different ethnic backgrounds while assisting with various insurance concerns. It was also a great experience to answer inbound and outbound calls.
good,call center environment as you are on the phone all day. sometimes can feel that you are being monitored and micro-managed. limited room for advancement but a good place to start off career in insurance
good,It's very common for managers and senior team members to give interns either busy/clerical work or not much work at all. This was not my experience at AmFam and I'm happy to say that they really treated me as a valued team member and gave me important tasks that affected the company.
good,"1. A typical day at work can be a challenging but in a good way  "
good,"Enjoyable place to work. Room to grow within the company. I learned how to deal with all kinds of people over the phone, new tricks from co-workers. The culture was diverse and fun."
good,worked for agency. management was nice and people worked with were nice. no real training involved. got to interact with customers a lot and customer service was key
good,I had a very flexible schedule with the agent. She was always there to help me with any learning curve I was going through. The agent made the workspace fun but learnable.
good,"It was nice to be able to work from home. I was able to work at my own pace and was still able to keep my workload manageable. "
good,"From what I've heard after leaving, they have increased their incentive based bonuses and vacation time to be more in line with the industry. The people can be real stale, and they have meetings just to have meetings."
good,Great overall benefits.      Too much claims related work and administrative tasks that doesn't allow front line managers to actually manage and coach people.
good,"Pleasant work environment. My supervisor was fantastic and co-workers were very congenial, helpful, and friendly to the point that that everyone seemed like family."
good,Great place to work; very flexible; great managers!  Encouraged furthering your education and supported your career goals.  Work balance and family life balance are great!
good,Too much stress trying to meet quotas with policies. We are being  pushed towards more Life Insurance policies or any policies at this time. We cannot make people buy.
good,Workplace culture was good and fun and the employees were great and job security was solid but the paid was not up to insurance standards. but the work load was fair.
good,Worked with a couple of Insurance Agents at AmFam and felt valued and appreciated. There was room to always learn and grow. When I moved I was able to continue working until I found the right next step for me.
good,"While I enjoyed working with everyone in the office and the customers I met and the knowledge I gained, I just found that this professional field was not what I was hoping it would be."
good,A good company to grow your skills. Fair to customers and employees. Management made job fun and was easily approachable. I would recommend this job to anyone who would like to develop their sales skills
good,"American Family offers a standard suite of auto insurance coverage types, plus a few additional options including:"
good,Its definitely a productive fun place to work. Employees get a lot of perks including 5/4 and very good insurance benefits. Overall its a nice place to work.
good,I got hired as an agent.  The training  was very good and extensive.  I learned does about insurance but nothing about learning how to run an agency.  I with that would have been included
good,"I enjoyed working at American Family and building relationships with coworkers, the agents and insureds.   Great benefits and they worked with employees.  Flexible hours."
good,The company provides a great product and cares for its customers.  All agencies are run as individual small businesses so the management depends on the agent.  I am lucky to work for a great one.
good,"When I worked for an American Family Insurance office the manager was the best. She was kind, knowledgeable, assertive, and fair. She made the work environment peaceful."

good,I worked at American Family most of my career and enjoyed all of the opportunities during my time with the company.  The people I encountered while working at American Family were very professional and supported career advancement.
good,Personally had my own auto claim with them and the service was good. had my deductible returned back to me right way so I know they jumped on the other party ASAP.
good,"I enjoyed working at AMFAM, the people were nice and management was very supportive and would assist you with any training or help needed. I really liked my co-workers and they were good hearted hard working people."

good,"Participated in Cost Estimation Class 5, Class 4 and Class 2 to remediate applications and also various other dispositions. Analysis of effort model and data in the estimation sheet. Assist Project Manager in Project management Plan and Resource Planning"

good,it is a good job working with different people of all ages to make bossiness growing as well and to make a little bit of extra cash
good,This was a part time job.  I provided my typing skills and listened to accident depositions and typed just as each client described accidents
good,This job allow me to home in on my work skills and allowed me to sit-up the office the way I wanted it to be.  Picking out the phone system to the computers and even the mailing equipment.
good,"A typical day at work includes answering the phones and returning all calls, processing any necessary changes, and contacting customers for any necessary correspondence. Additionally creating and implementing marketing procedures, and office procedures to help maintain a high retention rate for current customers, as well as a high satisfaction rate.  Eight years in insurance has taught me how to multitask incredibly well, with special emphasis on resolving difficult situations and assisting upset customers. I work with two agents, as their only assistant. I am the designated customer service representative, while they focus on sales. I handle all the eight computer systems on a daily basis to enter their applications, assist customers with their billing questions, and process all account changes."
good,"Working on all aspects of issuing policies for new business, there always  something changing and new things to learn daily. I had a great supervisor and my co-workers were helpful, friendly and great to work with. I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was constant changes."
good,Fun place to work- awesome support from the agent- he was always willing to help and jump right in with the csr staff

good,"American Family Insurance provides a good job culture"
good,"Job work life balance is important to this company"
good,I was a temp for someone on medical leave and I learned alot about the insurance world.  I had a wonderful experience working there.
good,Great opportunity for my first job in insurance. Was give the chance to work on my own and my supervisor had complete faith in  me.
good,good company just not sure there was really a position for me  kari leslie is awesome

good,"My day would consist of me notify lienholders for payoff balances on totalled out vehicles."
good,"Assists in the set-up and coordination of district-level marketing events and meetings as directed by the Agency Sales Manager; attends events as necessary. "
good,American Family Insurance is a great company to work for.  They offer competitive wages and an excellent benefits package.  Management shows an interest in their employees. 
good,"Fantastic company to work for if you need to balance family and work schedules. While the pay is adequate, it's the benefit of being able to separate work and family life that draws many if not most people to amfam. "
good,"A typical day at the office consist of a morning round-up or meeting, account reviews, billing maintenance, quoting leads, completing homeowners, auto, commerical and life policies and servicing clients policies or following up on cliams."
good,"Great Company, great opportunity to have your own business."
good,"Provide for customer insurance needs...auto, homeowner, life..."

good,I loved working here and would definitely go back. My previous manager before my last one was great. I worked from home so it was great being able to be there for my children.
good,"Cold Calling "
good,The 15 year experience I had at American Family Insurance took me from the banking/financial world. the process of growing a business from the ground up was appealing to me. I worked hard growing the business with competitive insurance products. I had a sales manager that worked with me and trained me to be a confident sales and writer of their insurance products.
good,"I managed a very large agency.  I also had several employees which I mentored, coached and worked with on a daily basis.  I was fiscally responsible for my own agency.  I also had a marketing system in place to help grow my agency through leads, referrals, and mailings."
good,Everyday you looked forward to being at work. Some days were hard but that's a typical day in the office. Overall I had a great boss and wish there was more like him!
good,"This job did wonders for me when I needed it. My every day consisted of a full email box of certificate requests that I sent out by the end of the day. Management was excellent and friendly, seeing me as part of a team rather than an individual taking their money."
good,"I worked in Services (lots of background work with agents, no customer contact) and the job itself was great. The schedule was rather flexible: you have to be in sometime between 7 and 9AM, but when you arrive during that time is up to you, you will simply need to adjust what time you leave according to when you come in. They also give you the options of what's called a 5/4 schedule, meaning one week you work regular hours 5 days a week and the following week you work extended hours and get one day off or half of a day off. You get all major holidays off as well as some additional days (Black Friday, additional days of the holiday is on a weekend, etc.) I loved that the company allowed us the opportunity to create solutions and alternative procedures for problem areas within the job, but it was often pushed too hard. Essentially, it felt as if we were being asked to create a problem simply to fix it sometimes. When advancement became available, to put it plainly, the wrong people were promoted. Consistently, people who did things incorrectly or didn't do their job at all were promoted to higher positions, and perhaps the biggest point of frustration was that managers were promoted from other departments. Underwriters or policy and procedure employees were promoted into services with little training, so they couldn't efficiently manage their team as they didn't fully understand what their team did on a day to day basis. Overall, I enjoyed my time with the company and would have continued to work if I hadn't moved."
good,"This job is great, it usually has great coworkers and it’s great for team work. In this jobs you need to show your customer service skills and they need to be the best you can give."
good,"I have enjoyed my time here and still am. I have my license and with that being said, you are somewhat responsible for the amount of money you are able to make or not make. Commission is where the better money is, so if sales are not for you, then I would not recommend getting into the insurance industry. If you like a sales culture and that environment, then I wholeheartedly recommend American Family."
good,"A typical day was trouble shooting problems.  Sometimes there was a new system to work on...analysis, coding, testing, and rolling out.  The hardest part of the job was being on call 24/7.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the facilities."
good,Professional and Personal Life balance will be seen in American Family Insurance Company. Given a chance I would love to come back to American Family Insurance for work.
good,"The office that I worked in only had two people....me, a licensed customer service representative and the main insurance agent. I enjoyed my job helping people and finding which products were of most benefit to them as well as provided financial services. It was a typical 40 hour work week. Occasionally there was continuing education given for free and the district office with others in the same position."
good,"In the time I have worked here I have watched the company change.  There is a focus on employee relations.  They are striving to be a creative, innovative, and future focused company."
good,Nearly 100% of time is spent on incoming calls for people looking to file a home/auto claim or to update information on an existing claim.  The position is the best for working on communication skills.  The company has an excellent reputation and strives to make the work flow as smoothly as possible.  The ability to move upward appears to be only limited by one's ambition.  They provide wonderful training and the opportunity to mentor each other to make the job less stressful.
good,"I only worked here for 3 months as an intern but overall the company was very welcoming, had a lot of training opportunities. There was work life balance and people were friendly. The compensation was good for an internship as well."
good,I have nothing negative to say about this Company.  The culture is very employee friendly.  The benefits are good.  Everyone there is very nice.  I would work for this company again
good,"The company was a good company in the past."
good,American Family is a perfect name for American Family as my co-workers are just like family! In my 10 years at American Family I have had almost all great managers and have been promoted 3 times! The benefits are parallel to none that I've heard of in this area!
good,"very good balance in work and personal life"
good,"A typical day consists of taking calls and assisting customers with their needs such as billing questions. I learned how to use multiple applications such as Apex, Billing Center, CIM, etc. I also attended classes to complete my Property and Casualty Insurance License. Was not in touch much with management and co-workers since the job requires us to be in cubicles. The hardest part of the job was not getting updated information on changes regarding customers bills. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to speak with a variety of customers with different situations regarding their bill and helping them solve their questions."
good,"I've learned how to process insurance, billing , and explain to how benefits are used in each company. I also scheduled what they needed before the treatment session began."
good,"While working for American Family Insurance I gained knowledge within the industry and applied these skills to my everyday life. The staff and management showed compassion towards my work goals and my personal life and family. I enjoyed the everyday challenges of various tasks, departmental goals, policy changes, and client needs that continuously showed my success and eagerness to do my best."
good,"Taking calls in a daily basis, process claims and make payments. Refer our clients to our Certified Repair shop, contact field adjuster if payment was not done withing 2 days after the vehicle inspection. "
good,"AmFam has been a nice place to work.  It can be a bit stressful, however.  And the job takes its toll on you; I often do claims in my sleep."
good,"I enjoyed working for American Family Insurance co "
good,Gained a lot of valuable experience and increased insurance knowledge.
good,"I have worked at American Family Insurance for two years and I have really enjoyed every minute of it.  I had a great boss who created a great work enviornment and wonderful clients who made going to work everday enjoyable.  I am sad to leave American Family Insurance, however I am excited to have new opportunities in a new state.  I am moving because my husband is persuing his Master's degree."
good,I loved working for this company. Amfam is a great place to work. I had two reallly good managers who helped adcanxe me in the insurance industry. I also had the opportunity to meet some good people.
good,Surveys were done on new business and renewal property insurance. Surveys were reviewed for hazards and to make sure the dwelling coverage was adequate.
good,"American Family Insurance Company has taught me the value of how communication between departments and within departments is one of the most, if not the most trait there can be within an office to perform tasks most efficiently.  Since I have been employed, our company has undertaken the LEAN program to determine how to most efficiently achieve our goals in every aspect of our job.  This includes customer interaction and satisfaction, development of standard work streams and communications lines, along with input from employees for updating software programs to help eliminate time that can be used to complete other tasks."
good,"Excellent part of the job is you are given real responsibility as well as mentored through out your internship period. "
good,Good place to work. Work/Life balance is great. Flexible schedule is awesome.  Allows me to take the time I need to deal with family commitments.  Also supports work from home.
good,I was only employed for a short amount of time.  The work was challenging and good training was provided.   The culture was fast paced yet the job provided good work life balance.
good,"Answering claim calls from property and auto owners requesting to make a claim or check on one. Lots to learn, good training, work from home reps, great pay!"
good,"Arrive at 8:30 to open the office. Normally start in on lead calling for the agency to help customers save money on their auto/homeowners insurance. After that I follow up with recent customers I have worked with in the last week. I also multi task with inbound phone calls with payments, policy changes, and questions. Also market my business to get more potential customers for the future. As the day ends I usually follow up with the leads I had not yet been able to speak with."
good,"call center customer service"
good,"Great people, flexible work schedules, relaxed and comfortable work environment, and I assume all the other pros that come along with a fortune 500 company."
good,American Family is a great place to work. Due to Corporate  restructure our office was closed. I was not in a position to relocate.
good,I worked with 7 other technicians in the Eden Prairie Regional Office. We all worked very well together and we assisted each other in completing project work and service calls that had to be done.
good,A really great company with very competitive benefits. Pay is reasonable for entry level positions. Due to the nature of the industry work can be extremely stressful and quick passed.

My desk is located in right inside the front door. I greet customers, help them if I can, or see if the agent is available if that is what is needed. I upload document into customer's files, fax requested information, update customer info as needed, update policies as needed, mail any requested information to customers, and reply to emails or any missed calls. "
