bad,I worked for several years and out of the blue was laid off or let go. Life Insurance can be a very cut throat business they terminated a manager and brought in a new manager fro another company in NY who brought some of his own people and several of us at that time lost our jobs
bad,"The company told me to submit 6 applications in 60 days or $6,000 in commission and then I will start getting paid a salary. In the life insurance application it said I don't need to collect a check from anyone to submit an application."
bad,"There are much better choices than Penn Mutual!"
bad,This was a work place that allowed me to go in everyday and get my job doone.  No career growth and a glass roof.
bad,I wasted 9 years of my professional life/work experience.  Penn Mutual almost assumes that their employees are complacent and do not require proper treatment/compensation .  Do yourself a favor and pass this opportunity by.   Advancement is not there and it mirrors Prudential across the street.     They brag about record breaking sales years but in no way return that back into the hard working peoples pockets.  Only to every year have the same excuse of where the budget is needed.   Sad
bad,Been here since 2008.  The pay hasn't increased with the multiple additional responsibilities i took on.  They morph you into roles and provide zero benefit.  Large discrepancy in payment  between job levels.  Benefits were bad and recently got worse now lacking hsa funding.    Unsure how they even hold onto certain levels of employees here.
bad,"I only worked there for 10 months, and the Chief Investment Officer at the time lacked both communication and managerial skills. The one positive thing that I can say is that the compensation was decent."
bad,"Penn Mutual is a good company to work for with benifits, 401k, and profit sharing.  All Penn Mutual's co-workers were great to work with.  Everyone treated each other like family.  Penn Mutual gave you the opportunity to better your career and move up in the company."
bad,There was no room for advancement.  It is a dead end job.  The benefits are horrible.  I don't understand how a private life insurance company can offer such poor benefits to their employees.
bad,Management was terrible with training and  terrible with one on one meetings. Also things weren't based off the honors system. people with 0 payed commission gets an office and easy term conversion leads and they couldn't close those.
bad,"This was an excellent company until they started promoting people with no experience or people skills to management positions. It destroyed the area I was working in and allowed management to hire 'similarly' aged employees. Expectations were unrealistic and not everyone is held to the same standards. Management allows good people to leave and or get fired and keeps people on staff that make them look good. Salary and job titles based on friendships, not education or knowledge base."
bad,Management is no help. Term Life is not very competitive. Underwriting takes too long. Does have good marketing. Not forth coming about base salary and advice on contracts.
bad,"was only there a short time DO NOT KNOW WHY YOU PICKED THIS EMPLOYER???"
bad,Great turnover of directors.Communication between management and employees is not the best and there is not a lot of collaboration between employees
bad,"I was hired on towards the end of 2016 with the position initially being a permanent full time position. Once I was offered the job I was told it was now a temporary position and I would be hired on permanent at the beginning of 2017."
bad,"New Penn Mutual office open it was a new training program which  overlapped sales times to have people actually make a living. In addition to obtaining a series 6 and 63, After studying and obtaining series licence program changed to Series 7. A bit of confusion on program requirements and not enough time to make actual sales."
good,Worked in a field office so I have very little knowledge on how the home office is managed. The field office I worked in was okay. Nothing special.
good,This was a flexible fast paced environment where I felt well accomplished at completing my job. My co-workers were great although there was some degree on over personal unprofessionalism with some of the supervision staff.
good,"I really thought they were different.  But, there was a change the last few years where they became a typical business; not being truthful on business objectives, hidden agenda's, etc."
good,not a good place to go if your not from the east coast or female. Very much male Indian environment. ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
good,"Tough job depending on one's personality. The culture there is friendly at first, but then it's all business. It is best to make friends there quickly or else you'll be shown the door."
good,"up beat enviorment"
good,"Company is going through a re-org.  Although I am sure that the project I have been contracted for will be completed, the company does not share information on whether or not they are keeping the contractors."
good,Penn mutual was a good company to work for. They treated their employees with respect and always acknowledged the accomplishments of their employees. They also made sure they would help the outside world as much as possible as well. I would go back to work for them if they would take me.
good,"Good people that care about their clients"
good,Hands on management of Security Investments and Life Insurance
good,a typical day at work is being your own boss you get what you put in. the other employees are always wiling to help and ability to partner up with other advisors and form a team.
good,"old school moving to the new millennium, some really great people, some areas more open than others, good benefits, ok resources, onsite gym, cafeteria and associate community events"
good,Great company to work for. Excellent benefits after a few months. Laid back environment.
good,"no room to grow at all"
good,The day would start with 1 hour drive plus traffic. I would hit the phones upon arrival of my desk. Catch up with advisors which have appointments of mine coming up. Set up appointments with advisors. To attend Training typically a few hours a day. Back to the Phones whenever possible booking about 5-10 appointments a week. Seeing clients with advisors whenever possible.
good,"Performing different tasks within a scope of software Quality Assurance engineer. Being involved in all stages of a SDLC and STLC. Management is professional, courteous and strong. Difficult 'crank' stages of a project. A great satisfaction when things get accomplished."
good,"a typical day at work would always be interesting."
good,I would assist two top agents with all aspects of new business with insurance and annuities. I would scrub and process applications to be sent to the carrier. The company was poorly managed. There appeared to be a lot of covering up when employees were treated poorly by the agents.
good,Everyone seems to enjoy it here and has the right balance between fun and productivity. Penn Mutual s a fun and exciting atmosphere.
good,"Held full responsibility for day-to-day transactions while continually managing ongoing servicing needs. Efficiently serviced producers and their clients by accurately processing financial and non-financial transactions while expertly responding to inquiries. Answered questions regarding annuity products and service needs. Effectively resolved problems and concerns to ensure a high degree of satisfaction. Maintained compliance with established procedures and regulatory requirements."
good,"Penn Mutual is a great company!  The culture at Penn Mutual is outstanding.  There are some issues, but I believe that this is something that they are working to improving."
good,"My team (Meeting and Conference planning team) was extremely positive, helpful and patient with all of my questions, being the newest member of the team in late 2012. They cared about me as a person and as a coworker and wanted to see me succeed. They helped develop my skills and taught me so many new things during my time there, which is very valuable as I move forward in the next stage of my career."
good,Penn Mutual is a wonderful environment for the employee. The offer an excellent work life balance. They do look externally for many of the higher level positions. This leads to inconsistency in the management and direction of various functions.
good,"Penn mutual has a great work life balance and the pay is fair if you're willing to go the extra mile,  however there is a lack of effective management and career advancements."
good,"Excellent company to work for. Many opportunities for advancement, along with training seminars. I learned a lot about being in a corporate environment. Work incentives and fun activities to join. Large mix of cultures. Most of the management was good to work with. Had a nice gym and personal trainer. Also had a life skills coach for your moral. Unfortunately some should not have been put into management positions."
good,Excellent company although numerous marketing personnel changes and territory adjustments made representation difficult.
good,Worked in the top regional office with 11 other employees.  We all got along and had fun while working hard to get the job done.  I was able to work remote during the week and the office staff took turns on which days we would be out.  Our direct manager created a team atmosphere which was a great work environment.
good,Very good place to work. however recently company seems to be headed into a new direction and has been releasing associates with 10+ years in favor of younger workers.
good,"Great place to work.  Be prepared for high pressure management, though.  They have great options such as paid fellowships to help college graduates and persons new to the field."
good,I was laid off due to company re-structuring back in September 2013.  That is the only reason why I left the company.  While there I really enjoyed how upper management interacted with their employees and showed they cared.  It was a great work environment that is hard to find anymore.
good,"I worked here for over 21 years, the best part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"I first started crediting discount rates to two different annuity plans and projecting UL profits. My manager was a great one because he always took the time I needed to develop an understanding of where we were going, and how we were going to get there. My co-workers there were also great both indoors and after work. Any questions you had you could get an answer to by asking one person or the next. If no one knew the answer, the internet was a great tool. As I moved along in the company, I passed my exams successfully, and I was assigned the actuarial department. By that I mean I had to make sure that everyone in the program got fair raises, and they were assessed competently. I also had to say who got hired for a position with other peoples' input. My staff increased to four professionals who were truely a good team to work with. My favorite projects fall in the categories of Statutory, GAAP, and Tax reserves. I was assigned the GAAP factor system and to update the factors. However, I searched through the company and there was no document anywhere that mentioned the GAAP factors and how they were created. I called around and settled on PolySystems. PolySystems prepared a sample of what our inforce should look like along with a projection of the expected gross profits for UL. The Senier Executives and actuaries saw it and we were pleasantly surprised! That sold us on PolySystems GAAP for a year. The Following year, PolySystems came back in and showed what our Statutory and Tax reserves could be compared to using a net single premium each year. That sold us on PolySystems for"
good,"It was a great experience for me to work for Penn Mutual. I was given the opportunity to learn new areas of work and was trusted to go hands on with that type of work. Aside from some favoritism that was ever present, the company itself has upstanding values and vast opportunity to learn and advance within the different fields in the company."
good,"Penn Mutual delivers a strong culture allowing individuals to contribute and succeed ensuring the company goals are met, advisers are positioned to succeed and clients get the most competitive product and experience."
good,"Great place to work.  The firm does not want to be #1 in its industry, so the stress that competition brings is not present.  Management is caring and understanding.  Relaxed work environment, casual dressing.  You will learn a lot about the insurance and broker-dealer industry.  "
good,"A typical day at work would involve reviewing products, reaching out to clients and prospective clients. The hardest part of the job was not knowing if the office would remain open and it did not. The best part of the job was meeting with clients."
good,"Wonderful employees at Penn Mutual make for a fun, relaxed and friendly work environment all while striving for excellence. Management is supportive of employees, their work life balance and strive to create a work atmosphere that is enjoyable."

On a daily basis, I meet with clients, collect and review paperwork, manage a database, and negotiate with banks to seek resolutions for clients' mortgages. I also assist in short sales and some real estate transactions."

good,I enjoyed working at Penn Mutual due to their forward thinking nature as a company and unlimited options on their investment product platform.  I was able to serve my clients at the highest ability and found their marketing and compliance departments to be very forward thinking.
good,"This is a great place to work.  It's not easy working in sales but this is definitely the place to go.  I was a teacher for 10 years then switched to finance and I'm lucky to have landed with such a great company with great people.  Sales suck but they make it better.  I've learned so much about money from them it's crazy and I'm going to apply that knowledge to my everyday life, even if sales doesn't work out for me."
good,"Penn Mutual was a great place to start my civilian career.  It was a great learning experience."
