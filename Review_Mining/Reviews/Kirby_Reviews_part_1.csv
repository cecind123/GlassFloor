bad,"Vous devez vendre des aspirateur à 4000 euro"
bad,I can go on and on about my experience working with kirby. My advice to make a long story short is to stay completely away from them. I was there almost 5 months and my experience there was horrible
bad,"I sold 47 $2400 vacuums in under 50 days an only made $1000 for 3 months, shifts start at 9am till 10pm 7 days a week, they didn't pay me on time or the right commissions"
bad,"nobody ever told me how to do anything the right way, very dissapointing. i will travel and do nothing all day in occasions, then send my to a difficult sale zone without any help."
bad,"Ambiente sicuramente giovane ma telefoniste pagate 3€ a ora senza un minimo di rispetto, per non parlare dei consulenti a cui vengono date sempre meno provvigioni"
bad,"Ti chiamano per posizioni di magazziniere,call center, inserimento dati, segreteria e poi é il solito lavoro porta a porta, dove cerchi di dimostrare le mirabolanti capacitá di un catorcio di aspirapolvere, dopo che ti hanno cercato di abbindolare per 3 giorni (ovviamente non retribuiti) parlandoti di vendere un prodotto innovativo, sensazionale, senza mai spiegarti cosa sará, ovviamente di soldi non se ne parla, in piu devi fornire almeno 5 nominativi per andare ad abbindolare  poveri ignari con questo aspirapolvere, quando poi arrivi sul campo il modus operandi é il seguente: dimostrazione in casa con ampia sviolinata di cavolate galattiche, qualche volta il cliente sprovveduto sará anche interessato, saputo il prezzo pero (3000 euro) si irrigidisce, allora scatta la tattica gold studiata dal manager de borgata, fantomima telefonica in cui il prezzo scende prima a 2000 poi a 1000, nel 90% dei casi finira con una mancata vendita, tu in compenso ci rimetterai soldi e tempo,ma oh ""il guadagno é sicuro, il manager faceva gli impicci a roma, non aveva bisogno di entrare in kirby, fai 2+2"" "
bad,you start the day off with a meeting with your co works then you would grab a few kirbys and you will go out a drive around and wait for leads and sometimes you will demo and nobody would buy them or they would just kick you out some of the workers would smoke drugs on the job
bad,"I was a top seller, sold 30 vacuums im a month. It ended up a pyramid scheme. But i was a door to door sales man and had to promote hospitality. Ended up working there 8 months before i found other job."
bad,I responded to an advert for admin type work only to be given the bait and switch to sell Kirby's door to door. Was an overall bad experience. Was embarrassed to be in people's homes. The one experienced guy did't even know how to fill the shampoo rug cleaner properly and used too much soap on the couple's carpet. I quit after three days.
bad,"They bring people in for a “customer service representive” job and lie about wages hours and the ability to advance people further. Some franchises won’t pay you if you don’t sell anything even after working 60+ hours that week. They’ll lie about days you work, hours you do, wages you’ll make and Kirby has a terrible rep for pushy and aggressive salespeople which I was trained to be but promptly quit. They rely on your lack of knowledge to profit off of and try to win you over with the idea of 1000+ dollars every week while not providing good training to get you there."
bad,I worked there and out of the whole money of waisting my time gas and turning down jobs they wound up never paying me for the day's I did work so yeah.
bad,This company will work you 80 plus hours a week with no compensation if you don't sell their vacuums. All they do is sell you a dream that your never truly given the chance to make true.
bad,"This company should be closed. The Kirby Vacuum itself is a great product that I would personally buy after selling them. But you have to go door to door in an attempt to sell a $3,000.00 vacuum to a person living in a trailer. If the person pays in installments you will never see your commision. Worked for two months, sold two vacuum's on installments, and never saw a dollar from Kirby."
bad,"Interview process is not transparent.  Tell you your basic is 1200 pcm but you will double this on commision."
bad,The people I worked with where awesome but I wasn't fond of the job. We had to sell $4000 vacuumes to people with no money. We had do whole demonstrattions. Shampoo whole carpets for the heck of it if the customer didn't buy.and we would work from 10 am till sometimes 12 at night. Super stressful
bad,"Una mala formación impartida a toda prisa, sin ayuda a progresar y demasiada presión negativa."
bad,Working for kirby was tough because you had to go to other people's homes and convince them to do a cleaning and then convince them to purchase the vacuum. Not a lot of people trusted me with coming into their home and overall it felt super sketchy and not enough compensation at all. Maybe about $100 per week
bad,"Never got paid, super shady work. All in all I could go on all day but to be honest I am prettysure I was just at an illigitimate outlet. Either way stay away from a place called Superior Systems in Colorado."
bad,Unless you are a great salesman(woman) don't work here. My boss was a jerk who didn't care about his employees well being.  Working in hr he made me fire people for him
bad,"I have been in sales for almost my entire career, which adds up to roughly 9 years or so in sales. This company is deceiving everyone from the employees to the customers. The job posting was not only misleading, it was an absolute LIE!!! I am okay with working off of 100% commission, I do currently and am doing great, making a killing with a different company. The lie to the customers about “a free carpet cleaning”, just to get in the door ( yes it is residential door to door sales, which sucks) then they force you to close a sale with the most high pressure sales tactics I have ever encountered, which again is coming from someone who still loves sales and has made a career out of it. I just totally disagree with everything they teach you to do in training, it is just morally wrong on so many levels. This was by far the absolute worst place I have ever worked in my life. AVOID THIS COMPANY!!!"
bad,"very horrible work experience. Owner is very rude and uncaring, does not care about the staff at all. The staff are very rude and it is a uncooperative work environment"
bad,He said since I was a woman I should know the most about what they sold. I had to go door to door to try and sell things and sometimes the people were violent.
bad,"I hated working for Kirby. I found a lot of my co-workers very unprofessional. Including myself back then. Showing up to work under the influence of alcohol and/or other substances. Only caring about making a sale. Long hours. Knocking doors all day. Even though I made great pay there, I wouldn't go back there."
bad,"I was only paid 200.00 every 2 weeks, poor management, I really don't have nothing good to say about Kirby. The managers were physically fighting all the time, it was just a bad work experience."
bad,I didn't like the fact that we were encouraged to be dishonest about the product we sold.  We were told that upon training we would get guaranteed pay. the manager did not honor that.
bad,i hated my life working for them. we would work really long hours and not get  paid. the only way that we got paid is if something sold and then it still didn't matter cause if it wasn't profitable then we didn't get paid. I lost so much stuff because of this company
bad,I worked there for a few months and didn't make a dime even though I made my quota on pitches. Also you have to sale base on their guidelines and not do your own thing
bad,"I'm sorry please read resume"
bad,"I did not like the job because it was based on commission, although you did get at least about $300 a week if you went to so many houses.  The hours were not great.  Started at 10am and we didn't stop till about 9pm.  Then had to drive home from where ever we were at."
bad,"I would never work  for this company again,  this was worst experience. I would never tell anyone to go work  for kirby. Some of people i meet while working for kirby was nice"
bad,they lie to you have you calling peoples home lie to them about a free carpet cleaning when that's not what they getting all you doing is cleaning one small spot in there home
bad,"Extreme hours, the ads lied about the payment structure, and there are multiple aspects deciding whether you get paid or not, you can work your butt off and sell 5 decent dollar vaccums and get paid 150 dollars"
bad,Worse place I've ever worked. It was a joke and they never paid you on time sometimes they wouldn't even pay you. You also had to go knock on random doors.
bad,"As I'm sure most people know, Kirby is a cutthroat business with cutthroat employees. They have very little regard for their clients and they're extremely competitive with one another, in such a manner that it creates a hostile work environment. "
bad,"It was a great job, but it is more in the field of door to door. "
bad,"Never will i work here again. Management was awful, I was the only person in the building and constantly felt like management were asking me to do things I wasn't being paid for"
bad,if you have no knowledge of credit and understand how to read credit scores this is not the job for you. basic math and being to keep up with sales this is not the job for you at all. Management is very very poor with this company. Not professional at all. may end up working in all kind of weather seven days a week and sometimes more then 12 hours a day and barley make any money. You have to sale sale sale!!!
bad,This is a terrible pla e to work if you are looking for staedy pay and no drama..... It takes too long to make sales the managers don't do as much work as you do in fact they get paid before.you do even though your the one doing the work
bad,"They told us that we werent gonna be door knocking , and they lied cause we did that everyday rain, sleep, snow...i was told i was gonna be making 800 dollars weekly and i never got paid"
bad,Not successful. If you don't have work experience in job I don't recommend it to nobody. I worked for Kirby for four years and it wasn't a excellent work environment
bad,My time with this company was short lived. I was paid compensation which is fine when im selling thousands of dollars a week. But when im getting shorted on my checks when i put 12 hours a day in walking around im not going to be happy so needless to say i left
bad,Promised $500 after 14 demos. Said Demos would be easy to get but it took 2 months to just get 10. Never sought after licenses for workers to sell products. Ran from police because of not having any licenses. Management was rude and vulgar to both customers and workers. Worked 15 hour days with no pay and traveled in a broken down minivan across three states
bad,"Long 11 hour days  9:30- 8:30pm,"
bad,"Bad place to work for "
bad,the typical day at work started off very unorganized and the management was also a big part it was unorganized. most of the managers didnt show up to work
bad,did almost all of the work aside from sales in the office along with being treated like a maid for a boys club for a year and a half as well as cleaning up other rental properties in the building for a measly 7.25$ an hour
bad,"I would not suggest working for Kirby, unless you never want to have free time. You work 12-15 hour days, you drive around in a van with a group of people you don't know, and you have to go into strangers houses. They say you'll get $530 a week, but you won't. It's strictly commission based, and unless you're working for one of the really good Kirby companies, you're not going to make anything. It's extremely exhausting and not good for parents or people that want any kind of social life."
bad,Very deceptive sales managers. They taught us to lie. Very unfair in promotions. They were crooks. they lied in every word.
bad,You work long hours six days a week may or may not make a sale. Owner makes all the profit and u get scraps. Very demanding hours
bad,"The business is currpted. They nevered payed like they should, and they always had me do illegal stuff in a customers house."
bad,"The independent distributors, B and B Marketing of Jonesboro, AR, in particular, are very scandalous, dishonest, and unethical. The cheat dealers out of large sums of money by lying to them about the product order being cancelled and such. They lie to the customer and mark the product up to a ridiculous amount, and defraud the elderly. Terrible!!!"
bad,"I was a sales representative who worked closely with people, even entering their homes at time. This job was a very good way to develop people skills as well as my experience with customer service."
bad,If you like to work long hours and not get paid then this is the job for you . The only person making money is the owner . It's a pyramid scheme !!! Don't believe their lies & false promises !!
bad,I would never work there again! I worked over 80 hours a week! Getting paid from the dealer was too difficult just grueling labor
bad,"This was by far the WORST job I ever had the misfortune to work for. very long hours, for literally NO pay. then when you do make a sale, they still try to jip you out of what they owe you."
bad,"They told me it was a customer service job helping customers that were having problems with merchandise bought from thier contacted companies making it sound like a call center setting at the interview.  After being hired we were told we would be selling Kirby vacuum cleaners. The trainer told us that no matter what we would make $2000.00 a month. Went through 3 days of training for free not to mention the 8 hours spent on demos to friends and family. "
bad,"terrible company to work for"
bad,this job is a very odd experience for sure. i go knocking on doors to sell a product each day. sometimes i make my own appointments by canvasing
bad,worked 16 hours a day with 4 hours sleep management was bad co workers were friendly and hardest part of the job everything.
bad,"Worked a good schedule, made appointments, sales, and janitorial duties. I did not receive the amount they agreed to pay."
bad,"My day would start with arriving at the Kirby place early in the morning. We would get assigned to a group and ride out to distant counties going door to door trying to sell a vacuum cleaner. We did this until it got dark out and then we would ride back to Charlotte. We would arrive home very late and only had enough time to sleep, eat, and do it all over again."
bad,Was not what they said it would be. Horrible pay and no training.
bad,"Knocking on random doors was a drag,  People did not want to let you in their homes, the moment they heard Kirby they would blow you off or slam the door in your face.  This company needs to find a better way to sell the product because this is a waste of time for good sales people.  Door to door is so old fashion in this day and time. Just does not work."
bad,the owners of the office I worked at are no longer in business.
bad,"A typical day at work: You start work at 8am, you go in for a morning meeting, and then you are off to random houses. While at these houses, you will work very hard. You will scrub, vacuum, and try your best at remembering how the vacuum works. You will receive no breaks, (even if you work for 16hrs like I did.) You are never promised a check at the end of the week/month. You must sell three vacuums in order to receive any type of compensation...The vacuums run past $1,000 in price....Selling three is much harder than it sounds. If you sell one or two, you will not be getting any compensation. You must sell three or more. If you work 80hrs a week, and you do not sell any vacuums....Or maybe one to two a week, you will be working for free...You will not receive any form of compensation. Honestly, if you have no other form of income, please do not do this job...You will most likely be working for free. It is a very tough job with no benefits, no promise of compensation, and you will barely have any free time. I strongly advise against this. "
bad,wasnt the place for me not the type to sale things every day and cold calling was the only good thing
bad,show up at the office get in with a group of people and go door to door selling vacuums
bad,Drug using staff.  Demand 24 hours of sales every day of the week.  Management continuously lies to employees.  There is an opportunity to make a good amount of money selling their vacuums but it's not worth it here.
bad,"try selling $3000 dollar vacuum to a person living in a double wide, nuff said"
bad,"Kirby is by far the best vacuum cleaner in the world, but good luck trying to sell them door to door. Purely compensation pay."
bad,No way to make any money. Just a bad place to work. Lots of lies and empty promises.
bad,WOrk all day and all night 6 days a week to sell vacuums door to door. Don't expect to make the money they promise you. NOT RECOMMENDED
bad,"This is the worst company that I have ever worked for. I worked there for a week, in which I worked 66 hours. They don't compensate you for any of your time."
bad,"The worst place for someone that needs money asap. I ended up quiting because of false advertising. all you do is try to get into a house and demonstrate a kirby vacuum. you also weren't guarenteed a paycheck at the end of the week. you either got 15 shows just to make 400 dollars, without selling any may I add, or you got the 400 plus commission of 2% of the sale you made. False advertising on craigslist and no paycheck if you don't know how to so the work."
bad,Knocked door to door selling vaccums. worked really long hours. went to meetings everyday.
bad,each day we would start our day off with a meeting we would sing dance to try to keep our spirit up hoping we would make some sales each day if we didnt make ah sale yu didnt get paid not really a job yu want to keep
bad,Come in Late morning about 9-10 a.m. get ready to head out sometimes over 2 hours away in a company van then spend about 12 hours going door to door knocking trying to talk people into letting you come in to show them a vacuum cleaner. Terrible job would not suggest to anyone.
bad,constintally sexually harassed. unreasonably long hours. terrible staff. unexplainiable money taken out of salary.
bad,"12 hours a day. 6 days a week. the company boasts a positive attitude, but this is the worst Ive ever experienced. unprofessional and negative staff members. pretty much anyone who receives an interview will get hired. Management is so hungry for sales that they rarely offer encouragement if an employee is having a bad experience. bad weeks with no sales happen. because this is a commission based paycheck, there is the possibility to work 60+ hours a week and receive no pay. you ride in a van (or whatever vehicle the team lead has) for 12 hours a day with 3-4 other co-workers. positivity is encouraged and if you seem too negative for the team lead's liking, they will kick you out of the vehicle at the nearest gas station and make you get your own way home (regardless if you are 2 hours away from home.) management supports and encourages team leads to use this technique at their own discretion. your position is NEVER secure, and you are reminded everyday that you can be replaced with someone else quickly, and easily. the amount of hours put in to the company per week is not worth the paycheck, and never seeing your family and loved ones."
bad,"I worked for Kirby as my first job and I must say that theie business practices are awful. They train their employees to barge into homes and push people into making an expensive purchase. They are commission-based, so if you can't get anyone to buy then you make no money. I left after they made me stay in an 87 year old woman's home until 10:30 pm and made me push her into buying so I could leave."
bad,"typical day at work was talking about the job, who sold what, who did what"
bad,"Did not like the job at all. Ya i gained some experience in sales. but the long 12 hr days walking around and bugging people in their homes just to show off a vacuum and get them to buy it. Not my kind of work, its not an honest job and they do not take care of their employees. 2 of my friends that worked there the same time i did both sold a vacuum and did not get payed for it. and being dropped off in the middle of no where with one other person is not proper. will never work for them again. poor management"
bad,Bad job.
bad,we worked for 16 hours a day. They expected you to work in different states in one day
bad,"Was not always guaranteed you were going to make a sale and make money for working 12 hours a day. Your life revolved around working at Kirby while you were out working most of the day you didn't have enough time to sleep or even have time to yourself. Kirby wasn't for me ,introducing people to an vacuum in their house."
bad,"The owner has no respect for employee's or personal life beyond the companies benefit.  (Deceased family members was not a valid reason to miss work even.)  The employee's are taught to ""get the sale"" and this means by any means necessary whether it be lying or failing to provide information."
bad,"long and boring , learned different ways on how the Kirby works, co-workers were OK , hardest part was finding a house to show , not that organized and professional , enjoyable part was meeting different people."
bad,"january of 2014 davenport iowa"
bad,"When i started working there they told me that we would get paid the third week working there, and that after the weekend they would provide transpertation for us to the anderson location and then to greenville, one of the mornings i waited like they told me to at my home at 7 am. I waited until 8 and no one showed i called and they told me I no longer had a job. The next morning they called asking why we never came in and i explained that I was told by the store manager I was fired and she told me that I was not. After everything she informed me that i would not get paid for a month and a half and that i did not get paid for the first month working. The manager informed me only the women get paid."
bad,Kirby was a completely commissioned base job so very stressful. Due to the fact that there is no hourly pay you  work long hours sometimes with no compensation after a 12 hour day if you have no sales .
bad,Kirby provides you with the opportunity to enhance your people skills and retail skills because it forces you to keep trying even when the customer has said no more than once to your offer.
bad,I hated the distributor I worked for. Not all of them are as bad as him. He pulled a lot of sneaky and manipulative stuff & charged dealers for lost or stolen equipment.
bad,"If you are looking for a job that gives you stability this is not the job. All I did was work , work , work. However if you are into Sales Jobs this might be the best place to start."
bad,No paid training. No class from management. Your boss smoking weed in the company car then hits on you. Will call you out your name... Run away from them
bad,"I  applied for a  customer service job,  and was told I'd be working with computers and answering phones,  got to orientation and was told that I would be selling door to door,  even  the instructor seemed shady,application  was misleading.  I  stayed through orientation but never went back,  the entire company gave me a weird feeling."
bad,"The team environment is uplifting."
bad,"typial day at work, i will be assigned one partner and go door to door trying my best to sell kirbys. hardest part of the job was try to persuade the buyer to buy the Three-Thousand Dollar Kirby."
bad,Mainly a sales company where my duties consisted door to door sales. management never worked with associates to help in advancing in company.
bad,"Forewarned is forearmed...I have only been a Kirby rep three days and warning bells are shrieking.  I had two half days of training on the Kirby and how to sell it.  Then I was expected to go out on the van.  I had watched carefully in training, but never even turned one on and didn't know how to shampoo.  My demos would have been appointments...so I already had a foot in the door.  The last thing I'd do as a manager would be to send someone as uneducated about Kirby as me into appointments!!  The machine sells itself, I'd buy one; but I can't sell what I know very little about.  The least they could have done was let me demo then in office ONCE."
bad,"Door to door vacuum selling in this day and age? Bad idea. Coupled with the fact that the product is super expensive plus you only make money if you make sales makes working at Kirby a bad choice. Not many people are going to shovel out nearly $1000 for a vacuum.Don't get me wrong, it is a good vacuum, but very overpriced. Some people just let you in their home to get a free demo of the product (translation: you get to vacuum a part of their home and walk away with nothing) "
bad,"Didnt like it because say if you get done with one job early,you will have to wait for however long to get picked up and possibly be late to your next"
bad,Too many hours door to door most people dont want you in their home so it always tends to make you feel like you cant do much more to help the situation. if you cant get in a house to sell the product you dont make any money
bad,"long hours, long weeks (6 day), no guaranteed pay, have to fight for the money you have earned, poor work conditions."
bad,"It was fun to work with the group of people i worked with, they were all full of excitement and we worked well with each other. i learned how to sell and use a Kirby vacuum. the management was horible i didn't get payed the guy who owned/managed that Kirby store got an embezzlement charge. the hardest part of the job was vacuuming and shampooing 100 rooms of carpet or hardwood floor a day. the most enjoyable part of the job was talking with customers and potential customers"
bad,Kirby is a fun place to work everyone is supportive. i would still be working here if it was not commission.
bad,"People were mean, rude sexist. Our area was great, but the guys were awful, and sometimes allowed to just push boundaries and act like jerks. They were rarely reprimanded."
bad,"I couldn't do it anymore. I felt that I was taking advantage of the customer. The money was fast and easy if you had the silver tongue for it. it just didn't feel right selling a somewhat decent vacuum for $2,000."
bad,I got into this field thinking that it would be easy money. The boss seemed to be too enthusiastic and really it just wasnt the right field for me. The benifits were ok but really didnt like the job
bad,"well dealers are to be at the office for 8:45am"
bad,"I would absolutely not work for them again. They do not pay as they say they will. Open promises, constant arguing, the driver was a heroin addict and on sever occasions almost crashed the van on the way home. There was not a single day that we opened on time. Most of the staff waited outside for the owner and CEO to arrive. The longest we waited was about 2 hours then we were told to go home because we weren't working. I was there for a month and never paid. An employee and on of the crew leaders constantly were trying to get physical in anger."
bad,"I guarantee that 99% of positive reviews are fake. "
bad,Trying to get into job was easy making a buck not so much. No sale no pay and I got left in a neighboring town so I will not be going back.
bad,"This company was very difficult to manage a work-home balance. Due to the compensation being strictly commission, it was extremely stressful if sales were not made.  On top of sales, persons were expected to generate their own leads, as well as their own appointments by knocking door to door or completing cold calls. Working in management in this company was even more stressful, due to the fact that pay was now based on the sales of the people underneath you in the company."
bad,great product. but this is a unsubstantial career. I did not like working there. I dont know what else to say. It was a great experience and I learned alot.
bad,"the days were very long and sometimes even going in was a struggle because of the fact you might work your hardest and not make anything for the week. the management was okay, wouldn't recommend it however to anyone only because of the pay."
bad,Office had a fun and positive environment. Management promoted positve characteristics. Absolutely no to little compensation to any employees besides management. We're very helpful during door to door sales. Worked long hours.
bad,Worst job ever promises made with unrealistic targets. Had to try sell to family and friends. Never got paid basic salary as promised as I could not make a sale first 2 months.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of me persuading people to allow me to enter their private homes and demonstrate our vacuum product. The job was very interesting because I was a door to door salesman, and it taught me skills of persuasion that only hands on experience can provide. However, just as any salesman, the job was commission based and I was searching for something much more stable and consistent."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for Kirby vacuum company. because they put a lot on you to sell their high priced vacuums. You have to basically lie to customers to convince them to purchase the vacuum. Working for Kirby was a big mistake.
bad,"Pushed back my pay day for a whole month, I was not payed for my sales even though i was promised commission and was told at interview i would be getting payed commission. Some co-workers said they've been there for two months and had only been payed $200 for the whole two months."
bad,"Manager and co workers never explained the pay rate after a weeks work including training, benefits were not offered, and co workers did not get along with each other."
bad,"Went into private homes to demonstrate and attempt to sell Kirby vacuums. I learned everything about Kirby vacuums. I had to drive a lot, which I did not particularly enjoy."
bad,"The job of a Kirby sales rep is fairly straightforward: Knock on a lot of doors, try to set up demonstrations of the product and follow through with demos and sales."
bad,It's a huge scam they promise you a guarantee of $800 bi-weekly and you never see the base pay. You have to sale to make money and you only make money off people who has A1( awesome credit). Kirby is a huge joke and scam.
bad,"Uma empresa onde não cumprem com o que é falado, acordado no inicio."
bad,"Worked for Graham for a while, 80 hours a week at times. Finally became a strong closer after 3 months of training and they decided to not pay me my earnings. To date I am still owed $4,000+ in EARNINGS that I never received. I loved the customer interaction and earning potential at this company except I NEVER RECEIVED IT! Stay away at all costs. Very time consuming for little reward. Handwritten checks so no record of pay which means no way to prove in court you weren’t compensated."
bad,"I Did the same thing everyday"
bad,"Worked Door to door advertising, demonstrating product and making sales"
bad,"The pay is very low. I sold very expensive vacuums, and only received 100 dollars. The office was small and I had to keep spending money to take the bus. My supervisor was always criticizing my religion saying stuff like, Yeah, people who follow this religion are selfish and stingy and the like. That was a typical day over there. I learned that sales is a hard work, and that commissions suck even worse."
bad,This job was terrible. period. Nothing good about it. You lose your hope for humanity.
bad,I liked the job w went door to door selling vaccums and it was fun but the pay was bad and economy sucked for 3000$ vaccums.
bad,"If you are young and ambitious and is one of your first or second jobs this may be right for you to acquire experience with communication skills public speaking and product presentation, pay is inconsistent and based solely on the amount of work you put in and whether the people actually have money to pay you I would recommend do this job while you were living with your parents "
bad,This job involved a lot of sales which wasn't what I was really looking for. Although the environment wass relaxed the job itself was very stressful and not at all rewarding
bad,Management not moving forward.  Employees not being replaced as people retire and/or leave...causing more stress on employees left.  Healthcare and other amentities going up.  Wage freezes.  No raises.
bad,"get to office, get in van, go to unknown destination , work until who knows when then go home. i learned how to sell $3000 vacuums, co workers were great and pay sucked"
bad,"It was a great working environment, but one did not have a life outside of work. all in all it was fun but not really what I was looking for."
bad,"I would be there at nine in the morning, sing a positive Kirby song, and travel around Utah until around ten or eleven at night. "
bad,I liked the job itself but I never understood the job culture and why everyone was always so tense.  I was hesitant when offered the position but I liked what I was doing and I just concentrated on that.
bad,I worked there for several weeks and only saw one paycheck in that time I was there. We worked long hours each day and its just not worth it.
bad,"A typical day would consist of going door to door convincing customers to give us the opportunity to show how the vacuum worked and how having it would benefit purchasing a Kirby vacuum. I also learned that everyone likes to have their carpet or mattress cleaned. Co-workers were very friendly and helpful and very easy to get along with; therefore, making the job enjoyable. The hardest part about the job was getting paid."
bad,"Sales door to door and over the phone with customers.Fun when dealing with clients that came in to purchase items for their Vacuum. Sales was the hardest. not everyone wants a 2,000.00 Vacuum But everyone in the company was great."
bad,Its a hard place to work if you want to make an income every week. The only good thing about that place is building your customer services/ sales skills other then that there no future in it.
bad,"while the you will learn tremendous value in terms of sales experience, you will have no life outside of the industry. your coworkers become your family and your family become strangers. not a great working environment, no background checks so you will work with people of all types of crazy backgrounds"
bad,"showing the product, its features, how its assembled, what the product does, how its good for carpet, how its the top of the line cleaner, etc. no paid gas, have to drive your own vehicle, drives can be anywhere for 10 mins to 2 hours."
bad,Still using old style marketing techniques. Typical day is starting around 5am driving to your targeted area. Clients may or may not have the income to support the sales. I drove an average 150 to 200 miles a day and spoke to over 100 customers. 16 hours a day to make a commission.
bad,the kirby vacuum and kirby company itself are amazing . but it is only designed for one person to be able to live freely while others suffer.
bad,attend morning meeting at 9am (last about an hour). Then pack all equipment in van and start driving to where ever city that we are working at. Walk around door to door setting up appointments to demonstrate our product. My co-workers were very outgoing and friendly. The hardest part of the job was trying to get appointments so that we could present our product. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people all day.
bad,Helped employees on sales calls. Enjoyed helping customers get what they wanted and helping them get the best finance options.
bad,Everyone is super friendly thier but the job is hard and xtreamly stressful
bad,"Working at Kirby had it's ups and downs. But at the end of my short 3 month work period with them, The bad out weighed the good and i couldn't take it anymore. Me along with many other people that worked there were told a good story to get us going an promised pay on regular bases. Ever other Tuesdays, but many of them came and went with not a single check in my hand at the end of my two weeks of work. Everyday while working there i had to be up by 6 am just to get ready and i had to be there early since work started at 9, which gave our managers the time to flaunt they're money and allow them to treat us like personal slaves, since we never got paid, my manger always spent her time drinking on the job and getting dead drunk before acting like a complete fool. while the other mangers spent most of they're day flirting with the young girls they worked with."
bad,Ambiente giovane ed energico che ti stimola con disciplina.
bad,the whole job was commission based so there was a very big pressure to get to a certain amount of doors every day and preform demos. The vacuum is very very expensive and not appealing to the average American. The lack of good management is also one reason why I did not enjoy my time at Kirby.
bad,was okay but not enough money and long hours when i was there it was cold winter and didnt feel like we had a good time working plus we didnt get paid unless we sell
bad,Bad dont like it..havent worked for them on a long time. Would not recommend to anyone who is loiking for consistant work. Thags it and that is sll...
bad,"My typical day would begin at 9 am, i would have to anwser calls book appoitmants and help customers with any problems. i have learned to be more confident whilst being on the phone."
bad,Get good walking shoes. You will be walking your whole shift. People will not always answer the door and some might slam the door in your face. Goodluck!
bad,Pay for your own fuel and insurance plus buy the product to sell to customers.  Promising customers on warranty that is not included and cheating on the payment plans made by management
bad,"Yes, this job is door to door sales.  It is as much as you would expect it to be. You go to residences, ring their doorbell, and try to sell an incredibly expensive vacuum. The hours are long because it takes quite some time to do all this. You can expect to put in over 15 hours a day. All your pay is commission. If you do not sell vacuums, you do not get paid. So it really boils down to how good of a salesperson you are because the product needs show casing and does not immediately sell itself."
bad,"This was a great place to work as far as pay goes but the managers never have time to you and they don't really let you know what you will be doing as far as your job until you get into the work environment. The Training was 3 days 8 hours a day, completely unpaid. I applied as a ""customer service representative"" and was told in the work environment what I'm actually doing is going door-to-door selling vacuums. Overall, a great product, a good job for some quick cash if you are single and have nothing better to do with 12-14 hours of your day, but management is awful and they will not be honest upfront."
bad,mattino entrata in ufficio e bisognava prendere appuntamenti per andare a casa delle persone per fare delle dimostrazioni del macchinario ed invogliarli ad acquistarlo e pur di lavorare dovevi prendere delle referenze da loro e tele davano per farti il favore di farti lavorare ma andavi da persone che non erano interessate
bad,"this was easy work , but you didn't get paid as much as the leaders because is like you get in the door but every vacuum you sell they get more percentage."
bad,"You go door to door selling vacuum cleaner, its not a good job if your not a good selling person. But my manager was a good teacher and he taught me how to talk to people better. It was a good learning experience but not a career job, I used it as a summer job. The hardest part was getting your foot in the door. The most enjoyable part was the money you get from selling a vacuum and also the funny people you work with."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of me persuading people to allow me to enter their private homes and demonstrate our vacuum product. The job was very interesting because I was a door to door salesman, and it taught me skills of persuasion that only hands on experience can provide. However, just as any salesman, the job was commission based and I was searching for something much more stable and consistent."
bad,"My mother was working here before I did, and she informed me of it because she knew that I am good at sales. It required no moving around and I had my own desk to make calls to potential Kirby customers. It was a fun job but ended after a major car accident in December 2006 and by the time that I healed, I was no longer needed by the company."
bad,We would get out on the field and do at least 3 demos a day and would return home about 10 at night. The hardest part about the job was the many hours that we had to put in.
bad,"Not ran well, kept too many things in the dark. Sold Vacccums in the home of prospective buyers."
bad,Hardest part is explaining to co-workers how to sell vacuums as fast as I do. Commission only.
bad,I was not able to really grow in this company or do anything else while working there.
bad,At Kirby Vacuums I did learn about sales and how to sell to a customer.  This job was commission based and there was no advancement opportunities.  I did enjoy the experience in learning more about selling.
bad,although I learned a lot here I would not recommend anyone work here unless they enjoy being under paid and calling OLD calling material that is burnt up!
bad,"A chance at earning some really good money. Dont count on having any free time. IF you work for kirby, kirby is your life. THings are always changing and you never get a answer they kinda run around a circle but never give a full for sure answer."
bad,"Is not fun to go door to door all day in very warm weather, and in a suit and tie. Good money but 18 hour days are not fun everyday. Makes you become social with people and makes you learn how to talk and sell product."
bad,"There is no hard part about the job, all I did was drive and communicate with other. Driving was OK just needed a newer van instead of the one I drove."
bad,"Kirby was a cold selling job, and the compensation and benefits were contingent upon selling performance. The people I worked with were great and management was good too. Overall an ok job, for true salesmen."
bad,would not recommend working in the environment provided. I would prefer to have had different management.
bad,a typical day at work consisted of me sitting in a room full of cubicles with a person at each desk competeting to get the most clients/customers to purchase a kirby.
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here if you are solely relying on that income. Dirty work place and hardly got any hours. On the plus side though it did teach me some skills in the office.
bad,"I worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. I walked door to door setting up my own appointments to sell Kirby's. There was no set time to go home, and it was all commission."
bad,"this was a door to door job based on commission.  All weather rain, sleet, heat. The commission scale is based on the customers credit if u sale to someone with bad credit u wont get paid"
bad,"Get up go to the office have a meeting than drive to customer house, show the product and try to sell it. lots of calls to boss to try to sell a kirby"
bad,This company was commission based and personally i did not like it. I woked a lot of hours A week and it was not worth the pay and although it was commission based.
bad,Following three weeks of training I was repairing and servicing vacuum cleaners for customers in line with their contracts. During this role I travelled to customers houses for maintenance of the equipment where we would also promote other products and identify opportunities for up-selling.
bad,"Unless you are relentless and able to do a hard close to influence people into buying whatever you are selling, then your long-term future in this business is dim."
bad,I didn't work here very long but I had some interesting experiences at this job and don't regret my time there. Your payment is largely performance based
bad,"Le poste obtenu chez Kirby Bien que très bien rémunéré et permettant d'utiliser de réelles techniques de ventes ainsi que des verrouillages de ventes très agressifs, cette société basée au USA soumets ses représentants commerciaux à un rythme très assidu de travail, dans mon cas, je me levais à 6:00 du matin tous les jours y compris le dimanche pour commencer ma journée à 7:00 au bureau puis travailler en clientèle (à domicile du client donc comprenant le trajet) jusqu'a parfois 1:00 du matin. Un jour de congé était ""autorisé"" mais si les objectifs n'étaient pas atteint a la fin du mois , la paie ne tombait pas du tout ! ( sur le mois il faut vendre au minimum 10 appareils à 4000€) de plus les rdvs fixés par le call center ne sont pas ""soignés"" pour certains rdv j'ai dû voyager jusqu'en Ardennes, bref traverser la belgique sans aucune aide financière."
bad,I enjoyed working for this company. We always got tickets to the games. They always showed appreciation to the employees. The job ended because of fundin
bad,"Like the business model, but personally was not one for giving a sales pitch. commission based, did not work for me, and thus found it difficult to balance my living budget and work to solely base my income off of Kirby. If I feel more confident in sales I may give a shot at Kirby again.."
bad,would go door to door selling Kirby vacuums. all your money was made off of commissions. the distributer I was working for was not a very good leader
bad,"A typical day at work is hopefully getting a few appointments. I learned a lot about people and how to put my skills in the business world to work. Management was very well done as far as I saw. Everything was organized and put together. The hardest part of the job was getting the appointments or dealing with customers who were total jerks. The most enjoyable part of the job was finally getting an appointment after dealing with some of the other horrible customers. My co-workers are great and they've helped me out to make sure I succeed and can stay a part of the team. If you wish to learn more about people and the business world, this is the perfect job."
bad,"I love the company and even the area, but being in college it was difficult to be a dedicated worker while working nights and trying to go to school."
bad,"ottimo per l'ambiente lavorativo, i colleghi, la conoscenza di molti tipi diversi di clientela"
bad,"i really didnt like working for this company, manager was on drugs all the time, co- workers where fun to be around, i was a driver who drove my co-workers around to sell kirby's"
bad,Rules of payments aren't clear cut. Managers who go out in the field take away from the dealers.
bad,It was a telemarketing position with secretarial work with it. I did like it at times. My co-worker was great. I did get a couple of bonuses.
bad,Management is as dishonest to the employee as the are to the customer. Hours are insane. Never once got home before 11pm
bad,Not too good of a company wouldn't want to work here any more need a new manager and pay methods for everyone. I highly require that you look for a different job
bad,Working at kirby I dealt with a lot of people. It helped me grow as a persons because working in a sales job forces you to be strong and not afraid to go out get what you want.
bad,I loved working at kirby though it was a years ago the people you see usually become regulars where you'll gave good conversation with some. Fast paced sometimes. Sometimes you may get left in the house with a creep and it may be your first day out of training.
bad,"The staff were very professional. Every question was answered to the best of their abilities. However, training took alot of effort. They may have needed to explain more clearly."
good,I was an assistant manager for the phone room. My boss had to respect for me or my employees.
good,"Co-workers were fun, job was fun, walking door to door was not the best, and salary was not dependable. Cold weather and rude people answering the door made it very challenging"
good,"Journée de travail typique: Réunion tous les 2 jours le matin, prendre des rdvs sur les heures de repas, avoir 10 rdvs pour la semaine"
good,"It was exhausting the amount of work that went into a demo, to potentially not get a sale at the end and then there were the customers that thought you were there just to clean their homes."
good,"i personally didnt like going door to door,  i knew i could suceed, but it was not what i wanted to be doing."
good,selling Kirby can be lots of fun and very profitable. there are good weeks and bad weeks. if you've gat money saved back and can ride it out and you have good sales experience you can make lots of money. you have to be able to make fast friends with complete strangers and get them to want to by a Kirby. by not only wanting it but needing it.
good,"I love Sales as I've been in sales my whole life. So working at Kirby was a nice and new as I had to do door to door Sales without any leads. However, I learned a lot and got good at Sales."
good,show up to work by 11 am get started with an upbeat morning meeting. help out with the orientation or training that being held within the 3-hour meeting. have an hour lunch before going out into the field. head to the field for about 6 hours. we will be dropped off on a street and will be expected to knock into a house within the first 20 minutes to perform a demo of the Kirby machine.
good,"Would never work for this place again and I recommend that nobody else does either. I actually sold these things too. The hours are terrible though, the commission on them is awful, and the room for advancement is a joke."
good,Great opportunity but its all commission and there is no work life balance.It's very misleading. They try to work u to death.
good,"I felt stuck at work,  same routine everyday with little pay my co-workers were easy going and helpful, overall i didn't enjoy it but i learned valuable skills like keeping my cool in all weather and conditions to be more of a people person considering the more people liked me the more product i would sell i enjoyed the oppratunity of a first job but needed a more advanced job"
good,"Good way to meet new people, but very un stable as far as work."
good,"Every day I would scan, file, answer 5 line phone calls, check workers in and out, and inventory."
good,".. didnt learn much ,"
good,"While working with kriby, your intorduced to drug addicts, alcoholics, rude people. Your working from 9am to past 9pm everyday and they wnated you to work 7 days aweek. For minimum wage, some days you would work all day and make 0$ because your going from door to door. Also, Without a break unless you say your tired and need a break. Don't get me wrong i was a great salesperson, but the pay didn't match the hard work your put in."
good,"I started working there at 17 years old. I worked everyday nonstop with barely any breaks. It was my first job, the hours were 8am-2am. Sometimes we would work past 2am. We didn't get any benefits with the job. We would travel all over North Carolina to Virginia."
good,"A typical work day was arriving at 8 am at the office, having a morning meeting, then drive out to a location to knock on doors all day. Its a sales job where you don't get paid unless you sell something. I usually didnt get home till after 11 pm."
good,My Kirby job was good to expirience for myself . I learned many thing from that job such as excellent communication skills .
good,"Start your first day with training. Introduced to the only product they retail. How to assemble and disassemble their product showcase for demo purposes. Training is a business week long. Training is NOT paid, only invest your time in this if you are going to stick with it hardcore. You will be paired with a manager and six other trainees like yourself packed in a minivan. No redundancy measures for hardware failures resulting in lost production time and prevents mission success."
good,Was constantly on the road going house to house not much time for a home life. But if you can make the sale there is very good money that can be made .
good,"Must be willing to work morning noon and night, in all types of weather. The best part of the job is meeting people in your own community and other zip codes."
good,"Working at Kirby Vaccuum was a great way to find my inner self find new ways to stay positive in different sitsuations, even when things didn't seem to be going as smoothly as planned. The co-workers that i worked with were very kind and out going, but that office did not seem to have very good management skills that i was looking for."
good,You work long days. If u get in a house your in there for about 3 hours. If they don't buy you just cleaned their house for free and worked your butt off for nothing.. And when the managers come in to talk to the homeowner they low ball the price to where you make no money off of it so it was still pointless.
good,Good environment but hours where to long not to be paid hourly
good,"The people were very nice and did not mind teaching us about the products, the other people I worked with were funny as well it was great ............"
good,"On the road 24/7 long hours, don't know which area you are in from month to month, great awards, travelled overseas on numerous occasions. Have to be mentally and physically fit"
good,Just commission no hourly pay and trips all over florida...No extra benefits your on your own.Trips all over florida to clean carpets and basically no pay to little.
good,"Positive energy,But Very time consuming. door to door sales with no breaks but great prizes for those who actually sell the kirby."
good,fun place to work in people are friendly everyday with a smile on there face i learned sales skills and how to talk to customers. the hardest part of the job was trying to sell a Kirby or convince a customer to look at one. the most enjoyable part was making your own hours everyday.
good,I didnt like working there and i wouldnt want anyone to work there
good,Going place to place doing sales pitches on the products capability.
good,I liked working here. The pay was great sometimes. The door to door sales were dangerous at times. There was a little adventure every day.
good,its sales success is up to you no base pay. to many hours always on the road great for single younger person with no kids pretty fun. advancement opportunity is available.
good,Learn to understand people. Weather it's to earn people's business or to develop new people working for the business. Train to be a professional salesman.
good,"I was very successful but needed more time for my kids, and I had to relocate. But, I made alot of money, went on alot of free trips Kirby provided and it was great until I started a family."
good,"Kirby was an awesome place to get my foot into the sales world. I was looking for some hard work that would pay off in the end. The management wasn't very bad but it wasn't good in terms of building their workers, if you are a determined, hard worker, then this is the job for you."
good,"Kirby Vacuums was an interesting and exciting work experience, but the fun of the job was quickly overshadowed by the fast paced and cut throat nature of the management team."
good,"Kirby had a positive working environment. I was able to learn a lot about different personalities, cultures. The hardest part of the job was working long hours, and working on the road for long periods of time. I would say that 80 percent of my time working for Kirby was on the road."
good,First thing was getting to the office in the morning then going off to work in different  neighborhoods. I had learned some keys in getting customers attention and sell the product. I got to meet different families in there homes and I would say that was the hardest part. You and your crew have to watch each others back. It was enjoyable. We get to travel too different cities in Oregon and sell the product so was fun.
good,O bom horário pós laboral. Fácil interacção com os colegas de trabalho e facilidade em aprendizagem
good,"start at 9 "
good,Kirby was an experience for me good and bad. This was not the job for me but my co-workers made the job enjoyable.
good,I know that this is a company that promises higher benefits as long as you are a single person with nothing but the job to do. This company is for someone that doesn't have to worry about the hours.
good,"Worked under some of the best distributors in the world. My father was a top performing distributor in the 1990's. The culture has shifted to one where drug dealers and addicts are glorified and good employees are forced to work with them. If you find yourself in one of those organizations run. If you are lucky enough to be in a proper organization where people receive their commissions instead of living off of draw checks, then I would recommend following the program and you will become a distributor."
good,"door to door sales canvassing upgrades old equipment supple customers with kirby products: bags, shampoo, belts,tune-ups on old equipment and customer acquisition."
good,was a good job at the beginning really enjoyed it but because it’s commissioned based it kind of caught up with me. Loved the people and the motivation was high
good,Selling vacuums door to door.  Great product but valued at a high price.  As long as they provided the right amount of commission the job was fair and fun.
good,A great job if you are young and single and aren't' trying to live on your own and be completely self sufficient until you get good!
good,"what i learn from my jobs are good skills to move up an to have better job opportunities . my co-workers can be cool but mean, only if you dont do what you are sap post to do.The hardest part at work can be when i have coffee rushing down and i have to make boxes to prepare them to be shift with 8 in each box.the most enjoyable part at work is when we all gather for lunch and try to make it a another fun day at work."
good,I both liked and disliked my job. I didnt like working for commission. But I did like meeting new people and interacting with people of all different backgrounds.
good,Meet new people everyday but Constant walking in hot weather
good,"- La mattina meeting di formazione e nel pomeriggio appuntamenti in case di privati per presentazione del prodotto.                                         "
good,A typical day at work consisted on trying to sell as many Kirby vacuums as possible. I learned to always be polite and respectful. If you want respect you have to give respect. The management at Kirby was great everybody was always so generous. My co-workers were also very polite and the also knew how to give out a great deal of respect. The hardest part of the job was probably walking around the neighborhoods. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting a smile on the people's faces.
good,"questo lavoro mi ha dato la possibilità di migliorare la mia disponibilità al dialogo,la mia gestualità,il mio autocontrollo e il rispetto verso le altre persone"
good,I learned a lot from this company and its employees. I learned how to be a sales person and a very good one if i do say so myself. I learned that its all about your attitude if your positive and you surround yourself in positivity anything is possible.
good,Door-to-door advertising. In home demonstrations. Time management.
good,I had fun working with the kirby family. But i was not apreaciated by some of the employees. Was accused of stealing. Because of that i left to my other job then was told i need to return what i stole after i told and showed them i did not steal from anyone.
good,"Great place to get experience, great first job. No salary so only commission but it Is worth it if you do the work most definitely. Would I recommend it?? Maybe"
good,The company is real family like. Unfortunately it is around 10 to 12 hour days and no hourly or overtime pay. the item you are selling is vacuums door to door. Most people are very rude to door to door salesmen
good,Bonus για την επίτευξη στόχων ομαδικών η ατομικών.
good,I had this job while I was looking for a personal training position.  I was living in the area to go to school so when school was done I left for another position
good,I really enjoy working at this place because I was surrounded by other peers in the job that had the same drive as me to get work done and to always set appointments.
good,"Please see resume attached and that I uploaded. This job has is listed on my resume, you can see the job description and length that I worked there if you have any questions."
good,No guardo buenos recuerdos por el trato recibido por parte de la empresa.
good,"Great Company, but you have to remember each office is individually owned so they are not all ran the same. Some distributors can be very greedy. If you are working for a good distributor you will have a great experience, if you are not working for a good distributor you won't have as great as an experience. My advice would to be ask around the office and see what kind of person you are working for."
good,Very long hours spent riding in a car all day. You can make very good money if you're good at selling. Very laid back and chances to win vacations and other prizes every few months
good,"Didn't give me many hours. Most hours were spent driving around. Didn't care for the manager. Long hours for the day. Never a designated time for the end of the day,"
good,if you're looking for a commission based job then this might be the one for you. It pays well and if you're ok with long days and being on your feet then the opportunity for good money is here.
good,the co workers where fun and learning and actually doing the job was fun but the compensation was a problem because if you did not sale you did not get paid and plus it was a house to house type of job.
good,They wanted me to work overtime a lot. Hard to work with my school hours. And when my son was born they wouldn't work with me on my hours. And cut my hours after my son was born
good,Just was not my type of work you go door to door trying to sell this vaccume its totally based on how many houses you show the vaccume to like in life customers are happy or mad but you still have to be in great spirit
good,"a typical day at work is very tiring but i learned as long as im smiling and moving fast i will get payed a lot , the management team is awsome and even my co-workers we all get along the hardest part of the job is happy hour and it is also the most enjoyable part because that means more money for me !"
good,good team to work with excellent customer care had a good time working with the team.would recommend anyonework there definately
good,"As in most sales organizations it can very stressful trying to make your quotas. Never a dull day out in the field interacting with customers, but in the office we are a strong team lively and full of energy. WE worked Hard but Played just as hard!"
good,it was a good job that gave the experience of a fast paced sales environment and helped further develop my people skills. however the difficulty in moving up the ranks makes it a job that one cant begin a career path within.
good,a typical day at work was coming in at 8 in the morning and having a meeting with co-workers and the manger to come up with a plan for the day. We would get finished and hit the road. The hardest part was the door to door.
good,"due to the high level of work needing to be done and the lack of help that the manager gets, you will not be given proper training and there fore never fully understand the job"
good,this job is only for the person who wants to sale sale sale . it can be a fun environment if you get into the gimmicks. the average day consists of about three demos and a very long sales meeting.
good,great place to learn sales. get good with people. fast way to make big money. hard job but good opportunity good for the younger person
good,Management was unprofessional and inefficient. My coworkers were unmotivated and lazy.
good,fun work environment but pay was based on commission. Very flexible work schedule and hard working managers and co-workers.
good,selling of vaccums and going to customers houses. The coworkers were great to work with.
good,Basically had to have good customer service. Sold company products to strangers.
good,A typical day at Kirby seemed frustrating in a sense of going door to door trying to get in various people home doing a presentation making a sale out of the product. I learned how to be even more patient with people and gained some sales experience. Management was cool because he was laid back joking with all his co-workers. All my co-worker was friendly helping if you needed it. The hardest part for me was making sales. What I enjoyed most was when I did make a sell it was fun and the events we attended.
good,La compañia de los niños siempre es agradable.....pero a veces se juntan 20 madres que cada una de ellas quiere la atencíon a su niño....y no tenemos ni 20 ojos ni 20 manos
good,i would go to peoples houses and try to sell them a kirby vacuum
good,"Kirby was a customer service/sales job. It was very productive, and fun learning experience. I was around many different people, some were nice and some were rude. It was my first time doing a sales job,  it was very easy for me to get appointments and get my coworkers appointments, the selling part was a little difficult. Sometimes i would make a sale and sometimes i wouldn't, i always left with my customers feeling happy about them having me in side their home and letting me demonstrate the kirby to them. What i enjoyed the most was being able to interact with different people, even if they were rude, it taught me to be very patient with others. The hardest part was making a sale, but at the end of the day my goal was to make my customer happy and maybe later in time they will consider purchasing a kirby."
good,fun but needed a steady pay and shift was under paid if i didnt have any sales
good,I personally am not a fan of door to door sales but it suites some people.
good,Working for Kirby helped me gain people skills and my marketing skills.
good,I enjoyed what I did for the company. It was a real laid back type of job.
good,A typical day would be going around town knocking on people's door to sell products. I learned how to talk to people and how to convince them to buy. 
good,Within my role at Kirby I was responsible for making sales calls to customers and gaining an appointment to go to their homes to give a demonstration on how the product worked; within the demonstration I was also responsible for closing a sale to ensure I hit my monthly and quarterly targets.
good,"The boss is amazing easy going, the employees well theres drama in that place for sure, sometimes hard, because the business is based on team work. hours are long, weather conditions don't apply its great if you don't have a spouse or children. As long as your selling the money is great. Set appts, show the machine, make em love it. you will fall inlove with the machine yourself i promise so it's easy to sell."
good,"i like the vacuum, i would even use it, but dislike the company because we work all day with one break"
good,Fun place to work. you get to befriend a lot of cool people but the fact that its commission based sucks
good,"This was a total sales job. I enjoyed it while it lasted. It was only a summer job during college. Kirby's are very wonderful pieces of equipment, but very expensive. It taught me that the world of sales is not all its cracked up to be. Cold calls are the worst. I know that sales isn't my forte."
good,"Kirby company was one of the best places i have ever work, this place gives me all the experience that i need to make cuistomers satisfied and happy with their purchasing products. also this work gives me the ability to socialize with customer and convince buyers on buying the products from the company. overall, Kirby company was a nice place to work"
good,"A typical day at work would be going door to door and telling people what we do and why we're doing it. I've learned that you can have fun at what you do. My co-workers were nice, appreciative, and fun to work with. The hardest part would be to get an invite into someones house. The most enjoyable part would be to make people smile or make them laugh."
good,"I was a senior sales person, who successfuly sold many products ( machines ) Than i trained a lot of new sales people as a leader of the new Team."
good,"My coworkers are fun energetic people, joksters in the office but professional in the field. We have to be there at 9:30 am and usually stop at 9:30 pm. We dont leave the first 3 hours is spent at the office and we actually start around 12/1 pm. Our boss is a funny guy that knows the businesses, he's kind and respectful but I didn't interact with him very much. Our team leader is a persistent funny guy that kept me upbeat on bad days. Food and drinks were provided for every worker and water lasted throughout the day. We were allowed to pick our own schedule as long as we reached our monthly quota of 60 demonstrations. If we made 15 sales for the month we could take the rest of the month off. Our boss offered weekly prizes to encourage us to sell, the prizes were flat screen tv's, sub woofers, ipads, ps4's, Xobx ones, all of witch we were allowed to trade in for cash. Prizes were win if we made 5 sells for the week. Again your experience will depend on your coworkers I made $160 my first day of ypur not happy stick around and do your demos for the month then quit. It's good no money and decent exercise."
good,The hours are long. The employee has the option to take an hourly salary or take commission pay. The commission pay is worth the work and the company shows you exactly what to do to be successful. The workplace is very competitive. The hardest part about the long hours is doing them day after day Monday through Saturday. If you have small children then this job may not be for you.
good,"outbound calls to set up appointments for free carpet cleaning in hopes to sell the machine, the co workers are nice and friendly the hard part was dealing with people yelling at you when you called and not giving you a chance to get the information out there."
good,Working at Kirby was a fun experience. I learned to be a salesmen and learned that the only way to make money in this company was to learn all about the product.
good,"I typically would arrive at the office, attend the morning meeting then disperse to our teams canvassing areas. Once we set an appointment to do a free carpet shampoo we would come back to the house and not only shampoo the carpet but demonstrate the ""Kirby"". The management was not the greatest but my co-workers were nice people. The hardest part would have been selling a $2500 vacuum and the most enjoyable part would have been filling out the paperwork for a sale."
good,Work hard going from town to town is not worth no paycheck. Was not treated fairly at all
good,"Working for kirby was a good way of earning experience in the distributing field. In my time spent there at Kirby I learned to work personally with consumers and get their oppinions based on our product. I had also learned very quickly that the business itself was an easy one to understand thus i was promoted to hiring manager within a few months. The people I worked with were always hard working, as a commissioning job the only way to make money was to sell a Kirby vacuum."
good,"This was a fun place to work when I started. The shifts became full days, and it was a lot of hard work. I'm thankful for the knowledge I gained through the experience. Although the 12 hour field working days became a little much for me."
good,Product promoting and schduling appointments. Selling products and relating with customers.
good,"Mi sono trovato molto bene, ti mettono a tuo agio un ambiente familiare"
good,Different job environment. Your an independant contractor so you made your own money.Door-knocking and performing cleaning skills to attract the buyer
good,Good job if you have proficient people skills and aren't afraid to put your self out on the front lines to get what you want. Each day you start out with a warm up we get each other pumped to go out in the field and bring home the bacon. There is high volume for advancements and promotions. I worked for 3 weeks and got promoted to receptionist where i would hire and help train the new recruits.
good,Liked it alot dealt with alot of people it was just being outdoors in the heat
good,"Exceeding sale goals each month. Crew lead supervising 6 to 12 people. Demonstrated product to prospective clients. Handled resolving problems if vacuums did not perform. Quoted prices, warranties and delivery dates"
good,I really did like it but got a better job it was good for the time being. I really was glad i landed it it was door to door Talkin to peolpe about product.
good,"La mia esperienza è stata positiva, poiché mi ha aiutata a migliorare molti aspetti della mia personalità come far parte di un team, capacità di risolvere problemi e persuasione, accumulando esperienza nella relazione interpersonale."
good,"A lot of money to be made if you're willing to put the time an effort in ,always room to make more money ,and if u sell , u could win a trip every 3-6 months"
good,"work is well but tha way of marketing is very strategical, i did a well performance in my job feild to accomplish my tasks and responsibilities with communicating my dear customers."
good,I got to meet a lot of good people and made many good friends. I would not recommend this job to anyone the hours you put in with upper ceos getting all the glory and fame was just not right. I’m thankful it went out of business
good,"Going door to door to present a product that could benefit the cleanliness of homes. I learned customer service, the value of sales, and I can create opportunities through effort and dedication. The management was pretty dead on either you come in daily to become successful or don""t come in at all. Co-workers were pretty friendly I felt no criticism or critiquing from anyone. The hardest part of the job was being able to sell the product and convincing customers why this product could help you and your family."
good,this job is awesome because you meet a lot of respectful awesome people everyday. this job will put a smile on your face for how fun it is.
good,"Every day we would get a binder full of numbers in surrounding areas and we would call each one to try to pursued them to set up meetings to get carpet cleaned at home. We had work incentives and certain goals we had to try and reach each day, week, and month. I loved that we could get big bonuses if the appointment we set up, actually purchased something from their company. I loved all my co-workers and got along great with everyone who worked there!"
good,"Convincing people that the $1500 Kirby Vacuum is worth having rather than your generic $300 vacuum cleaner! The product sold itself, the price made it a difficult sell but the experience - daily - was an great experience!"
good,I work pretty much every state west of the Mississippi. I typically have 3 appointments a day showcasing my equipment and cleaning one room of my clients home. This is a buy today business so communicating well with others is very important. Overcoming objections and closing a sale is the hardest part of the day (or not overcoming objections and closing a sale).
good,"I became a team leader in this job which involved training new members of the team. It was my responsibility to make sure they were doing the job correctly and sufficiently and also to the customers satisfactory. "
good,"great place to work ,your check can depend on lots of things and your drive is your biggest asset to getting paid,product is great and the work environment is awesome"
good,"Started at 10, door-to-door sales, learned many skills here and management as well, co-workers are fun depending on who you get, hardest part is handling rejection, most enjoyable is selling."
good,"The Management was great! What I appreciate the most about the management team is that, they actually took the time to help develop my skills. The hardest part of my job would have been over coming my fear of talking to customers and facing rejection."
good,You will spend about 12 hours of your day at this job. You will either be going from door to door or giving a presentation. It's a good job if you have no children.
good,I developed sales knowledge and experience with this company. I grew with this company and as supervisor I had the pleasure of working with a lot of great people.
good,"I enjoyed this job as it was a door to door sales job, meeting new people was fun."
good,Great learning environment will benefit from all the competiotion. Vreat enviorment to grow in. If your looking to learn beginner sales kirby is a good place to start. Helps with building character.
good,it was stressful because of the training but the managers are terrific its a good job its just what they do there the pay is good distance is not bad its a good job
good,Great place to work managers and excited about making the best out of the day. and helping you go home as happy as possible. the commission and extra perks are amazing. just could not continue door to door.
good,I learned to work independently and be self motivated by cleaning out vacuums and maintaining a clean working environment. I enjoyed working on my own pace and having a steady routine.
good,I loved this job but was a tough one. but most door to door sales jobs are. i loved meeting new people and talking to different people.
good,"Kirby was a great workplace for learning, taught me a lot of what i use today in sales. As for the work it was very demanding. 12+ hours a day on foot, cold leads and no salary/hourly pay. In the end it was an unforgettable experience I am very grateful for."
good,"I did alot of growing up in this company. I traveled alot with the crew . Gained alot of communication skills. I was shy before this job, so it was truly a life changing expierence. I only got paid via commision which is why I had to leave since there were times where I wouldnt get paid and I could risk not getting paid."
good,"High customer intereaction, good staff to work with and a lot of advancement opportunities. Employers are constantly helping employees learn and grow."
good,"It was really competitive being that we had to sell at the end of the day. although it was great pay when you sold a Kirby, it wasn't a job you could really count on if you did not sell anything because we only got paid through commission."
good,going do to door and maintaining and beginning demonstrations for sales the upright vacuum cleaner for various locations such as home warehouse and business settings.
good,"work days started at 7 a.m.  with a meeting at the office then we head out to go make sales and don't get back until sometimes 12, 1 a.m. I learned a lot about the sales business and what it takes to be successful. the management was good and helped a lot. the hardest part of the job was not making the sale after all the work put into trying to get it to happen. the best part of the job is making the sale and the feeling after."
good,Performed maintenance / repair of telemarketing department microsoft network with  30 users.  Also extensive customer service with new Kirby customers.
good,great working in a group or independent working hard everyday with great pay
good,it definitely taught sales procedures in a crash course type of way. perserverance and self motivated i definitely gained from this company.
good,"With the lead I received from the telemarketers, I would call the customer to reconfirm the appointment. At the appropriate time, I went to the customers home and demonstrated the product. I learned to communicate well with the public. My favorite part of the job was meeting new people."
good,normal 8 hr day job. nice people. easy work. not the same as it used to be
good,This company has much room for advancement and you are treated right. Would recommend to anyone.
good,Door to door sales. No stable income. Anagement was very nice and they offered professional training Hardest part was when the sales were slow.
good,"The job is awesome I like the work I do "
good,Kirby is a competitive work place everyone wants to be the best and sale the most after all whoever sales the most makes the most but we all are good friends even salesmen from other offices and we'll even share all of our tricks that we use but month in and month out we work very hard and long hours going door to door trying to be #1 4 times a year you have a chance to win a free vacation and more prizes every month over all this is a great opportunity and a great company the only thing you have to watch out for is a bad factory distributor because he will keep your commission
good,"Kirby Company is no place for someone who is shy of hardwork, but rewards those who learn its principals and how to do the business. In terms of the work all I have to say is ""You have to live a few years in a way that most won't, to live out the rest of your life in the way most never will"""
good,"WIth this company I was able to travel and meet new people everyday. The only down side was that it was straight commision, which made it very difficult in day to day life. However I learned may skill such as communication, time management, and the art of sales."
good,As soon as I would get to work we would have a short motivating meeting and then immediately start making calls.
good,this was a paid off commission job. i got to meet new people everyday trying to sell products & enjoyed the people i worked with. hardest part was getting someone to buy product but overall i did a great job!
good,"typically, a crew of 5/ 6 people would go out to a neighborhood and i would be dropped off on a street. main goal:to get as many appts. as possible. we would offer 1 free room of cleaning to take a look at the newest vacuum model. learned how to talk to people, get along with people and make friends. there are certain critia to reach in order to move up for advancemet. fairly simple to aquire. hardest part of the job, was the hours. just because we never had a set time for ending the day. most enjoyable part of the job was making a sale, considering i only got paid from sales"
good,"Its fun working for Kirby, very challenging,we have once a month come together,our challenging is who sells the most Kirby's  when during the month  when you think you don't have any money left, than  your commission comes,, so that's part of your challenge, you get trophies,gold badges  medals,so that's  my story while working  for Kirby."
good,Going door-to-door selling vacuums can be great money if you know what you're doing and follow what your taught However it's long hours so if you are married or wish to be married forget it. This job is for young and single people the long hours causes relationship problems what did you have no desire to establish a relationship and you willing to work hard for 5 years you can become wealthy doing this.
good,"You could use your own vehicle or be in a van with the team leader. Gas was paid for by the owner of the company. Fun place to work, lot of hours, if you sold, you made good profit"
good,long hours with a commission only structure in a willing to work environment. took advantage of new dealers with unrealistic goal expectations and a difficult training process
good,"It's very good when you can give of yourself to others and provide good and alternative ways to work."
good,I loved meeting new people and helping them. You get to meet people from all different walks of life and just being able to help other people make the the best decision for them whether it's purchasing a Kirby system or not my goal here was to help people.
good,Salinger Kirby vacuumes can be a challenging job starting At knocking doors an getting in to your presentation of the Kirby. Learning to sale kirbys have brought me to learn about people skills on an entirely new level from what I was already knowledable about
good,"selling Kirby, knocking on doors, meeting at the office"
good,"The Kirby Company was an amazing experience. We worked inside of homes displaying vacuums, that were rather expensive, but well worth it. we were basically salesmen, and personality was relied on. I learned how to make personal sales.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work off commission only, where your pay is based upon your own sales. The hardest part was actually sub staining a sell, but after I made the first one the rest were surprisingly easy. My co-workers were highly motivated and made the job much easier."
good,"This is a typical 12 hours shift day and I learned how to market merchandise. Management prepared you for future promotions, and your co workers provided a friendly competitive environment. The hardest part of the job was not being able to balance personal life because of the long hours, however the plus of this job is that you get to meet a variety of people."
good,Very flexible hours as you are an independent sales rep you can't travel in your own vehicle or with a team job is commission based with bonuses. Work as many hours as suits you.
good,"The biggest advantage was having daily reward for the first sale, this taught to work as fast and as hard as possible. Getting the product to the people was our number one priority. Closing a sale was also a big part of the learning in the sales industry, without closing a sale mean you haven’t sold the product in term means you’ve failed you primary purpose."
good,"Starting out working off of a van with a team, we went around knocking doors for hours in every direction, until someone allowed us to do a demonstration of our home care product. We got to do some meaningful cleaning and made sure the customers knew exactly what they were looking at and what it would mean for their future home care work. The product is truly outstanding."
good,Long hours can be a hard job.  Going door to door isn’t easy with no leads.  You just go up and knock a door and if your lucky you can get in the home and demonstrate the product
good,"I loved a lot of the people who worked there and they made that part of the job fun. But, sometimes it would get really stressful because there would be so many people during the rush hours and the restaurant is very small, so it made it hard to find places for people to sit at times."
good,"extremely challenging environment. Provides no security, purely based on commission. Can build only a limited repetitive business because of the nature of the product sold - usually a one time purchase, with very low after sale service and maintenance requirements."
good,"My time with Kirby was excellent. I had been a sales rep for a few months before I moved into a management position. The commission is great, and the earning potential is fantastic, although it is hard to get by if you don't take the opportunity seriously. For me, the reason I left the company is because of the work life balance, the hours are long, very long, and because it is commission based, there are times where it is better to stop working than to keep being pushed farther. Dealers are expected at the office at 9 and the day doesn't end until after 8pm, sometimes being as long as a 15 hour day 6, and sometimes 7 days a week."
good,Not a bad job to work at if one is in love with pushing product on potential customers. Fellow employees and bosses are great people. Very fun environment to work in.
good,I loved this job. It taught me skills about sales and people that are invaluable. I still take the skills learned with this company and use them in my day to day life
good,"Long hours "
good,"went door to door selling vacuums all day, very energetic job, and very motiviational"
good,"outbound telesales phoning warm customers, booking in appointments"
good,"Very great product, high turnover for basic sales associates because of the straight commission pay structure. Managing is quite easy as far as demonstration of product and training is concerned. Commission is based off of customer's credit which is becoming more difficult to profit from as time progresses. "
good,"They reach you the skills it's just up to you to apply them. I was phone staff and our company made work fun daily whether it be small contests, prizes or even chances for bonuses. Overall great place to work if you like talking to people."
good,"Highly competitive environment, but nice system of recognition for good work.  Great cultivator of sales skills and customer relations.  Mentoring from successful franchise owner was a great plus, and made it easy to look forward to work each day."
good,"This was my very first job straight out of highschool as en entry level salesman.  I loved it, loved my coworkers and my bosses as well as my job.  The reason I no longer work there is it provided very little social life.  There were days I would leave home at 10am and would not get back home until 2 in the morning, and then have to be at the office the next morning at the same time.  And as an 18 year old out of highschool that wasn't the lifestyle I was looking for at the moment."
good,"If you like people, the outdoors and have a strong drive to work and make money kirby is your place. It is 100% commission but the more You work the more You make."
good,"It is a great place to work. very cultured and diverse. If you don't mine commission based and you are a good sales men or people person then this is the job for you."
good,It's a company to work for make slot of money make a friend you would sell check cash credit card guarantee more doors knock on the more you have a chance of selling a Kirby make a paycheck every week is the key
good,"Looking for something new to add to experience and regular hours.. "
good,"Company is very good, great opportunity, just do a lot of research on the distributor your are interviewing for. Depending on how good the distributor is will tell how positive your experience with Kirby is."
good,"Effective sales associate with six years of experience in technology retail, including holiday sales. Dedicated team player with a focus on customer satisfaction and problem solving. Fluent in english. Display creation and inventory management."
good,You are required to gather your own leads. Can become expensive if not selling. You pay for gas. Straight commission. You get a percentage of each sale.
good,"Was able to implement a lot of procedures and was given full confidence by Management and Senior Management.  Job could be stressful and hectic but I thrive under those conditions so if you're someone who is seasoned and know your job, great place."
good,good people to work with and great working atmosphere i would recommend people to work there if looking for commission job its a fun place to work everyone is friendly
good,"I would like to use my management experience at Home Depot."
good,"The work day is starting the assembly line, check to make sure all the machines work properly before staring and begin working. packing attachments in boxes and sending them down the line. while there I learned how to use air powered screwdriver, riding pallet jack and stand up towmotor. I got along with management fine.hardest part of the job by it being a factory setting was the heat and humidity in the workplace.one of the best parts of the place was they had a full function cafeteria where they cook and prepared food breakfast and lunch.and fun coworkers to work with."
good,"fast-paced work environment "
good,"The Kirby Company is a success vacuum brand product. Working with my coworkers was great! An interview was placed, following a   required 3 day training program. After orientation, the motivated typical day at work began 11am every morning. In the field your team is required to display the Kirby product of 10 demo's in a week. After completion of each day we review what we learned."
good,"learned how to talk to people, and convince people to buy things, talking to people was most enjoyable, my coworkers were great, the hardest part was the long hours and traveling to new york"
good,Handle clerical duties on daily basis make office schedules and duties for co-workers love the co-workers they got work done and the place was clean.
good,"Commission only, mostly men, really fun. The work can sometimes be hard, but its only as fun and you're only as successful as you make it. If you're willing to push yourself and work hard, the reward can be great. There is no such thing as Kirby failing you, & only you failing Kirby."
good,"Fun and exciting days with typical challenges, but overall great days."
good,this job was my first job would say to work here if u love to work over night for high school students first job
good,hard work with allot of learning about the sales feild. long days lots of face to face interaction. great co-workers
good,"Very lax and healthy work averment... You would go to the office for a morning meeting and after leave to start your day going door to door setting up demos. It really helps you learn patience and customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is keeping your spirit up, because every once in a while you have those people r areas where you just cant get in. As long as you stay positive good things are bound to happen."
good,"good place to work, did my whole apprenticeship there"
good,I absolutely love the sales atmosphere. There is so much energy and challenge to each sale made. This all depends on you and your attitude.
good,Working at Kirby was very challenging every day. I learned how to deal with a lot of rejection. The management were very positive and fun people whom taught me success through professional work practices. The hardest part was getting rejected and the most enjoyable part was making a sale.
good,"This job helps develope lots of new working  skills aswell as , team work and leadership . Managment is always their when you need it and if you need help fancially they are their to help."
good,i had a great time at ths jobsyes i was commited to work a lot and its a very good job u get towork with people  and have great communication skills and be in apossitive mode
good,Great vacations and many career advancement opportunities. There are opportunities for the average representative will earn >$1000 per week(regularly)!  Not to mention there are 4 all expenses paid vacations per year!
good,The job was a job where you have to be a quick learner. I did gain some salesmen experience. Explaing what you have to do and also demoing what your saleing.
good,I absolutely loved this job! My team members and manager were amazing. This job was the job that made me want to go into sales as a career
good,"With this business, you have to be a people person... If you are not, forget it since you won't make it in this line of work."
good,fun got to meet new people everyday of all walks of life got to travel all over Missouri got to have fun each work day and got plenty of exercise
good,They offer jobs to Kirby employees before they post it outside of the company. They want you to better yourself within the company.if your not afraid of work and long days you’ll enjoy the perks and benefits they provide.
good,"I've had a great experience with The Kirby Company. It's hard but well worth it. If you can get good and meet the quotas you can do ANYTHING! I've learned so much communication skills, psychology, and customer service skills. About to own my own Distribitorship! Excited! Though when going to work Kirby or reading about working for Kirby it is a Distribitorship therefore they own their own business and some run it awfully but a good Distribitor means a GREAT opportunity!"
good,"You go door to door selling Kirby vacuums and offering potential customers free carpet cleaning in order to demonstrate the vacuums features. You demo on carpet or rug, mattress, or furniture."
good,I spent 10 months working for Kirby in Melbourne whilst I was travelling last year. I gained further experience managing staff and engineers
good,"Not enough pay overwork all the time , very sad because I have family to feed so I had to quit to get a better job that was more motivating so I can be happy again with a better job with great coworkers."
good,Smooth day no stress ok management great benifits light duty work enjoy working  with friendly people health care is great opportunity to advance with company
good,"This was a job based on commision, it was door to door knocking advertising a product not sold in stores an as a dealer my job was to display the product."
good,A competitive workplace in sales and phone soliciting that requires a genuine understanding of customers likes or dislikes of the product and the manner of which you obtain contact
good,"I liked this job for the product is top notch.  Overall, I think door to door sales is falling off and seeing as this is the only way Kirby does business, it is a rough sales position.  It is important to have your contract in mind and know how you are being paid, because often the distributor will do everything in his power to nickel and dime the dealer down to nothing.  Every penny the boss pays dealers comes directly out of his pocket."
good,"Io leggo tantissime persone che si lamentano dei soldi che spendono. Loro offrono 1200 euro mensili in cambio di 60 demo, TE LI GARANTISCONO. E, a fine mese, se hai totalizzato 60 demo, te li danno. E' impossibile che in 60 demo non scatti una vendita, quindi in base ai tuoi scatti in carriera hai un guadagno. Se sei nuovo senza scatti e vendi a 2-3 persone in 60 demo, riceverai un guadagno tra i 1.350 ai 1.500 euro, non è difficile da capire. E' normale che se non raggiungete le 60 dimostrazioni mensili i soldi non vengono regalati. In più, trovatemi un'azienda di vendita che vi paga per fare le demo e che soprattutto vi da il kit GRATUITO. Quindi per chi si lamenta che ha perso soldi per andare a fare demo voglio dire solamente una cosa: ABBIATE VOGLIA DI LAVORARE E DI INVESTIRE IL VOSTRO TEMPO. Perché è quello che chiede la Kirby company. IL VOSTRO TEMPO. Se non avete voglia di lavorare e nei 4 giorni che offrono di affiancamento non state attenti a come si svolgono correttamente le dimostrazioni, non lamentatevi. Dite inoltre che parlano solo di soldi, si è così, perché è un BUSINESS, non so se sapete cosa sia a questo punto. Ma a lavoro uno ci va per i soldi, non tanto per. Tanti cari saluti agli ignoranti che non capiscono questo lavoro ma che comunque si permettono di giudicare i loro scarsi risultati ottenuti facendo di testa propria senza dare ascolto a chi è interessato ( per forza di cose ) al suo successo. Bona gente"
good,Really had a great time within this company. Look forward to going back maybe in the future. Great teaching of sales and customer service and business management. Really fun and exciting every morning. Opportunity for big money and prizes.
good,"Long hours great pay hard work but yet fun, trips and incentives and opportunity yo move up. I would say a great culture based to someones efforts. Income related to that effort."
good,"I would go door to door every day but Sunday to persuade people into purchasing a vacuum cleaner from Kirby, the hardest part of the job was persuading people into buying the vacuum"
good,"Τέλεια εταιρεία με φοβερό περιβάλλον εργασίας "
good,"Ambiente stimolante e positivo, ogni giorno era una uova avventura e ci si interfacciava sempre con persone nuove"
good,"It's a very fraternal atmosphere, one in which you can care about the people around you and those you work with in different departments. This company culture adds cohesiveness and positivity to the workplace. Those who wish to just get the job done and go home are just as welcome as those who are recharged by the ""family' atmosphere. However, it is still a business. Those who are well-bonded will suffer the most when the occasional layoff occurs. Those who are less-bonded may have it easier, but will not fully get the most out of working there. just a paycheck."
good,I enjoyed my time with Kirby because it paved the way for me in the customer service and sales field. I always thought if I could go door to door and convince them to let me in and sell them $1907 product I can sell anything
good,"Had awesome leaders and co workers. it took a lot to step out of your comfort zones, but once you took that leap of faith you knew it was a job for you. Unfortunately family comes first, and once i started my family those long hours werent good for me anymore and i eventually had to bid everyone there a goodbye!"
good,"working in the Kirby office was great, I was always learning new things and growing in the company."
good,I like working in a competitive company like Kirby. The company also carries a great name attached to it. I like the fact that I was in control of how much money I was making based off of my efforts because I'm a hard worker and like to be compensated as such.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,customers were great it was very hard in the beginning but it was worth the hard work and dedication
good,"I have got a good knowledge and experience in secetarial work with Kirby and I have learned many things related to admin such as typing letters in both languages Arabic and English, filing procedure attending customers calls and liaising with other departments specialy accounts, purchasing and HR departments."
good,"Became a Indepentant Worker, and learned the art of Customer Service."
good,A typical day of work would be to come in at 9 a.m pumped and ready! We would have everyone stand up one by one and talk about their sales and who knocked them in. Then we would all sing a song to get our blood so we're ready for the day! Then the distributor would  help us on things we didn't understand. When we were through with our morning clinic we would all be super excited to work!
good,"Working at Kirby was great life and work experience for me. I learned how to go after what I wanted and how to follow through with completing personal goals.

The only thing we had to do was call customers off the list we were given and read our 3 questions and that was it! Pretty simple! If someone was interested then we take their information down and pass the information to management!

good,"Typical day at work would be going into morning meeting, have a talk about the goals of the day, then load up on the vans and go out to the field. Door to door offering free demos, you get a demo and you show how the Kirby works and show how it actually cleans your house. I've learned a lot about team work, sales, and pushing myself. Management was good, he always took care of things. Really cared for his workers. However coworkers i felt were not as motivated as myself. They didn't give their all. Hardest part was working with people who weren't as passionate about work as myself and seeing people get disqualified because of bad credit when they really wanted the Kirby. Most enjoyable was seeing the excitement and bonds created with the people I've sold the Kirby to. Knowing i was helping them."

good,The only negative thing I can say is you won’t have a whole lot of time outside of work so if you have a family it’s a little rough. Other than that you decide what you make through hard work and there are plenty of incentives like vacations and and other prizes.
good,"I can truly say that I enjoyed my years with the company. As long as you met your quotas, the company always had a trip or a prize for its reps. You had to be a go getter and a self motivator"
