bad,"Don't do it... I've never witnesses more favoritism, nepotism, amazing talent not encouraged or promoted... lack of diversity... they have ""token"" individuals- as I personally call them- that are awarded any new opportunities. If you're not one of them or in with the ""clique"", forget it. My old manager's team is where careers went to die. He liked to hide in his corner and hope that nobody knew he was there. I would say his name, but Indeed says I can't. Sorry."
bad,"Worked here nearly three years in NILC it's a revolving door, long hours to manage workload. Management has favorites and will take them off claims. While other employees have to pick up the slack. Would not recommend this job it's like working in h**l."
bad,Horrible company to work for.  Working 50-60+ hours a week and then they just dump more on you and except you to keep up and make sure it’s top notch.  Take away from customer focus
bad,I've worked for Nationwide twice. It is basically like being in high school. No room for advancement unless you're cute enough and catch the right eye. They also ask very odd questions in the interview and make you very uncomfortable.....on purpose as the interviewer pretty much told me. Don't waste your time there's way better insurance companies/call centers to work for.
bad,"They make huge changes that affect agent systems, and they don't test the changes, and of course the changes never work. They always over promise to agents and without fail, they under deliver every time. Management is a total joke, they have favorites and blatantly allow their favorites to do what they want, while making others strictly adhere to the ""rules."" It's hard to respect anyone of authority"
bad,Very mismanaged company and most of the management did not seem to care about work load of the employees. Whenever some left the company everyone else had to handle there work.
bad,"They pay peanuts for employees. Nationwide spend too much money on contractors And inferior bonus program, lots of directors and AVP positions who doesn’t have any real work. So they always come up with new processes and new expectations which is killing the productivity of the people who actually does the work. These unnecessary middle management layers need to be eliminated if they want to be successful."
bad,"After working for the company for almost two years I am glad that I am no longer there. The company made it impossible to enjoy the work that I did and the lack of professional support made it even harder. None of the supervisors appeared to be happy in their positions, and a lot of unethical things take place in the Gainesville location involving upper management. I've never been more happy to NOT be working for a company."
bad,Job is very stressful and you work minimum 12 hours days with no work life balance. No one checks your desk on vacation and the work builds and builds. Engagement is very poor and management communication is terrible from a local level.
bad,"I first started out at Nationwide as a receptionist.I opened and closed the office daily. I helped each customer with their insurance needs, accepted payments, printed out NYS ID cards, made appointments with customers for senior agent, answered all incoming calls. Made daily deposits, bought my own office supplies, including bathroom supplies. None were reimbursed from the senior agent. Since Nationwide required everyone to be an Agent, I got my license and trained another person to be the receptionist as the senior agent wanted another agent in the office. I was an associate agent for only a few months due to the fact that when i was out of the office like for lunch and when my customers came in to see me, instead of asking them to wait or call me to come back sooner, the senior agent stole my customers and wrote their policies as his. Since he continued to do this unethical practice my paychecks were so little i couldn't even pay a water bill with it. I soon left. It was a shame because the customers were great people and when you're in a customer service profession you tend to think of these people as your extended family."
bad,"Better Companies out there who appreciate you  Not worth my time"
bad,"Nationwide is undergoing a drastic downsizing and have cut thousands of jobs over the last year, including jobs they had hired associates for in the same year. It is unclear what their end game is since the company line is that the downsizing is coming from a ""place of strong financial stability"". Yet, they are laying off high quality associates with tenure anywhere from 1 year to 50 years and cutting the bonuses of their top performing associates to below a livable wage. I am doing everything in my power to get away from this rapidly shrinking company and advise everyone (including my worst enemies) to stay far away from employment in this toxic, highly unstable environment."
bad,"Favortism is the moto here.  If you dont give up your personal life and work 16 hours a day to make the 94% or better grade you will be crucified.  They love their action plans.  The managers are trained to not care and tell you if you don't do what they want, you will be fired and then they threaten you by saying you will lose your benefits and not be able to collect unemployment etc etc.  Worst 17 years of my life!"
bad,"The metric demands for employees makes it difficult to enjoy a work-life balance.  In order to obtain ""meet expectations"" as part of an employee annual review, employees had to consistently work 60 hours per week.  This is not sustainable long-term for employees with families."
bad,"Steer clear of this company for any call center jobs. It's all about tge numbers, they refuse to update there systems,and don't provide you with proper  tools to complete your job. Worst company I ever worked for."
bad,"In need of a union, anybody and everybody that work in claims absolutely hates it and would never recommend anyone to work there.  We would work CAT HOURS OVER SIX MONTHS IN A ROW LOCAL WITHOUT ANY DOWN TIME"
bad,"Nationwide is NOT on your side. Unreal expectations. Management (Agent) makes decisions based on favoritism. The agents' ""business model"" is focused on taking business away from Nationwide"
bad,"Great team at the agency, owner operates out of wenatchee and is not aware of day to day operations in Yakima. Hes a numbers guy who doesn't care about walk in, only wants preferred. Offers non-standard but doesn't want to sell it."
bad,"While Nationwide claims they invest in your training, which they do by flying you to CO for mock phone calls and lectures, it is not what you need for the job.  You just eat good food and have mediocre classes which are common sense."
bad,They sold our department to another insurance company and let people go left and right and it was a mess. I felt like the managers didnt care to help people grow and work with them if they were struggling it was just a write up and fire.
bad,"I am only writing this because i am required to. Do not work there. they are losing money and people left and right, making it more and more difficult on the people who still work there."
bad,"Overall, worked at Nationwide for 6 months or so. Did not enjoy it all."
bad,"company was heavy with employees, unfocussed management, terrible understanding of what was expected, employees do not help one another - a lot of infighting."
bad,"This position is extremely busy with only 7.75 hours of time to get it all completed, but we are sill required to work overtime with no overtime pay, we get paid a base salary and are expected to work numerous hours to complete our work."
bad,"I do not recommend this company to anyone, unless the previous management has been replaced.  There was definitely preference between employees in some way a little racist."
bad,"not satisfied "
bad,Managing partner in the office was a bully. He used intimidation and harassment towards the women in the office. Men in similar position with less experience were paid more. Complaints to HR were never investigated.
bad,Terrible management that could careless about employees all they care about are numbers. You are constantly put down and treated like a child yet expected to be motivated to come to work.
bad,Agency owner did nothing to help Associate Agents.  Favoritism shown to certain agents receiving draws and others not.  Product way too expensive and not competitive with other insurers.
bad,this was by far the worst job i ever had with the worst pay and the worst equipment. managment is lacking in all areas of there job. its a toxic enviorment
bad,"This place was nick named ""gossip central."" Very uncomfortable atmosphere, unprofessional supervisors and  managers who harass and judge you, favoritism determines promotion, additional work load thrown at you without any compensation, benefits are expensive, very little annual increase and no ability to adjust your schedule if needed for school or any other reason. Don't even think about being outspoken here, you'll be frowned upon and looked at as having a bad attitude if you disagree with anything. Expect to fall into depression and experience severe anxiety and stress if you choose to work here."
bad,"Recent budget cuts have made the environment super stressful. It is very unhealthy to work in a place that makes you feel like your job is constantly on the line. I probably got the short end of the stick with a supervisor who wasn't compassionate at ALL with work/home life balance. Reporting to someone who is cold and unresponsive made my time with the company worse seeing as how I had to go over my supervisors head to get a response. HR is great though! They are definitely the reason why I stayed with the company for so long. Well, HR and my team mates. I loved working with them."
bad,"Pay is horrible, unless you are on the executive team, Upper management is horrible. Find a job somewhere else, They are always trying to find reasons to write people up."
bad,"I worked for this company for 37 years, typing policies, etc, word processing, licensing clerk for sales agents, administrative Assistant in Sales Management Dept. and in the Claims Dept.  Retired after 37 years."
bad,"My situation may be unique to the agent I worked for.  She was not focused, always out of the office, required me to lie to her clients daily and provided no training or benefits."
bad,"I had transferred from the Bay City office to the Lake Jackson office and never felt part of the team. The staff there were not very social with me, and I felt like I had to walk on egg shells around them."
bad,"Nationwide is cutting  employees like a lawn mower right now. "
bad,"My co-workers are the most enjoyable part of my job. Love the gym and break room. Those are my favorite places to be. If you work well in an environment with constant change, this is the place for you."
bad,Job security wasnt  always there they ran a family business so problems from home came to work. Got laid off with no benifits wouldnt worked there again
bad,Run for your life.  I gave them a one star because I could not give them no stars.  I would rather be unemployed then work here!  Balance there is no balance here it is all self preservation.  They could care less if you ever left your desk.  They give you 20 claims on Monday and then anywhere from 5 more daily to another 20.  They don't give a hoot about anything except customer service survey scores.
bad,"They did nothing but lie to me the entire time I was at the company. They told me I would be able to change my hours so I'd start at a better time -they said this would happen at the 6 month mark and that mark came and went only to be told only the more senior representatives would be offered this chance- and they also said I could transfer out of the department after 6 months- I could certainly apply to other jobs but my manager refused to let me leave until at least a year had been  completed even though other people who started after me were able to transfer without any manager interference."
bad,"Nationwide seems to promote individuals that are completely incapable.  The less you know the higher you go within the company.  They like to dump more work on the lower paid individuals and do not compensate for it.  Nationwide also gives horrible pay raises.  I have learned that this company pays the least in claims positions and a lot of people leave the company because they are very unsatisfying in every way, shape and form."
bad,The Nationwide company is a great place to work. The insurance is great. The coverage is competitive.
bad,"Great location."
bad,I doing file clerks at that time and I really likes a lots do it. I learn is that to find different location files records and also computer to find information from web sides. Some of people who is not friendly and some them is friendly that what I hardest part who I work with.
bad,"There is absolutely no job security at Nationwide, they will  fire you for the most random made up reasons no matter how good and valuable an employee you are."
bad,"Terrible Managers, high prices, terrible benefits, this was my worst job in corporate america."
bad,I started at nationwide a few months ago and it was a complete nightmare....management was uneducated and always looking out for themselves. If you did anything to jeopardize there jobs or numbers they would threaten you or try to remove you from the company. Even as a newbie it bad. I felt bad for the customers because underwriting did not get involved until the policy was sold and payment was collected...meaning they would call and cancel you for petty reasons after they have collected payment and made you cancel with your current carrier. I felt bad for them.
bad,• Selling customized insurance to suit customer specific needs.
bad,Nationwide has decided that it’s better to get rid of employees instead of retraining  them and moving them to new jobs    Leaders don’t listen to ideas from their team members because they are always right and why would the need to ask for thorp
bad,The culture of the office was decent. The management team and operation system could use a tremendous amount of help. They were not open to communal teamwork or innovation.
bad,Would not recommend going there if you want a stable place to work.  Implemented lean and boy did they mean lean.  Not enough staff to get all the work done with high quality.
bad,"If you are not a straight white man, this is still a decent company to work for. Unfortunately, this company only promotes due to diversity and competence isn't rewarded."
bad,"Most toxic place to work in all the world. Leadership is conniving and discriminatory.  (Look up how many minorities they have in upper management). Politics of this place are so that if you don't play along, you're never going anywhere but out the door."
bad,"Over the last 15 years Nationwide has worked hard to develop an employee friendly company. It was their goal to have engaged and happy employees which would benefit the customers who relied on Nationwide when needed. In the past year, Nationwide had laid off several thousand employees in an attempt to reduce expenses and become ""lean"". All of the company's hard work developing a great environment has been thrown away in less than a year after new leadership took over. Some of the most pro-Nationwide people I've know are starting to jump ship before it gets any worse."
bad,"Inconsistent across the broad, an too many layoffs, management has poor lack of communication, not fair with employees and pay isnt bad nor is it the greatest."
bad,"It seemed as the company never cared about its employees. They had a very strict ""occurrence"" policy in the call center and would not make exceptions for anyone, even employees who had legitimate excuses for missing work."
bad,One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. The job requirements in the call center are completely unrealistic. The company has it's own mental health clinic.
bad,"I believe Insurance sales,marketing and customer service are important in doing business with Nationwide and the smaller companys. "
bad,this was by far the worse place i have worked. you are almost afraid to go in because you know what you are walking into. another boring day of data entry and tps reports.
bad,Worked as a injury adjuster for a few years. Last year was dreadful to say the least. Management appears to not know how to lead. Too much turnover has caused an increase in workload which requires you to work long hours which goes unpaid. There is no work/life balance here. Would not recommend the claim department in this region to even my worst enemy.
bad,"Not a very great Place to work, Weak Talent acquisition teams with stone age processes and lot of ambiguous environment. Immigration department is changing the laws and policies too frequently.  Work life balance is not really possible with tons of supporting and working extra night hours."
bad,"Awesome company, poor management team. Not a place to call home."
bad,Horrible company. My boss was awful. I was laid off unexpectedly with no real reason. I heard that this has been happening for years and has continued happening since I left.
bad,"Many years ago, this was a great company.  Then about 5-7 years ago, upper management changes occurred that negatively affected the whole culture and tone of Nationwide.  No longer did they care about the employees or customers.  Greed and profits took over and that is all that mattered. Layoffs began is mass quantities and customer service no longer mattered.  Those left are overworked and no one cares.  That is the culture of Nationwide now  NO ONE CARES ABOUT EMPLOYEES OR CUSTOMERS"
bad,"It's about who you know, not the quality of your work there. They say they have all of these values, but don't live up to them as a company. Most of management does not care about your well being as a person, or consider work-life balance. I went from highly recommending this company, to advising that it isn't the best option. They do multiple lay offs throughout the year. Within the past year alone, they laid off half of the quality team, half of the supervisors, and a lot of our sales representatives. I worked for them for quite a while, and am happy to be leaving them. They have made so many changes that it's not a place you want to be at."
bad,"Extreme micro-management, no career development or opportunities for advancement, non-flexible work hours and extremely cold work environment. Not worth the nickels and dimes they pay"
bad,The second week of employment they were trying to find ways to fire me. Making up lies on me because I didn’t fit there prototype. So the entire time there has been harassment. That way I would quit or they continue with their paper trail to fire me. Be careful most are backstabbers. Pretending to help but in reality working against you.
bad,"Co-workers were great. Upper Management made one bad decision after another. They protected themselves and left their subordinates holding the bag. Repeatedly I exceeded annual expectations. I was promised a raise and promotion, only to have upper management bypass HR with a new clause; one has to do better than to exceed expectations to get a promotion. This was introduced 3 days before my performance review."
bad,"The work atmosphere and job security were great when I initially began my career with Nationwide. However, after one year of working for the company there were quite a few changes that took place where I felt that my business unit was in jeopardy. I quickly moved to a new position within the company and then was quickly demoted to a lesser position and then once again after a year was demoted again ""to provide a better member experience."""
bad,"everyday was a different day. "
bad,"Used to be a great company to work for "
bad,"A decade ago, the company used to be a great place to work at. Now, like a prior user said ""management was cutthroat and two faced and massive company layoffs"". Also, you only got respected if you made *them* look good, and  even when you bust your behind and did just that, there was the added ""benefit"" of getting no credit at all."
bad,"This company has gone down hill in the last few years. It really depends on what manager you get as to what your experience is. When I first started it was amazing! The management was great and I really looked forward to going to work. Once there was a manager change, it all went downhill. Management doesn't have your back and they LOVE to micromanage."
bad,"I worked for Natiowide as an adjuster for 15 yrs in multiple operations including NATCAT."
bad,"Organization is run with heavy dependency on project teams. "
bad,"Your are just another number they do not care about you. They are closing their office they could have easily saved our jobs and didn't. Our benefit were extremely expensive. My manager told me I was expected me to work 8:00 am to 8:00 pm they offer no work life balance. Men make more money then women and are treated far more superior, so if your a man you will go farther."
bad,"The manager was very ignorant and would joke if someone was overweight or wouldn't have enough money to make payments on the new policy that was just set up. He pushed religion on clients constantly, which is extremely unprofessional. He was very against woman above him in the company and when a female would show him up, as I did, he speaks badly and spreads rumors. It is hard to believe this individual has an insurance license."
bad,"They always have changes and it is cut throat and management does not respect the agents."
bad,"its all about who you know..  if you not ""in"" with someone your sunk.. poor culture....   They promote to move people on...  screw up and get promoted..  lip service.."
bad,Extreemly draining. Increasing work load. They pay you for a 7.45 hour work day and give you 16 hours worth of work
bad,Nationwide is a good company to work for overall. The particular agency can make a huge difference in satisfaction.
bad,"The mangement is so caught up in MBO's.. management by objectives,  that they will not hesitate to throw you under the bus if need be. "
bad,"I am a top sales agent with some of the best stats. I am a respectable person, and you never have to tell me twice to do something. Management will treat you like you are never good enough, even though you're one of the best. I would advise anyone not to work for this company!"
bad,"Poor leadership, Not easy to work with no no cohesion. Stressful work environment from upper management. Rules no applied consistently across the board."
bad,Horrible business model in property claims!  Management played favorites and most of them were completely unqualified for their position-although a few of them were somewhat knowledgeable.  Terrible work/life balance in the department and the business model did nothing except set you up to fail.
bad,"The Nationwide office that I worked for in Oakland, MD was a horrible experience overall. The manager of the office was arrogant and not a fan of woman in the workforce. He was not a fan when I would sell policies.I have been in the county and know a wide variety of people, he was also not a fan of that. He went as far as telling people that I was fired from a previous job because I was accused of stealing, which is a complete lie. I would not recommend working at Hansford Insurance."
bad,"Typical Day: Work begins at 8:00 am  or earlier, calls are sent to office phone of claims that has been reported, call the customer to find out when can the damages can be viewed, after inspection is made I would pay the customer for the damages amount less their deductible or assign license trade workers for repairs to damaged property"
bad,"When I first started at Nationwide In the 90's it was an amazing place to work, but at the years went on they started to care more about money and less and less about their employees. Benefits got worse every year. Management was uncaring. It was very biased to collage graduates. As time went on more and more of the work I loved doing was taken from me."
bad,The job culture is not good. Manager relations toward employees is generally adversarial. Currently there is no chance for advancement or moving to a different department as the company is downsizing multiple departments including claims.
bad,"No work life balance, no confidence in any of the levels of management, salary was good, could use company car for personal use, health insurance had a $3000 deductible and that was the low deductible option, only matched 50% for 401k"
bad,Your experience at Nationwide directly correlates to your manager.  They can make your life a living nightmare or pleasant. Unfortunately I had the former rather than the later.  I also took a pay cut to work for Nationwide because I had heard good things about them.
bad,"I could not work in such a toxic, competitive environment and showed favoritism from supervisors. At the end of our training they surprised us all by saying we were going to be trained on upselling features insureds could add onto their policies. That was not part of the job description and I left the company siting that it just wasn't for me."
bad,"Highly critical upper management. Training was OK. Management was very reluctant to approve OT even though the job required the extra time. OT needs to be approved in advance and they did not want to do it. The employees that I dealt with were all very nervous about pleasing management. The best part of the job was actually when I got to perform my job. The worst part was the micro managing by the upper management. The lower level managers were OK, but their hands were tied by the upper level management."
bad,"The culture was about undermining others, not collaboration. Production quotas strictly enforced, but employees who skipped difficult claims to boost their productivity were rewarded for their ethical breaches. Employees who worked claims no matter the difficulty were punished for taking on more challenging work."
bad,The only good thing about this job was my co-workers. Our boss was very rude & condescending to us. He even left us (3 women) at the office after we received a call from the claims department that an angry customer was on his way to our office & that he had made threats against our office
bad,Nationwide will work an adjuster into the absolute ground.  Supervision offers sympathy but little else.  But you still have to provide prompt service with immediate results.  Worked 12-14 hours a day including weekends.  Sometimes received 4-6 field assignments a day.
bad,"Having QA on the same floor as the call center set up a climate where they are unfairly harsh to employees the just don't like. This was the least professional place I have ever worked. There were supervisors that lied about me parking in a handicap space to harass me and my supervisor agreed with it. I asked my manager for any evidence other than this other person's word that I had parked in the handicap space. After lecturing me, he stated that maybe the other supervisor had made a mistake. They force everyone to prepare for a yearly questionnaire making sure the are named one of the best places to work. I was counseled and prepared for this questionnaire at least 4 different times. No they are not even a good place to work and forcing employees to prepare for the questionnaire hardly makes the responses unbiased. I would never work there again with that ragtag group who are really not qualified for any job. Also, I would never buy insurance through any of their companies. I've seen how difficult it can be to get them to pay a claim."
bad,New management did not reflect the company moto.  I did not experience much enjoyment working here.
bad,"There were problems right from the start. I wasn't interviewed for my first position which led to issues later. The first department, Group Health, was in a state of chaos. I was used as a floater at first doing filing that the people responsible to do it weren't doing on other floors. As a result, I didn't have a desk or work station in my department, and, because of that, I never received memos nor attended any department meetings. The manager was ridiculously strict to the point where I felt like I was back in junior high. For one month, we had a new supervisor, except that I didn't know who she was because I wasn't included in the first meeting when she was introduced. There was a worker's comp injury, but the issue was so poorly handled, I ended up having to sign an agreement to never apply for nor accept a position with them in order to get a settlement and not take a large financial loss. With Medicare, I had a supervisor that enjoyed belittling her employees. She would often blow her stack and go into tirades, showed no respect for anyone she deemed below her and not as 'professional' as she was. The hardest part of working for Nationwide are the constant ignorant stunts that they pull on their employees and still do according to friends who work there."
bad,then they micromanage the heck out of you. You have to take abusive calls from customers. Dont go on break early or late because youll get written up. Cafe has good food though.
bad,They don't care about their employees. You are just a seat warmer. Don't breathe wrong! They promise you the moon and stars to get you hired and then do whatever they can to fire you if you aren't liked by someone in the hire up area. It's a joke.
bad,"Things changed when Scottsdale Insurance Company changed name to it's parent company (Nationwide).  No longer the same culture, and things really changed.  Employees that showed countability were getting laid off."
bad,Horrible heartless managers. Blah blah blah. Fired me for no reason. Omg omg sucks sucks blah wow they don't even care that i got deathly sick it matters about attendece
bad,The management team was not very good at all. Many times my manager would not even be at work or would lock himself in an office so we couldn't bother him with questions. There was a great deal of favoritism between management and associates. There is no room for advancement and the office is closing in 2020.
bad,I don't recommend the commercial lines department in the West -bad leaders and out of step with the industry.  Leadership allows for bullying culture.
bad,"Nationwide is a place where Excel spreadsheets matter more than the company employee. The procedures are last minute, the management is non-communicative and the employee is stressed beyond belief. They are bad people there and they blame others for their mistakes."
bad,"I currently handle a pending of 95 claims with approximately 40% in litigation. The value of the claims ranges from $100K to $750,000. My typical day is one where I juggle many tasks and many priorities. You never know what is the most important priority because everything is a priority. This company is driven by processes not results. They only care about whether a certain screen is filled out or if you have completed a process on the file. The management is also driven by processes and will micro manage everything you do."
bad,"Morale is very low. High turn over rate.. Company is not what it seems. Good training program though and knowledgeable trainers,"
bad,"Good money but stressful.  Cannot advance unless you have a good ""Brand"" or are in good with VP's.  They change their compensation plan every 6 months to a year.  Nationwide has a lot of growing up to do."
bad,"This is one of the worst employers on the planet. They give their people tremendous workloads, terrible pay, and foster anything but a spirit of cooperation. I was consistently bullied by the cousin of an HR employee, and I finally left. I'd rather be in basic training than work for this company."
bad,"Current leadership has gotten away from customer service and the new culture is only focused on the numbers game and nothing else."
bad,"Slander, gossip and public humiliation were actively encouraged.  Everybody had a ""personal brand"" that everybody else was constantly trying to ruin. I dreaded going to work there every day."
bad,"If you get the right Manager, it makes all the difference. If you're good at brown-nosing, you'll move up the ranks quickly. If you get poor leadership and your Manager doesn't want to help your career advancement or pay you fairly what others in your role make for doing the same work, you'll be miserable."
bad,co workers were team players and it was a fun atmosphere and there was various opportunities for advancement
bad,"Nationwide sales does not value their top sales people. These people are considered by the company as selling for bonus only. Isn't that what sales are all about? Management at nationwide state that they rather their sales agents sell a lower amount of policies which makes absolutely no sense. While I have to admit that the compensation that is paid out is good, it is a very stressful place to work at. They are never happy with their employees. The only thing that is keeping me here at this point is the pay, but once I find a job that pays the same I will quit."
bad,Beware before taking a job in a trial division office in the central plains region. Extremely hostile environment. Support staff not held accountable for mistakes. Excuses made for them. Wholly different standards applied to men v. women.
bad,"Five different managers in one year. There was no consistency in reviews or performance measures. My co-workers were great, and the best part of this job. They will tell you one thing and cut your job right out from under you."
bad,"Senior Nationwide employees pride themselves on the ""Nationwide Family""."
bad,"Nationwide has been going through through some struggles over the past couple years. They have eliminated departments and cut staff by close to 50% in a lot of departments. They have overworked their current employees, morale is low, and there is no end in sight. It used to be a GREAT company to work for but lately they just abuse their employees."
bad,My typical day at work involves answering incoming phone calls from customers who need help or assistance with their home or auto insurance policy. I've learned a lot about patience with this job - I've also learned how to become very personable even when interacting with customers on the phone. My co-workers are great! They help me when or if needed and I help them as well. The hardest part of my job is talking to angry people all day as it is emotionally draining. The most enjoyable part is being able to work in a friendly environment.
bad,"My co-workers at the office I worked in were the best co workers I have ever had.  We all worked as a team and PRODUCED, yet...….."
bad,"Company sold division, made a promise to incorporate adjusters into standard, but then stated later that they were not. Management lacked any effort to fight to keep seasoned adjuster and only worked to help themselves."
bad,Nationwide personal lines dept stays busy. The time you walk in to start your day they're are at least 25 calls in queue. Throughout the day it remains at least 30 and more calls in queue. There is no down time.It was a busy call center enviorment. I've learned alot about home insurance and call insurance also
bad,"Great environment, busy,steady. answer phonelines, take payments, make late calls"
bad,Stressful and very much underpaid they are all about the numbers and not concerned about their employees. They pay salary but because they know paying you hourly would could them to have to pay over time constantly because they work cannot be done in an 8 hour shift
bad,"Horrible agent purchased long time family run agency. Destroyed relationships with myself and current policy holders. Lost many policies because of his ""big city"" attitude"
bad,"Worst place to work."
bad,stress full work place. More work than you can get done in an average day. Changes were made that made the job even harder than what is should be. Agents are treated better than the workers.
bad,"A typical day was fast-paced and easy. "
bad,"Answer inbound calls to process insurance payments, complete policy changes"
bad,"Assist customers with policy changes"
bad,Slow office and slow sales. Overall smooth transitions and professional atmosphere.
bad,"company moved to san antonio, other than that good company to work for."
bad,"I believe that any company should put the same energy into the employees that they insist they do with the customers.  Protect your employees and show more appreciation.  Tickets to games and discounts on events are not enough when an employee feels like they don't matter at the end of the day.  I believe that if a job isn't a good fit for someone that the company highlight their qualities and maybe encourage them to look elsewhere within the company.  Letting go of valuable employees with no warning says a lot about a company and the true ""Mission Statement"".  Include the employees in this statement and stand true to your beliefs of genuinely caring for people."
bad,this was a good place to work to get started in the industry.  i got licensed and worked out in the field as well as other places int he office it was good
bad,"i learned how to make calls using a script ,information about insurance policies. A typical work day is very focused on time management and getting all task completed . The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with clients and letting them know that we are on there side ."
bad,"Front desk office Receptionist/office administrator.an 8:15 to 5:15- 5 day a week job that is semi-fast pace. Most enjoyable part of the job is with the policy holders ,helping them with their concerns and making them feel that they were special . Then their fed back of relief."
bad,"not a lot of advancement "
bad,4 years ago they seemed like the place to be. They lose way too much money in claims which trickles down until the week before Thanksgiving your told you may not have a job by Christmas. Also supervisors gloat and celebrate with each other after firing employees.
bad,Culture is one of non-communication and gamesmanship rather than working together. The division of contract and full-time resources is very apparent.  Fulltimer's tend to take your work product just before it is completed and reassign it to themselves to get credit.
bad,"Answered phones, selling various insurance plans, posting payments, filing, required continuing education. Opened and closed office for majority of the time. Ran the office for the most part."
bad,A lot of change is happening at Nationwide as the result of their efforts to lower operational costs and departmental re-organizations. The current internal overhaul and restructuring makes Nationwide a non-desirable place to work in the short term.
bad,"It isn't Nationwide as a company, it was the particular agency that I was working for. In fact after I left, the agent involved was reprimanded by the company for his conduct.  They offered me ermployment in another capacity,"
bad,a typical day I never here from my manager ever if something great happens in my territory.  It is like I am on an Island by myself for 3 years now.  He has only spend 2 days with me and won't ride in the same car with me.  He rents a car and follows me from account to account because of past HR issues with other reps.
bad,"There is no career advancement.  You only have one choice of medical, which is a high deductible plan. Family deductible is $10k a yr.  Management lack experience. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people you work with."
bad,"Nationwide as a company is great, however being as they are franchised out to independent agents, it is a whole different ball game.  Your success and support will depend on the agent you decide to work for as well as their management style."
bad,Poor management in both the direct supervisor and property director. The ARE NOT ON YOUR SIDE. Management will not hesitate to throw you under the bus and will also back up over you as well. Direct supervisor for field property is incompetent and doesn't understand property claims. Fellow adjusters are nice and understand the situation so they are always willing to work together to help each other. It is definately a divided culture between adjusters and managers that does not make for a great work environment.
bad,I had a bad experience with the company and they do not care about the customer or the employee they only care about the numbers. 
bad,Me and my ex husband owned our own insurance agency for 7 years and went we got divorced it got too hard to work together so we sold the book of business to Nationwide the owner had about 10 locations already. He ask me to stay on and help with changing the customers to Nationwide because we only did high risk and I did. it was not going to be a permanent job I stayed longer that I was supposed too.
bad,Nationwide Insurance at one time was okay to work at until in recent years. The demands and workload has become un-manageable.
bad,I took a month of classes outside of workplace but really didn't help me in office. I was in a small office by myself hardly got any help with system or support.
bad,"I retired early due to the stress I was put under in this company. The management was patronizing, they said they wanted our thoughts but that was as far as they went."
bad,"Lack of training and workplace culture. Very focused on bottom line. You feel like a number and not an employee, must follow the rules. "
bad,"At the start of working at Nationwide I was introduced to a three week training period. Training was extensive, and isn’t your typical step by step training course. The class was from 9am to about 5:45pm...perks were we were allowed early release most days. One of the Trainers I’ll disclose her name as Trainer “G” was very nice, helpful and professional “during training”. I’ll explain why I said during training later. Also we had an additional trainer K. To make a long story short training was difficult once we made it to claims, and the training did not hardly prepare us for the customer care floor. I was very disappointed when I actually began to take calls, because I felt like I had the basics down but I was just repeating what my floorwalkers were saying. We had floor walkers for about 1 full week which is ridiculous because we all needed a lot more help. As I crossed paths with the trainers they no longer greeting me with a hello or even gave eye contact. Trainer K was always pretty rude, and anti social...let me add she does say “Have a good weekend” on FRIDAYS! Trainer G does everything she can to avoid you, but when she needs the gossip on the office she will stop by to say hello. Back to taking calls; you are advised to call team leads if you need further assistance.  5 out of 10 are rude, will make you feel dumb, and will try any and everything to just get you off the phone if it’s an escalation (meaning they want to speak with a supervisor). If you’d like to know the type of calls you’ll be taking, just google the reviews with the better business bureau. You are told"
bad,"It was very difficult working there with a family, The compensation was very good at the beginning. However, it changed several times throughout my career there and was very erratic."
bad,no job security things change daily all about sales not the agents. high pressure sales tons of meetings and bad managing all around they seem more like they just started selling insurance than acting like a company that has been around for over 100 years
bad,"I worked for an agency and it was not your ideal workplace.  Micro-management and unfair pay, work culture was very high school.  Job not challenging enough."
bad,ALOT of meetings with no productive outcome.  A Manager with zero mortgage experience trying to lead a team of 10 processors. System outages very regularly.  The Underwriters controlled all that happened in the department.
bad,"Management was continually changing. Company placed more and more of the operating costs on the small businesses, causing them to struggle. Did not provide training to office persons."
bad,"There is no consistency. Employees are unwilling to go to HR with issues, because they fear retaliation. All advancement is based on statistics and Managers have the ability to manipulate those facts and figures."
bad,"If they don't like you, management  will make you miserable. Every six months you will be hit with a new direction to follow and you have no authority to make an agency exception.  Can go elsewhere for higher pay and better treatment. Lots of turnover in the Scottsdale office and not due to promotion. Underwriters are regularly over worked with high territory volume and expectations. Nationwide will give you enough training for 6 months but after that, you are on your own. Unless you want to relocate, little chance for advancement."
bad,"After taking on a position with Nationwide I started to notice areas in which they gave little to no regard to staff within the department. From the lack within management being unwilling to recognize the working abilities, along with strengths and weaknesses of their team. Management seems to operate on a ""black and white"" one level approach that does not integrate with all employees'."
bad,"Did not enjoy working for my boss at all. He was very rude, controlling, and unappreciative. VERY difficult to take time off. Very low morale and poor pay. One of my least favorite jobs ever."
bad,Only good thing about this job was meeting amazing human beings I'm lucky to still have as friends. My managers were all very rude & concerned about their own jobs.
bad,"I enjoyed my time in the field, but the company is closing local offices and relocating departments to Ohio. I feel bad for the people who have put in 20-30 years for the company and are losing their jobs because they can't move to Ohio. I am staying in Richmond, VA and I look forward to my next adventure!"
bad,"Nationwide Insurance has plenty of opportunities for those who are willing to relocate.  Unfortunately the bad outweighs the good.  Management shows favoritism and there is no compensation for working overtime. If you are an overachiever or prefer more time at work than at home, than this is the right company for you."
bad,"When I joined Nationwide, it used to be a very good company and a very good work ethics. There was a lot of transparency. Things were difficult, but mutual trust made it go with ease."
bad,"This company expects much from its employees, including very long hours. There is no appreciation or encouragement for work/life balance. They do not treat female employees equally."
bad,"Nationwide is the Titanic and has hit an iceberg. The Claim Units had massive lay offs. The Claim Associates left have a out of control work load. SIU field associates and managers were let go. Before long, any SIU associates left will be investigating from a desk....no field investigators. But it won't matter.....Claims management and legal don't listen to SIU anyway. The ones making decsisions are completely out of touch with the reality of claims handling these days."
bad,"My team is amazing, and I genuinely enjoy seeing my work friends, but upper management especially is completely out of touch (best case), or willfully ignorant of how bad it is to work here. The volume is too high, we are constantly understaffed, and they wont even acknowledge it. People have been leaving in droves and our upper management team literally dont care at all. they do nothing to try and keep people here, they pay too little and expect everyone to work unpaid overtime to keep their heads above water, while taking away the tools we need to stay afloat, let alone succeed. I want to be positive about my work and my job but it's a nightmare."
bad,"Nationwide was once a company that I would recommend to those seeking a career option, however in recent years it has become a very stressful workplace with limited advancement opportunities. Leadership will talk about positions opening, but postings will close unfilled. Pay is mediocre for the field and bonuses are very low. Workloads are increasing and external agencies are brought in to micromanage. Very unusual direction for a once successful mutual company, but market results are showing the poor strategy."
bad,The culture of the company has changed.  This is a workplace with limited advancement opportunity and the presence of nepotism. You will most likely work longer than 12 hours per day to accomplish all goals required.
bad,Needs improvement on all levels. The company has changed a lot in the past year. It doesn't appear as if they care about their employees. It isnt a fun envorment to work at.
bad,Age discriminatory.  This company goes after people as they approach the age of 50 - 55 and finds reasons to lay off or fire them. *******************
bad,Relaxed work environment however consistently under pays associates in comparison with industry. No opportunities for advancement. Treat underwriters like call center representatives.
bad,I was brought on as a rep and trained with the expectations set that we would be groomed for promotions upon successful work within a year to 18 months. They clearly pick and choose their favorites to advance and keep others in their cubicle farms to answer inbound phones. I felt like I wasted 3 years of my career.
bad,I did not have a good experience at Nationwide. Work was unorganized. I did not enjoy working in the call center and have no desire to do this again. It was not a good match for me.
bad,Co workers are great.  Company policies are not.  Laid off over 1100 people only to hire just as many.  Involuntary pay cuts and extremely high priced insurance for employees.  My salary is being reduced by $9000 in 2019
bad,"Insurance companies only concerns are to produce more revenue, Nationwide is no different and it is a very pressure appointment to sale insurance as a whole. The pricing of the insurance was not at all competitive with other insurance providers. The work culture itself was great. Meeting with new people and instructing them on insurance guidelines, procedure, and most importantly, coverage. It does fall into line with my degree in Political Science (pre-law). Much of insurance is written in a language much like the law."
bad,"Nationwide has lost its way as an employer of choice and in the marketplace. Opportunity and job security for very few people. Staying employed and relevant is all about who your internal sponsor is. Corporate profitability & budget managed through RIFs & increased premiums on decreasing customer base, not business growth"
bad,"Sold insurance to customers.  Licensed in 42 states in addition to Iowa.  Sold property, auto and home to various clients throughout the US.  Worked with customers to assist with all needs."
bad,Bloated with off shore weighted worker ratios.   Walkways from the garage are adorned with corporate value slogans that few managers have any hope of living up to. They are more worried about lowering the cost of doing business then about serving the needs of the customers.
bad,"Honestly, their is really nothing good to say about the facility that I worked at. Management was horrible, so was the pay. Then, the property was shut down without a heads up."
bad,"* High stressed environment, with no direction in leadership and unrealistic goals."
bad,"Management in claims department is very poor. It is specifically said by management that it is not their job to help develop peers or help you keep your job, your on your own. If management does not like they will get rid of you.. There are favorites, you will know who they are because they are hardly on the phones. You will be forced to participate in baby showers, birthdays, boss's day, etc ( you pay out of your own pocket for these events) , if you do not participate you will be considered an outcast and you will be penalized on your evaluation and supervisors will talk about you amongst themselves to upper management. If management does not like they will get rid of you"
bad,No Work-life balance. Poor management. Lack of chances for advancement at my location. Environment is very stifling as we are micromanaged. They boast diversity and inclusion and attractive values but don't put them into practice. Coach employees to give high scores on independent employee engagement surveys.
bad,"I was constantly terrified for my job and went from voluntary to mandatory overtime with no warning. Management constantly changed the rules.  I was told I would be able to promote, but was put off for years until they told me there would be no more promotions.   Would never recommend."
bad,This particular building was smaller with only  2 other employees including the owner. The owner went behind customers backs and applied certain coverage's to their accounts without permission. I do not recommend this company for insurance.
bad,"In claims, you are committed 24/7.  There is no work/life balance.  You are instructed to get the work done no matter how long it takes.   "
bad,"receive new assignments and determine if there is coverage and move files accordingly as needed. Some files I keep until the end, others are passed along for additional work needed."
bad,felt like I was in 3rd grade again....you had to be in a click to get your work noticed. Pay was
bad,"Managers and employee's were great , recieved good training tools. The benfits in this company were not what i expected, co-pays were too high which i could'nt afford the co-pay, payed too uch money to pay the health insurance or see the doctor. Wasent allowed to recieve calls on cell phone from doctor, state offices or family emergencies. It was always too cold, unable to use entranet tools on breaks or lunches, and not enough sick days."
bad,"No surprise when pop up layoffs continue and dedicated employees who feel uneasy decide to seek elsewhere where their talents and work product will appreciated and paid fairly. Claims department a sweatshop. They barrage you with unattainable metrics and poorly thought out workflow changes but the chosen associates in the cliques seem to "
bad,"The mismanagement of the company led to layoffs and loss of work security. the atmosphere was allowed to become thick with stress, fear and lack of a work-life balance. Management is supported in being punitive and degrading rather than training. The management staff was promoted before they were ready and poor decision making caused work loads to inflate with only derogatory response. The working conditions were abhorrent, and the employees were blamed for management incompetence."
bad,Limited room to grow and fast pace. It can be overwhelming with the amount  of claim you have to work. its a robotic environment since all you do look at the computer and talk on the phone all day
bad,"Typical work day, working from home was nice however being sent daily numbers for production with everyone's name on it could be demeaning but they used it as a motivator.  If you were not one of the golden ones, there was not a lot of opportunity for growth or promotion.  Processing member's changes on their policies was okay work and we did contact agents on occasion and internal departments as needed.  The workplace culture was okay in the beginning, however as changes and updates within the company began to take place due to technology advances, things began to shift within the company.  They began to focus more on production numbers and daily scores, quick to write up or put you on coaching if your numbers did not improve.  Overall, Nationwide is not a bad company to work for, perhaps it has improved since they have laid off hundreds of employees since 2016 and plan on laying off more for improvements of their delivering on the company's objectives.  However, if they have not learned to focus more on keeping those with experience and older workers, they will become like so many other companies, pretty on the outside and empty on the inside.   Companies cannot replace people with younger workers and expect to keep up with diversity and a well rounded talent pool of workers."
bad,"A typical day at work is meeting after meeting.  Not everyone shows up, so nothing gets done.  Overlapping meetings and overextended associates.  They offer tuition reimbursement but there isn't any time to take classes.  "
bad,"Should treat Contractors more professionally and not like second class citizens.  Interns are treated as though they are permanent associates and Contractors are underpayed grossly, but do a great deal of the work."
bad,"Not optimal. However, another person's experience may differ depending on their placement and management they deal with, as everyone will have a different personal experience."
bad,"Starting at this company, they make you feel like you matter.  Years down the road when you start to make decent money, they eliminate those jobs, pay you little or no severance and you have to start over.  "
bad,enjoyed it a lot in the beginning then the truth starts to be revealed and its not what you expect it to be from what youre told. No one is on the same page. everyone follows their own rules rather than all being consistent. the pay is nice but you have to work hours that are not so great and they only pay that much is for people to stay there. no matter how good the pay is people still leave.
bad,Not a bad place to work and certain manager are not open to a new specialist that knows the industry better than they do and showing them what's new and how a proper repair is done.
bad,"The agency owner was very hard to get along with.  For the short time I was there, I noticed an extremely high turnover rate and no one seemed to be happy.  Everyone was always walking on eggshells when the owner walked in the door."
bad,"Bad management, no salary increases, overworked, underpaid."
bad,"I worked for Nationwide's 2nd largest center in Des Moines, IA in the sales/retention area. It had the expected large company feel. I was in right out of college and so I got my feet wet in insurance then got out to another company where I've been much happier and have developed an actual career. With Nationwide they put you in your job and then advancement was next to impossible. The management they did advance left me scratching my head. One in particular didn't know anything about personal insurance products and really didn't have the attitude that he even cared to learn. He was later demoted (not fired) for quid pro quo sexual harassment of a female co-worker of mine at a wedding. Along the lines of ""Come upstairs in the hotel with me and I'll see what I can do about a promotion"" type of thing. They DID NOT fire him. Human Resources interviewed everyone there and all reported what they had heard and seen even the victim. He was offered his management salary and a demotion, so he took that and continued to work alongside the woman he had harassed. High turnover is the constant theme because everyone puts in their year (they make you sign a contract that if you leave earlier than a year you have to pay back the state licenses they had to pay for, although if you leave and don't pay all they do is mail letters, nothing happens, you just wouldn't be hired back at Nationwide). When I was hired they explained the compensation package, 33,500 base and commission. 6 months in they cut the commission and gave everyone a $750 raise. This was a long ways off what I was earning with"
bad,It was nice to work here because it was a good working place. They always make sure that you were pleased and comfortable to work
bad,"When I was hired, I asked a former associate about his experience at Nationwide. He smiled and told me it's a good place to start. I should have listened. Nationwide is a great place to learn about the insurance industry. The training program and educational benefits are excellent. Take full advantage of every opportunity that you are offered. Starting wage is decent, but wages are stagnant. You will be given impossible goals to meet. Do not be fooled by all of the best place to work awards. If employees do not give perfect scores, they spend the next year in coaching sessions to figure out how they can improve."
bad,You are just  a number.  There is no quick advancement. The volume of claims at times can be overwhelming.  They offer 3 days work from home which is nice.
bad,"Gave no performance reviews. I worked part time, while others I started with were full time, but I was expected to catch on just as quickly. Was never talked to about performance issues. Some of this may have been because I was a contractor and not a regular employee,"
bad,Pay was so little and the work flow was great. Alot of favoritism with the lady who had been there the longest.  She was so rude after a while. Couldn't ask for an extra day off without pay.
bad,Extremely poor management that included lack of leadership. Only negative comments were ever given and nothing positive was provided to help you improve.
bad,Company is very customer focused.  Very top down management style.  Time tracking for lower level employees and computer monitoring of time spent in computer applications.
bad,No opportunity for personal and professional growth. This is all i care to share about the company and/or its management style. The culture leaves much to be desired.
bad,The best part of this job was that I was able to earn my personal insurance sales license. The workplace culture sometimes demonstrated old values of sales cultures. The managers were friendly but not particularly adept at coaching. A typical day at work involved being on the phone for 7 1/2 -8 hours selling insurance policies. I was disappointed to have been laid off.
bad,Company is imploding.  Been here 12 years.  Time to leave.  Good leadership left while the getting was good.  Company continues to lay off with no end in sight.
bad,"Nationwide is a good place to start your career, however, as you grow, your pay will not keep up even promotions will be low-balled in pay.  Management does not provide clear paths to promotions and will regularly change the ""targets"" once you meet the previous targets."
bad,"There are MANY great people who work at the Corp HQ. Unfortunately, Home Office politics are openly acknowledged and overshadow individual results, opportunities, and engagement general departments, such as HR and Marketing. Common practice for people to make tremendous effort to either align with and constantly declare executive sponsorship to protect their job or they stay off the radar to stay employed. Golden Handcuffs is a common term."
bad,good training very detailed. Employees with more time in would tend to get better/am hours.  I worked the commercial side of the business and that can be very lucrative selling insurance but not always in customer service (pay was ok but not great for what I had to do).
bad,"Managed claims daily and also had to do the managers job as well as she couldn't do it herself. Very poor senior management , they did not care about adjusters work load or issues.  "
bad,The personnel in our department changed constantly. I was there for 5 years and had at least 6 department heads as bosses. The team itself was great fun and very enthusiastic. Most of them had been there far longer then I .
bad,Nationwide seems to have lost its footing.  At one time they were a good company with work/life balance and good leadership.  Some departments are better then others
bad,A good company to start out with. I unfortunately happened to choose a department which later was relocated to Ohio a year after I was hired. I was unable to find another job within the company.
bad,"They do not care about their employees, they will drop them like a hot potato if they are having a bad year, they will downsize at employees expense in a heart beat"
bad,"Gave this Company 25 years and moved my family 3 times when they continually downsized my office.  I was always proud to work at Nationwide and put many extra hours in every week. Last two years there, my health began to fail and I had to use FML A too many times and they pushed me out. Made up performance issues that they couldn't prove, HR was useless. Had to get out to preserve my dignity and protect my livelihood. Saw this happen to many older workers during my career but was naive enough to believe they wouldn't do it to me. I should've sued them but was glad To find a job where I was valued.  Shame on you NW - I believed in you and our mission."
bad,"was not happy with management"
bad,This call center shut down. They closed the call center shortly after letting go my training class. The doors were never reopened. It was an okay job for the short time I was able to work there...
bad,It is a small business of 5 employees so you get to know each other well but there is not a lot of opportunity for growth and salary increase. There is not a lot of information about the direction of the company and/or agency that is disseminated to the employees.
bad,With company a short time.  I was not impressed with the job/leadership of the particular unit I was in.  Company closed unit after a year and a half.
bad,The lines are always very busy and there is never a dull moment. The co workers are very helpful and kind. You are always kept very busy and your job is not usually in jeopardy.
bad,Easy going customers.  Weak Leader ship at Manger level. Happy to be there but have constant blockers to getting my customer base served in the best way possible.
bad,"Handling a large amount of inbound calls, with micro management in place."
bad,This company I thought was a good company.  Had a supervisor that disappeared a lot but yet if you went to the ladies room and took 3 min in there then she docked you 3 minutes on your next break!  Worked at the San Antonio location left there to work for USAA a much better company by far!
bad,This was not the job for me but I remain there because jobs were hard to find. I did learn a lot about car insurance. The job wasn't hard at all.
bad,company moved to ohio. was not moving to ohio. did not know anything about homeowners insurance.
bad,"After they completely changed management the company was negatively impacted. The new management is completely ignorant to the job functions of the employees. They do not understand nor care to understand the job functions of the people who are ""below them"". However they feel they are qualified to put restrictions and limitations on job functions that they do not comprehend. The company completely neglects the employees with experience in favor of the cheaper salary new hires. It has become standard practice to eliminated employees shortly before retirement, eliminating their access to benefits earned from 20 - 30 years of servicing their company and customers. This use to be an amazing family friendly company to work for but they are moving away from these values that made them a company people strived to work for."
bad,"I worked at Nationwide for 5 1/2 years when I decided to leave. There is way too much confusion here and no consistency. Every day you are given something new to say in your calls and required to hit all points. They try to make it pratically impossible to do every part of your job well and set you up for failure. The supervisors are clueless but their not the only ones. The trainers and QA's no very little, managers don't know silch, so you have to teach yourself with the materials your given. If your looking for job advancement be prepared to do a lot of sucking up because its not based on performance. Being in Retention your required to take overflow sales calls, make outbound calls to current customers as well as now handling customer service work. Instead of incoming calls from customers that would normally go to service they now go to Retention. The VP's decided to take the licenses away from service agents to save money and send all the calls to Retention and bombard us, another tactic to keep us from making our sales goals. The health insurance stinks but overall pay is decent. If you don't mind taking call after call and having someone incompetent always breathing down your neck, then this is the place for you. Not to mention the strict schedule you have to adhere to. Be prepared to be stuck in a confined area with a headset for 8 hours a day staring at two monitors. Only relief is when your next break or lunch is."
bad,This company has outrageous expectations and a bonus plan that is virtually impossible to achieve unless you lie to customers to write policies. The management is not helpful to new employees and the new employee training lacks much in the way of preparing you for the job.
bad,"As long as you are in with the right crowd, you'll get far. You keep to yourself and don't post any negativity about them on social media, you'll be fine. But if you mention one bad thing to anyone there, you're blacklisted for life, no matter how good your stats are."
bad,Lots of corporate red tape and not enough focus on agents and customers.  Compensation is not competitive and no concern by executive leaders when high attrition occurs.
bad,People want to get in your business a lot. Management may seem nice to you but can completely lie to you. The culture was if you are in a clique then it cool. I'm more of an introverted person so the culture kind of soured on me.
bad,"I was not told the full responsibilities of the role when hired. I was told this was a basic entry level position, only taking incoming calls to either change address on policy holder info or update other information pertaining to policy holder information. Not so, we literally had to learn every rule and regulation for every state that Nationwide serviced, in a very short time frame, and not only that we had to pass assessments at 100% in order to get thru training to get to production. Very high stress level in training let alone anything else. There are a lot of moving parts in this industry and that is great if I know up front what I am getting into. I can mentally be prepared or I can decline it. I did not have that option because I was not told the truth about what this position entailed. I think this is possibly a great company if I were a licensed agent, and after this training I felt like I wasn't far from that, but again , not so."
bad,Company is changing and going away from customer service to technology and making customer and third party vendors to all the leg work for the customer.
bad,All about money and don’t care about employees anymore.  It is losing quality employees by either eliminating there positions or not giving employees job security and turning to technology when it is still a people business.
bad,I enjoyed leading people and making sure the needs of our customers were being met.  I've learned to lead people through change and the impact my reactions can have.  Nationwide was a fun place to work and there were always programs going on to show employees were appreciated.
bad,"At present the management is making severe cutbacks in the number of employees, even though they maintain the company is healthy.  There is this constant threat of job loss, and there no longer seems to be any loyalty toward employees."
bad,A lot of change is happening at Nationwide. A lot of job cuts in our training and quality departments. This is causing concern as these departments help associates with their own career.
bad,Favortism.  Leads manipulated and provided to perferred employees.  Rules and commission schedule on a daily basis. Mandatory Saturday schedule.  Good weeks and then the leads would cold and old.
bad,"Passive aggressive and disinterested management, massive amount of turnover of both legal and support staff, corporate culture in which everyone is merely a cog in the system with a number, but decent pay and benefits with set hours, at least for support staff."
bad,"I wish this company put the effort into making itself a great place to work rather than into just saying that it's a great place to work. "
bad,"This varies, but my manager was not invested in the work I do. So I felt that my efforts are not well-placed or appreciated. I have met and worked with other leadership personnel who are quite the opposite."
bad,Due to the job freeze there where no advancement in the company. Must know how to multitask. Learning about liability in car accidents. Training will be given by company.
bad,IT is too expensive and slow.  Lack of transparency in IT Senior Leadership.  Too much change going on at one time with no clear picture of the end game.
bad,"I would answer incoming phone calls, take messages for one agent office; file documents, make copies, fax out going documents, open mail and post any payments."
bad,It started off as a very good company but recently the culture has completely changed due to budget cuts within the company. Do not enjoy my job as much as I used to due to supervisors and management shift of attitude towards making profit for the company and neglecting the needs of their employees.
bad,"Look to Become my own agent eventually, Upward mobility within the company does  not seem likely. Looking for better training used most of what I learned from State Farm for selling"
bad,Company was a bank that is no longer in business. Banking company that wasn't organized
bad,"Long"
bad,"Probably a great place to work if your supervisor likes you, if not, they can make your life a living hell."
bad,I was recruited to come to work for a company that was merging with nationwide.  All promises for bonus and benefits went out the window with the merger.  I have worked for several major carrier over the course of my career.  This by far the worst.  Leadership is so caught up in philosophy that they have entirely forgotten who put them where they are today as a company.  I can legitimately make those comment as I am a leader here.  But will be gone as soon as I can jump ship.
bad,Nationwide Insurance/The Brad Sizemore Agency was a very hostile environment in which to work. Co workers eemed bothered when asked a question. It was a very toxic and gossipy place of employment. I am happy to no longer be in that environment.
bad,"Grossly understaffed. Managers are good, but their hands are tied on many issues. They present the issues to upper level, but aren’t being heard, so therefore, we were not heard. Not near enough people to handle the workload, but if you don’t get it done based on best claims practices, you get in trouble. Not unusual to work 12-16-hour days. Salary was never increased to compensate for all the extra hours. Extremely high stress. They’ve lost a lot of great, talented people because nobody in the upper levels seem to care."
bad,"Excellent work/life balance afforded through their time-off/benefits packages. Communication is lacking, the company is so large that decisions are often made and not communicated to affected parties. A typical day in the service side of the company varies as every service employee is hired with a 'other job duties assigned' part of employment."
bad,The senior level management team is disorganized.  There is not a clear plan.  Data analytics are scarce and what you can get is not usually that reliable.
bad,"When new management came in, the culture of ""the employee first"" shifted to ""the customer first"" and it's been frustrating ever since. It's all money motivated. You walk on eggshells and can't actually speak to any of the higher-ups in a truthful manner."
bad,"Very high volume, fast paced, company downsized, the company consistently made less people do the same amount of work and although they preached work/life balance, it was not attainable"
bad,Alternative work environment and flexible work hours is a positive aspect when available.  The company is currently downsizing and eliminating 1100 jobs company wide.
bad,Once the company started closing different departments they started firing employees for everything. They would put you on a verbal for one thing but move it to a written for something else. There is no room for error. They tell you it's not about your numbers but it is all about your numbers and quality
bad,"Cat (Catastrophe) Duty = 7 days/week 12 minimum hours/day and it is mandatory.  Between 8/1/2017 - 7/31/2018, 9 of 12 months were Cat-Duty.  If you work 330+ days out of 365, how do you clean your house?  Walk you dog?  See your family/friends?  How do you live, if you have NO work-life balance? "
bad,"a basic job at an insurance company , but they are bad about closing and office and letting people go. Need to keep the people in there jobs in the state they  service"
bad,"With world class benefits and amenities, this may be an outstanding place to build a career for some, but to the apprised, just another corporate machine where there are too many moving parts for real synergy, sociopaths are not only venerated but groomed, and group think is substituted for collaboration."
bad,I enjoyed working for this company until they started to eliminating jobs. I worked there for13 years and enjoyed the people I worked with. I worked as a training coordinator. and then moved to Admin assistant and then office manager.
bad,"I could not get behind the do anything for a sale mentality. They are not always, as they say, on your side. I left as soon as I could."
bad,"Compensation was good, job security was bad as was management.  However, this was back in 1997 and I am not aware of how they are today"
bad,Nationwide has solid values however they are not followed by many.
bad,Regular management turnover. Lack of decision making process. Highly concerned about political correctness/image. Not nearly as much concern for customers or employees from upper management.
bad,It should be no secret by now that NW pays the top sales performers well in the form of bonus pay. There is little chance at advancement and if you are making too much they will let you go in favor of finding a few temps to make up your sales for cheap.
bad,"Use to be a great place to work, but things have really changed a lot of the employees are on pins and needles about there jobs."
bad,"task driven, organized, very good interacting with people, passionate, motivated, driven, loyal. I've worked for 2 companies over the 20 years."
bad,A good company if you are productive and can keep your numbers up.  If you are young and quick and are computer savvy this is the company for you.  Management favors the employees that produce the best.
bad,"I haven't worked at Nationwide since 2014; however, they have gone through mergers and layoffs since then and I have heard that things only deteriorated more since I left."
bad,"Supervisor was very poor, not very thorough in letting new employee know how to enter time off, nor updated employee how much time off available. Supervisor did not keep accurate record of employees type of time off. Not enough time to allow for restroom breaks - if sick stomach and use time during early hours, cannot use restroom for evening hours. Unrealistic expectations of talking to long to customers, yet wants employee to engage with customers."
bad,Okay company to work. Not a whole lot growth opportunities. Slow-moving projects. Bureaucracy at its best. Has good learning environment. Tuition benefits.
bad,Had a great manager but beyond immediate manager seems company downsizing is starting to take its toll on all. Seems like outsourcing is the new rage.
bad,"*Assisting business partners with complex questions"
bad,Took calls from agents to assist with software issues or issues with insurance policies.
bad,Nationwide is what you make it. If you want to be a great adjuster you must put in alot of early mornings and late nights. The expectations are  near impossible and the company is very understaffed
bad,"Some days were more productive than others. The days that were productive, there were a lot of customers that were served and the days that weren't productive, there were a lot of customers. It was during this time it was a lot of downtime."
bad,Nationwide was a great company to start my personal lines insurance knowledge with. Good Management and a wonderful staff of people who can be wonderful friends who can be helpful with knowledge.
bad,Great benefits and opportunity to make a good living. Have to work insane hours to achieve it and compensate for company cuts in commission structure.
bad,Rules were made up as they went along. The management would some what make up the rules as they went along and not everyone would follow therefore causing much resentment.
bad,"Expectations keep changing, very rigid schedule, management is usually friendly."
bad,My responsibilites here included making phone calls only to current commercial policy customers to renew policies.
bad,"Good work culture with work life balance.   "
bad,do not care to comment.  My manager at Nationwide was not very fair and proved to be fake in his assessment of my work.  Too many reviews of my work without directly speaking with me.  Faker
bad,"Company is expense driven and focuses on the bottom line to maintain financial stability and growth in this ever changing industry and market place, which should help to maintain their financial rating."
bad,Unmanageable workloads and unrealistic expectations.  The culture has changed over the years.  You are treated  just like a number rather than an individual.  There is always the worry that you may lose your job.
bad,"Stable employment, standard insurance company benefits. Limited career advancement opportunites. Income reasonable and comparable  standard for industry."
bad,"There's not too much I remember about this job. Many of the folks who worked there didn't converse as much, at least not with me. This was a job I worked while college before transitioning to another employer who offered more hours."
bad,"As a claims adjuster it was very fast paced always moving always something to do. If you don't take your work home with you it can be a lot of fun, but very sink or swim."
bad,"I was able to work from home-a plus. There was a culture that your job was all important and you were expected to answer a new claim any time day or night. There was an ongoing software rollout/difficulty that made daily work much mach more difficult and tedious than necessary."
bad,I prefer not to review my experience with Nationwide publicly. The only thing I can say is that I worked with a good team of associates and the company offered excellent pay rate.
bad,Great place to work. Creates the opportunity to build a strong knowledge base of health insurance beyond what is taught in class.
bad,Very disorganized at times and poor management in total loss department.  Very friendly environment.  I worked with Nationwide for 5 years and had 5 managers during that time.  Management is not good and very poor training.
bad,"When I started with Nationwide Insurance, you were treated like family.  These days it looks like they are trying to run people off  that have any tenure."
bad,natiowndie is a great company it self but the hours suck they hate changing your schedule even when you tell the great circumstances. micro managers make the job more difficult
bad,"nice project"
bad,"In order to succeed in this field, you must be able to sell! Selling is your way to victory in this career."
bad,"Although this agent is a Nationwide agent, the practices of the daily work routine were unethical.  The agent did not care for the safety and well being of his employees, as long as they sold with no commission and very little pay.  I was required to work overtime with no pay, only comp time accrued as straight time, not time and a half.  This is not true for all Nationwide agents, as I very much like the Nationwide product.  This agent was just looking out for his bottom line in which I made him thousands in commission every month with no commission for my hard work."
bad,I prefer not to comment but the site requires it. I would not trust majority of the leadership and there seems to not be much stability and trust any longer with this company. It is a shame as it used to be a wonderful place to work.
bad,You're working for a company that is in the business for the long-run!
bad,"The management team doens't look out for their employees. The supervisors are very hands on and single minded. They do not allow for individual learning, everything has to be done the way they want it done. There is no support or assistance. If you want to learn something or move up, you have to fight tooth and nail for those opportunities."
bad,not a good place to work if you have young children and have to be off for school meetings or if your children get sick.  You can only go to the bathroom on your break.  Anytime you need to go to the bathroom you have to take time off the minutes they give you for a break which is 15 minutes.
bad,"It's a solid, stable company that has a lot of very long-term employees. Unfortunately, the culture is one of ""process over progress"" -- there is enormous inertia and a culture that is geared towards ""doing tasks"" rather than ""producing results."""
bad,"Management does not show or explain how to request time off, which causes unknowingly unscheduled absences! For call center work- expectations are be friendly & nice and get the job done YET do not stay on the phone too long. Their own version of google for their company,  which in some areas provides alot of information HOWEVER its so much information that you have to read quickly and then relate the information to customer etc, and do this in as little time as possible! If you're having a bad day with stomach issues,  you better not go into work bc you're given 40 minutes for a 12 hour shift, that is your 2 breaks and restroom visit, and if you're on a late shift the cafeteria is closed, so not convenient unless you're in management basically.  If your supervisor likes you, you can pretty much take any time off, visit and socialize,  yet if you stick to yourself and dont really speak to anyone there will be no leniency at all."
bad,"If you enjoy being treated rudely by other departments who don't do their work and act like jerks,  this is the place for you.  There are no consequences for bad behavior at Nationwide.  "
bad,"Proficiently balanced ledger accounts for national plan accounts with Nationwide"
bad,I do not leave jobs very often or easily. I loved my last job and am looking for one similar to it that will get me excited about getting up in the morning again. I have been laid off from other jobs that I have thoroughly enjoyed and would still be in those same positions if I hadn't been downsized. I work very hard but it is vital that I be in a pleasant work atmosphere.
good,More work less pay. No respect of persons. Management.....AWFUL!!!  They give you a title but other responsibilities because they have a revolving door and cannot maintain employees.
good,"I had no benefits, no time off and my commission was terrible. I think independent agents look at employees as disposable people. They are not concerned about you or what you need to get anywhere in life."
good,Nationwide is transitioning into an independent agency and it is up to the owners to accomplish this. My agent was wishy washy and no new business was coming in.
good,Nationwide bought Insurance Co that I worked at then they slowly dissolved all positions and closed our office.  low pay high turnover corporate snakes
good,Under other circumstance I know that there are better agencies to work for. My private agency did little for their employees as far as compensation.
good,"never paid on time, pay is being cut with out warning. Head agent is never in office."
good,"I worked for an agent that owned his office. You work for the owner-not the company. Low pay. No where to go. "
good,"I was really excited to work here when I got the job, but now the culture of the business has changed, I drown in work and it doesn't seem like anyone cares."
good,The benefits offered suck. They dont work with you for schedule changes. Don't ever get sick because they will try to boot you out. Management does not communicate changes and expects you to understand changes without explanation.
good,"Not a bad job, work/ life balance was not the best. I was a high risk pregnancy and wasn’t able to get time off because of me being there 9 months and not a year"
good,"If you are not in the in... you are not in... Upper management is always trying to CYA, and do not care about yours.  if you keep your head down, and do not ever have an issue you should be fine.. but even after 15yrs of work, they still lay you off."
good,"However, the person I worked for.  Was not motivated & didn't how to be an agency owner. She had no idea how to train employees and give them advice or ideas to further their career. That being said, the sales manager was even worst. He gave no advice on how to promote our agency or even any suggestions to gain growth for the agency. He only care about him hitting his bonuses. Nationwide the company itself was great. I suggest to anyone not to work for an agency. Bottom line they don't care about you. They just want fresh meat to gained more customers and then toss you to the river."
good,I really enjoyed working with the customers. I found that spending an extra five minutes explaining things to them to help them understand their policy made a significant difference. It helped me stay ahead of my competitors but it also made me feel good to know that I could help them.
good,Ridiculous! They do not support you to find a new position within the company when placed on an unassigned status.
good,"The upper management moves you around as they see fit.  If you have a family, do not seek a manager position. You will be moved often to wherever they want multiple times and for nominal pay. Any small issue arises, do not expect upper management to support you!! Be sure to always provide evidence of your decisions and defend them regardless of upper management."
good,I’ve been away from Nationwide for almost 3 years now.  Their turn over rate is deplorable.  It’s a swinging door environment where entry level is brought in and given the promise of career progression but delivery of the promise is more of a lottery of selection from ‘yes’ men/women that seem better fit to secure the higher ups own job security.  Ex-employees call the facade ‘drinking the kool-aid’.
good,"Working for Nationwide is a satisfying career choice, when you have a good agent to work with. Nationwide is a large organization, with many opportunities to advance. I would have stayed longer and pursued my license, if the opportunity at my next employer had not presented itself to me. The best part of working at Nationwide, was helping the customers find the appropriate policies to maximize their protection of the insured options. Whether it was home or auto, life or health, it was satisfying to know at the end of the day, I'd helped someone find what they needed."
good,I would not work here again.  Not because of the job itself but because of the management.  You have supervisors who play favorites and spread other peoples business to everyone.  You have supervisors who let their favorites get away with everything.  Supervisors are constantly micromanaging everyone and everything you do.
good,"at the time, Nationwide was a major employer in the area - I left because my hours continued to be cut and I found full time employment elsewhere. The company has since ceased all operations in Lynchburg, VA"
good,Company lacks advancement for growing employees looking to grow within the company over time. Managers and Higher up's are never sure of the company's direction.
good,"Management knew that my husband was in the military and would constantly ask me when he was being moved to a different location, if I would be joining him, where were we being relocated to. Nationwide made me feel as though my husband serving our country was interfering with their business and I was no welcome to work there since they were not certain when my husband and I would have to move or even if we would have to move."
good,"I don’t find Bationwide to be competitive with compensation in the Des Moines area. Also I work in a smaller dept and time off is hard to come by as it is seniority and quality based and even after 2 years here I can’t get time off most days. Nationwide will tell you many times you’re not just a number, but every week my supervisor was forcing me to come up with numbers related goals. Management micromanaged like no other company I’ve ever seen and really just made it so I was never excited to be at work. I will say I know people with other supervisors even within my own dept and they love Nationwide. But if you get a bad manager you’re basically screwed."
good,"Just a certain group of people have advantage over others in information technology department.  If you are not one of these people (H1B) visa holders, you are in trouble."
good,"A typical day as a Field Claims Specialist consisted of interacting with customers and auto body shop owners. The hardest part of the job was trying to please three different parties (management, the customers and body shop owners)  who all had completely separate interests from each other.  All the while you needed to get consistently high survey results from customers who would hold it against you and give you bad ratings if you where honest and valued/conditioned their cars honestly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people and having them show their appreciation to you."
good,"Working nonstop for below average pay, no room for advancement, & management that does not support or empower you. The benefits are nice but you work like a dog and barely have a life outside of work. You're stressed out 90% of the time and management will find new ways to add on the stress."
good,"My first admin job i must say was great learning expirience I worked for a man that has great worak ethic, hard working and willing to teach me the ropes I started fileing and then graduated to actually being a customer service rep for our customers it is a agency in falls church va as well which had a huge variety in culture which i love, "
good,"A days work at my agency consists of inbound calls and outbound calls.  Processing member requests, policy endorsements.  Meeting personal and agency sales goals.  Claims service and handling, general office administration and management.  Accounts payable and recievable."
good,You need to always be on your toes.   Changes occur every minute.
good,a typical includes processing agent changes on policies. I have learned most of the insurance buisness as far as processing policies
good,I enjoyed the work environment. The managers were friendly and helpful. Training staff was amazing with an extensive paid training programs to ensure new employees are ready to take on most situations.
good,"Stressful, depends on management.  Going through a layoff.  Quit job to go back to school.  Call center work and office work is not for me.  Highly stressed, listening to calls, constantly grading and degrading you."
good,"I had one of the best managers and one of the worst due to reorgs.  Sad to say the worst one pushed me out.  I will not tolerate being bullied.  with that said, HR did not intervene on my behalf which was a shame."
good,Great corporate training and continuing education available. Commissions were fair but could have been better. Little opportunity to become an agen owner
good,"I was with  Nationwide for 20 years.  I enjoyed my time there until about five years ago. Leadership has already selected who to promote and if you are not on that list, it will not happen.  There is also a blame game where leadership will serve you up if you identify issues with processes."
good,"Typical work day starts out with 31 voicemails from overnight calls, constant phone calls with no relief, lack of ability to take regular breaks or lunch do to volume, more work than is manageable, and regularly working without pay to keep up and not create a ""performance issue"". Used to be certain departments were this way, now the whole company is trending in such a fashion. The pay is not competitive, and you are a number not a person. Profitability is key, and they have adopted the Wells Fargo approach of terminating longer associates that make more to bring in lower paid newer associates. Cycle creates more work on seasoned people as new hires need trained, if their position is back-filled at all."
good,"Nationwide seems doomed to never learn from it's shortcomings and repeatedly makes the same mistakes. Rather than retain talented sales staff, management fails to adapt and enforces leadership to enforce ill placed guidelines. Ultimately forcing out talented employees or leading to the termination of employees for failing to adapt. After months of enforcing bad and inappropriate business decisions, management makes the appropriate changes. Unfortunately too little, too late."
good,The cubicle walls will listen and talk... be careful of your so called work friends whom will stab you in the back the first chance they get.  Do you like being micro managed?
good,The company as a whole is ok to work for. Management and the way management is trained needs to be re-evaluated and the current people leaders in place need to be replaced. Trial division is not given as much attention as claims and that needs to be addressed.
good,"I like my job and the people I work with.  I would like to be promoted, however do not think that will happen.  The culture is diverse and the people fair and I get along very well."
good,Good stable company but limited opportunities to advance in your career. I can think of worse places to work. If you are OK with limited growth and diversity then you will fit in great.
good,I loved my job as an Administrative Assistant and all the duties that I fulfilled on a day to day bases. I loved all of my co-workers. Management was very poor. The most enjoyable part of this job was greeting the customers with a smiling face and making them feel at home!
good,There is a very fast paced work environment overall. A positive for this company is that it is highly customer oriented.
good,"Very competitive enviornment.  Employees compete for positions and performance recognition so not always collaborative.  In support areas deadlines created to drive performance often creating unrealistic expectations for teams.  This leads to ridiculous timeline expectations to support perception of leaders being good at driving results.  Travel expectations aren't respectful for employees.  Last minute travel over holidays and weekends.  Some areas and leaders are supportive of work/life balance.  Some leaders that are ambitious about their own careers drive their teams and don't support their personal committments.  Professional image is important.  Leaders may have expectations for their teams that are significantly above the guidelines to create higher standards and prove they are ""tough"" leaders and their teams are better (more professional) than other teams.  Tougher leader/higher standards/reputation of being difficult to work for  = perception of being a better leader"
good,"Adapted and adjusted to the 'Nationwide Culture' reorganization"
good,"Management, spoke of wanting change and if change would not happen would need to get rid of those not willing to change however this was not conducive to a change enviroment."
good,"CSRs have access to many tools to assist in providing outstanding customer service.  Some of these will have to sought out in order to take advantage of them, as they are not part of general instruction.  I found it easy to balance customer and company needs whenever it was within my power to do so.  As with any large company, bad management is currently rotting the company's culture.  The hope is that, with most things being cyclical, an eventual influx of new blood will turn it around.  One bad Supervisor with a willing HR department taught me, much to my disappointment, how corrupted the system had become.  Hated to leave.  I LOVED getting to ACTUALLY help people on a constant basis."
good,"I worked in a call center for 7 1/2 years. In the beginning Management, moral, atmosphere was pleasant. there was employee interaction. As time went by, all that ended. Management changed for the worst. It became brutal. In my opinion stay clear."
good,"Very busy with un-needed computer logs, which wasted a lot of time."
good,"Use to be a very good company to work for. Just within the past 6 months to a year the company has went downhill. The moral of the employees is low but you wouldn't be able to tell that because you have to play there game to keep your job. They have qc and productivity stats that you have to meet otherwise you go on coaching and then improvement and after that your out the door. They want you to meet stats but also want you involved in there little commitees that they have. And, on top of that you have weekly team meetings and weekly one on ones which you have to come up with a plan to work on every week. You also have to do Ci projects every year which can be from 2 to 4 projects depending on when you had Ci training. If the supervisor's dont like you they will find a way for you to leave. The coworkers are great. The benefits were good. However, working your butt off gets you no where except more work and the raises are not the greatest. After awhile the whole thing wears on a person and there health. Maybe that is why they have had so many people leaving or people that are just waiting until next year to retire. All in all this place is a joke to work for. They have no idea what they are doing."
good,Good job  too much PC reliability and pass the buck  to tires 2 worryabout call time than solving the issues! Tires 2 can take up to 48 hours to fix! Not fair to the customer!
good,"still company is functioning with so many methodology's , its in transaction face , it will take time for the organization to get in to proper agile scrum framework."
good,Multiple associate with high quality relocated and are now being forced out of jobs. It is sad to see others treated unfairly. They say they value people but if they did they would not be cutting the jobs that they are.
good,"Understanding that business is forever changing they were on the same page as what they wanted to do with their employees. The amount of work at the time compared to the pay was subpar....... actually I heard one employee say it was ""really poor"" and this is from a tenured employee (5 years +)."
good,Very stressful work environment in large loss unit. Lots of travel and lots of employee turnover. Job expectations were difficult to meet. Claims management micromanaged employees.
good,The office manager herself was cool. But the one i ended up under turned into to a massive control and demanding things be done a certain way even though I was taught differently.
good,Laying off IT professionals as applications move to cloud.  This is hard on morale.  There is no chance to be promoted.  Most IT staff is worried about their jobs.
good,"I worked in the Claims Call Center assisting with first notice of loss and basic claims inquiry.  On the best days you get people who need your help and you can provide it to your callers.  On the worst days you're reduced to be tactical ablative armor for the claims adjusters who can't be reached or don't return phone calls to people who have already filed claims."
good,"A typical day at work is hectic with meetings and trying to work between the meetings and the noise in the open workspace. My coworkers are fantastic, but leadership leaves a lot to be desired."
good,It was for an independent agent who sisnr want me to help customers finalize their claim or research and make calls.  All he wanted was payments and changes on policy coverage.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you're interested in the insurance business. A lot of changes lately and not much advancement within the company at this time."
good,"I was fired over leaving for bereavement when a young family member passed away. I was gone for a half day and provided a funeral itinerary but was called a liar. Instead of telling HR she was wrong over times and for telling me to go home, the manager threw me under the bus."
good,The company does not hire enough people for the position and expects those that are there to handle all of the claims without providing overtime. They are always looking to cut costs.
good,"Pros:"
good,It's a decent place to work. Wished there was more opportunity for growth and advancement. Starting to allow more work from home. Co-workers are friendly. Wish we had better systems to complete our work. There is flexibility is some positions.
good,"I originally set out to have my own office, after 2 years, no desire to be owner, so went into an agency and became more like co-partner. Company went through changes, not for the best."
good,Used to be a very good company to work for but culture has changed so much within the company.  So many changes have gone through- they're still very strong with training .  Staffing quality has declined over the past years.
good,Agent Programs change frequently leaving agents uncertain. They could use more sales training and  a different program for those who never had a sales position before.
good,"This is a great place to work as your first job out of college. There  really is no work , life balance."
good,My experience with Nationwide Insurance was good. Great place to work with opportunity to grow. It was a rewarding job if you put the time and effort into it.
good,"The employees good, overall upper management horrible and uncaring to associates needs. No confidentiality between managers and associates, OAR did not help associates"
good,I have worked here for several years. They do not reward employees for their loyalty. People hired off the street make more than an internal promotion. Management is all about themselves and do not care about employees. Lots of turn over in the Orange County office.
good,If you're not management or higher they treat you like a number. Would not recommend to anyone. Even as a start up job. No room for advancement or much of a raise.
good,Nationwide needs to focus on compensating its employees rather than cutting corners. They are cutting positions and forcing untenable workloads on their employees. Also bonus percentages are pennies compared to other companies.
good,"Typical day is being tethered to a phone for 8 hours, having to use your breaks to use the restroom.  If you are out of breaks you are out of luck.  There is no work/life balance.  They don't care that you have a family; it's all about money for this company."
good,"I.T. critically underfunded, and critically lacking in onsite leadership.  Existing systems are obsolete and yet the mother ship in Columbus will not fund overhaul or replacement - turnover will continue to be high."
good,* Culture is more to do with playing politics than working.  There are peers that would rather play politics and being a favorite of management than to do their job.
good,"Each office is owned by an independent contractor.  Depending on the contractor and their aggressiveness in the field depends on fast you can grow the book of business. If your agent is comfortable in the zone they are in then the growth is not there, and you commission is likely to suffer.  No benefits or sick time."
good,"Call it truth in advertising -- Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company has offices throughout the US. The company is a leading US property/casualty insurer that also provides life insurance and retirement products through its Nationwide Financial Services subsidiary. Its property/casualty products range from general personal and commercial coverage to such specialty lines as professional liability, workers' compensation, agricultural insurance and loss-control, pet insurance, and other coverage. The company sells its products and provides services through ALLIED Group, Nationwide Agribusiness Insurance, GatesMcDonald, Scottsdale Insurance, and other subsidiaries."
good,"great benefits, horrible management, if you have no college degree you could not advance in any position. Poor management, no training to help you move up. Cap outs ."
good,"I worked for Nationwide for over 3 years, participated in several internships and activities that were alleged to help me build my career but after years of biting and clawing, I was in exactly the same place I started. Management leaves much to be desired; micro-managing and negative reinforcement were rampant causing department morale to plummet. I tried on several occasions to apply out to other positions in the company but was denied and told that I had to master my current job before I could leave; regardless of how miserable it made me and what was clearly not a good fit. The service departments use a time-stamping system which is an absolute nightmare and nearly impossible to perfect."
good,If a manager didn't like you they would find sneaky ways to undermine you.  Never an opportunity to prove yourself even though the manager was a very poor trainer
good,"advancement is determined on who you know. I don't know what else to say since I'm being forced to write this review when I really do not want to, thank you!"
good,Challenging but also nice to know that every day us different. Good team spirit and managers are involved. its a great place to enter the claims world
good,"Trying to learn all the different parts of the auto insurance was different in every case. Answering questions clients may have regarding their policy and taking payments. When the policy was coming to renewal, I would let the customer know ways of saving on polices they may qualify for."
good,Inconsistant management style. The call center is a seperate company from Nationwide due to the AVP leadership. Once you are in am leadership position in the department he will not let you leave.
good,"The small teams are very close to each other. "
good,Busy assisting agents and other departments with policy changes
good,"working for the insurance company was a lot more demanding than I thought,  But employer was great."
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers , existing and new business to attain a policy for their life on all levels, from home, auto, life and business polices. "
good,I do not wish to review this employer. I had a very difficult time coordinating child care with the schedules they would change every 3 months. When I asked for an accommodation for shift bids due to my child care limitations they refused to work with me.
good,"Good company with a good culture, that has struggled in the past few years specifically with regards to the Claims organization.  Heavy use of favoritism and office politics in the place of actual performance results.  Increasing volume of receipts and work load without added manpower to absorb the increase.  Top notch QA standards compared to the industry, however, expectations borderline unrealistic against the volume expected to manage.  Claims manager level leadership is actually exceptional and do a good job of navigating teams through shifting priorities and goals of upper leadership.  GREAT several years ago, but plenty of room for improvement in current state."
good,"Conduct on-scene investigations by examining the damaged vehicle, interviewing the witnesses and participants, and collecting evidence."
good,I was with the company for over 24 years. Had great management unit last year.  Great co-workers.  I loved my job as I enjoy working with insured's helping them put their lives back together after a loss. Can't wait to start a new venture for the next 24 years.
good,"The cause for which VPI  stands is admirable because the premise is pet health. There are a lot of great people that work for VPI and the business is run like a family owned company. "
good,"Nationwide is a great company. I did not enjoy customer service, however they have other departments in the company that you can work your way into. I didn't like the micro-management approach they took with employees. Every week your supervisor(who doesn't do the job you do or doesn't have experience in your job) conducts a side-by-side and gives you advice.(Really?) I also was not a fan of how one would have to kiss.... to get a raise or other employment opportunities."
good,"initially I was hired as a temp, then converted to permanent. The training was good, team interaction was good."
good,"Compay is difficult to move around in, and advancement opportunities are few and far between."
good,"On Fridays everyone was more relaxed and work seems to flow. Management I don't agree with some of the things they do, for instance when you have down size don't let go the employees that have been there for years. Hardest part when the computers crash can't do anything about it."
good,"Process incoming and outgoing calls regarding policy changes, premium payments, verification of coverage, premium quotes, request for copy of policy, etc.."
good,"Overall, from the standpoint of benefits and pay, Nationwide provided decent compensation & excellent benefits for the roles I undertook. And I was lucky enough to have some very competent and caring leadership most of my time with the company. I learned a great deal, and was actually being trained for Six Sigma prior to the announcement of pending layoffs. And, once the fear of layoff is established within a company, it loses a lot of its engagement culture, and morale dips. One should never be forced into a situation where he or she has to apply for nearly every available job posting to secure their future with the company. Sales positions were cut, retention positions within sales were cut, PLSC positions were cut, and property claims intake positions were eliminated, as were field claims roles - these all included leadership positions as well. Shift differential was removed, licensing was sacrificed, and demotions offered with acknowledgement that no raises would happen the ensuing year or two. This does not promote a positive atmosphere. During my time, I was blackballed by a department whose leader was ""friends"" with my worst supervisor - a supervisor with whom I talked to for a total of maybe 30 minutes in 10 months! I simply asked why I wasn't chosen for an interview for a position within that department based upon my qualifications, and what I could do to insure an interview next time -  the response was that the manager of that department felt I believed I was ""entitled"" to such a position, and that I'd never obtain such a role with that ""attitude."" In nearly five"
good,"Not much room for personal growth. Call center, Other departments offered 4 10 hr shifts and work from home options. Open for all holidays and claims regularly has mandatory overtime."
good,I was an independent contractor. I didn't have a great inside perspective. Nationwide like any big company has their plus and minuses. I didn't appreciate there uncommitted philosophy to the agent force.
good,There have been so many reorgs and layoffs over the past 2 years that the environment is based in fear. It's shame because it didn't used to be like that even as recent as 2015.
good,Reorganized (laid-off) twice within 2 years.  Nationwide benefits are awesome! There is such pride in the culture.  There is no job security for leadership nor down-line.
good,I do not wish to write a review of my last company.  Thank you for making write into this comment the 150 characters minimum without giving me a choice to skip this question.
good,Busy work environment dealing with servicing current clients as well as working with prospective clients to write new business. Light involvement in claims consulting with the client on their losses. Micro-management from supervisors. Has potential to be an excellent place to work if management would make some changes.
good,"company is so large and uses old and new technologies together and makes for unproductive workday.  Legal Department is ripe for a Lean/process improvement overhaul, but, impossible due to politics, size and ""leadership"""
good,"Was required to work most of year on extended hours.  12hr days 7 days a week. Compensation for the amount of hours is not fair. There is room for advancement, however high turnover."
good,"I was in quality for the commercial call center.  The supervisors created an us versus them situation between the reps and us, so instead of coaching and making them better, we played the part of the bad guy so that the supervisors didn't need to do their job."
good,"Nationwide is undergoing big changes , the people at the top are not communicating with the workers as to why and what is happening , it is just the goal for 2025 to be number 1. On one month we are told that our positions are safe and then the next month we are being laid off, we are not being told. Is there a purchase of another company coming ?"
good,"Salary is not competitive with other major carriers.  Systems are not efficient, a lot of duplicative in work.  Should spend more money on compatible systems"
good,"The job atmosphere is awesome, however they are stuck in the stone age when it comes to handling their techs. They attempt to hire within but its usually easier to come in from the outside and move up. There are no advancements in the IT department and the employees are severely underpaid. The CEO is against WFH which is the new trend in our fields and the company doesn't seem to care much about job advancement opportunities."
good,"If you’re not with the cool kids, you are out potentially looking for work. I have seen hard working people loose their jobs while the socialites with less output get to keep theirs. Normal office environment but maybe twice as bad as a normal corporate job."
good,"Positions are being eliminated and will continue to be for the unforeseeable future. I have enjoyed working at Nationwide and hope to make it past the next round of layoffs but I'm already looking elsewhere. Do not count on long term job security as employees who have been with Nationwide for 10, 20 or 30 years are now finding themselves out of work."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at NW, but unfortunatly the last few years our healthcare benefits have gone down the toilet. I would take a pay cut to find a job with better health insurance."
good,"I didn't mind the job itself, I loved the office job was it wasn't really fun working with certain people here. There was no time off, and the boss was rude at times."
good,You are well compensated for a repetitive and grating job. Many managers have lost touch with what it is like to interact with customers on the phone. Very little advancement is available to get any position that is off the phones once you start there. Managers are very reluctant to support a role change even if your numbers and quality assessments are acceptable within the business unit.
good,Confliction with following policy. Trying to be 100% in adherence with the companies policy is difficult. Customer satisfaction is not always the goal.
good,Area is now gone that employed me.  Was a decent experience and learned useful insurance knowledge.  Promoting from within was big even if people were unqualified.
good,"Strong training program but difficult position in a call center environment. Would be much better if reps could become more centralized in one state versus multiple. Too much to learn and retain and available ""bible"" of information is difficult to navigate. Management was nice but not always available to assist, so good customer service to caller was difficult most of the time. Of the maybe 15 people I started in training with, only 2 or 3 stayed in the position and company."
good,Owner was great but was growing the business so he kept most of the profits to himself which is understandable.  I worked there for three years and left to find other opportunities where I could make a better living.
good,"The culture in the heldesk is very controlled, employees are babysat. We were not allowed to make outbound calls (even when you lost connection with the person you were helping), which I felt was very unprofessional."
good,Work load and work life balance creates a daily challenge. Nationwide is a well respected company in the industry.  Due to growth and downsizing of covered territories claims loads have increased.
good,closed the department I was working in after promising out jobs were secure. Lack of communication from upper management to the floor. The department felt unwanted.
good,"Being an office manager was a great experience until I had to become an agent.  Once I became an agent, the owner withheld my commissions by covering it up in math calculations he knew I would not understand."
good,"Unfortunately, company has been re organizing departments and procedures for years, and the  day to day objective of customer service and claim handling has been reduced substantially."
good,"Most difficult is understanding a lot of information in a short period of time, and then applying it in sales."
good,"Overall the operation was run successfully. I would have liked a more genuine approach to self develop and provided more opportunity to advance in my career. I felt overall that the operation was built on a more ""its who you know"" rather than the performance of the associate and the passion one would display."
good,"Process 2nd to 3rd day transactions for customer service reps"
good,"Just like any large corporation you take the good with the bad. If you have a supportive manager you can learn and grow and be promoted into new and better opportunities. Conversely if you are under someone who isn't supportive then you can find yourself stuck. Hiring managers have a tendency to only look at your current position as opposed to your complete resume/past experiences, which can limit growth if you take a lower position to 'get your foot in the door'. 14 years ago I feel like there was a much greater employee engagement than today. The last 7 years there have been layoffs, reorgs and a continuous tightening of the budget (LEAN) that creates tension among staff. Managers have to fight to give positive reviews because they are guided by matrices rather than honest feedback. It's not all bad and I learned a lot during my time there, I'm just disappointed in how my last couple years there played out."
good,"Nationwide is generally a large employer with ample resources and the stability and bureaucracy of a company that's been around for decades.  That being said, the enterprise varies dramatically within individual departments.  Some are smaller, lack resources, and offer more of an entrepreneurial feel, while others are behemoths with loads of politics and bureaucracy.  Fortunately most are somewhere in between.  Don't rock the boat and you'll be fine."
good,"A typical day would consist of calling on delinquent accounts in attempt to collect a payment"
good,"Performance is measured based on productivity.  With reduced timings, it is becoming more difficult to make production.  Leadership seems to promote based on friendships and not knowledge.  The culture has changed from a ""we have fun at work"" environment to one that is cut throat, make a mistake, your out the door.  Have built some great relationships while being employed here."
good,"Answer phones and take customer payments when they come in to pay  phone bill, power bill and insurance. filing, mailing out letters, updating customer information on computer, took claim photos for agents, providing customer service."
good,"Great training"
good,"I did all of the day to day operations of the office.  I was a licensed insurance agent.  I did quotes in person and by phone, all aspects of customer service.  I also did daily banking reconciliation and daily deposits."
good,"The company has a good message overall."
good,Rewarding job but over the past few months the turn over rate has increased so the case loads have increased per specialist.  Customers are not getting the customer service they need due to the overwhelming claims coming in everyday.  It is very enjoyable to help someone through the difficult process and being able to give them the attention and time needed but it is getting harder and harder to do that with so many staff leaving.  I have learned to prioritize and give my best to each customer treating each person as they are the only ones I have to talk to that day.
good,Nationwide is a good company to work for to gain experience.
good,No work life balance.Hours are long management is ok but can be better. Not enough people to handle the workload.There are areas of the company where you can find success.
good,The position I was working was third shift support role. Either there is a lot going on or nothing. The shift is twelve hours long so if you got work that kept you busy it was good. But the nights nothing was going on it was a slog. Typical work is monitoring server alerts and playing phone operator (Tier one support). Most server alerts are high CPU/memory usage. Answer sit on the ticket till the work load was done. Not correct the monitoring alert throwing the false positive. So if you are fresh out of school this is a good place to learn the basic.
good,"Although the compensation, and benefits are good, there is an undefined underwriting appetite, struggling with company culture and employee engagement, lacking standard work, inconsistent expectations, high attrition rate, unbalanced workload that drives unfavorable work quality ."
good,"For many years this was a great company to work for.  Supportive, encouraging, and team oriented.  Recent upper management choices have lead to many lay offs unfortunately, and it's an us vs. them environment related to management.  They encourage an environment of accountability until it comes to leadership, then you better just politely agree and do as you are told without pointing out any alternative solutions, or new ideas or you will be an outcast, and eventually eliminated."
good,Overall great company to work for and their motto “ we have fun at work”! this was a true statement. The training was awesome and it really was valuable to your job.
good,I enjoyed working with my supervisor and all the other employees there. I like how they show appreciation to their associates with group activities. Only thing is that there’s no guarantee to get hired on.
good,Nationwide used to be a great company to work for.  Lately they have lost their way and no longer offer the career development opportunites they once did.
good,"Out of 13 years working there only 3 or 4 were good.  Management wasn't very supportive.  "
good,"stressful environment/ not a lot of opportunity for growth,/ the company struggles to provide a work life balance.  this company struggles to create a fun productive environment"
good,Workers get worked hard but slackers continue to slack.  I was out on medical for 6 months and came back to 6 months worth of reports.  I was a very hard worker and handled several projects and wore many hats.
good,Good experience but no loyalty to people. Reorganization is constant and prior years performance are not considered.  Work from home is positive and a strong selling point to stay.
good,I did not trust my superiors. My supervisor was incompetent and arrogant. He played favorites and insulted those he did not liked or respected. He was the reason I left.
good,"Insurance positions range from claims, underwriting, sales to administrative to marketing.  Each entity had it strong points and bad points. Claims completely overworks the staff. People burn out fast. Underwriting should be a great position but was turned into more of a call center atmosphere with ineffective training, making it a high stress position as well.  "
good,this is a great job for an entry level employee. the pay is fair as long as you don't have any children or a home to tend to. the management does not have a open door policy and is hard to communicate with.
good,"Despite having a small army of highly paid strategy associates, Nationwide has too many top managers who do not agree on what they want Nationwide to be when it grows up.  As such, they go from pole to pole on profitability vs growth, selling direct to customers vs sticking with agents.  They are about to flip all Exclusive agents to Independent agents in 2019 (after having cut their renewal commissions by 1/3 in 2017).  Existing Independent carriers are going to eat those book for lunch and Nationwide will continue shrinking, unfortunately."
good,"Call center management can either be great, offering lots of opportunity for advancement and company recognition, or your supervisor doesn't pay attention to employee progress/advancement and does not suggest or help you work towards promotions/moving jobs in another area of NW. My supervisor offered to ""help"" me by reviewing my resume, the changes suggested actually hurt me, as the suggestions were to be brief, use less detail, and entirely remove my education and references. Management can be poor, and its nearly impossible to get a schedule change to work day hours if you work evenings, and is especially hard to get weekend days off - even if you request it 7+ months in advance. Call center manager shrugs off employee concerns, and if you request a meeting with them they will pencil you in but made you wait weeks to hear your concerns. And once in the meeting they will ask you questions, then interrupt you mid-response and change the subject. They just genuinely don't care about employee concerns or complaints, especially when it comes to upper management.  Evening supervisors are more ""could care less""  than day supervisors. "
good,"It's a fast paced cut throat environment which is praised as being premium 1st class none can do better. ""Best practices"" are enforced 9on some teams while other teams are encouraged to ""do whatever is takes"" approach which rides the line of ehtical vs illegal in the eyes of the department of insurance. Getting paid off policies sold is a joke. Processing is THE MOST UNTRANSPARENT thing I've ever seen in any corporate environment its nuts. I'm so surprised someone hasn't sued them over processing and getting paid on time it's laughable. ""Top of the funnel leads"" were given to ""top reps"" yet you were NEVER permitted to listen to their calls or shadow them. Supervisors were instructed to say all leads are given equally to all agents... The VP of Sales, the AVP or sales for P&C admitted otherwise. But yet this is an Equal Opportunity Employer whom gives everyone a chance to make the same pay. 90% or the sales floor is averaging 40k sold for the month while a few ""Top Agents"" have sold 80-90k so far... And they say it's by consistentcy but yet won't let you do and side by sides with them. Smelling fishy yet? Agents are encourage to give high deductibles for home and autos first chance. I'm talking 5-10k deductibles on home. And customers have no clue the impact this would make. Personal Health issues of employees is gossiped between supervisors and managers. Last time I checked this was against the law yet HR does nothing. HR and managers are are personal terms which makes bringing matters up very uncomfortable and almost impossible due to retaliation. Over 1100 Lay offs just occurred"
good,Always felt like the company had a finger in my back pushing me to get more money out of our clients.  People at the top have no clue and have never sold insurance or anything else for that matter.
good,Very stable and progressive insurance company. Nationwide Insurance Company has innovated the insurance industry with their accelerating strategies and sound procedures.
good,A workplace that purports to care about its customer base.  Company prides itself on fast-paced change to accommodate a competitive and changing marketplace.
good,The pay is adequate. The call center is a different environment than the company. Getting out of the call center is difficult as far as excelling to another department.
good,"I liked working here, but they are eliminating jobs and not replacing them. They used to have a really good workplace culture, but since they started LEAN Management and started worry more about number than actual people, the culture has gone down quite a bit. Nobody likes working here anymore."
good,"I worked for an independant agent for 7 1/2 years. They did not offer any benefits outside of paid time off. There were seldom wage increases, and it's tough to be single and live on a low wage salary."
good,Working in the field in claims was extremely stressful with no opportunity for a healthy work life balance. It is all about the numbers and bottom line with no true incentive for employees
good,"Was not liking the high school drama! Everyone, including the boss was more worried about going and getting drinks on Friday night instead of being professional."
good,"There is the possibility to gain a lot of experience in the claims department, however, work/life balance is not acceptable. Adjuster's are salaried and expected to work well over 40 hours a week."
good,It's too bad changes needed to be made.  Room for advancement was difficult but I learned so much working here for 14+ years.  Supervisors are amazing.
good,"Nationwide is a good company to work for, depending on the position you hold. The sales department i was in shut down a year after i started working there."
good,I haven't worked for Nationwide since 2013. The job was very demanding and they had unrealistic expectations of their associates. I wouldn't work there again
good,facilities is poorly run compared to the rest of the company. my job was eliminated due to the proposal of selling the data centers. no provision for assisting with another position within company
good,"Leadership is clueless regarding certain industries, particularly in banking!  As a result, the bank closed but I'm sure the leadership will live on within the company! Nationwide is on their side!"
good,The company is shrinking at a rapid rate.  Multiple departments are making cuts and they are not currently hiring many positions.  They are starting to outsource certain claims jobs to other companies.
good,"A Typical day at work consist of fast paced, multi tasking , deadline driving environment. This can be good and bad depending on your view. Good place to gain experience, network with important people. The management in IT are statistic/ data driven mangers who expect deadlines and work be to completed on time. Hardest part of the job comes from trying to make everyone happy. Most enjoyable part of the job is the experience you gain from working in an Enterprise company."
good,"Nationwide's main focus is its members.  To that end its employees receive the training and tools necessary to excel in customer service. I rate management as I did because they will no advocate on behalf of their subordinates.  I made less that any other adjuster at the Senior Level with the company. Despite my request for a salary review, from supervisor up to avp, no one was willing to have this addressed. The CAT DUTY pay was 25.00/hour but you had to work 5 days of 12 hour shifts or you got nothing. PS - CAT DUTY was mandatory!"
good,"stressful  work from 8-6pm generally as a salary individual to keep from getting backed up as they continue to slash jobs."
good,"I am rating an agency, not the company. The agent was difficult at best."
good,"Good compensation. Can lose job at any moment if management decides on workforce reduction, regardless of documented, positive job performance. Will cite ""operation efficiency"" when cutting job so friends can be placed in your position. Sad but 100% true."
good,Very good culture but will be blindsided with layoffs if the managing staff aren't aware of the goals of the company. Its difficult to get direct answers when addressed directly although this a very meeting oriented company.
good,"This was a great company to work for, however the management was poor. The owner was not too great so it made it hard to work there. But overall Natiowide is a great company"
good,"The workload is unrealistic and expectations for time management are unmanageable. The culture and teamwork is a strong focus, but staffing is a huge issue."
good,"The Nationwide Material Damage claims department is heavily focused on providing top rated customer service to its customers, both policy holders and third-party claimants."
good,"My duties were to prevent and eliminate injuries and illness to employees. Assist companies and clients to comply with safety regulations. "
good,"A typical day at work was good, had a lot to learn with no training. I had to learn by myself. Management was great she did what she could to make me comfortable while i earned what i needed to do. the hardest part of the job was the owner. He wanted me to make him money and he didn't care if i had family emergency or not. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I actually liked what I had to do, which was make calls and file things etc."
good,"Title says it all. The company has a great backbone and great values, however the leadership team from managers on up don't care about the people, but rather themselves. People don't leave companies, they leave"
good,I enjoyed my time at Nationwide Network although it was just a short post (Temporary Position ) However I did enjoy my time there and gained some experience in the car insurance industry .
good,"The vast majority of callers are negative in general. The focus of leadership is stats driven, which makes you feel more like a number than a person. There is rarely time between calls, which results in very limited interaction with peers. When the above is added together, the overall result is low morale and high turnover. However the company does seem to care about their employees and is relatively accommodating to individual needs. There is a gym on site, Starbucks, cafeteria, and a gift shop with decent items for very affordable prices."
good,"There is no work/life balance.  However, the best co-workers you will find in any job.  Managers, Directors and VP are clueless and have very high expectations of what can be done.  And a tornado or hurricane with more workload.  Very good on the front end of the claim, but no allowance for follow through."
good,"I learned how to have excellent communication skills- also great customer service. These things helped sales be effortless, because it came natural."
good,Most of the managers were very supportive and the coworkers were awesome. However the work load was tremendous and the training was awful. The computer system was so bad employee spent most f their time in putting duplicate information into several different systems. The work itself was very rewarding.
good,I'm neutral on working here both before the 2008 economic turn it was a great place to work after that well lets say more improvement on learning to value their employees.
good,Strong focus on engagement and values.  Low stress data processing responsibilities.  Constant changes in work processes.
good,"A typical day of work includes taking calls for policy holders, claimants, agents, lawyers and medical providers."
good,Consistently delivered high value testing solutions for Corporate Internet and Contact centers QA teams.  Improved the quality of delivery and consistency in both water fall and agile deliver environments.
good,"Pleasant work environment. management take over was not very successful. New owner was less informed, and not as valued."
good,"Work shift consit of being on the phone, good training. Team moral building. Some of the phone calls where for fatal accidents."
good,"Typically will take 40-60 calls per day from policy holders, agents and business partners."
good,Retention with employee's was some what not a long term. Fun place to work. I learn a lot in managing employees. We always tried to ease work load and divided between all employees. To make such work is completed before end of day.
good,Given a lot of trust over the years. But lost touch with associates and the challenges we face daily.
good,"Good schedule, the company really strives to treat their employees well. Good people work at the company at all levels."
good,When I started at Nationwide I was told I would have to close 65 claims a month. After cutbacks and re structure I was closing between 120 and 130 claims a month and suffered a heart attach.
good,"Great program, lacking manager direction."
good,NW is a great company to work for if you value good work/life balance. If you leave the company for advancement in your career in hopes of returning for the job that you could not get while there - you will face the following challenges:
good,"They had a lot of contests for empolyees to play. Nationwide Bucks you could win and redeem for company logo items. Yearly Picnic, White Elphant Christmas Party, Talent Show, Cook book contest. If you pulled a Holiday shift they would set up a picnic dinner."
good,Nationwide is a good company to work for in some regards but there are several things that could be improved within the company to make the work experience much better.
good,"Great company to work for, Excellent hours. I enjoyed the team building skills that I learned here."
good,"This office is now closed. The management was great when I started. Unfortunately, the managing attorney became fed up and quit. The new managing attorney was incompetent. My co-workers were always very competent, quality, and helpful people and I enjoyed working with them. I also enjoyed working with the adjusters."
good,A great company but unfortunately some poor leadership and some workplace bullying. Some managers need retraining on ADA rules and reasonable accommodations in regard to an employee with disabilities.
good,I have enjoyed many years with Nationwide. A change is something my world needs. I look forward in finding out how other companies drive. I can’t wait to become a part of something new.
good,I worked for an independent agent that was located close to home.It suited me fine during that time of my life. I was able to raise my children and start my career.
good,The Sscurity Officer job at Natiowide is a boring job with little advancement opportunities.  The pay is good and also the time off. Not much to do on the job.
good,"It could be a good job for some, I enjoyed the company and culture in the beginning but if you are one who speaks when things aren’t as they could or should be things may change for you."
good,"Overall corporate culture is positive.  Home office corporate culture doesn't always track all the way to the other offices in the company (i.e., flexible work schedules, remote capabilities, advancement opportunities without relocating to another city).  Insurance benefits are competitive but could be improved (lower premiums/deductibles) since the company is self-insured."
good,It is a stressful job. Many policy holders and some agents do not understand how the policy works or what it actually covers. Claims adjusters try to help people as best we can but we have to follow what the policy says.
good,All you do and they just want more more more...longggg days in office..feel like you work your life away..go home eat go to bed and get up and do it all over again!  Great money to be made but you have no life..
good,the job itself was ok a lot of work that needed to be done in a short amount of time but the structure was great and pushes you to get licenses to really write auto and property policies.
good,"The job required a large amount of overtime to complete.  It was difficult, if not impossible, to balance work with home life when you often worked well into the evening hours.  My immediate manager was an experienced and knowledgeable individual who applied a large dose of common sense when approaching business."
good,"I used to love to go to work at Nationwide.  Nationwide used to be a friendly, fun and relaxed place to work. The employees were family and you were proud to be a part of the family. Now the pressure and unrealistic demands are placed on employees and morale is at an all time low."
good,Nationwide has good benefits if you have the time to use them. They promote work/home life balance but it is not possible with the work load. Also tend to find that they do not do a good job of hiring managers. Too many times the manager does not have experience in that field or came from outside and many times they are micro managers.
good,"I have enjoyed working for Nationwide for the past 25 years.  I had a lot of flexibility and freedom to set my own schedule.  I enjoyed time in the field and in the office.  Due to recent layoffs, my current job will be eliminated on April 15th."
good,Stable environment in a changing industry. There is an evolution in the industry that they are preparing to be ahead of with a strong emphasis on advancing.
good,I liked working at Nationwide at first but when new management took over it became one of the worst experiences ever. You always felt like a target was on your back. We worked for the substandard auto which was an acquired company. Maybe they treat their actual employees better.
good,"I worked there about one year and moved on to other company. The application was old and not well maintained. No consideration of efficiency or performance of code I was seeing. They hire a lot contractors, which is not good for company who want to keep a quality system since for contractor you leave after like 6 months. Anyways at the end of day it is not a tech company, so not much you can expect. I guess it is a good company if you are doing business roles. If you are into tech, please reconsider before you join because you will not learn too much, it’s kinda waste of time."
good,"work life balance is good. but the compensation is not ."
good,Nationwide is experiencing a culture shift as they transition from an exclusive agent distribution system to independent agents. Not exactly sure why they're laying off 1100 people.
good,"Same expectations, same schedule, no room for advancement "
good,"If you are ok with being overworked, having more responsibilities and receiving no compensation for your efforts, then this is the job for you. The managers will be the to micro manage your work, and disguise it as coaching and feedback."
good,"I believe it can be difficult for older workers (e.g., over 40) to receive continued career advancement even if they are still interested in pursing it."
good,OK Place to work.  Management does need to get out of their offices and see what is actually happening in the trenches.  This will make them better managers.
good,Call center environment with lots of micromanagement. I would not recommend this job unless you like working every weekend with non standard business hours.
good,I left because my manager was not following through on our development plan that we discussed when I transferred to his team. Also the claims environment did not have much of a career path.
good,I enjoyed working for my father’s company selling insurance until he retired and the business was bought out immediately and employees were also immediately replaced.
good,The compensation is solid but their is no true job growth opportunities unless you move to the corporate HQ. The job is highly regulated with a high work load it can certainly be overwhelming. Always having managers and supervisors looking over your shoulder and upper management changing work flows can get tiring quickly.
good,"When I was their lead FileNet engineer, It was just Scottsdale Insurance at the time and we were able to make our own decisions and own goals. I was able to deliver on every key project that was given when we were given a certain timeline. Management then was very helpful! Our culture before Nationwide took over was amazing! I learned so much daily and was constantly excited to keep performing to help meet our goals. Everyone helped each other. "
good,I have worked here for 3 years and taken a multitude of classes. I have been unable to find a new position. Nationwide claims to be one big family that boasts moving up people from within but they fail to do just that.
good,I as under the impression that there would be great opportunity for growth with the company. That is not true. The employees are underpaid as well. The system they use for paid time off is not the best. Requesting holidays off is a lottery system. There is job security at Nationwide but not enough perks and means to live comfortably off of.
good,"Big enough you can change departments and even careers internally, but watch out for the lay off axe. Profit sharing available. Reasonable benefits. Top heavy organization. IT is pretty bureaucratic. Inbred culture which rewards playing nice rather than voicing unpleasant realities."
good,Great direct report manager
good,OK place to work as a second income not good for a primary bread winner.  Lots of cliques and favoritism. Will move you laterally to keep you at the same pay rate.
good,"I learn many things, I have experience with desk office, Cashier, Cutting grass, phone call, customers service. I enjoy helping others and finish my task on time. I also like to make sure the environment is clean. etc"
good,Manager changed often - never had the same one for more than a year. Coworkers are great. Workload was high and customers were difficult. Management would not have your back and instead always took the customer's side on things. Benefits are pricey and provide poor coverage - nothing that makes them stand out against other employers.
good,"I loved everything about this company except that it has a history of abruptly restructuring with what I feel are questionable reasons.  You will not see it coming.   Worst of all is that you will not be told that your job is being considered for restructuring/elimination.   This is not based simply on the fact I was let go recently.  As a 19 year employee with the company that included management experience I have seen it happen so frequently as to question the company's commitment to talent and their employees.  Generically they say the right things bit there truly is no vested interest in you as a person.  Additionally, I feel Nationwide is not a benefits leader but an also ran.  They will do their very best to be middle of the pack in their benefits packages.  They do not have the vision or passion for their employees that you see in many companies owned by younger owners."
good,Will fill this out later. I'm not here to review my current company as that is irrelevant to my needs at this time....................................
good,"Good place to work with very poor leadership in a lot of areas. Nepotism in a huge issue as well. Benefits are good, but could be better. Some metrics are almost impossible to obtain regularly."
good,I don't have an opinion about anything about this company either good nor bad life is what you make if and if you don't like it change it. Have a good day.
good,"There's the type RCA for Incidents"
good,Go into the office and make cold calls to customers to try and solicit them to purchase insurance. Go out and market your product to potential customers.
good,when I first started it was an excellent place to work but when a company becomes more focused on money rather than the customer and it's employees it creates a problem no one wants to deal with
good,Advancement at times seems out of reach and individuals that are promoted have very little skills in those areas. Focused on who can sell the most and not who has the skills
good,"Overall it's a good company, but job security has been questionable in the last few years. The culture is professional and ethics are valued.  The pay is fair and the facilities are very good."
good,Not bad company to work for the Personal Lines department is quite stressful to work for.  Management is always changing no supervisor or position is safe someone is always leaving.
good,"work/life balance is good, and my team is really awesome to work together. I already got the offer from NW, but I declined it because of their really low compensation and HR teams attitude. The HR teams are so rude and mean. I felt discrimination from the HR during the negotiation flow. If you are not caring about money, NW is really good option for you. If not, I want to recommend you to find another opportunity."
good,Nationwide Insurance was your typical call center entry level position. I was a lead specialist so a typical day for me would be to log in and start calling leads to transfer to an agent. I learned more about insurance than I had known before. Nationwide Management was fair though I did not have much experience dealing with higher Management. The hardest part of the job was finding leads to call due to shortages. I enjoyed working for Nationwide because they really cared about their employees.
good,Good associates there who work hard but the company and each department seems to be reorganizing constantly. It's not unusual for a department to be re-organized at least once every two years. They could be much more focused and profitable if they would simply go in one direction and stay the course for a while rather than keeping associates off balance and concerned about their jobs on a regular basis.
good,I loved the environment of working in the office. Requirements and guidelines quickly changed when they shut down the call center and had us working from home.
good,"Typical workday consist of indexing insurance policies to make sure that the policy holder information matches policy number. I am also cross trained to scan documents into server to be indexed out, as well as maintaining proper retention schedules to make sure documents never backed up."
good,Over awesome place to work but advancement and management needs a lot of work.  Poor recognition of talents and promote low preforming individuals over those that deserve it.
good,"Processing internet quotes was fun."
good,"Nationwide is currently going thru a period of consolidation of business units, restructuring and many people are in flux.  A great period of uncertainty.  The people of Nationwide are wonderful and for the most part the culture is very enjoyable. Anytime there is this must change there is unrest and Nationwide is no exception."
good,Found it difficult to manage high workload. Management would not approve of overtime necessary to perform job duties and set very unreasonable expectations.
good,"I would file mail into envelopes and then pull out the envelopes to take to the back and put them into the postage machine.  Very goal oriented company and the best part of the whole job, was the associates I worked with."
good,"I believe Nationwide is a solid company and will do anything to help their customers.  The branch I worked at did not feel the same way about their employees (the branch has since closed).  I had worked for better managers that did not micromanage and encourage us to think outside the box.  The compensation was ok, but I think they felt insurance adjusters could be replaced consistently but still expected high performance with employees constantly coming and going."
good,"Ensure servers (all platforms) are status Green in Production and development environment. Process daily work requests."
good,"This may not be the norm in other agencies, but our agency is constantly changing. This could be attributed to growth or a lack of good management. The most rewarding aspect of my job is the team that I work with. We are truly like a family. The hardest part of my job is meeting goals that are unrealistically set. However, I do enjoy building lasting relationships and growing a loyal customer base!"
good,"sat as expert in RN practice, in mediation & other ADR processes.  taught large groups of medical, and non medical persons on numerous medical topics and conditions common to insurance claims; provided professional opinions to data in claims process, feedback to agents with medical claims in their files."
good,"I was a consultant through UNICON and work life balance was good."
good,I had a wonderful supervisor to work for. I had two small children and was a single mother at that time and was able to work with my work schedule to do things with my children.
good,Ability to advance is all in who you know or are willing to kiss up to.
good,"I believe that Nationwide can be a great company, if it would only place true value on it's employees."
good,"The company had a great work-life balance and employee benefits and I wanted to retire from there, but IT layoffs were frequent in the satellite offices as jobs were consolidated to the corporate headquarters in Columbus and management changed. Corporate culture became focused on trendy soft skills, such as avoiding the use of certain conjunctions, which was unusual."
good,"The company had a great work-life balance and employee benefits, but layoffs were frequent in the satellite offices as jobs were consolidated to the corporate headquarters in Columbus. Jobs in this company in the Cleveland area would be a good place to stay for a little while, but not to count on retiring from."
good,"Great place to interact with people, if you love ever changing faced paced environments ..this is the place to be."
good,job atmosphere is friendly and easy going. Co-workers and management are great.
good,"Working at Nationwide definitely has it's ups and downs. I enjoy what I do and the people I work with but there is a struggle with work/life balance. The benefits regarding 401k match, bonuses and healthcare costs seem to be lacking compared to similar large companies in the area. Vacation time seems to be on par, to slightly better, than the vast majority of companies."
good,"A professional place to work. It could get a bit boring at times, but there is always something new to learn and improved. It is harder to advance within the company."
good,I had a great supervisor. I was exceptional at my job. I learned that being good at my job was not the main or only reason i would be promoted. I wasn't involved with outside of work clubs or groups.
good,"I worked for an independent Nationwide office, so the culture was a bit different from a regular Nationwide office. I enjoyed the people I worked with (customers and coworkers), but the benefits were lacking, as well as opportunities to advance. That's part of why I left."
good,"Overall, a good experience. Unfortunately, forced to either leave or deal with workload and requirements that were not manageable. The company overall was a pleasurable company to work for."
good,"My supervisor was promoted from an armed senior officer to a security supervisor.  Unfortunately he is not  leader.  I gave him a year to start developing the leader within him with negative results,  He was not firm, fair or consistent.  He played favorites and did not take care of issues brought to his attention that affect officer safety."
good,"Premiums are high and notes that are put in for the monthly account needs to be more Agent friendly."
good,"A typical day at work was being on the phone all day making calls to save contracts before they left Nationwide."
good,"Mon through Fri normal hours, Call center environment. Workplace culture is business casual. Very cultural and diverse place to work. Weekly and Monthly meetings"
good,I don't have anything to say it was a temporary position for only 4 months.It was 8 to 4 5 days a week until the employee came back from personal leave
good,"this is my first, and hopefully my last call center job. i thought i could do it but i guess its not for everyone. looking for a new place to work. love the schedule and pay, but the job itself is depressing."
good,"They truly want to do the right thing, but seem to always stumble on getting there. Have become a technology company that is still convinced they are an insurance company."
good,Okay place to work. Big company. Depends on manager. Doing a lot of downsizing. Lots of rules. More interested in process than results. Good benefits!
good,"most agents will leave all the office work to csr's and pay slightly above minimum wage but expect them to do most of the agents job while the agent simply ""networks"" all day long. most will also require you to obtain your license so your able to quote as well, hence doing their job."
good,"Far to many people in management and there is a great lack of communication between management. This makes things very difficult on other staff. Work life balance is not something that's there if you have a field position; Office job, yes to work life balance."
good,The job was far less difficult which from work I had done in the past.  This made it very difficult to stay invested in the work that I was doing there.  The work did not seem very meaningful and I was quickly turned off by the company.
good,There was nothing I can complain about with NationWide I was just ready to move on to another chapter of my life and Nationwide was no longer part of the picture for me.
good,"Change in management  Agent  retired and new owner was not as organized as the original agent  Cut hours,  did not make changes that were  good for the agency"
good,"Nationwide is a stable company but there is ton of politics everywhere. For employees looking for stability, this is a perfect company. Everything was slow."
good,"Typical day at work: 50 - 60 hours a day. Competitive work environment. You will have upwards to 5 - 7 meetings a day. "
good,"Very engaged and cultured company. Many changes happening and departments moving or being eliminated. "
good,Overall experience has been a positive one.  They care about work/life balance.  They are changing the way they now handle claims which is not my preference.
good,Very interactive work culture. Throughout my time at Nationwide I worked in the sales and customer service departments. I very much enjoyed the customer's I worked with daily. The harder the job was the more I enjoyed it.
good,"In the last 2-3 years, the company has been in a downward spiral and it is getting much, much worse.  Major business units are being sold off.  Major layoffs are occurring.  Top leaders are being fired.  Exclusive Agency model is being eliminated.  P&C results were terrible this year.  The company appears to be in decline.  Time will tell."
good,nationwide is relocating to headquarters in Columbus ohio by 2020  and are closing the harlesville pa location without offering relocation positions for local employees
good,"It's a great place to work if you don't mind being passed over for promotion by the beautiful, chosen few.  Talent doesn't help you rise, talking a good game, and being able to deftly shift blame do."
good,"I work 6am to 2:30 pm Monday - Friday with very few after hours requirements. Bad leadership in the IT department, a lot of technical debt. A lot of people are unqualified for their job and are not held accountable. Flexible schedule and friends are best part of job. Good work/life balance. I've picked up a number of skills."
good,"Working at Nationwide has been a great experience, but there are not a lot of opportunities for contractors to become permanent associate in HR department after working a lengthy contractor term."
good,"That is the 1st year i came to live in Sacramento, so the job in this company is not a suitable job for me, i stopped after very short time working here, so i think i can not give any comments on this Job as well as on this company."
good,"The company is a good place to work for the most part.  The work/life balance leaves a lot to be desired, but it has good management and the opportunities in the company are plentiful."
good,"I have been involved in job downsizing for the past 4 years and it does not seem to be getting better.  Just had another 350 associates displaced this year and more rounds coming.  People are always wondering ""Is it going to be me this time"".  This makes the engagement of the associate hard."
good,Unable to give an objective comprehensive review because I was not employed there long enough.  Differences of opinion with the branch manager caused me to leave prematurely.
good,Few opportunities for advancement especially now when the focus is expense cutting.  Best part about working at Nationwide is the people.  Mnagement is self absorbed.
good,"each day brought its own challenges and rewards"
good,Great opportunities for advancement from entry level to front line management.  Good culture at front line associate level.  Moving to Agile and Lean.
good,"Good Company, "
good,Good place to work but there is more emphasis on who they can dump responsibility on  and how much procedure they can give you . Your work about 60 % procedural requirements to be able to set up to work a claim . There is so much redtspe to just work a claim ! It seems it’s somebody's job to make up ways to add more work to someone for the sake of just doing it . There is no stream line process the dump all the responsibility on the lower levels .  In this case liability adjusters . They get all the stuff dumped on them . It takes  more time doing and putting what they want in a file than it dies to work a claim . There is nothing simple about any of it . They’d rather set people up to fail so that it will give some one selection hire up a job .  They pay is okay but not the best but not the worst . Would be nice if adjusters were allowed to work the claim rather than send emails and do busy work so you can get to the point of working a claim .
good,"Everyone here is ""nationwide nice"" but everyone here has also worked here for 20+ years. That creates a lot of old processes and stubbornness around updating and innovating. They are trying to change that now but at the same time reduce all expenses. Tough to do both."
good,It was a nice place to work. They offer lots of benefits and have their own cafeteria that serves okay food. They aren't very lienent with missing time.
good,"Call center job, management not supportive, call center employees are lowest tier employees, and are treated as such. Not flexible with schedule, locked in."
good,"It was a descent place to work, I ended up leaving due to maternity leave and due to not passing my test. I was able to work with amazing people and get a better understanding on insurance."
good,Workplace and daily interactions with  cross functional teams allowed me to grow and succeed to future endeavors.  Management was supportive of career growth.
good,"Nationwide is a while stable place to work and have great benefits. break room on every floor, understanding supervisors and set work schedules. Paid vacations and 41k. Great place to work sadly i moved and the distance was to much for me and had to leave."
good,Constantly busy.  Little time off the phone.  Lacked development outside of call center due to call volume and turnover.  Great company of you are sales oriented.
good,"n/a "
good,"I was working for a local agency in Raleigh under a medium-term contract. During my time I learned a lot but overall I found it to be an underpaid, stressful, and overall negative experience. The agents I worked under were great but management was difficult to deal with. If you get your work done there is no limit to how far you can go."
good,"Good compensation and benefits. Very competitive work place, with little flexibility with working schedule. Underwriting became more of a call center environment."
good,"The job itself is stressful due to the nature of the role (call center) QA is the number 1 reason employees are let go. They have so many obstacles when it comes to requirements in my opinion. I understand compliance is important due to certain states regulations however, having ""regulations"" made up from the companies point of view is frustrating. If you enjoy reading scripts all day, then this is the job for you."
good,This was a decent company.  Not very flexible on time off though due to the understaffing and high call volume. The people were cool to work with but can be political at times.
good,"fast work pace"
good,"Coming to work at Nationwide is very fun and relax. While I worked at Nationwide I learned how to do Auto Quotes, Homeowners and Renters insurance Quotes. The crew are very friendly and helpful. There is no hard part of the job. The most that I enjoy working at Nationwide was translating to customers from English to Spanish"
good,Nationwide is a diverse company with multiple areas of business. Recent years have seen a lot of change to update for a changing business environment. Throughout the company there is a large focus on work/life balance
good,"Nationwide Mutual Insurance company is Great to work with as it holds corporate values and culture."
good,"My experience has been okay, however if I would have know what the position was turning into I would not have accepted the job.  Lack of transparency!!"
good,"It's a typical call center environment, with taking accident calls and filing claims. Overall not bad, but constant change, and not enough benefits or pay compared to other competitors."
good,It was ok. Not that great. The preview wants more stuff. Ok it really did stink actually. Worst job ever. Why do you really care about it. it was a lame job at a lame company.
good,Nice place to work for to only was regular in employee The team members was nice lots of place that you could at private area .clean bathroom could see in prizeect
good,"Changes expectations and goals frequently"
good,"I was extrermely disappointed when we found out that our office was closing and the closest office was in Harrisburg, PA. I have not found a job since the office closed and will be running out of unemployment benefits next week."
good,"3 hour phone black to answer and assist agents and our service reps."
good,Great company with excellent benefits.  Training and development is constant and there is a strong focus on customer service skills for all departments.
good,They are laying off a lot of people lately and this is not a safe place to work. Everyone is worried they're going to be cut next. It's a stressful environment.
good,"most boring was repetitiveness, liked the people and culture the most, learning about financial industry, work day included answering phone calls and administering reports"
good,"I will neither confirm or deny what working for Nationwide is like. If you can make it through their interview process and you think you will be a good fit, then by all means. Go to work ! The rating is a 3 to be neutral."
good,The company was a nice place of employment for the many years I was an employee. The company was purchased by another entity and as such the long term employees were laid off.
good,It was a nice place to work for the most part.  I took a shift in the customer service health role and went to customer service vehicle insurance and I saw more advancement opportunities in the health field.
good,I enjoyed my time with Nationwide as an Associated Agent.  The principal was a good guy and always wanted to do the right thing but at times did not follow through.
good,Working for an insurance agency was not a great but not a horrible experience. It is definitely hard working on commission especially when you are new to the business and still learning the ropes. My favorite part was interacting with clients but my least favorite was the instability of my paycheck each month.
good,Friendly co-workers and an overall good company to work for. It can be stressful at times but they provide fun activities to keep the employees engaged.
good,"Nationwide has been experienced a lot of turnover on middle senior management. The company is relatively large, and lack of organization. The availability of internal resource is unaware. No common platform to request work relevant apps."
good,The company is being reorganized and going through a lot of staff eliminations and poor sales results.  In 3-5 years it may be a good company but now it is in such turmoil that it is not a good place to be. It has always been a company filled with nepotism and with current issues a number of employees have gotten positions due to things other than their qualifications
good,Overall good company to work for.  Leadership is a plus and minus. It all depends on the department you work in. Job security is higher than most companies and leadership communication is good.
good,the sales team was run into the ground by management.  other companies are doing well even in the rough environment.  provided poor help to those of us losing our jobs and no empathy
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, your sitting about 8 hours on the phone with policyholders and agents. Sometimes the call volume would be high with little down time."
good,Enjoyed working there. Greeting customers and my co workers were good people. Manager was a good employer. The hardest part of the job was getting laid off and having to say goodbye.
good,The agent I worked for was not very helpful- I am assuming that with the right leadership my experience could have been better. Overall everyone that I met employed with the company was nice
good,There was plenty of opportunity at the Nationwide location where I worked.  At one time advancement through hard work was easy.  That changed as did the corporate structure.
good,Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company downtown location in located in the 1100 and 1200 block of Locust street downtown Des Moines. Personal line and causality licensed insurance sales over the phone.
good,"my recent team lead despite being there for over 20 years was very rude and displayed that daily anytime you asked a question. The supervisor response every time was that she would talk to my team lead but the attitude didn't change til the end of my assignment but it was not much."
good,Typical day includes direct inbound calls servicing customers insurance policies and addressing an concerns the customer may have regarding their policy.
good,I love my management team. The business flow is very inconsistent which often leads to high highs and low lows. I would recommend this job to anyone with construction knowledge.
good,Management/timelines could use a lot of work. Not many advancement opportunities depending on which team you are a part of. Stuck in old software practices.
good,"I worked here for 10 years, splitting my time in two different states.  At first I felt pretty important to the company, but after a while of hearing it said over and over, but not seeing any real actions to back up their talk, it was no longer for me.  The company also reorganized just prior to my leaving, which caused a lot of people to have to relocate or find other work."
good,Good job that was close to home.  A great way to learn about the different types of insurance.  Good pay scale and good people to work with.  Great way to earn more money over the set hourly rate of pay.
good,Handle personal lines sales calls from prospective customers. Coached and mentored new hires. Top performer for 8 years. Assisted others as subject matter expert. Great benefits and working hours.
good,"Take phone calls and service insurance polices, collect premium and quote new policies for prospective clients"
good,This was a highly stressful and competitive place of employment.  The managers and work culture was very difficult.  I learned that working in call centers is not for everyone.
good,"Answered questions from customers via phone and provided customer service."
good,"Great job if you do not mind working to 10 pm and from 8 am."
good,Nationwide Insurance does not care about their agents. They do a lot of things that are unethical and it is not a good place to work.  Their managers are good but the people above them suck.
good,"I work from 8-430 everyday.  However, I am salary so we are required to work anything that comes in during our business hours regardless how late we are here."
good,"Good Company Overall"
good,"Nationwide is a good start up company. Has many benefits to offer, very diverse and culture as well. Good facility and has a cafeteria and starbucks inside the building."
good,"At Nationwide, we work hard to safeguard your investments and help you plan for the future; protecting what matters most to you and your family. That remains true for their employees."
good,I started as a temp/ contract employee after 4 months I was offered a permanent position. The atmosphere is nice the people in the office are fun and helpful. Management could be better  managing and knowledgeable about their job.
good,Excellent culture and a good place to work. The only down fall is that in order to grow within the company you would have to move to Ohio. I would recommend someone to work at Nationwide to start their career in insurance.
good,"It has been nearly 7 years since I last worked at Nationwide, therefore I do not feel that this review is appropriate or fair given how things may have changed."
good,Since the move to the 151 location the company has become more corporate.  More numbers driven and less focused on customer service.  The goal is to get the customer off the phone and rush to the next call.
good,"Has a Very friendly staff ! They keep their customers satisfied !you can call a 24 hr customer service number for any kinds of questions, they have English and Spanish speaking reps available 24 hrs a day!"
good,"Nationwide offers good policies.  I did not care for the work environment, that is not a reflection on Nationwide just the agent owner I worked under."
good,I worked at Nationwide for over 7 years and was only promoted once. I have many years experience in the insurance industry and was a top performer. I never received a negative review. The pay is also not that competitive from my experience.
good,If you just want a job. changes daily. some good some bad. tons of turnover. have to have a degree to advance. rating system for your job changes every 6 months
good,Training for my position as a CSR for this company was one of the most positive working experiences I've ever had. Management was very warm and understanding.
good,There is a real sense of teamwork throughout the company. Management does a nice job of listening and staying in touch with the associates to address any concerns.
good,"A typical day for me is consistent work. It's a fast pace environment and consist of multitasking."
good,The company has diversified since my employment in offering other carriers insurance such as Progressive and Foremost opening other opportunities that would have had to have been referred to other carriers in the past.
good,"I was at Nationwide 2 years, there were in re-organization mode, age discrimination talking place behind close door. Other manage with over 30 years retired to keep from being fired."
good,"busy, productive"
good,"- Opportunity for advancement if you work hard"
good,I learned personal lines property and casualty. I enjoyed the people but the job was more focused on stats then it was helping our customers. Even if you had customer compliments and great reviews if you talked on the phone too long you would get a write up regardless. I felt like they were more focused on that than our customers needs
good,Nationwide is a good company for work life balance and new process implementation. Though this company has limited growth opportunities for people who can deliver but are not good at building network.
good,"its laid back company, job security is good. even for contractors. But if you want to keep up with cutting edge technologies, this is not place for you,"
good,"Mass quantity of overtime is expected. Not enough training, hence the need for overtime. Morale is down. Very skilled area within the company that requires more training"
good,The pay was excellent. Recognition is great. Excellent company to work for. Good hours. Off most holidays. Tools are resources are provided to complete the job effectively
good,"Nationwide offers great benefits and co-workers are wonderful. I work with a very diverse group of people and there is always someone there to help and offer support. "
good,"Overall the company has great potential.  It is going through a re-branding process while merging operations.   Right now they are shedding older staff.    It is difficult to advance unless one has connections.   Management is very ""clubbish"" and it is difficult to break into positions without the backing of upper management leaders.   Supervisors and lower level managers are often not well versed in leadership techniques."
good,"I worked for NW non-standard which means that the insured is a bad driver with a bad record of accidents.  From what I was told by the people who work in standard it is a nice place to work however non-standard is the pits.  If they could  make you work 25 hours a day, they would do so.  The manager of non-standard is trying to get ahead in the company and therefore she drives everyone to work as much as possible so that she looks good by getting more work done with less employees.  DO NOT accept a job at non-standard."
good,Good company to work for. Good atmosphere and people. Close to Highway for commuters. The company likes to promote from within. There is something new to learn every day. Great teamwork among current employees.
good,During my 14 years of employment with this company I saw many changes and quite a bit of growth.  The employees went from feeling like family to feeling like just a number on a spreadsheet.  Unfortunately Nationwide's growth included opening and closing offices all of the country and centralizing and decentralizing different job roles on multiple occasions.  The company downsizes its field employees with each change all while encouraging those same employees to work on personal development.
good,This was a job I held while in high school and some of college. Not a bad job for someone at 17 years old. I am now 25 and would probably never work in a job setting like that
good,"Loading up all of the programs and checking the score card to see were you rank.  I learned how to take home owners and auto claims and call tow truck while the customer is still on the line so we could get help to the customer as soon as we could.  Some of the manager was really good and very helpful, the upper manager always mico managed to make sure that we came back from breaks and lunches.  My co workers were great always caring and always wanting to help out if I needed it.  The hardest part of the job was to try and help a person that called in and started yelling and would not let you get a word in.  The most enjoyable part of the job was co workers and everyone working together."
good,I liked working here...it was like a second family. Everyone worked together to get the work done. sorry to see it close.
good,"Overall Nationwide was a great company to work for.  I learned how to interact with customers on a daily basis, handled confidential documents and retain clients."
good,I worked in a unique setting/situation with a new territory. There was lots of ambiguity with little direction. Could be stressful at times but also rewarding.
good,"I have worked at various client sites in the US, both in the IT and Marketing departments. My greatest learning in all these years is; maintaining a work life balance is as important as work itself. A shift in life's balance can affect work and vice versa. A typical day at work with Nationwide begins with a 15 min head-start where-in you can catch up on previous day's work and prioritize work for the rest of the day. The co-workers here are great to work with. The hardest part of the job is the work itself. The project being new, there is very little planning and understanding of the tasks. Working with Nationwide has been a good experience overall."
good,"Was a contractor at this job.  Not much to go on that would be helpful to anyone applying."
good,My favorite perk is that you are able to bring your pet to work with you on designated days. I find you work a lot better when you have your furry friends with you. I think all places should allow bringing your dog to work!
good,Would receive your claims on a daily basis and was expected to make contact on the same day.  Once you have contacted the client you would set an appointment and go inspect the loss.  Once the loss was inspected you would write the estimate on site and issue payment if it was within your authority.  During my career with Nationwide I learned how to organize my day and to be more proactive on claims.  I often spoke with my co-workers and we would discuss claims.  Management was easy to contact and would help with any issued that would arise.
good,"Go 'above and beyond for their customers'"
good,"I enjoyed learning and experiancing new adventures in this company. Able to build my knowledge of insurance and finacial avenues. Work expectations always varied and was not communicated.  Best offence is a good defence and it expectations were communicated upfront, that makes for a better work day and customer service."
good,"Again through Randstad's association with Nationwide, this was a temporary position given to me by a different management personal who provided higher pay incentive, I worked with Nationwide's Legal and Broker department pulling electronic files for customers who were in need of Legal Action regarding their case files.  If case files were accidents that took place prior to data processing, then I would be required to copy these physical files and prepare them for the Brokers/Agents that were handling the case.  Also prepare another copy for Outside Counsel."
good,"A large variety of different jobs at this large company.  You will probably have an opportunity to work with some really great people and build relationships that turn into very good friendships.  Currently the company is going through some strategic changes, but the management team has a clear direction on where they want to go."
good,Trying to work with a new system they implemented and it runs extremely slow most of the time. In doing so you need to still keep up with all the companies standards in doing your job. What is required isn't a realistic expectation.
good,I wasn't there long enough to review them. I was a part time employee. The agent I agent I work for was a good person. They company seemed okay.
good,"Great work life balance"
good,Enjoy working with supportive associates.  Salary incentives could be better based on other carriers in the area.  Company is very engaged with associates.
good,Nationwide has closed it's doors out here so it is no longer an option for working. Not much opportunity out here anymore and they are now located in a small town in Ohio.
good,A good place to work with good benefits and 401K.  Opportunity to grow and move up.  A lot of associates to interact with.  Management sometimes is not the best.
good,Nationwide bought out Harleysville Insurance group and that is a good thing. But with such an acquisition jobs will be lost. The work environment is decent the pay a little lower than other comparable companies. The health be fits are horrible compared to other insurance companies.
good,Busy insurance service center. Training was put on by experienced insurance professionals. Call volume was heavy most weekdays. Good opportunity for advancement.
good,They company prides itself in being part of the community and promoting within.  There are multiple opportunities to advance within the company and grow both on a personal level as well as a professional level.
good,"I enjoyed being an insurance agent as i got to deal with clients one on one."
good,"A typical day in the office is that I come in at 9am and go over what I need to get done for the day regarding clients, paperwork, calls, etc. and then through out the day deal with walk ins and phone calls that we receive. There are no dull moments. I have learned an incredible amount of information about the insurance field which included getting both my P & C license and my Life & Health license.  My co - workers work with me well and we help each other when needed.  They are positive which helps the environment of the office flow well.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with unsatisfied customers about things that we can not control directly.  When issues come up about certain situations that are out of our hands it is frustrating that the customers are upset with us.  The most enjoyable part of the job is providing coverage for our clients that sincerely appreciate it and know that we truly do care to help them."
good,"•	Interacting with the client to understand their requirement.	"
good,I worked here for 5 years and nothing ever made me not want to come in. It was a nice atmosphere and i really enjoyed my fellow employees . Once again i was in finanace department and learned new functions everyday
good,"Nationwide volume for adjusters is all over the board, sometimes very light, sometimes totally overwhelming. They offer very good CAT pay incentives in times of high volume, but their base pay for adjusters is very low."
good,"	Having around 10 years of IT experience in the implementation of Data Warehousing applications."
good,"The culture of Nationwide is great because they allow for a flexible schedule (depending the position) and your fellow co workers are nice. Your bosses are their for you (depending the boss) and the work is not hard. Its probably like most office jobs where the work can be mind numbingly repetitive. That being said, the only way to get ahead is climb over other people. starting from the bottom you will not be able to move ahead for your first year, after that you will be competing against many people at your level and even in your position for 1 or 2 positions. If you dont get the new position your pay increase is like many financial institutions of max 5% increase. If you do go up or get promoted your only allowed to go up one step at a time. Meaning if you have the skill/talent/ability and/or qualified to be a manager, you would have to become a lead first, then wait a year, then apply for a management position and so on and so forth. So if you take a position and dont like it or hate it or your boss is bad your stuck their for a year or quit. Pay doesnt go up that much and probably 75-85% of people wont see 40K their first 3 years. "
good,"temporary job, taught me how to read blue prints and run cable for phones, internet, & security."
good,A active member of the community.  Very relational culture.
good,Good company to work for but too traditional and slow to adapt new technology.
good,Enjoyed working with the clients.Insurance was not for me but enjoyed the experience.
good,Nationwide has high expectations for a quality work product and like all other companies are attempting to reduce costs and maintain high quality standards.  The company can be demanding of time but they do provide 3-4 weeks of vacation and your vacation time increases as your years of service increases.
good,The Nationwide Call Center has a variety of work schedules to their employees
good,Some managers make this a great others made you dread coming to work.  I worked for both kinds there
good,"The pros of working for Nationwide is the opportunity for advancement,  toast masters,  good health insurance/benefits, good pay."
good,Walker Insurance Group is run by very selfish people. They are money hungry and could care less about the employee.  If you make them rich they are happy but if you don't you will suffer. A typical day at work is you are constantly fussed at by customers and by the owners.
good,I was the Administrative Assistant. I enjoyed my job. I didn't like the manager of the company. He was not helpful and hardly did you ever see him. It was also very hard to communicate with the owner because he never would return calls or emails.
good,Call center environment with strict schedule and statistic goals.
good,Standard Insurance place. Comparatively low wage. Fun co workers when I was there
good,"Each day you receive a block of insurance claims, which you are to verify coverage applies to cover the accident, investigate the claim to determine liability and evaluate the damages presented.  Finally you evaluate and negotiate a settlement to make the claimant whole yet, not reward them for having a loss.  Sometimes a case has to be litigated and the file is prepped for trial and transferred to a litigation specialist."
good,No pressure as an Intern. Friendly people and no job pressure.
good,Great place to work if you have the right supervisor. It was in Asheville so the area was okay.
good,It was a great because you get the freedom to work where ever you please. You didn't have to be in an office all day. The bad part was salary wasn't there forever. They lowered the pay structure.
good,Extensive phone and email contacts.  Review contract knowledge with agents and fellow associates.  Review all new and existing policies within territory assignment.  Conduct travel twice per year to meet with agents.  Problem solve and resolve varies inquiries by agents and management on behalf of customers.
good,"Field property position"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the processing Medicare Part B, DME claims"
good,"good"
good,Good for gaining experience. I have learned a lot so far. Very fast pace. Great hours.
good,"Treats Employees well, can be hard to move up depending on the department"
good,"This company was amazing when I started, but has seen a steady decline over the past several years with regard to corporate culture. However, employees are paid well and the benefits are good."
good,I have enjoyed my time at Nationwide and am just exploring my options at this point.
good,Nationwide was an overall good company to work for. They were really driven to help out their associates and customers to make everyone happy.
good,"I am seeking to obtain a full-time sales office support or client services position within your company.  I am a client relations and communications expert. I have acquired with several years of administrative support, telecommunications management, and retail management experience.  I also posses the ability to work in all sorts of environments from small entrepreneurial settings to large corporate environments. I can also provide additional assistance to your current support staff, satisfying business needs when opportune.  Having experience working in small departments that contribute to the overall growth of a large business, I fully understand the need to work cohesively as a team member and to become what is needed to better substantiate the business."
good,"quoting home and auto policies, filing, taking payments, and general customer service."
good,I enjoyed working for Farmers and left to take a new position with another company the management was good and the backup was wonderful
good,"A typical day at work primarily is based in customer services, trying to make sure customers get the best customer services available."
good,"A typical work day involves checking email, setting appointment for new and potential customers while meeting a certain level of business each week."
good,"Demonstrated the ability to learn new organizational processes, workflows, policies and procedures with minimal ramp-up time."
good, good company overall can do better to help employeesmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
good,"Again, the owner had a bad habit of reprimanding employees by SCREAMING at the employee in front of other employees and customers."
good,"typical day is 9:45am to 7:00 pm. call center atmosphere, learned a lot about auto and home insurance. received P& C sales license. co-workers are easy to work with and eager to help.  "
good,"10 hour shift"
good,"Provides first line customer service contact for claims reporting activity. "
good,Busy on the phones helping customers and agents that call with policies. I have learned more able car insurance then I knew before. The management is great and are always willing to help their employees do better. My co-workers are helpful and fun to be around and the hardest part of the job is remembering everything you can and cant do in each state.
good,"Nationwide is a company that encourages teamwork, reduction of waste, streamlining processes, community service and new ideas. A typical day of work involves working through an electronic inbox of work, sometimes answering client questions over the phone and completing various projects. It is up to you to juggle responsibilities and prioritize work to completion while meeting deadlines. Once you learn the company's systems the work is repetitive, but necessary as the clients rely on excellent service.  "
good,I learned how to file claims with nationwide insurance customers.
good,"This company experienced a lot of change in acquisitions and leadership and didn't seem very committed to new technology (supposedly that has changed). "
good,People were great asset. Technology lacked with what competitors had 10 years prior.
good,"Investigated auto/home owner’s liability claims in AL, GA, SC, and NC according to state law. Included small property, med pay, and commercial. Multi-tasked by handling 20-30 claims at one time and completing the tasks required on each in a timely manner. Provided assistance to customers with questions in regards to coverage and losses."
good,*Greets all persons entering or calling building premises
good,• Responsible for all aspects of the OYS operations market performance.
good,Worked on and completed several systems in the unix environment.
good,"Every day new day, new people, new challenge. Ready to find job without the stress of sales."
good,Working with clients on a day to day basis with all service issues and claims. Produced property and casualty New business
good,"-Took inbound calls helping customers, local agents, and internal employees with billing and policy questions"
good,"Typical day at work consisted of managing my manager's email, calendar and travel arrangements. Also, coordinating sales meetings and travel. Event planning was the most enjoyable part of this job. The hardest part of the job was the salary."
good,there will be days that things will get crazy and out of control sometimes there was days the system will be shut off for an hour
good,"The day begins with sorting emails for my supervisor (VP), taking calls, updating the day's schedule. I've learned to multi-task on many levels; ie scheduling, travel, conferences, all going forward at the same time. I became very good at managing all my responsibilities. I worked with a team of Administrative Assistants who was always there if you needed assistance. The hardest part of the job sometime was scheduling 20-25 people for a conference out-of-town. This could be very hetic because scheduling was difficult at times. But while preparing conferences could be hetic, I met and spoke to many people which was always enjoyable."
good,Place needs to work more on being employee friendly. To worried about just the customers and not recognizing that their employees are their customers too.
good,My work was consistent and repetitive there
good,"Last position allowed me to meet people from all walks of life. Scheduled hotel accomodations, classrooms and breakfast/lunch for students; ordered classroom books & supplies;"
good,"Nationwide Insurance, Columbus, OH"
good,I worked here part time. It was a good place. Not much more to say.
good,"This company I worked the longest for, they have no real growth opprotunities for those employees who work hard to try and to get ahead their way on providing any opportunity for growth at all is for the employee to caugh of money so to speak to take their classes or college course, and if the empolyee can't afford it oh well their loss."
good,"I have worked for Nationwide Insurance 7 years and have enjoyed my job and co-workers. I am very disappointed in the decision Nationwide has made to close the Battle Creek office. There is a lot of experience and hard workers that are now having to look for new employment. Some have been with the company over 30 years. The building we are located in has been in Battle Creek 50+ years. Started as Transamerica. Nationwide is demolishing history and neither the company or the city of Battle Creek care. All of us work as a team and get the job done. Those that will replace us in Columbus Ohio do not have the experience or the desire to do the job right. Our customers will be the ones to suffer because of this change and also the State of Michigan. Typical day for me is answering customer calls, dispatching new claims to adjusters, handling mail, filing, maintenance of the office. My co-workers are team players and are a joy to work with. This will be the hardest part of leaving. There is no hard part to my job because I put a lot of time and effort in completing all the tasks I am given and taking care of my customers."
good,"Good company to work for. Good benefits. I am in the Agent Capital Program. This is a very challenging position and I would recommend to anyone thinking about joining the ACB program to have a proven sales record. Great opportunity, but if you are not sales driven and focused, this is not the right place for you."
good,Claims was a different animal but the other departments in Nationwide had better work life balance. Overall it is a good company to work for and great for experience
good,A computer job processing requests from agents and underwriters. The culture definitely changed from when I first started. More about numbers than about the employees now.
good,If you have other family members within the company.  They're not entirely sure how to assess an employee's contributions so when you get reviewed it can feel unfair
good,"I worked for Nationwide for about a year and a half total. I was deployed for about 10 months of that time frame. Upon coming home from my deployment, I had resigned since I found a new job. I was then sent a bill in the mail saying I owed about $3400 to Nationwide, due to hours that were not able to process in their system, that they ""paid"" me for. I went through a 2 month period of going back and forth with them, trying to explain that if I was over paid that amount of money, I would have realized it. I ended up settling the issue with them (right around the Christmas holidays), and owed them around $450 for money that was over paid to me. The entire issue was that when I was on drill weekends, even though I would request to not be paid from the company while I was not there, they still continued to pay me. I did not realize the entire time that I worked there. The company ran an audit back in March (while I was deployed) and found the issue, but did not mention it to me at all until I came home. So a great holiday season to me, when I have an unexpected bill of $500. I understand that if you overpaid me, that I have to pay it back. But the fact that they even over paid me in the first place, and then didn't mention it to me until 7 months later. If you are in the military and drill, be careful of how you input your time into their system, or you may receive a hefty bill from them down the road. "
good,"I've been with Nationwide since 2013. Within the last few years, we have had MAJOR changes, which has been disheartening at best. THOUSANDS of positions eliminated, unfortunately a majority of those positions for very tenured associates (we're talking 20-25+ years with the company). For example, my department originally had 8 managers. Not even a year ago, they gave 4 of them their 60-day notices as their positions were being eliminated. Of the 4 who received their notices, the least tenured had been with the company for 22 years. 2 of them were within 3 years of retirement. The worst part? They realized after the fact that they actually needed 5 managers, so someone else was brought in shortly after to fill the position they just told someone months ago was being eliminated."
good,I enjoy working for such a culturally diverse Fortune 500 company. Everyday is different from the one that preceded it. I speak to people from all walks of life in different areas around the country.
good,"Over the past few years, Nationwide has been undergoing revolutionary levels of change in a condensed period of time placing pressure and stress on various levels of the organization to deliver results despite incredible challenges. Cultural values need to be lived out in every level of the organization, including listening to and making changes based upon feedback."
good,The environment was relaxed.  Employees were encouraged to improve their skills.  Training was readily available and employees were also encouraged to be clean but comfortable.
good,"It was an okay job to begin with, but a typical day at the office can be very stressful. It allowed me to grew professionally, more experience with customer service."
good,"The company really tried to do what's best for it's employees. Fun environment to work in. With the recent layoffs, management handled the communication of the situation very poorly."
good,"No benefits, pay is not that great and no room for advancements. The rate increases every 6 months limit us to any cross-selling. Customer service department is all over the place. The billing is always screwed up."
good,"Company is changing to reflect future needs of customers to keep competitive in the  Insurance industry . Accommodate all parts of claim handling , including pet insurance"
good,enjoyed the company but they started changing policies and procedures and laying people off that didnt make my job feel secure. so made me want to move to another company.
good,"Nationwide has no direction as Insurance Company, I have been  a Nationwide employee for 10yrs. It lacks Leadership in the Sr Management level. No Presence as a Leader in the Insurance Industry. We have been stagnant for the last 8yrs, Marketing needs to be redirected to a local level. It is a Great Company with awesome benefits Culture, Diversification programs Positive Public service with Blood Drives, Food Bank Support Drive as well as many others. We have limited opportunity for advancement here in SA."
good,"I enjoyed most of the people i worked with at Nationwide, managers were not consistent in direction or managing teams. They aim to pay at a median level, very hard to work your way up to a higher pay grade. Pay grades are determined by position, not contribution. They do offer learning options but it doesn't always mean you will advance because of it."
good,"Pay levels were not good as compared to national pay scale. I learned a lot but management could be improved, depending on the department. Workplace culture was fun and excellent. Hardest part of the job was getting good SME responses for the writing. Most enjoyable was the fund raisers and reward lunches."
good,Nationwide has continued to downsize continuously and seems to be continuing into the future.  I have had many great teams but the continuous reorganization and downsizing makes for a very unstable environment in which to work.
good,"This a great company to work for, engaging culture that cares about the community and they care about employee development.  Plenty of community activity if you want to get involved."
good,"A typical day is working and meeting metrics. Work cultures is satisfying trying to find ways to motivate each other each day. The hardest part of working in this department is the lack of training for the job that we have to do to fit for Customer Service, sales, and processing all in one job. They pay wasn't fantastic,but you had to be able to move with changes."
good,I moved 3 times with them in 9 years and had many different positions.  They kept buying up different companies and eventually had too many employees and constantly changed folks around.   Not  a secure place to work.
good,"Work environment is fun, healthy, work life balance, benefits are ok, health insurance is quite poor and not many options, lower than average pay and not a lot of opportunity to earn more, unfortunately."
good,"very good benefits, great people to work with but there is so much constant change you never know what you are doing on a daily basis.  There is alot of friend/favoritism when it comes to promotions"
good,"When I began my career with Nationwide in 2007 it was an amazing company to work for. They cared about their employees, offered great benefits, great pay, and the company was all about having fun. In 2012 things drastically changed and things went down hill. They have gradually closed down call centers and laid people off more and more."
good,"Nationwide has a very relaxed work culture. Assigned task take up a small portion of my day. Lots of opportunity to develop skills that will advance your career. However, there is not much growth opportunity within analytics. Management is unsure what they are looking for and hope to achieve"
good,"Most of the people that work there are awesome - helpful, work together, friendly.  However, your experience and opportunities will depend largely on your bosses' willingness to help you move along."
good,"Job is as an insurance processor in the commercial lines division. The company is good. You can wear jeans, listen to headphones and have a somewhat flexible work schedule. The issue is the job itself is one of the hardest I've ever done.  The salary is not worth the amount of stress you go through in order to meet the standards demanded. It' a mentally and emotionally exhausting job and not for everyone for any length of time. The good thing is there is plenty of opportunities to relocate, move to different areas and move on if your scores are good enough."
good,"I worked for this company for more than 25 years.  They treated me well.  Unfortunately, there was a restructuring of my department which resulted in my position being eliminated.  It will be difficult to end this chapter in my life."
good,Nationwide Insurance is an old school insurance company. Make sure you communicate to other departments via your manager. Don't expect annual raises to be more than 3%.
good,"I really don't want to write a review. Laid back culture and similar to working for the government. Nice people, so so management with a ""coaching culture""."
good,Company is well established and offers competitive pay.  Very focused on engagement and giving back to the community.   Upward potential can be limiting (depends on who you know)
good,"wonderful company, but hard to build book of business, money does not come in first year, competitive industry that is only getting tougher.  Must be commited to succeed"
good,"Work life balance is an issue at the company, a lot of work and not a lot of time to get this completed. Systems need to be brought up to the future, still behind other insurance companies."
good,"Seems that the leads we have now are not very profitable, We have been told that money is going to be put back into marketing but never happens, We have lost 2/3 of are Insurance Sales Agents in the last year and seems as a trend that will continue."
good,"This was a great place to work for many years, but unfortunately they did the reorganization and displaced a lot of their veteran staff unless they wanted to relocate. Main goal was to make money for the company."
good,"A typical day would start at 8 AM and answered phone calls for 7 1/2 hours.  Complete all requests from phone calls (ie loans, change of address, fund transfers for variable products, mail change of beneficiary forms)."
good,If you enjoy insurance this may be a job you like. Typical office job. Turning into more a call center job. They are starting to micromanage which leaves you feeling suffocated. Not really many advancement opportunities. No fulfillment in your work.
good,"Great benefits, decent salary, challenging without being overwhelming (for the most part). My immediate leadership was supportive, friendly and engaging. Lots of on-site benefits (gym, pharmacy, tailor, post office etc.)."
good,They place high demand on personnel with unrealistic expectations. This causes associates to burn out quickly and the standards are much to high to maintain over a long period of time
good,"I don't have a lot to say, either good or bad, for employment at Nationwide.  It was a good place to work while I was there, but it ran its course with me."
good,LEAN process has changed everything at Nationwide recently for better of the company. Since this is a huge company.....our technical work is split up between teams and not much opportunity to grow technically. But otherwise the company is a great place to work with a great work life balance.
good,I loved this job.  I came to work ready to go.  I was able to listen to my Ipod as I processed.  I enjoyed working with my co workers and was not required to be on the telephone all day.  The most difficult part of the job was when they began putting efficiency before quality.  It was a relaxed atmosphere and you were able to wear jeans.  Working from home was also an option.  The onsite cafeteria and fitness center was awesome!
good,Nationwide was a nice place to work.  There is always room to move up at Nationwide and learn something new. For the most part co-workers are supportive on one another.
good,It was a good place to work they would switch you to a different location  didn't have a permanent location. Secure in the areas daily patrol and daily paperwork.
good,It is a great place to work for if you are looking for work/life balance. Provides a lot of opportunities to learn new technologies. Fun employer to be working for.
good,I enjoy the culture they have produced and the management team. for an insurance company though their health insurance and pay is not up to the same standards the rest of the industry has.
good,"I generally enjoyed my time with Nationwide as an insurance agent.  The product itself had some competitiveness issues where I was located, but we were able to find some niche markets.  While here, I was able to further develop some additional sales skills while building upon my insurance knowledge."
good,"1) Good Work Environnment."
good,"Very fast paced so must display a sense of urgency to deliver quality results, proven success handling multiple priorities at one time and a passion for developing others."
good,Nice place to work if you can find good management. Is a company that has good benefits so it is typical to find people who have been in the company for 15 plus years but it is also typical for them to be micro-managers that are afraid of change.
good,Nationwide is a good company with the potential to be a great company.  Nationwide is currently going through a lot of change in order to be prepared for 2020 vision.  There is a lot of growth and advancement opportunities within Nationwide if you are mobile.
good,"well organize"
good,"When I first began with Nationwide, I worked in Mail Services as a file clerk. I did a whole lot of numerical filing. Also responsible for scanning the sortagraphs that had the envelopes pulled from them and printing new envelopes. Once the mail that was filed and pulled, we took the envelopes and boxes that needed to be mailed to the scales and sorted them by weight be posted on a Pitney Bowes Mailing machine. This sealed and added postage on each envelope. The mail was then out into mail tubs and APC racks to be picked up by the US Post Office."
good,"Overall, a good company to work for.  Nationwide has decided to consolidate offices and as such is losing tenured staff in locations who are unable to relocate."
good,Well established company and phenomenal infrastructure. Great benefits and room for advancement. Stressful work. Very flexible and professional management.
good,Great people to work with. Culture and work process need much improvement. Turnover was constant. Nice facility. Systems need updating.
good,Pretty good company to work for but just was not for me I did not like standing/sitting in one place a day long day after day. Loved my coworkers everyone was so willing to help win situations
good,Data entree. Updating information for residential and commercial policy holders according to city and state codes across America.
good,"It felt like a production line.  Even though you learned a lot, it was all about numbers.  We had a lot of turn over in staff and everything was inputting everything into the system."
good,"I worked for Nationwide for almost 10 years. I transferred into the Total Loss Claims Department, and ended up in the worst ran department Nationwide has to offer. Besides the horribly stressful job, and no work/life balance, the management was awful. They didn't seem to care about their employees and used us as warm bodies to fill their seats. They offered not so great training and then demanded perfection from you which is impossible. Turn over is very high in this department. People either get fed up and just quit or they tough it our and transfer into a different area of the company. I tried to do this but my Manager was so unrealistic with what I could do she would not allow me to leave her area and after almost 10 years I am being forced to leave a company I have loved to work for. It is a shame and very sad this has happened to me. All in all Nationwide is a great company to work for. Most areas are ran by great people who do care, just stay away from the Total loss department."
good,"Mainframe work environment using COBOL, IMS, VSAM, SPF, JCL, CICS, DB2, SQL and Expeditor.  It is a great large company to work for with many sponsored activities and sports.  Corporate challenge sporting events to compete athletically with other Fortune 500 companies.  Nationwide hired me right out of college and basically taught and trained me everything I know about programming today.  I would work there again."
good,"After Nationwide purchased the Insurance Company that I work for my days changed. I worked in a satelite office for 27 years, then office closed and worked out of my home office. I learned about time management and self starting. I became an expert in Excel. I developed skills for using PeopleSoft General Ledger Software and NVision reporting. Analyzed many new reports to help managment."
good,Good facilities and workforce. Repetitive work thou. learnt a lot to do with mortgages and fraud. Also how to use their computer systems.
good,The company is very large and they offer many benefits including paying for education.  They also try to keep their associates engaged by having many teambuilding activities.
good,Typical work day consists of taking lots of calls and answering a lot of questions. Co-workers are usually pleasant and management is usually very good. Pay could be better.
good,"8 hour work day."
good,"I have been with Nationwide for 25 years in different departments.  There are so many opportunities for any one that wants to take advantage of them.  There are company paid insurance classes and a generous tuition reimbursement program."
good,Typical day is busy. quotas have to be made. its all about the numbers. some coworkers are okay others are into peoples business to much. lazy workers also. management has no clue what goes on with the employees and dont seem to care like before. hardest thing is to remain positive. most enjoyable part is the work i do and going home.
good,Very busy day processing commercial insurance policy's and answerered agents phone calls. Learned all about the different type of commercial policy's. Last year and a half worked from home for nationwide.
good,"I did enjoy working for Nationwide. When i arrived, i would sign on to the computer. That is the way the company keeps a track of your time. I learned alot in the 25 years i worked there. The management in the claims department was great. The co-workers were all friends to me. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work, where i enjoyed working with alot of good people, even my boss & her boss in Columbus Ohio. I enjoyed helping people on the phone on various problems. W9 forms & 1099's. The hardest part was having to leave the company after so many years. They were family to me. We had to break up the family. They closed the office down. I think the only left here is a legal group in another area of town. Everyday I miss working for such a good group of people. The corporate people don't know what they had in the employees in the Portland, OR office!"
good,This is a great place to work. You have the luxury of setting your own pace as a Property Inspector. The downside of this job with this company is the pay is low. The managers and the work environment is friendly.
good,Nothing bad to say. It wasn’t the job I was hoping for. I like the management and everyone around me. Everyone was so nice and eager to help in every way. Some of the managers where a bit too much sometimes.
good,"Nationwide is a great place to work, but you will get stuck QUICK! & don’t mention to anyone that you don’t want to stay complacent because they will hold that against you in the future. They only want you to move up within the company on THEIR time. Great for college students though"
good,"I went from a blue collar job to working in an office at Nationwide. It is the nicest place I've ever worked. I think that has more to do with some of my former employers though. The amount of change you can be expected to keep up with on a weekly, if not daily basis, is rather daunting. I am rather disturbed to see how many people have worked hard to advance in the company only to have a department reorganization eliminate their position, then have the company come back a few months later to fill that eliminated position all over again with someone new and less qualified. Most managers are easy to work with to accommodate work/life balance. Pay is not bad and the available benefits are extensive."
good,Nationwide is good about work life balance.  Not very competitive when it comes to salary but the culture is good.  People often call to ask for their jobs back after leaving for a higher salary.
good,They expect big time sales and retention rates. Can be prison like at times. Great people with great intentions but were going through growing pains during my times.
good,Work Enviorment was okay. The Work was satisfying however I had to travel 1hr and 15min to get to work one way. So I did not enjoy sitting in traffic.
good,"Sink or swim, then when you sink they want to know why instead of lend a hand."
good,"In the last few years, the company seems to have placed the welfare of the associates below improving revenue."
good,"If you enjoy working in a call center, than this is a great opportunity to be consistently busy with something new being presented to you every day. Additionally, if you have great communication skills, you can go far and excel within this organization."
good,I was excited to work for Nationwide in the beginning they promise you a lot but unfortunately in time learn that there is no opportunity for growth..
good,Love my workday flexibility. I have the freedom to work on projects as I determine. Management is usually inclusive. I am curious as to where we will grow next.
good,I was recruited to join the Commercial Property team due to the growth of the property division.  18 months later I was laid off due to reorganizing the division to about half staff.
good,"High volume high productivity environment opportunity to learn and service a unique variety of life insurance products, extensive customer contact both written and oral"
good,I worked from 10:30to 7:00pm. I am licensed in all stated with a 620 license. I worked in liability claims. I was originally licenses in the south eastern states for liability and was promoted to work in all states.
good,"Depending upon where you work within the organization, it can be a good place to work.  They offer lots of job training and have great benefits.  The retirement plan is good."
good,"High employee turnover. Claims come in fast and hot. "
good,"Although on average, the claims being defended by the Nationwide Trial Division do not involve the complexity or risk that one encounters in private practice, the experience gained here is invaluable for anyone who wants to be a litigator."
good,"The people you work with really make you feel like your family. however with the change in higher up recently, the company has created a stressful workplace in the sales department. But overall great company"
good,"Great work life balance, decent pay & flexible schedule. Training was pretty unorganized and not long enough. If there was anything that the company needed to fix it would have definitely been the training."
good,I enjoyed my job here they were fun and very professional. Until they did another administrative change and the new people they brought into the company ran it down and was no longer a fun company to work for it became very stressful
good,I loved working with the people I worked for and worked with. The pay and benefits were really good. The only part that was bad was when it went out of business.
good,"I would say this job is DECENT as a job,but not as a career. They love to push the notion of this being a career job, however I just don't see it. The reality is that this is a call center job, where you stay on the phone 95% of your day, you're micromanaged (just like all call centers), you consistently talk to people who are rude and normally stupid. Job growth in relation to the position isn't good enough. It's pretty difficult to get promoted because you have to meet the stats for promotion. This includes handle time, after call work percentage, and QUALITY of calls. But here's the thing about quality of calls, for an average MCR quality only grades 1%> of your calls. You take a lot of calls a month and quality only looks at 4-5 and bases your performance off that. What other career do you know of, where your supervisor bases your overall performance off less than 1% of your work? It's not consistent, and as a result the metrics you get which determine your chances of promotion aren't consistent. And that's just for promotion within the position. Going from MCR II to III or IV. In reality most people want to get AWAY from the call center portion of the company or at the very least away from the customer service portion of call center work, and I don't feel like Nationwide gives the development opportunities for that to happen. Or at the very least, supervisors aren't always eager to give you those development opportunities. Like I said, it's a call center. in their mind the queue and service levels are more important that attempting to assist you in your move to a different"
good,"The culture at Nationwide is second to none in terms of job security, work/life balance and the value placed on associates. The company is sound financially and makes decisions for the long term rather than focusing on quarterly earnings."
good,People are not skillful. Hard to find the development. Compensations are not competitive in the market. It is good for the people who are planning to retire from this company.
good,"great company, every other department besides claims has it really good, give a lot of time off but barely able to take it, very fast paced job, must be able to multi task, will ask to switch days, they will tell you no but then hire new people into those days"
good,Interaction between departments is encouraged. Employee engagement is something that a lot of emphasis is placed on. promotions are not based on merit but instead based on manager's perception of how you will handle certain situations
good,"Nationwide is a great company to work for, and has lots of opportunities for advancement. If you are looking for a long term career Nationwide would be a great start."
good,"- Encouraging manager"
good,Fast Pace environment. A lot of room for growth. Call center environment a little micro management issues but nothing that would stop someone from being successful.
good,"Things here are great."
good,"A typical day is fast-paced.  Meeting must be set-up, teleconferences and sometimes a lot of xeroxing for meetings.  I've learned to interact with dozens of vendors for travel meetings; setting up hotels, airline reservations and transportation.  I've also learned to manage my time when juggling multiple assignments.  I have had co-workers that work together to get assignments completed."
good,Great job. Would love to work there again. I learned a lot from all my co-workers. It was a very fun job all the way around.
good,"Nationwide is a good, stable company with good benefits.  There are always opportunities to transfer to different roles within the enterprise."
good,"I enjoyed working with everyone there. The management seemed to truely want you to do well, for both the companies sake and your own personal developement."
good,We were not yet computerized and claims were handled by hand-written files. Management was excellent. Spent most of the day on the phone.
good,"I enjoyed my years with Nationwide. If you gain the skills through the free education the company offers, get involved with peers from different areas and work to be the best at your current position, you can be promoted to higher levels."
good,"Made calls to attorneys, claimants and insureds."
good,Nationwide has talked for many years wanting to be a great company and still talks about wanting to be that great company.
good,Overall great place to work. Fair pay for the role. Advancement opportunities have changed. Great job for someone looking for great pay for low effort.
good,"Hours were great, management was good, money and raises needed to be adjusted, my time in working here and I never received a raise, even after asking, there’s response was every six months, but I did not receive one. And no paid sick days were provided."
good,"Was a good learning experience true all the years. Give me the opportunity to feel comfortable selling insurance and getting the insurance knowledge to continue my career."
good,"The people you work with are very nice always happy to help,  you will learn something new every day, the management always had an open door policy. The workplace culture was happy."
good,"relaxed casual wear, speak to awesome policy holders! managers always make work fun! special contests, everyone is helpful and always are willing to show the ropes. lots of training."
good,Nationwide was a great place to work at one time however anymore it isa high stress environment with low quality leads and system issues that ultimately cost you time and money a management staff that is cut throat and demanding
good,Not much workload so I end up leaving Nationwide for better opportunity and more responsibility. I loved that Nationwide supported higher education by providing tuition reimbursement.
good,"Good place to work for. Very nice people to work with. "
good,"Nationwide has been good to me, claims is a very stressful role & it is not for everyone. It is a great company to work for & if i was in a bigger location where i could advance to a different role that i enjoy more i would. The location I am currently at is smaller and not much room for growth."
good,"have enjoyed my position but looking to get back in supervisory role, the benefits and compensation package is very good.  The people are helpful and many are will to network"
good,"This company is very stressful to work with as they don't care about their employees life outside of the company. When you express issues or concerns about work life balance managers don't seem to care as much. "
good,Enjoyable place to work.  Nice people - teamwork and collaboration.  It can be slower paced because there are a lot of overly structured processes and procedures which is typical of larger companies.
good,"Great team environment. Fun office to work Campus is brand new with great gym, starbucks, lounges, and cafe. Flexible with scheduling and 3 days off a week."
good,"This is a great place with great benefits, but for the volume of phone calls and work that we do, the pay should be more. We should get more recognition and incentives."
good,"Fast paced environment with clients are seeking solutions at a moments notice. Using multiple platforms, computer based, to seek these solutions is the key to success and earning the trust of the public to do there business within the insurance field."
good,"Being an independent contractor has unique challenges and benefits.    Having come from a company that provided marketing material, leads, and training, I was shocked to have to pay out of pocket at Nationwide."
good,"Gym on site."
good,I really enjoyed working at Nationwide. It's hard to move around and getting promoted takes a while. Salary is okay. Work life balance is great!
good,They have well defined process which helps on every application release to deliver smooth and the job security is high for the associates who are working
good,"The claims call center is a great place to gain experience, but if insurance is not your cup of tea, it is easy to let 10 years go by because the benefits are great, and the open atmosphere is fun!  It seemed like there was a lot of busy work requirements that didn't really add to the work process and was redundant.  Changes daily, and insufficient training to keep pace with the changes.  Also grading practices are subjective.  Also, time off is impossible if projected needs are greater than expected.  All time off needs to be pre-planned almost a year in advance.  Being sick is no excuse!"
good,"Great company with exceptional benefits. Position was stressful, but also provided employees with freedom. Managers would tend to micro manage. I did not see much career advancement within our department."
good,I work as a claims adjuster.  I work from home which is really nice.  But the workload is very high.  Co-workers are great.
good,Insurance sales through a direct inbound channel. Warm leads only. Constantly shifting directives counteracted by good pay.
good,I worked there for more than 10yrs. It was an enjoyable place to work but management changed hands several times and job responsibilities increased exponentially.
good,"Great for families, work-life balance is solid. "
good,"Not security has declined. There are many layoffs even though they continue hiring. Company used to have an atmosphere they cared for their employees, but that has gone."
good,"Nationwide is a great company to work for, great work life balance and great people to work with. The only bad thing is their technology is like 20 years behind the times."
good,"Schedule hard to change once set, to many changes in guidelines, Lack of leadership at moments. Stressful calls. night shift isn't fun and hard to stay focused with no calls."
good,"Good Company to work for.  To much time wasted on non productive work activities.  Based on a position that required you to meet a  specified quota, spent too much time in meetings and unnecessary lean training."
good,"Just not for everyone. If you're okay will call center work Nationwide has tons of benefits and amenities. Onsite nurse, cafeteria, Starbucks, gym, walking trails."
good,"Outwardly an innovative human resource approach. In reality very out-dated, counter productive human resource approach, focus is what you fail to do correctly, with no encouragement or personal instruction. Employees never speak their minds, because what you say or do will be used against you."
good,"Everyone is focused on achieving the goal of the company, the commitment to achieve the best is second to none"
good,You are almost always doing something yet is a very laid back call center. You get the enjoyment of helping each and every customer that calls in.
good,"A lot of the code was poorly maintained. There was little, if any use of version control. Teams seemed fairly resistant to adopt agile workflow. Salaries were a little below industry average, but there was extremely good job security - most employees had been with company 10+ years."
good,"There has been a lot of changes within the company in the past few years but the changes have been good because the company has grown bigger and bigger, there has been a lot of opportunities for employees working there. I was sad to leave NW but left to follow my dream of working as an RN."
good,"Beautiful downtown office in walking distance of restaurants, sculpture park and library. Free covered parking and access to lot during weekend events."
good,Job itself tends to be difficult due to different state laws and trying to apply them to each individual policy.
good,"A typical day at work would be going into the system to log in and pull up your daily tasks and begin your day. I learned by working here that everyday to expect a different challenge as no day was the same as the last. Management was very hard to express your ideas to even though we were the actual ones doing the work, and lots of times they did not know how we did the work or why it was done in that manner. The workplace culture was awesome as the job was very diverse and i loved that abut the company. The hardest part of the job were the unrealistic expectations they had at times of the employees."
good,Since I worked for an agent I did not receive the benefits provided by Nationwide Insurance. I had no paid vacation or medical benefits.
good,Busy from the time I got to work till I left. Insurance demands. No help from co-workers. Best time was 5:00 getting off time.
good,"When my son got hospitalized I got in trouble for it, his daddy was over seas in the military so I was the only parent around. Then I had a medical emergency happen right before my 90days were up and had a note from the hospital but they fired me."
good,Realized that technology environment is very outdated and there are no plans to move forward with new technology until the older stuff breaks or is no longer supported by vendors.
good,"I enjoyed my co workers and loved the company and what they stood for, did not like the management. They were down your throat. I would have liked to advance but was blocked by my supervisor, that did not work for me. They have great benefits and pay."
good,"The CEO was wonderful to work for. The manager of the branch I worked for was not very good at book keeping and pay schedules."
good,"Introduced me into a whole new world! Took the time to teach me, knowing i was a quick learner! Very calm, respectful, and very understanding. They are truly awesome!"
good,I have learned a lot from the agent I work for. It is a small office and we have to make up for the lack of employees yet the owner is great. The office manager knows the business but is not very good at managing the office. She passes her work off on others and treats some employees different then others. We have lost several customers bc of her and her not wanting to communicate with them. She is out of the office more then she is in.
good,"Working for this small office was a pleasure.  It was close to my home and offered perfect part-time hours.  "
good,"Small work force that complemented one another. Day started early and usually went over. On most occasions lunches were taken at your desk as you continued to answer phone calls, and service clients. However wasn't strapped to a desk as on many days I had to leave the office to inspect prospective properties within a 20 mile radius."
good,"I enjoyed the job it’s self, hard to advance in customer service as there weren’t many departments or room to growin management. Not the friendliest management"
good,A typical day was spent mostly on the phone pertaining to customer complaints and questions.  Spent the rest of the time writing new policies and trying to save people money.
good,Management and quality is inconsistent each manager deviates and communication is poor if this is a first job then it is an awesome place to start the pay is great and the benefits are decir to
good,"Fast paced and proffessional environment to help excel in an advanced work experience. I highly recommend applying to some different insurance providers if you are looking for a job, they pay well even at the bottom and if you work for a nice agent, work may be fun each day!"
good,It is a good place to start in the workforce. The only problem I found is the not payment of renewals in policies.
good,"A typical day, I would come in at 8:45 am to open up and get all the computers, faxes and scanner ready for the work day. Answer any and all telephone calls, prepare quotes and Auto policies. No co-workers just my Boss and myself."
good,It was a okay job not the best and not the worst.
good,"Typical dry atmosphere in an insurance defense firm. Day went by quickly as there was never a shortage of work. Can be tedious as it is usually the same subject matter, personal injury."
good,Customer focused job.  Interesting work and opportunities. I loved the team environment and the people I worked with.  Would do this job again in a heartbeat.
good,The company focuses on entry level associates. Once you begin to move up in the company the compensation doesn't match job roles. The culture at Nationwide is one of change. Change however doesn't equal progress. Many changes are one step forward two steps back.
good,"A typical day in the office involved assisting customers through various needs, making calls, responding to emails, and providing care that Nationwide clients are used to receiving."
good,There was not many options to hours but the clients were great and the staff did care about the clients.  The management was horrible but the office management was great. Nice place to work
good,Owner was not very friendly. Really liked the other two people I worked with. Was a pretty fun job all in all.
good,"I was underpaid and I knew it, however, i liked my manager and people I worked with so I put up with it... but getting promoted or getting a raise is impossible."
good,Great way to learn how to negotiate through the political web. If you keep a low profile and you work for the appropriate people you are fine but if you are a go getter and someone above you is intimidated you'll be terminated.
good,Great company vto work for till they had massive layoffs.lost my job with very little notice.upper management only care about the bottom line without considering employees moral.
good,"The typical day was fairly slow. Lots of busy work to do around the office including filing, tidying up the office and your own workspace as well as organizing paper files and shredding old documents among other things."
good,"Was a great work culture to work in and was a fulfilling job choice which kept you busy and changed things up from day to day. However Management's expectations changed frequently, sometimes day to day. I was asked to perform a task and when done to their specifications per their instructions. The next day, I was asked why I was doing that task a certain way, I replied that they told me to do so. They denied they told me to do that task that way and called me a liar. This cycle continued for months. Minimal room for advancement but would advance you if you within their social circle and met the criteria. Honestly I would like to go back to the company but not under the same supervisor."
good,"Working at Nationwide can be stressful. The majority of my time there was spent on catastrophe duty performing 12hr shifts. I often found myself unable to use the restroom due to call volume holding a queue ranging from 8-60 at any given time. One must be mentally, physically, and emotionally capable to learning what to absorb and ignore while working here. Compensation is great, but means little when you're never with family to enjoy it."
good,The Company is going through a lot of change.  There have been a lot of layoffs. Certain departments have become more of a call center environment when it's not an actual call center. The headquarters has a nice gym. My department has flexibility but that's not consistent. Benefits are not great-High deductible health plans only but a lot of companies are going in that direction.
good,"This is a regular call center job, with high customer service expectations. Some is scripted work. The call volume is manageable compared to other call center jobs. I enjoyed myself for the culture and the personal branding that Nationwide gets from their employees."
good,"A typical day is wander into the home office between 7:30 and 9:30, and always leave by 4, at the latest."
good,"double of work load was unrealistic and unmanageable.  Management and training were not very good,  A one size fits all mentality.  Management would ask for advice for areas to improve but never followed through on promises or commitments for improvement or either ignored or failed to implement concepts and ideas to help make the team/region more efficient, and help to bring a better work life balance to the field employees."
good,The culture while I was there was short because the demand was not in line with what was explained to me the job would include. I was hire to be an Sr. Oracle Programmer Analyst but was assigned production support for PERL programmer which was not difficult but off balanced from what I was previously doing in other jobs.
good,"This is a good company to work for with support and opportunities."
good,I'm sorry I do not feel comfortable providing information in this forum. I do not know who the review is viewable to or which information is being shared.
good,"When I started this company, I had no idea what insurance was about. I was overwhelmed with joy once the ""insurance jargon"" was explained to me thoroughly with the trainers. Our training department is great, they are consistent with state laws with car insurance, and makes sure we are provided the materials to guide us through our calls. "
good,"If you are female or minority, you have job security, if you are white or male, you do not know from day to day if you have a job."
good,A typical day consists of calling potential clients for insurance.
good,Company never stops trying to make adjustments. No core values.
good,I enjoyed working at Nationwide. I liked the hours I worked and we received hour lunches on pay Friday. I enjoyed all of my co-workers. I
good,"Lately the company is going through many changes trying to stay competitive  and adapting kizen lean in multi departments where it is not a good fit for 1. Employee satisfaction and 2. Customer satisfaction. It only produces numbers and eliminates waste such as 1. Jobs adding more titles to another job function and 2. You become a slave to the  KPIs and scorecard and it determines you worth as an employee and depletes  morale of the department. There is hardly any work life balance and inflexibility. Some areas of the company promote worklife balance but it depend on the AVP and it is extremely inconsistent. Inconsistancy between the umbrellas of the company is what harms it the most. They through our changes that are poorly planned by people not qualified to successfully implement them in efforts to save money which in turn often fail. In failing it effects customer retention and agent satisfaction and lead to huge losses in the long run. What kizen fails to forecast is the impact of the efficiency change on the end user and customer which is a huge discrepancy. I beleive one day this could be a great company again with better leadership from the top down. The people here are truly great people and they deserve better leadership. Very friendly, inclusive and diverse work culture but, you will hate your job if you come here."
good,The company has great culture and the talent that is hired is the best. Leadership needs to work more with mid management to create solutions for company problems.
good,The business was sold to another principle agent who was so full of herself and very hard to work for. I had a personal issue that this same agent interferred with. She over stepped her boundaries and made false accusations against me. She also did not pay me well and did not pay me for commissions that were owed to me.
good,Claims adjuster where workload and quality/production demands were not balanced by management. Stressful work environment and atmosphere. The workplace culture has shifted from previous years.
good,"Corporate culture favored growing employees into new roles from within but the new roles were often cut, leaving employees searching for new positions outside the company. There was a fear of advancing too far into a position that would no longer exist in a few months."
good,"busy,busy,busy,busy,heavy work load,long days, large paper work, no room for error, hovering , no good job is gone undone, no praise for doing a super job"
good,"Nationwide is a great company to work for; however, there are areas that the company could improve. There is never a dull moment at work, and the company provides many learning opportunities. Overall, the company culture is good."
good,Tough to advance if you weren't connected to the right management.  Typical days at work were spent 80% in meetings leaving you with little time to perform your daily tasks.
good,"Typical day was fun and upbeat. Team at the time was extremely fun to work with. They did a lot of promoting from withing which I thought was fantastic. There was a lot of turnover due to the work load as many complained it was too stressful. Other than that, enjoyed my time there and appreciated the opportunity."
good,"Good place to work if you are getting into the insurance field, no health benefits. Will have to multi task and be a quick learner. Typical day would consist of quotes and payment processing."
good,"I usually would work 1-5 everyday and all I did was answer phone calls and take insurance payments.Also, that the work is easy and my boss was easy going."
good,"As an Agent on the phones with incoming calls constantly. "
good,"My time at Nationwide was always interesting and fulfilling. I enjoyed the variety of daily job duties."
good,"I was on a contract so I really didn't get paid much, but the permanent employees got a pretty decent compensation package, it is really laid back professional environment where you may find your self in conversations with the very top of upper management who take pride in being very approachable."
good,"just stay out of claims ....you will work for free, the workload is unbearable. "
good,"Always helpful and willing to assist. Initially the job is a self train position, is what I concluded because I had very little support with training."
good,Nationwide insurance is a very honorable company to work for. I enjoyed that they genuinely cared about the customers needs and not just about the money.
good,"answer phones, accept insurance payments, copy, fax documents, type various Microsoft office documents. Prepare mail for shipment. Help co-workers with various things."
good,Nationwide is a good place to work for. Right now they are not hiring anyone and there are lot of changes going in within the company.
good,Great working environment and values.  Software development techniques and strategies used by the company are latest in the market.
good,"As a sales agent sold products to existing customers and prospects, such as auto, life and renters insurance. Making cold calls to business attempting to sell them commercial insurance.  And giving presentation to first time home buyers about home insurance."
good,"You are able to work at your own pace. "
good,answering phone calls assisting customers making payments help with billing questions making changes to their policies.
good,Sales is fun and meeting people within the Insurance business is thrilling to say the least. As a Sales person people are everything knowing you can't make everyone happy but you can make them see that your product is good for them! running a store front is a bit tough but again it is worth it to get to be a person people can rely on to be there for them! I enoyed making people happy with their service and seeing them learn something new about Insurance as we talk of their needs that is a great expereince! Hardest part of job is working 12 hour days and at the end of the day finding that you lost more people then youo gained so your commissions just went out the window!
good,"Overall a good company to work depending on what department. In most insurance areas, good. In communications and marketing, bad leadership. Little job security. What you do counts for 20% of performance review, the other 80% is ""how"" you do your job...meaning, working the politics. Very good place for young people to work but not for older workers. Lots of opportunities for minorities."
good,A good company to work for.  Some gave a good bonus if you hit both personal and company goals. Benefits differ between agencies and Nationwide had good training sources.
good,Plenty of entry level jobs to get into insurance industry. As you progress through your career the competition is more intense. Education is important to move through the company.
good,"A place to grow and developed more skills.  They are more on automation and innovation.  Always in a trend for new technology, still using bot legacy and new application."
good,Employees should be ready to work for day and night. It is a good company. Good company to work with. People are friendly. You can learn new tools and technologies.
good,Went on appointments to visit existing and new potential clients. Worked at the agency assisting clients with their changes or questions regarding their insurance policy.
good,Nationwide has great training and they are really good about explaining insurance to their employees. Nationwide has been a wonderful career starter! I have met a ton of wonderful people who I have been able to work with.
good,"It all depends on the agent you work for. The company itself is a good company, but if you are not an agency owner, your experience working for the company will depend heavily on who the agent is."
good,"Nationwide is a huge insurance company.  I worked in a district office and at the home office in Columbus Ohio.  It provides decent pay, great training, and sometimes decent managers.  It all depends on where you work and who is your boss."
good,I was an Auto Field Claims Adjuster.  I had a large territory with a lot of drive time.  In the beginning the focus was on helping the customer through their difficult time.  As time went on the focus became more on reports and numbers.  I felt I was unable to offer the customer service and empathy I enjoyed giving.   Extremely Stressful
good,"A typical day involved attending meetings, planning leadership events, researching and assembling presentations, organizing division events,  follow up on staff financing, Corporate real estate usage and other duties as assigned."
good,"Great company to work for. I had a wonderful career as a Claims adjuster and Agent. The most challenging part of my job was managing the overall Agency and still adding new clients. I enjoyed the flexibility of working my own schedule, creating new sales markets and opportunities. Meeting goals and being rewarded for the same."
good,Nationwide gave me an opportunity to manage.  The business policies were clear.  I enjoyed working with the Claims staff.  They were progressive in managing performance.
good,It was fast paced and staff are helpful with helping when you have questions. They are currently short staffed and there is an increase of claims and they are trying to help with the volume but we need more people to make that happen. I do not mind working for Nationwide but it is to far away and need to find something closer.
good,"Nationwide is a well established financial services leader. I have enjoyed my time at Nationwide and have built many relationships. Overall, Nationwide is a good place to work."
good,"Excellent people, tons of opportunities to explore, member focused. Educational reimbursement, moving expenses, in house training, paid time off more than other companies."
good,"At this time with all the downsizing the people that are left are required to do more with less.  Still a great place to work, so much change has occurred it seems as though management either doesn't care or they are limited in their power to help regain some of the prior work environment."
good,"We had the option to work from home, move our breaks and also had flex and lifetime days of PTO we were allowed to use. The supervisors are complete boneheads and most of the time were nowhere to be found, but the comradery  amongst associates was wonderful."
good,Great place to work at Nationwide. I had a lot of new opportunities to experience. The balance between work and private life is amazing. I enjoyed every bit of my time I spent.
good,"A lot of great opportunities to grow. If you are willing to move around a lot, property positions are available most of the times."
good,"This is a great company to work for.  Many benefits, a lot of opportunity, and a great sense of family within the department where I resided.  I would recommend."
good,"I worked at Harleysville as it was absorbed into Nationwide.  The culture change was immediate and vastly different from what had been the culture.  There was much frustration on the agents' end with the change of direction and underwriting appetite, as well as the nonrenewals and large renewal increases.  Things would change overnight, and I was often left unable to back up my word that I'd given to my agents just the day before."
good,They were minimizing departments almost as soon as I started working. Lost 4 departments within my first 2 years working here. Just waiting for my position vto get cut soon.
good,Nationwide mutual insurance company is a great place to work for. The only downside is that you have to grasp a lot of information in a short period of time.
good,Its a great place to work but there are not a lot of opportunities to advance  I love the benefits and my tesm but it seems like everyone is out for self and not with helping everyone succeed
good,"A typical day at work is all about taking phone calls (at times back to back, at times not), team huddle (to review your metrics & stats, and  issues while on a call), 15min break, lunch and back to work until the end of your shift with an ocasional 1 on 1 coaching or team even (such as a potluck, or on some ocasions birthday celebration break)"
good,"Nationwide was a great place to work. As a FNOL rep it could be stressful, especially during a CAT. The company was great with feeding reps that worked long extra hours. The work environment was fun and great opportunities for growth."
good,"Depends on the scrum master the team will evolve and if scrum performs well, there was good productive in team regarding the projects."
good,"Fun place to work with cafeteria, ping pong table, and gym on campus. Good place to make decent money while going through school or looking for experience in the insurance world."
good,"Hard to impossible to review 30 yrs later.   Was 1st job after high school, Entry level.  enjoyed working there.  "
good,"Good support from underwriting departments.  Compsny hss great rates. ,Iimage is well known to the public. Customer base is well established . Ease of System."
good,"Great place to work except for the fact that there were too many people calling the shots and very few of us actually doing the work.  A lot of repetitive steps - processes needed to be streamlined, but upper management did not seem to understand how to effectively do this."
good,"I was an Association Group Representative in Central Oregon and had a large geographical territory. I was hired by the regional manager as 2 of 3000 candidates for the positions."
good,"I loved my fellow employees at nation wide insurance, but I did not like how there was little room for my career to advance there. Furthermore, I decided I no longer wanted to work in the insurance sector."
good,"Nationwide, as is the case with most P&C companies, is changing and reducing their store fronts. With this comes a reduction in client service and the quality of the remaining service."
good,"Nationwide is a great company to work for and it's better to be a team player, knowing how to collaborate and work with others is of upmost importance."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Syracuse office closed, but there is no option to bypass this field."
good,It was tough but the structure was very different. It has improved to make it more employee friendly. It was very stressful and the management at the time was not the friendliest.
good,"I worked at Nationwide. "
good,"While they say you can move up from the call center, because you’re gaining experience, don’t believe it.  If you have your degree, don’t start in this call center.  Start in another part of the company."
good,Great place if you want predictable hours and work that is manageable. Great corporate culture where values are lived everyday and employees are taken care of
good,"Nice Place to Work. Great training and development programs and management is invested in the success of their employees. The on campus cafeteria, lounge areas, and teambuilding exercises were great."
good,"Nationwide Insurance has their way and it has worked for years, but it is somewhat archaic. Management is very adept in the sales field and a great place for beginner sales people to learn."
good,I worked here years ago I liked this job because as a single mother at the time the job was very good at giving me a flexible schedule I would recommend this type of job for someone such as college student needing flexibility.
good,"I never considered this to be my dream job. Just a place to get started, and to get my licenses. would recommend it to others looking to get started in the industry"
good,"A nice work place to work. Also people who work there are helpful and it's really fun to work with them."
good,"The company had good benefits, competitive pay, and lots of opportunities, especially if you had the flexibility to relocate to the Columbus, Ohio area."
good,"If younare comfortable figuring out problems yours, you’ll be fine. Make sure you are engaged. EPMPS are annoying to do every year. Otherwise it’s pretty relaxed."
good,Not an environment a millennial or fast paced employee work with. And the blocker is change is slow and filled with layers of management to implement. Benefits such as daycare and expense related items not covered at most levels.
good,"Good Client to work.Great Culture. Fabulous People"
good,"Good work life balance.  Pretty political, you will not get a job unless you know someone in the department and you get a recommendation - or if you have a very specialized talent."
good,"It was a pleasant place to work with good benefits, good training and supervisors that would push you to succeed and grab for more. Average pay, but slow in raises."
good,"Comprehensive benefits package, great people to work with, and a great office environment. Pay is good and there is room for growth and advancement..."
good,"Very stressful and overworked however great benefits."
good,"Good place to work, however, since being taken over by Nationwide, things have changed and continue to change at rapid rate.  Not sure of the direction long term."
good,"Good place to explore and learn new technologies, Good and friendly work atmosphere , Management is good and friendly it adapts to new changes in technology encourages ideas of employees"
good,Nationwide is a great place to grow and learn about insurance.  Which makes it easy to go to work and learn to products and systems.  Given and opportunity would have
good,"There are several departments within the company to work for, each department has different functions.  The department that I was in was very routine, each day it was the same thing over and over again."
good,"Just like any major corporation, it has its ups and downs. It overall had room for advancement but being a larger company had more competition. direct management was great!"
good,The individuals that I worked with were great.  I built lots of relationships with co-workers while I was there.  If you engage with your team it is a great place to work.
good,I would encourage others to seek and consider employment with Nationwide. It has offers a lot of opportunity for growth and development as well as employee benefits.
good,Had a good experience working here. Worked as a customer service representative and enjoyed working with customers. Helped me to cultivate organizational and people skills.
good,"Very good company in terms of culture, coworkers and until a major reorg, seemed to have opportunities for advancement.  If the pay had not been less than competitive, I would never have left."
good,"be ready to work hard and learn fast but if you are doing well, you will be treated well and will have fun. If not you will be pushed out slowly. You have yo be willing to ask for help and utilize the tools given to you"
good,Good company.  Good training.  Good pay and benefits.  Really enjoyed the co-workers and management.  Customer and employee focused.  I would recommend this company.
good,Great company.  Various jobs with several locations across the nation.  Pay is competitive and great benefits.  You will fall in love when you walk into the building.
good,The benefits package at Nationwide Insurance is the main thing I miss. There were incentives for maintaining good health as well as a 401 (k) program.
good,"Productive and fun workplace with people, I gain knowledge with this client as well as work location also good. "
good,"I started at Nationwide as a rookie programmer right out of college. I was a mainframe programmer in claims processing and a programmer for a distributed auto policy system.  I analyzed requirements,wrote program specifications and I tested.  I led projects of all sizes.  Customers are the number one priority.  After working for Nationwide for 12 years, a group of us was outsourced to IBM."
good,This is a nice play to work with a lot of opportunities. I like working here. If you can relocate a lot of opportunities exist.
good,Great company to work. Excellent training and great management. Nationwide provides great opportunities and excellent benefits. The training that you receive to become a licensed agent is amazing.
good,Started new agency and was given good support on getting the office up and running. Most difficult part of job was recruiting sales agents.
good,Good stable company with and ever evolving company plan. This company is not as profit driven as it had been under different regimes. The customer is being put back where they should be.
good,"Nationwide provides their associates with a great work environment.They have a great facility, and their managers are always willing to help you. I appreciated the opportunity to learn from many people throughout the company."
good,"I think that provided more opportunity, more branding, more publicity, the job could have been much better. Recognition always motivates people. Rewards are great incentives."
good,"Great culture, fantastic friendly environment, lots of helpful people around who are willing to help you pitch your ideas."
good,"Typical day included providing great customer service and handling and settling homeowner claims."
good,The workplace is a good enviornment the management is great and very interactive and the work enviornment was very interactive but you have to be willing to be on the phones all day and in a fast paced enviornment so you can keep up your stats
good,"Assisted the adjusters within the claims department with proprietary software to assess the monetary amount a claim is worth. Discussed injury types, prior awards and reserve adjusting to properly set the maximum reserve of the claim. Knowledge of injuries and similar claim types to review the award process.  Recommended award amounts to the adjuster with reports regarding particular claims"
good,I really enjoyed working in an environment that gave me an opportunity for growth. I was able to work under little supervision and made great advances at adding on customers to our place of business.
good,"The majority of people are great but there are some that treat contractors like second class citizens."
good,"Received great training.  Had wonderful supervisors. Good perks but parking is a challenge in the area unless you can get a space in the NW Garage.  Also, traffic horrible when local sports taking place and large scale events like Red White & Boom, Arts Festivals and other events that the place in the heart of downtown Columbus Ohio"
good,I love the people I had the opportunity to meet and be around on a daily basis. Nationwide has great benefits. They love people to love their job/career. Groups were selected to come up with ways to improve the company's stability
good,"I learned a lot about insurance, office work, and making deposits. I really enjoyed working events and working with customers. Very good office hours."
good,"overall good company.  Local regional management does not adhere to the overall company vision and values."
good,"I was a contractor, so I was left out of the team meetings, and company functions.  Except for feeling left out, It was nice."
good,Nationwide is a good company to work for. Great benefits and great atmosphere. I had awesome coworkers who made the work day fun
good,This job really helped improve on skills that I am able to use later on in the workforce such as organization and time management. It also helped me improve on my customer service skills. I really enjoyed working here and I really enjoyed my co-workers as well.
good,Arriving at work around 8:00 am and some days staying until 8 or 9:00 pm just to try and stay caught up with bodily injury claims.  Auto Claims area was managed much much better and had more concern for their employees.  The hardest part of the job was trying to stay caught up and do a good job for your customers....again bodily injury claims.  Auto claims there was never really a hard part of the day....customers were enjoyable and thankful for what you were attempting to do for them.
good,"Dispatching daily claims to team members"
good,"The best part of my job is being able to be customer focus and problem solving. The customer are my main priority each and every day and is something that I thrive to do each day. My co workers are willingly to assist on any problem that I may be having. This company is big on engagement so, they plan social events for the company often. The hardest part of the job or I would rather say the most challenging part is figuring out how to correct errors that the company system has caused."
good,"The management works hard to train all of the employees to be the best that they could be.  It was hard trying to meet all of the expectations, but the feedback and encouragement made it worth it."
good,"Typical work day includes receiving new claims, evaluating coverage, responding to clients, and indemnifying effected parties."
good,"Typical day at work would include assigning work and joining the team huddle in the morning.  Then working the pending service requests in the Service Center queue.  Contacting customer and scheduling appointments."
good,"Enjoyed that every day was different, and loved playing a part in company sales growth."
good,"Nationwide is a fortune 100 company with great benefits. It is a people oriented company made up of teams with drive, ambition and goal oriented focus"
good,The job I do is tedious and repetitious. It requires sitting at a computer all day working on insurance policies. Processors are graded on quality and production. Processors who continually maintain high quality and productivity scores are allowed to work from home. There is also the opportunity to work a compressed work week in order to have an extra day off.
good,My contract experience at Nationwide was very positive.  My duties were an excellent match for my experience.  The overall environment was positive and I would recommend to friends and colleagues as a great place to work.
good,"Management staff was great, encouraged continuing education and preparation for leadership roles.  Values coaching and feedback as well as work life balance.  Helpful co-workers.  Job secuarity at its best.  Family atmosphere. Able to help others during times they need it most."
good,"The company is a pleasant place to work, however there is limited growth opportunities with recent company model changes."
good,Great company to be with.  They care about your life balance and my team members have been great to work with.  A typical day is to answer anywhere from 12-20 calls and explain the benefits and features of various insurance policies.  The management team is very helpful and supportive of your career growth within the company.  I would say the hardest part of the job is getting used to adhering to a strict timed schedule (when you can and can not leave your desk).
good,Good place to work. Co-workers were great and so were the clients.
good,The claims office in Chambersburg was the best job I ever had! Working with this group was like extended family with a lot of fun and work done at the same time.
good,Good place to work but going through corporate changes. Regional locations are also changing.
good,Nice place to work and my co-workers are good to work with.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers.  On the other hand the most enjoyable part is building relationships with my clients and being able help them with their insurance needs.
good,"Results oriented, performance driven strategic Human Resources leader with experience in: Employee Relations, Talent Acquisition & Management, Organizational Development & Design and Change Management across multiple industries and business environments.  Successful relationship builder and business partner to executives, management and employees in both field and corporate offices.  Ability to quickly identify business needs, develop solutions and implement initiatives/change plans to impact business results."
good,"Consistent handling a commercial auto claims, Assisting supervisor with assigning new claims, fielding questions from fellow associates, handling phone calls for myself and fellow associates"
good,Most of the people are wonderful at Nationwide. There are many people who want you to succeed.
good,The typical days were very busy and tended to be endless paperwork. Learned a lot about the insurance business.
good,A great place to work with friendly coworkers and leadership that wants nothing more than for you to excel within the company.
good,Management here tries to help but company needs to hire more people to help with the excessive volume Very nice people work here.
good,I've been working for Nationwide for 2 years now. It's good insurance company for work for long term.
good,"great company"
good,Reporting claims and helping people with their insurance issues. I learned about excel.

good,Productive and Fun Workplace. Management is helpful and training was good.
good,"Management cares about employees."
good,"Productive. cant please all the customers, co workers respected my job and and we all got along. Hardest part is making sure you succeed your goals. Most enjoyable we accomplishing our goals."
good,"A good place to work with good benefits.  The hard part is when on ""cat duty"",  incoming calls and long hours."
good,Very demanding and busy days that go by fast because the people you work with are great!
good,"Company standing rated high in industry. Many job opportunities."
good,Working at Nationwide has helped me to develop myself as a person and associate. From taking communication and presentation course to being apart of an engagement team. 
good,"Typical corporate setting, lots of opportunities to reach out and help the public"
good,Days typically went by fast due the high volume of customers.
good,Nationwide provides challenging work in a supportive environment
good,"A typical day at work consisted of managing claims, handing customers' payments, managing current business while completing new business quotas."
good,I enjoyed working here. Very family-oriented and a great experience.
good,worked on insurance policy renewals.
good,Nationwide is a Company that wants to be excellent but does not hire the right people to push the company to the next level.
good,Overall it was a good experience and I got to work with some talented individuals.
good,I worked here part time in college. It was nice to have flexible hours and I could do calling from my dorm room with documentation.
good,Quoted and sold personal lines products. Good co-workers and management. Good pay and benfits.
good,Worked with this company 8 years held multiple positions while employed with NW
good,Family oriented company and cares about the surrounding communities.
good,"Determined insurance eligibility under Maryland and District of Columbia laws by reviewing policies, claims, and other records."
good,Nationwide Insurance is a company that has small business startup values. When you work for Nationwide you felt as though you were working for a family fun business. Your opinion was listened to and they hired from with-in the organization.
good,Great group of people work at Nationwide. They have passion about what they do. They all work hard to make a great product for their members. I happy to be part of this team.
good,Nationwide is a great company that promotes giving back to the community. I have learned that the relationships you develop with co-workers are genuine and they want to see you succeed as much as you want to succeed.
good,I worked at nationwide while attending a job placement class in high school. The staff was helpful in teaching me good work habits and how a professional office runs
good,Nationwide is a wonderful company to work at. Management helps you as much as possible to enhance your career growth. Co-workers there work as a team. I learned to take advantage of any programs that can help you grow in the company and not be stagnant in one position.
good,Handling incoming calls and walk ins keeps the day moving quickly. Insurance is always changing and there are many details and nuances to each situation. Can be a rewarding career.
good,My time there was good. It is a very professional yet laid back environment. They definitely encouraged workers to perform to their best and rewarded hard work.
good,"Nationwide Insurance was overall a good company to work for.  I left because they were closing the local office and I was unable to relocate to another state."
good,"Leaving due to change in my responsibilities, was a field adjuster and the company moved to desk adjuster. Retained IA to inspect and provide narrative report, then took that information and wrote repair estimate"
good,"I worked in a independent agents office and he was very nice to work for. "
good,"Well organized,  good people.  Benefits are good too.  They are going through a difficult transition currently. So a lot of changes they are working on managing."
good,"Depends on your management....overall good company. I have had some decent leaders however there is no work/life balance....it is just balance so if you get to the wrong leader, you will be looked at wrongly for trying to be a parent/employee"
good,"As a consultant to a wide range of internal clients, I found the degree of happiness at work varied greatly between various departments.  Some areas are far more rigid and old fashion in their management while others are progressive and engaging. "
good,Nationwide has changed from and employee loyalty company to a bottom line company.  No person or associate has the security of job security anymore. I do not recommend this company.
good,Good climate but high turnover at management levels and other companies have more advertising and are cheaper. The turnover makes it difficult to train new employees on a system that is flawed and difficult to close business on line or over the phone. NW offices are all independent so my experiences will vary from office to office.
good,difficult job but management with an understanding for the demands of the job made it easier to handle. Mandatory OT at times due to natural disasters.
good,Your success and growth depends too much on the department your in and your supervisor.  The everyday job I did you are always learning which is fun but must have the right people around you.
good,I was not satisfied with the investigation of the claims and felt they just paid everything in spite of the liability. I preferred to investigate each and every claim and make decisions as to the liability. I was then told to just pay it.
good,"Each day is an experience, with new opportunities.  Working in IT there are various responsibilities which requires you to re-shuffle your priorities and be flexible to resolve new problems and/or new assignments.  This keeps each day interesting."
good,"The people at Nationwide are outstanding.  Great work environment.  Does require hard work with long hours at times.  Equipment, environment, tools to do your job, all first rate."
good,"Good job, no benefits, commission based. I learned a lot and would recommend it to anyone that is good in sales and can hustle. The more hours you put in the more you will make."
good,"During majority of my tenure, Nationwide was a great place to work with dedicated highly productive associates and lower level managers with unlimited opportunities to engage, learn, grow and promote up in position.  Most enjoyable parts of the job were the engaging partnerships and friendships developed amongst the associates and lower level management."
good,Expensive insurance for employees and high deductibles. Staff is divided. Office rarely engages in activities or holiday parties so employees do not get a chance to really bond or get to know one another.
good,"Was a decent a job, when I started out of High School, however as time continued, I realized that the health benefits and vacation were not really worth it. The pay was minimum but not enough management wouldn't allow any suggestions to better sales or provide training until it was the time when I said I was leaving."
good,"Some really good people to work with here, but alas career advancement was restricted as people filling roles came from outside rather than promoted from within"
good,Nationwide provides excellent training. They are encouraging in educational growth. Opportunities to advance are offered.  The workplace is engaging and interactive. The management team is hands on and supportive.
good,In worked in claims for over 15 years and the company as been closing claims offices ever since and is still at it. If you go to work here you better start your job search today.
good,Company is changing with the times and is reducing staff to stay competitive.  I like field work.  Your car is your office and your windshield is your window.
good,Overall good work life balance and benefits are competitive. Culture is great with a relationship oriented environment. Lots of meetings needed in order to make decisions but still a great place to work.
good,Good place to work.  Slow to adapt but overall not a bad place to consider.  Good culture. Takes care of their people. Compensation could be better. Parking downtown can be difficult and expensive.
good,Great place to work.  Company is employee focused and willing to train for advancement in most cases.  Nationwide is considered one of the best Companies to work for.
good,"no comment. typical work day, what you learned, management, work place culture, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of job working with friends"
good,Overall a good company to work for. I enjoyed my years with the company that I worked for. The workplace culture was good and I had the opportunity to become more knowledgeable in my career field of insurance.
good,"I had a great 19+ years with Nationwide.  They were very good to me over the years; offering me time off when I had triplets, being patient with my chronic health issue.  But there was work that needed to be done and you had to be accountable for that work.  I think that is fair and appreciate being rewarded for my good work and being held accountable where I fall short.  Good company, good people."
good,Fast paced environment but very stressful and slow to advance and slow to change. Management has poor communication skills which leads to slow advancement of projects and position.
good,"The work culture is fun and interactive. Nationwide is a great place to work, and it allows for me to gain new knowledge and skills necessary for advancing my career! Supportive management and positive work atmosphere."
good,"It just wasn't the right place for me. I worked there for 7 years in three separate positions, and didn't feel like I was any better for the time I put in with the company. I moved to a different field of work."
good,"Nationwide Insurance is a great company. The organization does a great job focusing on its employees and their satisfaction at work. Vacation days, and flexibility are great, benefits are pretty good as well.  Numbers and productivity are huge within the company, and the environment can be competitive. Diversity and Inclusion are emphasized, but more work could be done to bring more people of color into the workplace. If you make your voice heard and work hard, you can accomplish much with Nationwide."
good,Very stressful work environment where associates are consistently told that they are not completing enough. There is a persistent push for closing files when there is not enough staff and associates are buried with more files every month.
good,"I enjoyed this job and the people who worked there. I mostly enjoyed the customers and helping solve any issues they had. My boss was great and very helpful. Salary wasn't great. I did find that most days, I finished my work very early in the day"
good,It is a good place to work but is starting to focus more on minute details of the claims process than how to actually treat the people involved with the claim no consistancy with QA
good,Standard 40 hour work week. Work culture involves embracing change with roles and departments changing as needs shift. Meetings and presentations are minimal for individual contributors.
good,"Overall Nationwide is a good company with decent benefits. Metrics driven, instead of results driven. Nationwide strives to provide a good work life balance."
good,"This was a great place to work, but they are systematically dismantling all the benefits. Also, they are a large inefficient corporation that just realized its redundancies,so they are cutting waste and duplication. I can't blame them for getting efficient, but every day there is another unit that got laid off."
good,Enjoyed my time with Nationwide however constantly going through changes.They are unsure of the direction they want to go. Pay was below average but great work place. People are nice and management is good.
good,"There are so many different departments, work groups, and managers, that your experience at Nationwide is completely dependent on your exact role and manager. I've worked there more than 10 years, in 6 different roles, with a total of 10 different managers. I've had roles and managers that made me absolutely love working at Nationwide, and I've had roles and managers that made every day miserable. As a company, Nationwide offers fair pay and great benefits. There's no consistency in management across the organization or even within the same department."
good,Typical was relaxed day I learned different methods of Insurance how the billing system worked. Management was ok I think it could of been better as far as organizing the team and what was expected
good,"Nothing negative just lack of advancement without having to relocate."
good,"I didnt have a great experience with this company, mostly due to certain management styles. Some of them fell into their jobs and had no idea what they were doing or how to effectively manage people. A few of my direct managers would pass the buck to make themselves look good. Up until the issues with them I loved working for Nationwide. There is a possibility I would work for them again in the future, if given the opportunity."
good,"Be ready for challenges and constant change. As an administrative professional, in working for a C-Suite executive, schedules change, priorities can be changed in a moment's notice."
good,I enjoyed working at Nationwide. My fellow employees worked well together and collaboratively. My responsibilities involved addressing the needs of a diverse clientele. I received extensive training in communication and customer service.
good,"If you have tenor you will never get terminated no matter what the circumstances.  Upper mgt perceives the ""small guys"" as a ""dime a dozen"".  A typical day is clear as to what is required. Hardes part of the job is ""micro-managers"".  Able to flex hours and possibility of ""work from home."""
good,"Management is different. Workplace culture is different. it's very very competitive placed to work for. "
good,Check trouble tickets assist users with issues related to their servers. Create spreadsheets for server installations. Provision servers for installation.
good,"I work in a very collaborative and supportive environment. with a contemporary culture providing great tools to do my job. For many years there were exciting projects that changed the company in a positive way allowing us to grow and develop."
good,"A typical day at work consist of answering phones, filing, contacting leads, writing policies, etc. I enjoyed meeting new people and working with my boss. The hardest part of my job would be, not learning more about certain types of insurance policies before I moved on to my school job. Enjoyed my time there though."
good,I enjoyed working at nationwide and gained considerable technical knowledge and the co-workers were collaborated very well. i was looking towards continuing to work their. however i joined as a contractor and was not converted.
good,"The typical day at work involves providing customer services to Nationwide customers who were recently in an accident. The workload can be heavy. Nationwide as a company does well taking care of its employees in terms of benefits and morale. However, management is inconsistent across some levels."
good,"Nationwide is a good company to work for, but the problem is that you have to be willing to relocate regularly to advance in to upper level positions."
good,"Very good company and has great benefits, but at the end of the day it's all about numbers and work/life balance isn't the greatest. The job requires at least 10 hours on weekdays and 14-16 hours/day when in a Catastrophe situation if you want to be good. Culture also is a week point, as in there really isn't one. There are some great benefits to working for this company financially and most of the people are pleasant to work with. With all that said there may be better places to work, but are definitely worse and they are a reliable and consistent employer."
good,"I was 17 when i started. This job has it perks, fun environment love the manager. The Boss has his moments but still fun. You can advance with this company."
good,"They invest in their associates with necessary training."
good,A typical day at work means to spend half of my work days receiving property claims over the phone.  The second half of my work days are spent communicating with policyholders and resolving any  existing claims assigned to me for resolution.
good,Overall it was a very good place to work and everyone worked hard. There was a problem with turnover that was a constant issue. Most of management spent time training new people on a regular basis. Sometimes there was unrealistic demands put on managers and a constant pressure to be number one constantly
good,"Nationwide has been a great place to learn and grown as an Individual, but I would like to expand my knowledge within another company. Working for a Fortune Best 500 Company has been a honor, and I would like to transpose my knowledge of what has worked and what has not worked within another Business entity."
good,"Come in check phone messages, then call them back to proceed with what they are asking to be done.  Look at incoming email also answering or calling to get information that is needed, go over follow ups from day or week before making sure it was all done in a timely manner.  Answer any emails that may be follow up to problems that are being handled by out underwriters.  There are only 2 of us in the office and we enjoy working together and finishing up projects independently or as a team.  The hardest part is when people are upset and you do the absolute best you can to try and get the problem taken care of and the underwriters will not budge on keeping a policy.  Then you have to tell the insured that there is nothing we can do.   Most enjoyable part of the job is when I am able to helped our customer by going over and above what they would expect and treating them like I would want to be treated."
good,"At this job, I was able to form great work skills to help me thrive in current and future positions. This is where i was best able to ""get my feet wet"" in the insurance field, and customer service field."
good,"Typical day was on the phones with customers helping with policies, sufficient breaks, great hours, cafeteria with excellent food great co-workers"
good,I worked for Nationwide for over 20 years between Allied and Nationwide.  It was a good company to work for and had good benefits but toward the last they seem to only care about numbers and not the people that worked there.
good,"Handling multi-line property claims through independent adjuster and staff assignment. Policy/coverage analysis, Xactware usage, and correct estimating practices are daily operations. I also assist in officewide IT operations and  help train lesser experienced employees with claims procedures and policies."
good,Great company! I have been working here for a few years. They have great benefits and a pension. Great people work here and are very helpful. Very team oriented enviroment.
good,Typical big company with a lot of positions but a lot of moving and travel to move up in the company. I would be interested in coming back to work for this company one day.
good,"Sales and Customer service are key;"
good,Nationwide has a strong presence throughout Central Ohio and I am proud to work for such a great company.
good,"Daily management of roughly 150 pre-litigated claims files for primarily the downstate NY region.  "
good,Overall Good Company.  Leadership has the opportunity to be more adaptable to change. 
good,"Performed diversified and confidential secretarial and administrative duties in support of the Vice President of the Office of General Counsel.  Prepared letters, memos and/or reports, often of a confidential nature. Frequently composed and sent correspondence of moderate complexity without review.

good,"Working at Nationwide was an enjoyable experience.  I learned many things and many new job skills.  Nationwide cares about their employees and wants them to have the most enjoyable day that they can have."
good,"Good work/life balance, decent management, not a lot of chances for increased opportunity"
good,"High work volume, you need to work more than 8 hours a day, or not take a lunch to meet the department goals."
good,Management was understanding and easy to work for. My co-workers where also fun to work with during my shift.
good,Overall a good company to work for with compensation package given to its employees.
good,Nationwide is a large company with opportunities to move to other areas should you search them out.
good,"A typical work day for Nationwide, quoting business to prospective clients, following up on internet leads, policy and customer management, policy reviews, up sell, cross sell coverages. The management and co-workers were both good. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the content changes in the insurance industry but it was also the best."
good,"My typical day at work consist of working over the telephone, email, and using other databases to investigate claims. Customer service is 50% of my performance objectives. I have received awesome training and work independently with my members and consumers on a daily basis. I love my manager because she allows me to independently make decisions that are best for the member and consumer. Not mention, she helps me develop and prepare for future career advancement. My co-workers are my extended family. We work hard and play hard together. The hardest part of my job is multi-tasking and handling several difficult duties during traditional business hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I'm challenged each day and learn new ways to approach different situations. Working at Nationwide has help me grow personally and professionally. However, training consultant opportunites are limited in the Raleigh area. However I am mobile."
good,Review quarterly and annual financial statements that are filed with the NAIC.
good,Colleagues are very nice and easy to work with. Very good working environment.
good,"Job eliminations are a regular occurrence at Nationwide. Overall, a good place to work, but don't allow yourself to become obsolete. Yearly job cuts.."
good,Work hard stay focused. Loved my original team. But my new team was a little lackluster. Original intern team worked on lots of code. New team made me pick up cards and do random errands revolving around software system. Not really much coding. Didn’t like it as much as original intern team.
good,I had the opportunity to work with some really professional QA managers who assigned me projects where I was able to learn new business functionality while also learning new tools to be able to deliver quality products to the business.
good,Only left due to aiming for higher. Loved the people that I worked with and the call center culture. Managers and supervisors were incredibly supportive and would go out of their way to help.
good,Provided great training to new Agents and offered  awesome and helpful customer service assistance when Agents were busy so that the customer would be taken care of right away. Easy quoting system. Overall I enjoyed working here.
good,"Overall a decent workplace, but pretty heavily micromanaged. It's awesome to work from home, which you get to in this position after about a year or so. The position expects a lot out of you that isn't always achievable."
good,"I left due to layoffs, but new job made me realize this place is the best job I have had. Highly engaged with coworkers, raises every year. Only thing here recently is that layoffs come once a year. I dodged twice. Management is ok, still corporate politics so you must play the game to succeed. Either way, coworkers become family and they help with coming to work everyday alot easier."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Nationwide, however I was offered a tantalizing position in NC. The management was great, they were a good company who cared about others"
good,Enjoyed the opportunity to work at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company as it offered a great deal of opportunities to grow and develop and establish strong work relationships.
good,"Although there are and abundance of opportunities,the competition is great.   Seeking the right position within the right organization to complement your skills is challenging due to the competitive nature."
good,"helping customers, agents with insurance policies, learning new things every day, great supervisors, friendly coworkers, upset customers, helping people"
good,"Nice place to work, a fast-paced and friendly environment.  Benefits were great, the pay could have been better for the level of work provided.  Overall experience was very educational."
good,Very cool work environment!! Highly recommended for an entry level position.  It is challenging sometimes however it will help you develop your professional skills.
good,it was wonderful experience in working with some exceptional people. The work life balance was not so great and the company culture could use so improvement.
good,"Company values work/life balance. However, they are focused on the top/bottom line over keeping talented employees. Once upper management changed, the culture and morale changed impacting the job security."
good,"My day is always exciting, fresh and educational with several daily challenges that have to be met. There is support from leadership and there is a general friendly culture."
good,Depending on department the stress levels changed. Claims being the highest. The same goes for management. Exp managers were great. New managers not so much.
good,Enjoyed experience base on leadership quality.   Constantly changing focus for IT.  Projects were started but not finished before a replacement target was begun.  Had to rewrite my job description several times to stay current.
good,"Enjoyable work environment that's family oriented. Competition, however, could be more competitive.  Management was great. Discounts were okay. Insurance was expensive."
good,"Nationwide Insurance has a great atmosphere. A great breeding ground for leaders and those who prefer a career in various forms of assistance. Days often feel routine. Come in, sign in, take calls. The culture of Nationwide is warm and comforting which compliments the day to day life. Everything is interconnected on some level. There are always open channels to various levels of management even leading up to our AVPs. This is easily the most enjoyable part of the job. You get to see that everyone in a higher position is human as well. This is often a glaring oversight. This, however, is also a large drawback. Many times, knowing your superiors on a near personal level, you often become numb to the line to the line between work and home and often receive a harsh step back to reality. Overall, Nationwide is quite a wonderful place to work and gain some new friends while learning more and more every single day."
good,I was able to grow may career and try new opportunities both on the business and IT side.  Nationwide is a large corporation and can require patience to navigate the politics that are inherent with large organizations.
good,"Good place to work for a time. Very little opportunity for advancement in current area, although multiple job opportunities in other areas.The workplace culture is passive aggressive and indecisive."
good,"Lots of meetings every day, some very good people trying to do good work. With budget, cuts, the squeeze is on now to get the most out of every associate by adding more responsibilities without commensurate pay."
good,"Manager was not a micro-manager"
good,"Opportunities to learn new technologies. "
good,"Good place to work and learn and compensation is average. The company doesn't offer WFH for contractors."
good,"Training was for 3 whole months and additional training are available if your performance is good on your responsible field. Entry level position but most of my colleague who I trained with got promoted or transferred to other high position or department after around a year and half. However, it was in Des Moines and not much challenge position so that I left to go back to school."
good,"Depending on your business unit and manager, things vary greatly.  You can have a manager who supports you and helps you advance, or you might not.  Everything is dependent upon who you know."
good,As a consultant at Nationwide I will say that the work / life balance was great but there was a lot of red-tape to try and get anything done.  The program I worked with was stalled for 3 years before I came on board and was a serious challenge to try and meet deadlines with the number of processes and meetings involved.
good,This company would be wonderful if we had good health insurance and better pay. We have deductible plans and it costs so much money to go to the doctor that I can't afford to pay for my medications. It is also very hard to move up. You have to know people and there are office politics which isn't fair for those who work very hard and for those who have work experience.
good,"This company encourages work life balance as well as accountability. The senior management focuses on good work rather than fast work. They are committed to ensuring their customer's are taken care of,"
good,"You will work hard and long hours, but the pay is good, the benefits are excellent and there is room for growth and advancement especially if you are willing to relocate.  The perks are amazing as you are offered all sorts of discounts including new car purchase discounts, theme park discounts, rental car discounts and numerous other things. They try very hard to make this an enjoyable work place and encourage community service opportunities for their employees, which include allowing you to participate in these types of activities during normal working hours."
good,"Nationwide is a great place to work on many different career levels.  There is also lot of employee engagement, diversity and inclusion. Nationwide employees strive to provide excellent customer service!"
good,"I enjoyed speaking with the policy holders and assisting them with any issues they may have on their policies, explaining the different coverages that we offer and helping them select the coverages that would best suit their needs."
good,"Nationwide has a good culture. Good fortune 100 company to work for. However, certain areas of the company are better than others. Claims was much more demanding than other areas."
good,"A typical day for me would be prioritizing my work load, answering phones calls from agents and our customer service department.  handling commercial accounts across all lines of business, and primarily working within Nationwide’s PCIO platform.  My job requires me to  accept, retain and price complex moderate to high exposure new, renewal  and endorsement commercial business policies based on granted authority. I provides technical direction and account expertise in the development and guidance of the my underwriting associates."
good,"Working at Nationwide can be great but like any major company there are pros and cons. They have great benefits and the pay is great. "
good,Not the place to work if you don't like a true sales environment.  It can be stressful but fun at the same time.  Goals are lofty to say the least.  Team managers are great for the most part.  Upper management no so much.
good,"Fantastic company. Great benefits."
good,"I would work there again. I enjoyed my time at Nationwide. Like any larger corporation, it's easy to feel as though you don't matter as an individual. You're there to be on Nationwide's side and not the other way around. Bad bosses can ruin good positions. But there are many good people there and that can help even the landscape."
good,"I worked as a contractor for Nationwide, for more than four years. Even though I was not a traditional employee, I always felt that I was treated with respect and fairness."
good,"Working at Nationwide has been a great experience. I work with some very knowledgeable people."
good,"The corporate culture is generally pretty good.  With aggressive expense targets, ""job security"" has become an obsolete term.  I highly recommend the company overall."
good,"Nationwide overall is a good place to work, the compensation could be more, but there's a lot of perks while working there. Overall I gave them a 4 just because of the lack of growth and management is decent."
good,The company has made many changes in the last several years that have impacted the Sacramento Region with a re-organization. There products have suffered as well as the relationship with the agents.
good,"Good place to work. Was a Contractor and left when my contract ended.  Very enjoyable work culture and managers were fair."
good,"Nationwide is a great company to work for.   Work load is an average of 25-30 claims per day.  Over the years working for Nationwide I have learned responsibility of working with little or no supervision and owning up to your mistakes.  Management for the most part is fair.   The hardest part of a Desk Reviewer is multitasking, while working claims you are also answer phones, emails, skpe and other co-workers questions.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people while they are in a unfortunate place and making their day a little easier."
good,Nationwide is a professional workplace to develop skills needed in the insurance world. They provide antiquate training and feedback for new associates and tenured representatives.
good,My Supervisors were always willing to go out of their way to assist me with any situation and help me to improve my knowledge. Nationwide would take the time to assist their employees with being prepared for the future.
good,Great working environment making a difference in peoples lives.  A group of coworkers that worked together as a team to find ways to improve the processes used on a daily basis.
good,My typical day at Nationwide Insurance was to review and adjust Roadside Assistance claims following the coverage on the member's policies. Nationwide has been a great start for a career in the insurance industry.
good,"A typical day, would consist of taking about 25 calls and making another 10. I learned how what our underwriting team is looking for when writing multiple products in one hope. I learned that any time a person has multiple assets to get them as much information as possible with out taking from their day. "
good,"The workload for Claims Specialist is grueling but fair based on the pay."
good,"Can be very rewarding, can also be extremely overwhelming and stressful.  Great coworkers.  You must be willing to hit the ground running, and work overtime from home."
good,Nationwide Insurance has really gone downhill over the last several years.  They aren't really on your side.  At least not their employees sides.  They close offices with long standing tenured employees.  Only certain people are on the fast track to promotion while others just wither away in their current positions.  Its really sad what this once great company has turned into.
good,Good place to work however no room for advancement.  I believe the office in Richmond will be closing in 2020.  Upper management is good however middle management needs work.
good,No cons this time ..Good fast paced intense environment and manager is strict but will listen to your concerns and support WFH when we need it very badly
good,"- Agile Methodology"
good,A typical day varied depending on workload and responsibilities. Sometimes incoming claims would require the majority of your day other times they would not it always varied.
good,I really enjoyed helping people. I am bilingual so it really made guest service better for the guest to understand as well as for myself. I really enjoyed learning new things about there.
good,"It was a job that I enjoyed for several years but towards the end I became very burnt out and passing QAs was either ""pass"" or ""fail"" and my morale sank when people who had worked for years and was known for giving great service was suddenly in danger of losing their job and then they closed the call center in my town."
good,"Awesome place overall to work, but some managers are still much more interested in asserting their authority and having their egos stroked than in furthering the organization."
good,"Get in at 8:30, answer emails for an hour, couple of meetings, lunch, work on projects for  few hours, another meeting, another hour of emails.  Most people leave by 5:30."
good,Good company to work for. they provide excellent training in their Columbus home office. Very competitive and they give you the tools you will need to succeed.
good,"Working at Nationwide has been great, they have been very good to me. Company car, 401k match, 19 days PTO, company phone, laptop and hands off approach."
good,"They are great to their employees, just don't pay as well as other carriers.  Some of the management shouldn't be in their positions but others are great"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Nationwide Insurance.  It was a fairly relaxed atmosphere and a challenging position.  My supervisor was always willing to give me new tasks, which was something I was looking for."
good,"Amazing work culture with scope to learn and improve your career."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist and help everyone that I came encounter with.  A typical day was retrieving voicemails, returning calls, paying medical bills and taking recorded statements."
good,"The job was part time in the summer, but it was a good way to start out in the work industry. The work flow was relaxed, but not enough to where you could slack off, the files were always organized alphabetically and by date, making it a lot easier to work well. The coworkers were quick and easy to get along with, as well as the occasional customer entering the building. There were times that the computers were a little bit slow and wok flow was completed a bit early, but that last remark was a knit pick."
good,"There is no limit as to what you can accomplish here.  You make your own schedule, are your own boss and the most difficult part of the job isn't even difficult if you apply yourself."
good,"good life work balance, but I seek for something more challenging. I was a developer. Go to the office and do what a developer do. workplace culture friendly"
good,"dedicated work force, although not always cooperative with new hires. Challenging insurance applications using legacy code with intricate logic dealing with discounts and general rate determination. Large IT staff working on many projects at same time.Some managers ride employees unnecessarily hard, and sometimes show their biases and preferences for certain employees"
good,"always being trained on the different sections of the department, therefore always learning.  Made some really good friends.  Management was familiar with what you were working on."
good,Claims is rough regardless of where you work. Constant change and reassignment of others claims to high performers because they can't keep up. The money is decent but the stress can be high in the claims department.
good,Great place to work. Really great work environment with unlimited resources to choose from if you can get them to assist you. Most senior I.T. personnel are very reserved about assisting but will set up training to assist you in understanding current processes.
good,"Great place to work, just not a lot of room for advancement without taking a pay cut. Management is easy too get along with. communication is somewhat lacking in most areas"
good,"Productive and fun workplace, dedicated to customer service, very dedicated to giving back to the community, active in United Way, food bank. Need to take better care of Associates."
good,"Needed to pay better for the work we've done, I was overwork an under paid during my time there. High demands and not given the correct guidance to get there."
good,I enjoy working for Nationwide. Total loss claims is very fast pace and high stress job. It can be a negative environment but fun at the same time. Management is laid back and flexible with your schedule.
good,It was fun environment. There was a lot of pressure to make quotas instead of quality of product. My work day consisted of selling nationwide products to customers via phone in a call center environment.
good,Spend most days on the computer and the phone. Working with clients who have just experienced motor vehicle accident. Conduct phone interviews to determine fault. Schedule damage estimates. Move claims as quickly as possible.
good,"Wonderful people and good benefits! The boss I have is great with family schedules and just knowing that there is life outside of work. The work is ok, it can be stressful at times."
good,"A great place to work and expand your skills. "
good,"Providing underwriting support to claims.  Assist product managers on projects, facilitate team meetings, and train /audit associates along with provide coaching to associates to identify areas of improvement to establish one call resolution to provide great service to the member"
good,"A typical work day was meeting and greeting the customer's, "
good,The overall workplace is amazing. Everyone is knowledgeable and helpful. The company has a good name and quality services for all the insurance needs.
good,"It was great meeting new people and making friends for life. Busy as a call center should be, learned how to multi-task using different computer systems while on a call. Must be self-motivated to move up in the company."
good,"I really enjoyed the nearly 3 years of employment at Nationwide.  While the job would at times would be high stress and volume, there was also opportunities to interact with co-workers.  I learned how to work on a high claim volume at a high pace."
good,"A typical work day consisted of answering phones and taking payments. The beginning of the month was the busiest time, but it was always manageable. The office manager was very efficient and kept everyone on track. My co-workers were pleasant and supportive. The hardest part of my job was dealing with people whose rates had increased without explanation. The most enjoyable part of my job was having a set schedule with weekends off and paid holidays."
good,A good mid-west insurance company to work.  Associates are a good mix of people with appropriate talent backed with Management support.
good,"Great place to work my sup sucked. The parking was a bear at times."
good,I have worked at a few places doing help desk support. Nationwide is one of the best companies that I have worked for. They care about their associates and do what they can to make sure that they are provided for. Management can make questionable decisions at times but that happens most anywhere. My co-workers are the best. We work hard to provide support to the entire company.
good,"We have an awesome game room, cafeteria, 24 hr gym. The atmosphere is really good and everyone likes each other and its really flexible and its really culture oriented"
good,"Used Microsoft's Office and other software applications to provide clerical support during the opening,maintaining, and escrow accounts."
good,"I worked in a contracted independent agency that worked exclusively with Nationwide. That ""independence"" provided a sense of freedom to create a very closely knit, friendly work atmosphere with my co-workers while still maintaining a sense of professionalism. However, the job security is minimal, because the existence of our position depended solely upon the ability of the agency owner to satisfy the company we were contracted under."
good,"A good company to invest your time. Lots of training and learning opportunities. Good management, if you are talented and lucky you can climb the ladder."
good,"Reviewed candidate pool, source, screen and submit qualified candidates to hiring mangers as they make their selection for candidates that they would like to interview."
good,"Nationwide is a good company to work for, however I feel as though advancement is a lacking focus to this company. There was definitely positives for working with Nationwide  but I want to be able to be recognize for hard and efficient qualities that I put into my work, working towards advancement within the company. A typical day includes not only member interaction but also engagement opportunities within peers that I would play a role in on my specific team. The hardest part of the job was not diversifying enough Its great to talk to members, but I believe there was many ways to be an asset in the workplace such as more processing focus, engagement focus and communication with peers and superiors."
good,Fairly good work culture.  Management was extremely competent and usually were very clear about what needed done.  Advancement and compensation were OK.
good,"Nationwide is a fantastic place to work... if you are an average performer and are comfortable with a very slow pace of change. This is not meant as a derogatory comment... most people are, by definition, average and thrive there. However, this does not foster a culture of innovation and progress."
good,I am ever so grateful for the experience and opportunities that I achieved there.   They encourage you to grow and have lots of opportunities for promotion.
good,Closely worked with developer's team. I got the opportunity to explore the technology. Shared knowledge among team members.
good,This job gave me the skills to not only learn how to be a problem solver; but also the knowledge to prevent my own problems in the future.
good,"Wonderful place to work with many opportunities for advancement.  Great co-workers that were willing help anyone in the department."
good,"•	Worked extensively on SQL, PL/SQL and very good exposure to Oracle 11g,10g ,9i, 8.x, Teradata 13 and, MS Access 2000"
good,Insurance is a dog eat dog world with many options.  Hard for scratch agents starting out.
good,A people-based organization with a forward thinking strategy.
good,"After working there for 7 1/2 years, I did see many changes along the way. Some good and most recently, not so good.  Management changed and nothing was put in place to recognize the Claims Service Representatives, from a positive perspective.  We were all just and number and were treated as such.  That aspect made for very unhappy and unappreciated workers.  We, as CSR's, were the 1st point of contact for our customers and I was very good at my job.  I had high marks, never was late and made my customers feel like they had called someone who truly cared about them.  My most enjoyable part of my job was the friendships that I had made. After being home with my kids for 10 years, it was a good transition in the beginning for me to ease into a part-time position.  The hardest part of the job was not being appreciated and when feedback was given, it was not taken into consideration.  It was all about the numbers!  If you have unhappy workers, then how can you have happy customers?"
good,"Made Reasonalble procedure exceptions to accommodate unusual customer request, prvided accurate and appropriate information in response to customer inquires, developed effective realtionships with all call center departments through clear communication, built cusotmer loyaly by placing follow-up calls for customers who reported product issues, and properly directed inbound calls in phone ques to improve call flow"
good,Get an insured back to where they were prior to the loss and they tell me thank you
good,"I met a lot of good, solid people there. Management differed depending on you had. Some were promoted out of harm's way. Others were fantastic. The buildings are really nice inside (atrium, two cafeterias, access to other eateries, a library, workout area, card shop, etc.)"
good,Good place to work.  I worked for an independent agent so I cannot give much insight into the corporate side of the company.  So far I have enjoyed the working atmosphere.
good,"*typical day: at my desk dealing with customers on the phone, doing paper work and working on the computer"
good,Great management and co workers
good,"I learned many things, skills, and values at Nationwide insurance. Finished up a couple of degrees and professional certificate programs there. I felt well-rounded there at Nationwide."
good,Company offers great benefits and an environment conducive to networking. People are valued.
good,I gave them my very best and they cared for me and my family.
good,"Great company to work for! Excellent group training classes, engagement activities and weekly meetings with your supervisor. Great benefits and paid time off available."
good,"Good benefits, informative internal website for associates, job opportunities throughout country if willing to relocate.   Lots of opportunities for volunteer service"
good,"It's a good place to work, the advancement is slow pay is okay. "
good,The workload is manageable if one is focused on learning the material and putting in the time to succeed. Several competitive benefits. Upper management can sometimes make questionable decisions that affect employees.
good,"As an associate, there's potential for advancement.  However, I think one could advance further if management lead and assisted in your professional and personal development."
good,People make an extra effort to stay engaged with one another. There is advancement opportunities if you make the effort and are intentional about what you want.
good,"I have been here 23 years and its been a good experience, both form technical standpoint and learning about surplus lines insurance. I would stay if not trying to relocated to northern NC to be near family. Thanks"
good,Customer and employee focused culture. Everyday associates are given the opportunity to do what they do best. Nationwide is supportive of their employees and encourages cross training and development
good,"Nice management staff and pleasant place to work."
good,"I spent the whole summer training with Nationwide and it was very fast paced! A lot of info to understand, but a great work environment. The hardest part was dealing with difficult members, but every job has them!"
good,"Nationwide was my first civilian job after leaving the military.  It was a good introduction to the workforce.  I learned that leadership roles are different, and the way in which you engage with your peers is different as well."
good,"Nationwide is seeking to make changes, moving to the cloud and streamlining their process to become more competitive. A day in the life of an employee usually involves a standup meeting and at least one weekly team meeting to cover retrospective, priority, or to review active work items."
good,"Took this job straight out of grad school and have learned a lot and grown as a professional. Easy to feel burnt out in customer service within a year or two. "
good,Felt that everyone within my team was willing to help and contribute to the team's goals. Learned how to speak on the phone and conduct business in a professional manner with different agents throughout Nationwide.
good,High volume claims with expectations of quick turn around and settlement.  Enjoy working with people and turning a negative situation into a positive one. Hardest part is managing claim volume while trying to give fast and effective customer service in a timely fashion.
good,"With infrastructure moving to the cloud, so time to look for something new.  The company itself is very good, with benefits, pension, 401k matching.   The uncertainty in the IT department has led to a few looking for opportunities outside of the company."
good,"One of the best places to work in Columbus, OH (USA) if you want to learn and apply your Agile/Scrum skills.  Great growth prospects and employment benefits."
good,"Overall, this is a great place to work.  The company lives its values and has a strong culture.  Networking is the key to making moves within the company."
good,"Agile approach was aided by workplace set-up... helped aid in team building and project involvement.  Cleveland area offices/jobs integrated into Columbus HQ, though."
good,"People friendly company that values it's associates.  There is a definite separation between executives and associates.  Makes it difficult to bridge when your leaders don't understand some of the core of what you do and how to represent your best interests."
good,"My job was to complete started projects, initiate projects for the Director, collect requirements and deliver them.  Working downtown was difficult."
good,"Nationwide provides career development paths, courses with skills assessment, and mentoring- all available to associates.  There is an expectation for associates to participate in what is offered, supporting management of their career goals."
good,"Good company, great work experience . Educational and nice working culture. Overall good area and coworkers. Management is easy going and fair to all employees"
good,I enjoyed working.  The culture is kind and it's a Nice place.  10 years of service.  I had many opportunities.  I learned a great deal and gained experience.
good,"They were very flexible with scheduling. Team leaders were very easy to work with. We were able to have team outings with our co workers, we were close and had celebration once a month for birthdays."
good,With this company a short time.   Good experience and training.   Good benefits.   Moderate pay.   Would recommend if asked.  Free Car and Gas.  Time off.
good,"The company is highly driven to change/improvement. Positions are highly competitive. Benefits are great, but pay is below industry average. Most professional advancement is determined by popularity more than on merit."
good,They give you the ability to work via an alternative work environment and give you the latitude to manage employees in the manner ones feels best but also offer support and guidance to the same.
good,"I was fortunate to work at the Canton Ohio office location.  The culture there was a true family atmosphere.  Many of the associates had 20+ years of employment with the company.  I started with Nationwide as part of my high school placement program when I was entering my senior year of high school.  I was able to complete my degree with the education assistance offered by the company, and remained with the company, progressing through various levels of responsibility to my current job of Personal Lines Underwriting Manager.   "
good,My last role was as an IT Architect in Infrastructure & Operations.  I really enjoyed the collaboration and camaraderie within the work group.  Projects were interesting and engaging.
good,Good working environment and great associates. I enjoyed my time working at Nationwide.  Management was always available and they provided the necessary tools to perform your job.   They promoted team and have various activities for team building
good,I would  go back any day. The culture is relaxed and less stressful yet competitive and ideal place to groom yourself. Also probably the best place to learn agile methodology.
good,Internship was really open ended experience. Great company work environment. Hardest part of the internship was the lack of structure and expectations
good,"Great local team to work with. Everyone was family oriented and stable. Very Supportive. Company destroyed local office base which separated local teams from each other as home based causing loss of face time with associates. Very damaging to morale, but of course saved the corporation millions to pay out as bonuses to corporate figure heads."
good,"In my position (Processor) we have minimal freedom to get up and move around. We are required to be at the desk almost the entirety of our shift. Management is hyper focused on production and meeting challenging goals. Not every department is the same of course, and I more enjoyed previous positions at the company. Benefits are a huge plus. This position pays well for entry level work that doesn't require any experience. I do feel like management goes through my day with a fine toothed comb though."
good,Besides working a second shift and having to work Saturdays. Get the option of working four ten hour hour days (with 45 min break. Plus 20 mins to do off phone work to tie up loose ends. 45 unpaid lunch) or 5 8 hour days (with 30 min break 15 off phone and same lunch) breaks can be split up how you want or joined. For the most part you're left alone to work and as long as your numbers are good it stays that way.  Training lasts about 10 weeks and they like to say 75% of what you learn is outside the classroom. Can feel overwhelming at first but that goes quick. Healthcare is expensive and confusing causing you to pay more. Job is about who you know and click with.
good,Enjoy the opportunity of providing customer service to our members. I enjoy working in the field scheduling my appointments. During times of heavy claims volume hours can be lengthy.
good,Nationwide has a good culture of supporting it's people but it is definitely lacking when it comes to technology and innovation. Currently I work in the business support department and I am working off spreadsheets and there is a current struggle of writing down and documenting processes. I also didn't receive a raise for a promotion to a higher pay band and was told it was due to moving within the same business unit but a peer who is male received one after making the same move. I feel like the BU I'm in currently is just frustrating but the culture and personal lines business unit is pretty up to date.
good,Nationwide has great benefits and supports their associates.  The culture is excellent and I would recommend the company to anyone searching for employment.
good,Good company that is going through changes. The leadership is strong and will drive profits to the company. Coworkers are friendly and there is room to grow in the company.
good,"Great place to work, would love to work here permanently. Nice location, good team to work with, very cordial place, everyone was nice. Project was properly set up and managed."
good,Options for advancement is not that great at the location. Can be very busy at times where you have to work more than you average work hours. Sometimes the stress level can get very high in the position.
good,Working at Nationwide Insurance laid the foundation for learning as much as I did about the Financial Services Industry.  The opportunities were many to learn and process all that came my way.
good,nice work life balance . the team and colleagues at nationwide are very supportive and fun to work with. Provides a nice learning while working atmosphere.
good,"Fast paced with a lot of change.  There are good benefits and job security.  However, with change comes some turnover.  There is a lot of team building activities."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with daily. The culture at Nationwide is good - we care about our members as well as our associates.
good,"A typical day could be very fast going, and timeliness is a must. To be successful. Manager's typically offer guidance, and progress checks. Business professional in a upbeat facility. Some challenges would be quota, and being"
good,"Stable. Benefits. Salary. The pay wass good, the benefits were good, time off included and anything in insurance is typically pretty stable. Offered training for licensing."
good,"Good place to get started. However, major changes in the IT structure. Since they are unwilling to pay a competitive salary to keep their talent, developers are expected to do everything from infrastructure work to admin work... with very little development work. It's okay if that's what you want to do."
good,Very good place to work and learn. cutting edge technologies used and enough mentors to seek the guidance is available within the organization and teams. A very collaborative work environment.
good,". . . until management outsourced the work of my department and 18 of us were laid off.  We had a close group, many of whom have been in the unit for over 15 years.  The former company culture precluded layoffs but, unfortunately, the current culture does not."
good,"Culture is great, pay is decent, advancement is hard but the work life balance is excellent. if you are in the right stage in life it is could be exactly what you need but if your looking to get rich, not the place"
good,I worked at a extension office.  It was only open a few months and closed due to not enough traffic to keep it open.  There is still a office close but too far for me to travel at the time.
good,"Although work/life balance is difficult, overall, the company is a great place to work.  Good benefits, vacation and time off awarded is sufficient.  You get what you put into the job.  Work hard-get recognized and promoted.  No work ethic=left behind"
good,Relaxed environment. Slow changes. Job alignment isn't the best and career advancement can be difficult if you're not a sociable person. Leadership could be better at guiding associates in the path they want to take rather than trying to get them to do things they want them to do.
good,"took payments, adjusted insurance policies according to client needs, took care of home, auto, specialized policies. faxed insurance binders to loan companies as requested and made sure the customer was happy with my work."
good,"Good culture to work, great team environment with good life to work balance. New opportunity to learn new things each day with engaged associates and management."
good,"Management was involved with associates to make sure that work was completed on a consistent basis.  Fast paced, with always new work to complete.  Friendly environment."
good,Great people; stable management; strong culture; supports customer advocacy; socially responsible; minimal opportunities for growth and extreme expense pressure
good,I enjoyed working for Nationwide and gained a lot of experience. I was very saddened when they decided to pull out their business in FL after the 2008 hurricane season.
good,I was engaged as a contracted project manager to augment an in-flight project affecting 5-6 of the business divisions. The exposure to the various divisions was educational as well as enlightening.
good,"Fast paced and stressful work environment. There is an emphasis upon employee engagement. There is opportunity to advance but at times, leadership will discourage to movement to different business units."
good,"Nationwide is a diverse organization that lives its core values.  They hire qualified candidates from within, and encourage professional growth with Enterprise-wide training curriculum and tuition reimbursement."
good,The benefits and company is great overall but the insurance industry is taking a direction with an unknown direction due to technology and current law.
good,"Good culture, in the midst of focusing and changing for the future in a tough economical climate.  Caring environment focused on staff development.  Slow to change but increasing pace."
good,Our work day is preplanned. This company prides itself on being adaptable to families. Very flexible schedules along with great benefits for your family. The easier part of the down is the organization on how you receive your work. The hardest part is dealing with quality and having that self-discovery in place when you fail to complete a task correctly. It's not just tasks what we completing each day. These are people's livelihoods that we are in control of.
good,"Good Place to work. Work life balance."
good,Address incoming contingent workforce requisitions and inquiries to meet the needs of the internal customer. Learned project management and day-to-day use of vendor management system (VMS) tool. Workplace fostered a culture with performance and core values in mind with all activities. Working with the vast majority of the diverse and professional associate community was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"There are small cells within Nationwide that are innovative but progress is stymied by reactionary policies, lack of cross training and time spent with end users.  "
good,"As with many large companies, they tend to go through reorganizations but make a point of finding a spot for the individuals affected by them. There is no standard of pay or responsibility throughout the organization, though, and some departments are taken for granted over others."
good,"Nationwide is a good company. I would recommend the company. The company is diverse and have good training programs. In my position, you do reach a cap in development and opportunity."
good,"I like working for Nationwide, but they moved the claims offices to Dallas which is why I had to change jobs.  The hardest part is when it rained and I had to work multiple multi-car pile up claims"
good,Good company. Good work/life balance. Good benefits.  Management needs some tweaking. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the policyholders during a difficult time.
good,"Limited advancement opportunities, unless you are open to relocation. Management listens to employees and promotes family environment.  Enjoyed working and interacting with associates."
good,Great company and work life balance. The flexibility is good has become more attentive to having remote workers as well as work from home opportunities.
good,Great place to start my professional liffe. Open culture with opportunity to prove one's self. Found the people to be open and ready to assist. I would recommend them to anyone.
good,"A typical day is very structured, but can change on a dime as someone walks in the door.  I learned to find a way when there seems no way, to seek a resolution for whatever is presented in front of you.  I learned to become a problem solver, that there is an answer to every problem as long as you investigate all your options.  The culture of an agency is whatever you make it.  "
good,The intensity of the job was always present along with long hours and stretch goals.  Management leadership was inconsistent.   At times goals conflicted .  Overall a very strong company but challenged with communications.
good,"Great progressive company that truly takes into account employee feedback. I've learned a great deal through the various training opportunities. I have been challenged through the numerous changes, but it's reminded me of the importance of remaining nimble in an industry that must follow the lead of consumers."
good,"Check email, Job Requisition & agent order inbox's. If job req. not completed call and get information needed. Enter new jobs, give to assigned designer. Answer phone and customer service, job reports, filing, stuffing, receive print material delivery from printer and deliver material to customer, scheduling meetings, update gantt (job listing), reorder material to printer, pull print material from agents request and sent files to printer. Make out shipping forms for mail room."
good,"During my time with Nationwide, I have had the opportunity to work in two different positions. While both were challenging, I am looking to try something and start somewhere new. The environment that I work in is great and I have reliable coworkers who I trust both personally and professionally. The most rewarding part of my job is trying to resolve pain points brought up by our internal associates and feeling as though things are being accomplished."
good,"Nationwide pays below market value at just about every position in the company. This is balanced by the fact that associates are not expected to take work home with them, vacation time is generous, and culture is laid back yet productive."
good,They spend the money and time to train and equip their staff.  Although as a field adjuster you can forgotten about until there is a problem. Definite freedom to make your own schedule as a field adjuster.
good,"Pay was great, lots of perks, nice campus. Downside is call volume is high and they keep track of every aspect of your call like crazy. If you're used to working in call centers then this will be great for you."
good,"Nationwide is a great company to work for, but if you want to move up you have to do it quickly and be on the inside circles. The benefits are good if you don't go to the doctor often."
good,A strong work ethic is important. Many roles are fast paced and technical. Excellent communication skills are highly valued. The company promotes from within most of the time.
good,"Professional co-workers ."
good,Productive and Family Oriented Environment where there is plenty opportunities for advancement. Job security is not an issue and management is extremely efficient.
good,Awesome team members here. Everyone seems to motivate everyone. Supervisors care about you and your work and constantly follow up with you on how you are doing.
good,"Good place to work, the interview process was short due to the fact it was for a temporary contracting position.  The compensation was fantastic.  I appreciated the workspace provided for me as well as the laptop.  Lot's of little perks that makes working there fun with young professionals.  It's located downtown so plan on paying for parking."
good,"Making a solid effort to do what is right for the customers, agents and employees. Benefits are good as is the management team."
good,Have worked in three different area's of the company and am generally happy here. Need more areas of advancement within the company's different state locations.
good,"i love working for enterprise i loved my manger and the people that work there, you really become a family working close together. it's just the wages for the work performed just does not cut it for me."
good,Nationwide was a great place to learn so much about insurance policies. Great co-workers. Helped agents from different states in adding or removing vehicles. Management was okay and the most enjoyable part of the job was the fun we had when we worked on a holiday or weekend.
good,Nationwide is a good place to work.  They expect a full 8 hours of work from everyone but they were fair.  Part of the reason I stayed at the company for so long was my co workers.  The hardest part of the job was the major changes within the company and new system changes.  There were many changes in my last two years but the upgrades were needed.
good,Great place to work. Completely agile workplace. Lunch café located inside building. Everyone is nice and laid back. Documentation could be more stringent for requirements.
good,"I enjoyed the everyday challenges while working at Nationwide. Coworkers were friendly and always willing to help. Management does show appreciation for associates, but will address underperforming individuals. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships established and continuous associate engagement events to boost morale in the office."
good,"Good amount of work flow to keep me busy, but not overwhelming. Challenging opportunities to design, code, and implement. Many facets to the job, keeping things more interesting."
good,"Nationwide is a great company to work for (or at least it was when I was employed). They value their employee's growth and have many opportunities to help their employees learn and grow. Tuition reimbursement, work/life balance and non-competitive company culture are strong points worth mentioning."
good,"Company offers plenty of active and fun things to do everyday, The company promotes fun at work and how can they do better"
good,Typical day of work is busy. Answered and assisted incoming and outgoing client calls. Worked and coordinated with Insurance agents to schedule prospective clients. I handled a variety of customer service and administrative tasks and resolve customer issues.
good,Great place to work when you are in college and they promote internally or they did then. Still have friends from back then that still work there and are adjusters.
good,"Managed employee work and telephone schedules daily.  Monitored work volumes and ensured proper distribution in order to be productive and meet strict deadlines. Budgeted to monthly expenses, and reduced expenses by implementing new procedures to save the company money."
good,"•	Maintained Licenses and knowledge of laws in 48 States."
good,"No Micro management, you are trusted to complete the work needed in time."
good,"Supported senior executives with operational activities for two, corporate-level, 50+ staff teams which provided technology, software, hardware, development and support for all Nationwide customer service centers, Nationwide.com and mobile applications. Implemented changes in financial management and metrics management which improved consistency, ease-of-use and executive reporting; resulting in a better ability to react, respond and see potential issues prior to fruition. Please see resume for complete Nationwide work experience."
good,"A day in the life of a claims adjuster at Nationwide is a fast paced and challenging enviroment. On a daily basis you can balance your time between working on newly assigned claims, your claims that you have and are following up with on the status of with customers, working with lien holders and attorney's and also any projects that you are working on. The hardest thing about this position is making sure you have enough time to complete all that you need to get do in a day, but is also keeps you on your toes making sure that you can multi task. The co-workers are amazing and certainly help get you through the day.I really enjoy this work and getting the chance to speak with all the customers and helping them out to right the situation that they are in and educating them on insurance and explaining what I am going to be helping with."
good,Nationwide is a good and respectable company to work for. You just have to find the right agent for yourself.
good,"My days at work are very goal oriented, however I've always found time to take advantage of the online  courses, that our company has to offered. I've enjoy most working with the people and using my people skills for better service. My goal is to be the best employee, co-worker that I can be."
good,"great training, great pay, great compensations for work.  but if hired for one group of work could not transfer to other. i was part time, and they would not shift to full time. but they would hire full time people after you. even thou you were trained."
good,"Nationwide Insurance as a whole is a wonderful company to work for. There are several avenues within which one can move professionally, and the company provides a plethora of resources to support its associates. However, that culture doesn't completely translate to all of the company's satellite branches/locations. I've learned while being here that WHO you know matters just as much as WHAT you know, and that just doing your job well doesn't necessarily put you in a position to advance."
good,This is a call center environment solely driven by numbers.
good,"Working included offering auto, home and life insurance to prospective clients. Receiving and processing outbound calls and assisting clients with issues regarding their accounts. I've learned how to effectively manage the business functions of a company. It was always easy working with co-workers however it's important to maintain a good relationship due to the fact that you have to communicate with them on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was at times informing the client on their account because at times they did not understand but again it's important when communicating with clients to be clear and concise and try to assist them the best way you can. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I did everything I could do to help my co-workers and clients throughout the day."
good,"I enjoyed the work I was during, and it was a fun play to work, most of my work experience has been with Nationwide Insurance Company.  I knew my job and understood my job and also received training and took continue courses to help me in my job.  I am a hard worker and a team player. The hardest part of the job was the job elimination. "
good,"Working for a insurance company can have its days ."
good,It was excited to work with new version of HP tolls. Very friendly co-workers and was challenging to work performance testing team.
good,Good in Agile methodologies. Not much growth opportunity in QA.
good," At the beginning of a typical work day, when you arrived you would grab your time card fill out when you arrived and grab a packet full of numbers and start dialing. You would call explain who you were and talk to them about maybe switching with a cheaper quote. If it is so they would like to we then take down some quick information and put it in a box. Then have an agent call back with more information, and getting that handled. I have learned a little more about how insurance companies work with conditions of personal items or situations for customers. I sat at my own desk, had a window but it was an open area. No cubical. The enjoyable part was that I felt very welcomed and that encouraged me to work hard."
good,Nationwide was a highly professional workplace with good benefits.
good,"Lets face it, insurance agents are not always liked, but if you can get past that, Nationwide is a decent place to work. However, the Amarillo center has closed since I worked there."
good,"One of the best places to work in Columbus, Ohio."
good,"Not my cup of tea. Too many layers of management, too much politics and very hard to get anything done."
good,"I have returned to Nationwide Insurance several times over the course of my career because of the great people and the good benefits. My most recent position was a property and casualty claims quality control position, in which subrogation opportunities were the focus. It was rewarding to have such an impact on the company's bottom line through identifying and collecting missed subrogation dollars from responsible parties."
good,I have overall enjoyed working for Nationwide. It has become the company that I have been with the longest in my career. I have developled many skills and techniques from the extensive library of knowledge the company provides. I have also gained many friends and connections through my years with the company. The hardest part of my job with Nationwide is having to say goodbye after 12 years. I have seen many others come and go but I know that Nationwides strength will keep it in the forefront of the insurance industry. I would say the most enjoyable part of my tenure with Nationwide would be working with others and celebrating the acomplishments we've reached.
good,Nationwide value people
good,"Support teams are involved with all aspects of resolving issues quickly.  Although, at times we had more outages than coverage, we were able to handle issues with the cooperation of several other teams on shift that assisted in starting calls for resolutions."
good,"Nationwide offers a lot of great benefits to associates and incentives for personal development. They say they rank high for work-life balance, but starting out you do not get hardly any vacation time and work from home is only offered in certain departments. Overall, it is a great company to work for if you're interested in climbing the corporate ladder."
good,"The company genuinely cares about the associates, but rarely pushes the boundaries of what can be done to support associates and members. Many of the perks and benefits are par for the course, but the people you work with are great and caring individuals."
good,"I worked at Nationwide, for 13.5 years.  They must have great recruiters, and interview personnel, as 99% of the employees are very good people, and great to work with."
good,"Typical day at work team meetings daily, friendly smiles and great teamwork. Management always giving feedback for the team and personal roles. Times can be fast paced and chaotic and other times will be slow and relaxed."
good,Overall a great company to work for.  However there are transition pains from old school Nationwide to something they want to be.  Very political / process driven.
good,Generally good people. Clean space. Lots of opportunities. Internal procedures could use some adjusting. It was difficult to create opportunies for lasting change because of so many disjointed elemetns
good,"At Nationwide my job was productive and challenging work; Nationwide is committed to developing their employees into leaders, team building, and diversity."
good,Good company to work within a traditional insurance company. A good place to start a career or finish a career. They put to go use the practice of Agile but had ways to still improve further
good,I started in an entry level position at Nationwide and was exceptionally trained. I was also mentored by the Attorney I worked with and was able to grow and learn. Overall my experience working at Nationwide was positive.
good,"I am hopeful that Nationwide IT will succeed in their journey of change. With a desire to divest itself of IT infrastructure, the company is pushing hard and fast to move to the cloud."
good,Management positions were based upon job knowledge and personal relationships with employees.  Job training was sufficient for college-level education but fall short on developing skills needed for Mid- Management and Upper Management development.
good,"Nationwide encapsulates an environment that is development driven. Engagement is interwoven into the HR structure from top down. It is our company culture to routinely participate in community service responsibilities. Throughout my journal, I have gained priceless KSAO's which lead me to pursuing my degree of Industrial and Organizational Psychology from Purdue University. Meaningfulness in ingrained in every role at NW. They help to support a healthy work-life balance. Its a great place to work!"
good,"Fast paced work environment with plenty of room for growth. Friendly culture, but lacking in work life balance. Mandatory overtime hours almost weekly- reaching up to 84 hours a week. Aside from poor work life balance- it was a positive working experience."
good,"It's a decent job but, the diversity within the company is significantly low besides that its a decent company to work for. Working hours are Monday through Friday."
good,Overall good company to work for. Work life balance is a plus.  Room for advancement is good. Leader provides a conducive environment for development.
good,"Great people, great work life balance, compensation is on low end. Technology and ability to do work functions based on technology is problematic.  Overall I like the work culture, but too many limitations to be able to do work functions properly."
good,I really enjoyed my twelve years at VIP/ Nationwide Pet Insurance.  I learned a tremendous amount of responsibility in all the departments I had the pleasure to be part of.
good,Good place to work. Our department manager decided to utilize lawyers for the subrogation role. Those of us who were not lawyers were encouraged to move to other areas.  I chose to go elsewhere for more money and change of pace.
good,"Nationwide Insurance is a great company to work for. Great benefits, decent pay, and opportunities for growth exist. Supervisors are also great as well"
good,"I worked at Nationwide for 5 years in the personal lines and commercial lines departments, including 2 yeas in management.  The actual claims job was similar to any other...high frequency that requires detail and overtime work to stay on top off.  That is claims.  If you arent ready for that.  You wont be happy there."
good,"I have very much enjoyed working at Nationwide for a number of years; however, have recently learned that my position has been eliminated due to budgeting/expense constraints. Otherwise, I would not be seeking alternative employment. The workloads are generally manageable and expectations as to work performance are clear. People do their best to produce quality work and to live by the company values in everything they do. The benefits are commensurate with other employers in the insurance industry."
good,"If you have the right approach and demeanor, this is a great place to work!  Insurance is not for everyone, however Nationwide has always treated me well."
good,"Nationwide is a great place to work.  The company has a strong culture of caring about the employees and giving back to the community.  During my tenure, I held several positions that increased my insurance knowledge and helped me grow as a leader.  There are always opportunities to learn and develop."
good,"Typical day at work was pretty much the same as far as filing claims went."
good,"A great place to work.  Inclusive & collaborative culture.  Nationwide's focus is about transitioning into the future to be able to provide customers with the products that they need, while still being profitable and a great place to work for it's employees."
good,"Nationwide is a great company to work for, and has provided me with as much work-life balance as I could hope for in the corporate world, however I know that varies from role to role."
good,"Overall this was a great job, immediate management was the only reason I left, however the culture was amazing and inclusive. The job itself was very rewarding if you were willing to put in the work."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Nationwide. They offered a good job work/life balance and I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  Very busy, always work to do, but rarely had to put in OT."
good,"Good work life balance and ability to control and dictate your daily schedule.  Health, Dental, and Vision Insurance is top notch with multiple options for those."
good,"Nationwide was a very good company to work for, but I had another opportunity become available. It took me a while to adjust to working remotely; handling claims located west of the Mississippi while working in Boston."
good,"Excellent pay, benefits, pension and have always respected their culture and the way they treat their employees."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working across business units and establishing good business partner relationships. By building rapport with others, it may create new opportunities."
good,Nationwide is a good company and has a good culture.  I have never been asked to do anything I felt was immoral or illegal and people generally support each other.  No complaints.
good,"I learned a lot while working there, I became proficient in processing payments, processing and pulling files, scanning documents for various Businesses."
good,"I worked for Nationwide for about 8 years and held 3 different positions. I started off in claims as a processor. This is an entry level position that is often fast paced and thankless. However, your day goes by quickly. If you work hard and are good at what you do, you'll be appreciated by the adjusters that you support. Turnover is often high in these positions, but that is not a reflection on the company - it is typical in comparable roles in other insurance companies. Next, I was a Fiduciary Auditor in the P&C Sales department and finally, I was a procurement analyst. All 3 jobs, really had little to do with each other, so I feel like I was able to attain a diverse portfolio of experience within the same company."
good,This was a great company to work with! Company has a wonderful culture and stays true to its vision.  I would recommend this company to anyone in the Columbus area looking to be valued and appreciated.
good,"A typical  day at work included reviewing email, following up on commitments made/process steps, attending necessary meetings,  problem solving, coordinating with team members and other departments, interacting with agents, management and VPs.   "
good,"While many changes occurred with the types of Insurance Products the Job stayed the same. Because the company was so big there was many people who you would interact with, some of whom were there for 10-15 and 20 years. Promotions were difficult."
good,What I enjoyed the most working for Nationwide was my boss. He was extremely busy but always managed to take the time to help me. He was a great leader and taught me everything I needed to know to run my own agency as he did.
good,"Nationwide overall cares about it's employees. "
good,"I hoped to spend my entire remaining career with Nationwide, but structural changes dictated massive eliminations. I enjoyed coaching and guiding Agents for growth and development."
good,"I learned a lot with Nationwide and worked with a great group of people.  "
good,Working for Nationwide in the many different roles afforded me the opportunity to grow.  I started out on the property and casualty side as a contract employee and worked my way up to a supervisor within the Broker Dealer portion of Nationwide financial. Great place to work and the environment was wonderful.
good,"Nationwide was a great company to work for. I would have retired there if it wasn't for the company reorganization that closed the Worcester, MA location."
good,"I was very happy there, my first insurance job so thanks to my boss and co-workers teaching me.  I was pleased to be there and learned so much to carry me onto a more expansive insurance jobs.  Am still good friends with co-worker thru these years."
good,"Nationwide is a good company in terms of products, benefits, perks for their employees, but it is too micromanaged!  If they would lay off of the micromanagement, it would be a much better place to work for!  Great employees should not be micromanaged!"
good,Over all I think this is a good place to work. I think I am in a different situation than most people and think I am being held back from getting technical training.
good,I enjoyed working here for the most part. what I didn't like was the constantly changing rules. It felt like I had to constantly ask my superiors what the new rules were each week when it came to policy holders.
good,There are always a lot of changes which you can expect with an insurance company but it's a great place to work. Most enjoyable part is the work/life balance.
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed my time there.  They provide a good work life balance, support families and always give back to the community and encourage employees to do the same."
good,"Promotes within and flexible work schedules.  Was able to work from home when needed."
good,"Lack of growth is the only downside at the moment, other than that great company to be with, great benefits and freedom to have a life outside of work."
good,Very much enjoyed working at Nationwide although I didn't take advantage of skill development in order to keep my position. It was eliminated when new business rule software was implemented.
good,"Care about not just the associates/leaders but the community of SA as well! The culture truly embraces differences and have created a work safe space for people to share ideas, opinions"
good,"Great company to work for. Depends on the department you are in, but I liked how management cared about your career goals. Made life long friends there as well. Okay pay."
good,Nationwide provides many opportunities for building skill sets. I appreciated the development opportunities.  The benefit plans were very good.  Salaries are competitive.
good,"I was offered the job through a staffing agency. The training is long and very intensive for the customer service (member care) agents, anywhere from 2-3 months."
good,Nationwide is an employer that is evolving and finding it's way in the fast paced property and casualty insurance industry.  They have a wide variety of products and the ability to protect all of an individuals personal lines needs.  There systems are in the process of being overhauled to prepare them for the future so there are many challenges employees are facing to get to the new systems.
good,"Nationwide is a great company with plenty of room to promote. However, you better be ready to rub elbows to get anywhere. Instead of being based on skills, proven work ethic, and overall qualifications, promotions seem to be based on who knows who, and whose flattery game is the most on point. "
good,A lot of opportunity to grow in your career and leadership is always there to assist you to get to the next level. If there is another job within Nationwide I would highly recommend applying. Looking for the next great challenge to improve my career.
good,Productive employee driven workplace with great benefits. only drawback is CAT duty and overtime exemption. Working here was fun the atmosphere was cheerful.
good,"Investigate  auto claims"
good,Overall work day was fast paced and productive. It was an enjoyable place to work. The people and culture were good. Had a good management team that was willing to help you succeed in your career goals
good,"The days were fun because of the co-workers and management.  Management was willing and available for training and questions.  I started as an Administrative assistant, but management encouraged me to get my Adjusters license and I did.  I moved from administrative assistant to a claims adjuster with their support.  We all worked really hard but also had a lot of fun.  The hardest thing was having to leave because the office closed."
good,"Great place to work, Good Company, and many opportunities. Company teaches great core values to achieve sales goals. Problem solving and provided a lot of tools to succeed."
good,"If Nationwide did not have a history of Job Elimination or letting people go often it would be a good place to work."
good,P&C business facing challenges. Upper management challenged to respond to changing marketplace. Expense pressures causing uneasiness in workforce with direct job reductions or not filling roles after natural attrition negatively impacting work life balance as remaining associates are asked to do the same amount of work with fewer resources.
good,"I've been with Nationwide since I was 20 years old.  I've thoroughly enjoyed it and hated to leave.  However, Nationwide is no longer the company I joined.  In 1997 Nationwide acquired Allied Insurance which was a small company in the midwest that served independent agents only.  Nationwide is a ""captive agent"" company.  These two distribution channels (captive and independent) are very different and managed differently.  Since Nationwide maintained the top leaders at Allied, rather than terminating them, it wasn't long before many of these leaders had high positions at Nationwide.  The result is that now Nationwide is being run by Allied.  Nationwide has enjoyed amazing success during this time.  However, they are abandoning their commitment to the captive agent model and will soon be moving all agents to independent status.  This is causing great angst and turmoil in the company and has impacted it's culture.  I believe Nationwide will survive this change and end up even stronger, but it will be a challenging transition over the next few years.  I see Nationwide as a wonderful opportunity for those interested in a challenge in their career.  I believe Nationwide will remain strong for the future and will recover quickly once the distribution issues are resolved."
good,"Nationwide Insurance in Columbus is a very nice to place to work. It can be attributed to the people, culture, management, flexibility and work-life balance"
good,"Good company but they promote some managers who have no idea what they are doing in certain line segments "
good,"If you like collaboration and innovation this is the place for you. There are constant adaptions in processes and tools to increase efficiencies, and improve customer satisfaction."
good,"If you know of how to do yours consistently, this job is a piece of cake. The only way you can get fired is if you don't go to work. The management can vary."
good,The one thing that you would instantly absorb at Nationwide is to feel relaxed. People here are cool and help you get to the level where you can be at your best.
good,Good place to work. The people are willing to help as long as you ask. The training is good and there’s meetings with managers to get opinions on how to better the company and/or training.
good,"fair pay, your commission reflects your work ethic, good work environment, Supervisor was pleasant and diligent in running the office. Employees worked as a team"
good,It was not Bad. I learned a lot and was exposed to new technology. Communication among staff was very open but communication with management was not always clear.
good,Great company with a mature architecture practice and decent IT delivery process. However growth prospects remain limited as its not your fast growing startup but rather a mature insurance giant.
good,Retired from this company after 16 yrs. Had a total of 37 years in insurance. Nationwide purchased my old company. They were good to me and I felt I was treated good. Liked working here.
good,Friendly place to work but very stressful at times.  A lot of engagement among peers. Increased stress levels with the quality of calls due to being a call center environment.
good,"The company has a clear focus on customer service, fast paced environment, and high quality expectations.  Room to grow and develop your career.  Leadership is always listen to continuous improvement ideas."
good,"The company is great"
good,No day is truly typical. In the morning we check for emails and phone messages and check for possible cancellations.  After that you go with the flow and pick up where you left off the day prior and take incoming calls and walk ins and give quotes or take payments and further educate our customers on any new or better savings on their policies with us.
good,Great work culture that really emphasized the company brand. Great hiring process of qualified associates. High paced team-oriented environment dedicated to providing great products and a second-to-none customer service experience.
good,"I enjoyed my time working with the company as a sales agent. pay, management and work culture were all fair. I was with the company for 3 years and had no issues."
good,"Under staffed to properly provide proper investigation and customer service.     You recieve good training with friendly management, but simply entirely to many claims to process."
good,"•	Involved in development phase meetings for Business Analysis and Requirements Gathering."
good,"I enjoyed working at Nationwide.  I was impressed with their cultural values, and really enjoyed the team that I worked with.  As a company, Nationwide did a tremendous job at making its employees feel valued."
good,My manager was what I consider to be the basis in which I compare all other coworkers and managers to.  He brought a team of individuals together as one unit and increased productivity and team happiness in doing so.  I learned a lot from this company and have taken the insight gained from nationwide with me to every position I've had since.
good,"Good company to work for, managers really care however not a lot of room for advancement. People are really nice. Benefits are good. Office is nice and pay is competitive"
good,"Typical day includes 40-60 calls per day (inbound call center) fast paced high call volume. I've learned time management and how to deescalate callers without having to get a supervisor. I also was able to improve my ability to handle and break down billing questions and concerns. Supervisors are great and managers are excisable. The workplace was one of the best I have ever worked for. High in engagement and always offering incentives and or fun activities to participate in. The hardest part of the job I would say is dealing with a person who is angry and cussing. Sometimes it can be hard not to take it personal, but I have learned that they really just need someone to hear them out and validate their concerns. The most enjoyable part was working with my team."
good,"Overall a good place to work, management knows what they are doing as far as staffing the claims department. Most managers are good. People are generally happy."
good,On a typical day when arriving at the office you automatically feel at home. All of the coworkers I had shared my enthusiasm and overall feeling of security just  to be able to trust in our management team.Most of the morning was spent filing policy forms and answering phone calls. Then new business in the afternoon. The hardest part of the job was that there never seemed to be enough time in the day and the most enjoyable was definitely the personal relationships that we got to develop with our clients.
good,"Supervisor was work friendly to each employee and genuinely cared about everyone there"
good,Great company but has made recent decisions to close offices therefore I need to find another job.  I would never have left the company if it was not for this reason.  The company has been very good to me.  The workplace is comfortable with many great people.  The company loves innovation and new ideas.
good,The hardest part of working at Nationwide was finding a balance between work and home time. Otherwise its a challenging but rewarding job with generally helpful peers and management. They dont do much handholding.
good,"Good work life balance and benefits. Office staffing is adequate and volume workable.  I enjoyed the people in the office and most of the people who work there have been there over 5 years, which is a good sign of a stable company and a happy work force. "
good,"I've been with Nationwide for almost 15 years, and have done many different jobs during that time.  In general, I feel the company cares about its associates and doing the right thing for the member."
good,"I only speak for call center work, particularly their help desk. The pace is often overwhelming and there is little variance from day to day in a typical week. Change is constant but not usually for the better."
good,"Management is taking us out of cubes and putting everyone in a collaboration type environment "
good,I have only been with the company for two months so I do not have much insight.  The culture and management seem t be great but the work life balance seems to be a major complaint from employees.
good,"none, no comment, does not want to disclosed any information about the company. Want to find any adjuster or underwriting jobs outside of Nationwide. Or in Nationwide is fine too."
good,"Management is great, worked with you and not over you. There is always an opportunity to learn and work with others. Good team environment."
good,"The typical work day is  fast pace.  I managed a staff of 7 specialist, reviewing files and coverage's for accuracy which included quarterly audits for compliance of best practices and un-fair claims practices.  Most days were intense and stressful but fun."
good,"answer phones, assist with estimates, call policy holders, make payments to the policy holders, assign claims to our field reps. keep up the notes in the files"
good,"Fortune 100 Best Places to Work"
good,"I was injured in a car accident on my way to work one morning.  It was 100% the other person's fault.  I was unable to work for more than 2 - 3 days per week.  As a contractor, they needed me to be there more than that."
good,I love the culture at Nationwide. Nationwide is full of constant change. In every position I have held within the company I have felt challenged.
good,Fun workplace with good work life balance and advancement opportunities. Great management that is always there to answer any questions and provide assistance
good,The people are awesome. Learned a lot. Advancement was very doable. Managers seem to care about their employees. It was a shame to see the company close in Lynchburg as a lot of people depended on that company.
good,"I have worked for Nationwide for 9 years. After starting as a CSR I advance to agent, and then office / sales manager.  "
good,"Nationwide is the sixth largest property and casualty insurer in the United States."
good,Nice place to work with helpful co-workers. Telephone calls to computer work across two monitors I had to be quick and efficient in order to keep to my daily job task for the day.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"•	Wrote Test Cases for EDW - Data ware house (Source to Target) and Cognos Standard Reports, OLAP and CUBE."
good,"Mutual company with primary objective of protecting members' needs.  In my 16 years I've had ample opportunity to grow, develop, and advance my career."
good,"Call center environment that is well managed but lacking in positive reinforcement. A typical day involves taking incoming insurance claim calls for automobile and home claims. Contact with customers, insurance agents and adjusters.  Very rigid schedule with only 45 minute lunch. Quality assurance recorded calls are graded weekly."
good,"Enjoyed my time with Nationwide. I  would go back in an instant."
good,Company does a good job developing their associates.  There is good growth opportunities within the Company.  Company is focused on associate engagement.
good,"I have worked for Nationwide for the past 5 years and have loved every minute of it.  Now that I am on the east coast however, I have hit a ceiling career-wise working remotely.  Not a lot of opportunity for advancement unless you live in Columbus Ohio."
good,"I was one of their homeowner processor, overall it is a great place to work and I enjoyed it. Overall rating would be 4 stars."
good,"I loved my time at Nationwide Insurance. I started what was called an 'internship' while I was a senior in high school. This was my first taste of a corporate job. "
good,I held multiple positions with this company.  Advancement opportunities are available for associates who are dedicated and committed.
good,"Loved working at Calvin office, needed more hours and was a temp job. Learned alot and enjoyed the people that i worked with"
good,Nationwide is an amazing customer focus company who strive to help in any way they can
good,"Nationwide Insurance was a good place to work overall. Of all"
good,Underwriting accounts that come from agents. Small through large premium in size to underwrite.  Able to underwrite multiple states.
good,"Highly energetic environment, heavy workload. The most enjoyable part of the job is service to customers. The hardest part is the lack of work/life balance."
good,"Faced paced, friendly work environment, very appreciative of employees. Long hours at my choice though."
good,You definitely stay busy working at NW Insurance.  You learn alot and have great room for development.  Some management have very negative personalities and positive feedback can be rare.  There are levels of trust which make it difficult.  The flexibility of this job is good though.  You are able to work from home and can make time for yourself.
good,"good place"
good,Provided terrific training for product specific line of busines.
good,"Working at a desk all day and not having a lot of people interaction was a little hard to do.  You are required to make a certain amount of productivity with very little errors.  If you do not make the quota then you will not make it as an employee.  My supervisor was great and I had a great bond with her, she allowed me to advance.  I enjoyed getting out of the office every so often when the company would let us go bowling or other fun activities as paid company time."
good,"A typical day at work is to review new claim assignments, make contacts, arrange inspections, check & return voicemails and emails, and work claims diary"
good,"I like the atmosphere at work, however the scheduling is difficult to work around my life resulting in a poor work/life balance."
good,"Management, in my experience, is wonderful. I learned quite a bit about dealing with many personality types. Co-workers were like family. Hardest part of the job is ""Quality"", many times a little miss weighed heavily on performance and not offering things (even when inappropriate) came back to haunt you. There was always a sense of ""You're easily replaced."" with the revolving door of employees."
good,"With such a large company, the area you work in can vary greatly.  Certain areas are more politically charged than others, though most all are."
good,"A typical day at work included researching, organizing and planning local and community events. Supports the sales activities of storefront agents, ensuring prompt and efficient service for internal and external customers. I have got so much knowledge and experience since I joined the Company, including my Life & Health licenses. Management and co-workers are extremely friendly and helpful."
good,"Compensation and benefits are above average. Company focuses a lot of attention to culture and values. Depending on department, leadership seems at times confused re: direction. A lot of politics. Difficulty achieving agreement between business and IT in regard to support for assets owned by both IT and the business. Overall a great place to work."
good,"Processed various claim requirements such as auto, medical, legal, and salvage on time with no defects and within established SLA (Service Level Agreements) sending them to our adjusters ensuring that the client receives monies for claim"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Nationwide and with the other employees there. They had a spanish speaking receptionist and me. I thought it was a great idea, since they had so many spanish speaking customers and the agents did not speak spanish one bit. I really learned alot about office work and all the tasks that are required for a receptionist. The office I worked in was very busy, whether it was filing, answering the phones, taking messages, taking and recording payments, or informing people of avaialble policies. I did everything except sign people up with car insurance since the agents had to do that."
good,In the beginning the owner was very supportive of all staff. Not sure what made the change in support.
good,Well managed company. Typical insurance work. Stressful work; not a job to stay in more than 2 years - very limiting - no variety.
good,An environment that is just go go go.... pay was great but just started to wear out after a couple of years of doing the same thing.
good,"A day at Nationwide is a day meeting new people. As a Customer Service Representative I answer the phones and help people with their policy. My co-workers and I all do the same job, and because of that it makes it easy to help each other out with questions. Servicing 26 states is a lot if information to retain so its nice to be able to help others. The hardest part of my job would have to be remembering each states particular guide lines, but I do love to get to learn something new each day."
good,It's ok. Good place to pick new IT skills and learning to adapt with older technologies.
good,"Enjoyed my job at Nationwide the hours were good for me. Although, I was a contract worker I was very sure that I would have been hired."
good,I was stuck in the same role 7 years due to lack of ability to advance. The other hand the people I worked with were great. I can honestly say now that I have left I wish I never did. The people at the company are far better than my new employer.
good,This company has a great culture and management. Unfortunately a large issue with the company is their lack of growth and opportunity in the San Antonio location.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people that truly love their job.  The environment is positive, upper management is accessible and helpful when it comes to your development.  They care about their associates career path."
good,"Its a nice company to work,They have great process in place which helps to move thie things in fast pace. The work balance is great. Management and team support ."
good,a hardworking but fun place to work. the management is great to work with and its always a laid back place. just a great place to work and learn from others.
good,I really enjoyed the environment and the people i worked with. Work life balance was acceptable. There wasn’t much room for advancement in the field i was working towards.
good,Hours of works were great by having flexible schedule offered. Benefits are great. Co workers are respectable to each other. There are plenty of opportunity to advance in the company.
good,The workplace is a better place to be when you have the opportunity to take on one of your co-workers in a quick competition or do a little trash talking after a meeting. Ping pong is fun and makes employees happy. Happy employees are more productive - it's science.
good,"Enjoyed my time there.  Grew a lot.  Increasing responsibilities made unreasonable demands.  Change of management with limited support."
good,"Time Management, teamwork, compassion"
good,"Start shift at 9am and ended shift at 6:30pm. Help auto, property and casualty insurance policy holders service their policies. Management is awesome. They really stay on top of things and want everyone to succeed. Networking is big on Nationwide Ins culture. Hardest part of the job is learning all rules and regulations so that your following quality assurance guidelines."
good,"Decent place to work with work life balance and good exposure to the Insurance Domain concepts."
good,Safe and a place with plenty of opportunity to learn. Job is very secure and work is limited to an extent where work/life balance is very good. Good place to work.
good,"Large demand.  Typical challenge to manage priorities across shared resources.   Professional environment, structured workplace and best practice methods."
good,A great place to work. The management team was very supportive and the training was detailed and very precise to the functions required to perform the tasks efficiently.
good,"I have to admit i love this job. you have to work hard by selling bundled home and auto in order to make more than just make salary. There is a cafe. Its very diverse, and you get rewarded for meeting company metrics."
good,"Great people but a little ""sleepy"" in terms of trying to be an investment company which is what I was in.  At the end of the day its a massive life insurance/annuity company that dabbles in the investment space.  The Insurance/Annuity/Pension sides are very well run and I think some recent promotions at the top make it a great place to work now. Certainly a lot of opportunity to move up if you are in your early career.  I certainly enjoyed my time their and would recommend to anyone.  Just a little frustrating on the investment side which is where I was."
good,Team members are great to work with. The people are friendly and want to be do their best. Communication between departments can be improved. Sometimes the left hand does not know what the right had is doing. Also company could better with releases. Need to do more testing before implementing in production. Benefits are superb and really great. Overall is a good place to work.
good,I very reputable place to work.  Great hours but the pay was not good.  Worked with great people. Insurance testing seemed to be very difficult. I would recommend Nationwide.
good,"Nationwide is going through a large correction right now will let go several thousand people over the next few years.  With that said, I still rate Nationwide very highly as a company.  They try and do right by their people, but overall the culture has become complacent in many areas and people are just mailing it in.  For the company to really grow that mindset has to stop."
good,"Nationwide has a very deep and rich corporate culture, they encourage training and advancement and management are very good at making teams aware of upcoming opportunities for career advancement."
good,"If you're interested in sitting behind a desk talking to people all day, this is the job for you. The training process is intense, and at the end you will have to take a test to get your insurance license, one of the hardest tests I've ever taken."
good,"Nationwide is a good place to work, they constantly challenge and encourage you to be creative and management is very good about sharing new opportunities for advancement that arise with their teams."
good,"nice work atmosphere providing great customer service with great team support offered throughout the company ,we have a lot of training , onsite workshops"
good,I enjoyed it very much. I learned a lot while working at Nationwide was given so many opportunities for knowledge. Coworkers were awesome too. Work like balance was great
good,"I really enjoyed working with Nationwide in Phoenix, AZ"
good,"Claims can be stressful, management can be difficult, and the hours can be taxing. But the people I worked with (coworkers) were great, I had my own space (cubicle), and I loved helping people and hearing their stories ranging from the day to day claims to crazy interesting calls."
good,"The company is very good in promoting good cohesive team building events, and forming associate bonds, while building trust.  Associates are sold on covering for other associates who are on medical leave, or vacation as well as providing SME assistance, where needed."
good,"There is team engagement, coaching/quality sessions, a good work life balance, and opportunity for growth. You get 2 breaks and can choose if you want a 35 minute, 45 minute, or a 1 hr lunch."
good,"Working at Nationwide was interesting because they asked me to take a Scrum team that didn't have a Scrum Master for the last six months.  I was concerned when I went to Columbus to meet the team.  The average age for the team was twenty-three years old. When I got up to introduce myself, I found the people excited to learn why people were not getting told what the team has been doing for the past six months.  It turned out after our first retrospective that no one was doing sprint reviews. It was suggested by me that we start holding sprint reviews after each sprint and to make the first sprint review would go over the past six months.  We did this while suggesting when people should come to hear their part of the program and we also provided snacks and soft drinks at the review. It was a hit because the business stakeholders stayed around and talked with our developers."
good,Great company to work for.  They care about their employees. They have great benefits. They allow work from home for some jobs. They give back to the community.
good,"Training was always well done and presented. Enjoyed working there in the sales area, was always compensated for my work. Company is restructuring to potentially have people work from home"
good,"Set your own schedule.   Good PTO system.   I was downsized otherwise,I would not have left. "
good,"Nationwide is a company of great people doing great things. They care deeply about doing what’s right, and being an employee there means working hard to make an impact for everyone: their associates, their members, their partners and their communities that they service.  "
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Nationwide and would recommend this company to others.  "
good,I worked at Nationwide from June of 1986 to March of 2018 at which time my job/location of the company was relocated.   The company was great to work for and offered competitive pay and benefits.
good,Nationwide as a company cares about their associates by providing safe workplace environment. They are focused on supporting their members at critical moments in their lives.
good,"answer phones daily, help agents with questions on the phone, typing  productive on the job, screened others work for errors and helped team lead with other various jobs."
good,It has been a great experience to work there. It has given me various experiences in working style and learnt so many things. Working culture is so nice.
good,"Nationwide provides there employees with the necessary tools to learn and advance throughout the company."
good,I learned in the sales call center environment it is very competitive and fast paced. Great place to work for competitive money hungry people. I would recommended it for anyone who is hungry for a big compensation.
good,I was very happy in my position here but was offered another opportunity.  I was able to learn and advance in my position while with them.  They treat people fairly.  This was a commission position.
good,"Nationwide is a great company to work for.  It provided me with many opportunities throughout my career."
good,"I really enjoy my job at Nationwide. The culture is great and there are a lot of perks, including on-site gym, remote work options, matching 401k, HSA's, etc.. However, there isn't much room for promotions/raises. With the recent layoffs, there probably won't be any time soon."
good,"Nationwide was a nice place to be employed. I left nationwide because of low paid salary."
good,"Great work environment. The facility was nice and their were several activities to do on your off time. Onsite gym, basketball court and a Starbucks. People were awesome."
good,"I love doing what i do day to day at Nationwide. "
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for Nationwide. A typical workday is busy but not stressful. I am grateful for the knowledge I have obtained from my 16 years at the company. I have been lucky to have had wonderful managers and have developed close friendships with my fellow associates. I would love to continue working for Nationwide Scottsdale if at all possible.
good,Working at Nationwide I've learned a lot of valuable information.  not only did I review and sell customer policies daily I kept that knowledge for my every day life events.
good,"Overall, the company is great. Environment is eh. Loved my positioned being a SME Support helping other agents master their call flow. I will consider going back if I had no other options of occupations."
good,Nationwide has cut 1100 jobs since October 2018.  You have to really be on top or you get plucked out.   Quality is not fair for this call center.  I thought this was going to be my career.
good,"The call center culture is very demanding, but the managers were most helpful with respect to all the changes.  It seemed as it Nationwide was always upgrading the way they did business."
good,I enjoy my time at Nationwide.  I have felt that they care about culture and the development of Associates.  My management truly cares about my personal and professional development and I am grateful.
good,"I was a total loss adjuster for two years. It was a well paid job and my team was fantastic. However the job was thankless, and stressful. Employees got burned out quickly. The department would do everything they could to stop you from moving to another department."
good,It was a good place to work. People were nice.  Management was ok.  Work hours were good.   Liked working from home towards the end of the job.  Wish my job was not outsourced.
good,"Overall the experience has been positive working here. A lot of the benefits of working here come from your manager. If you get a good manager, then work/life balance is good. If you get one who follows the handbook to a T, then it will not."
good,Nationwide was a great place to work. If I had reliable transportation I would probably still be there. It was a good environment to work in and the other employees were nice.
good,"Good management, good benefits, ability to work from home. Work life balance can be a little off with work load. Good pay. Overall, Nationwide is a good company to work for."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of reviewing up to 40 new policies or inspections with photos and drawings.  We reviewed for accuracy of coverage, compliance of standards and accuracy of customer information.  "
good,It is very good for International candidates like me. we have lot of  seniors to help out in critical conditions and make it easy to work. works very well for the beginners.
good,"I have really enjoyed my time working for Nationwide. I have learned a variety of skill sets, and the benefits and pay are competitive. The culture is changing and it is very difficult to move into different roles unless you build relationships with the hiring managers before applying."
good,I enjoyed working with this company. It was fast paced. I was able to come up with advertisement for the office to promote the business. I enjoyed working with the customers and being able to brighten someones day.
good,Nationwide helped provide me with and develop skill sets that I still use today within various departments and jobs. I also learned a great deal about customer service and time management while working at Nationwide.
good,Typical day was troubleshooting application errors with the insurance agents. The management was great and really worked hard to insure that everyone was educated and happy. This made the work culture very friendly and everyone was set out to help each other succeed.
good,"Had a great experience. Great people and great leadership and if you are able to relocate, great career advancement opportunities.  There is a focus on diversity and inclusion, community service and personal development."
good,"Nationwide was large enough that if you didn't like your current department's culture, you could move to a different area.  In fact, for upcoming managers, they encouraged it."
good,It allowed me to gain a great deal of knowledge and allowed me to expand upon the current knowledge I had as a sales associate and apply that from the management perspective.
good,I enjoyed working there but decided to move out of state too be closer to my parents.  I also wanted too have more children and did not want a babysitter too raise my children.  I also lived in London and was tired of the  long commute everyday and the traffic.
good,good place good work life balance but had to relocate had to quit. Good management sometimes stressed a little and quality standards were kind of punitive but overall good place
good,I enjoyed my time at Nationwide. Every department is slightly different so each experience is unique to the individual. Many opportunities to learn new skills and more about the insurance industry.

good,"Overall good place to work. Salary is good and benefits ok. "
good,I loved working there... if it didn’t close I would have stayed there. The staff was wonderful and the relationship between suppliers was always great.
good,Nationwide was a good place to work and advancement was possible here.  Unfortunately for many of us a lot of departments was moved out of the building and moved to other states which left a lot of us unemployed if we wasn't willing to relocate and most  people was unable to relocate to we had to leave the company.
good,Handled incoming customer calls for insurance customer claims or questions. Required to assist customers within company and department guidelines. Must be able to assess situation and motstenproperly

good,I worked for Nationwide Insurance for 6 years tragedy struck upon me a couple of times in 6 years i worked there. They were always on my side. If i had an opportunity to have my career back with them i would go back because of the compensation paxkage and benefits. I worked in the personal lines service center as a member care representative 4 . I miss my Nationwide family and hope at some time i could go back. It is a very stressful fast paced environment.
good,"Nationwide lives up to its values of collaboration and mutual respect for most parts. The organization's IT department is a diverse working place and has been an industry leader in innovation as well. Most people in the company have been here for a long time but almost everyone seemed to be welcoming toward any one new. Having said that, just like any other corporate, some people can be very competitive and would not hesitate in climbing over others to get to the top. Everything in the company is still very much centered around it's HQ in Columbus, Ohio which can be a bit challenging for those working at other locations."
good,I worked in the Amarillo call center and I enjoyed my team and had a great supervisor. The company closed the center and moved everybody to San Antonio. Overall good job.
good,"Nationwide has a lot of opportunity for work in IT. There are many compelling IT projects and initiatives there to make life better for their customers and employees. However the speed at which these projects are implemented happen at a snails' pace. I guess that's what customers would want out of their insurance company, slow, safe, deliberate, but ultimately sitting around waiting for a week for change approvals for every little step of a project is just not exciting and it starts to wear you down."
good,Nationwide offered training and opportunities for growth.  Workload often high and stressful.  Culture and management overall positive.  Would recommend.
good,Its and 8 hours shift with lunch and breaks.
good,My great great grandpa and every family member since him has worked for nationwide insurance. That's why I say nationwide is a family member and has been very good to us.

good,"I was in IT.  They had a tendency to hire in Columbus as opposed to in Des Moines.  Career advancement is hard to come by because of that reason.  Loved my time there, but it was 6 or 7 years ago.  Things might be a lot different now."
good,"I liked working at Nationwide, but no career development."
good,"Our work days are 7.75 hours with a 45 min lunch. Management used to be good, but with our building closing, it's been a little harder to have a work/life balance."
good,This is a call center and just like every other job it has its good days and its bad days. The job becomes much easier after about 6 months if you pay attentions to what each contract states and just follow the terms and conditions of the contract and you can never be wrong
good,Great place to start in the information technology field. Quality co-workers and great environment to learn new technologies and build on your current skills.
good,"Nationwide IT staff worked hard to provide good working culture in most of its divisions.  There were the usual handful of ineffective or bully managers who would not or could not support you.  Most managers were excellent and tried to assist.  "
good,"I have enjoyed the opportunity to work for Nationwide Insurance. There are opportunities to advance and the company values align with my own. However, I am ready to make a career change and explore options outside of insurance."
good,When it came to member services it was a fast pace job of course. You are in a call center and take in bound calls to help your customers with their polices.
good,Nationwide Insurance is a good place to work and it provides you a nice working environment to learn and improve yourself. The work-life balance is one important advantage an employee can get while working for Nationwide.
good,"High paced, competitive, and each department will have different expectations, flow, and culture. Different departments and lines of business are suited for different types of individuals and learning styles."
good,I enjoyed my time with Nationwide and would love to get back into the corporate training area. The collaboration with others is evident in many services they provide to their clients.

good,"Great manager kept it real.  Even though it is a large corporation, the management kept it at a personal level.  Lots of opportunity to grow professionally and personally."
good,I gained a lot of knowledge working with this company. Dealt with the public on a daily basis. My boss was excellent to work for and was compassionate.  Highly recommended.

good,Nationwide was an excellent employer. Respect in the work place and a great balance for family and work. The Commercial Lines had excellent supervisors and the environment was good.
good,Great company to work for if you are looking to advance your career. The most enjoyable part of my job was to help associates see their own potential and provide the tools and resources to support their overall growth and development.
good,"Working for one of the largest insurance companies in the country and one of the most highly rated places to work is an amazing opportunity. As an Analyst Consultant, one of the big take aways was the amazing team, quality of people, and great work ethic I participated in. My team manager was one of the best managers I had the privileged to work with. Not only did he mentor minors, but he took his position seriously and mentored his team as part of his own family. He was always there to help you succeed as long as you had the drive and courage. In my opinion, that makes the company, having people who genuinely care, represent Nationwide. IT and its specifics are commentary."
good,"Great place to work, well balanced lifestyle possible. Family friendly and supportive management.  Engagement scores are high.  Only downside is advancement can, at times, require lateral movement due to long tenured workforce."
good,Very easy going people to work for.  Gained a personal lines license in which I am able to reflect on my resume going forward.  Very professional and pleasant environment.
good,"I made more as a producer but started out doing On-Your-Side reviews on the service end, which had a higher base pay & a bonus structure vs the lower base & higher commissions of straight sales. The stress of not knowing exactly how much I'd be getting every time sometimes made me want to rush through sales instead of before when I could take more time with each client."
good,"Was a great place to work for, but not now.  Blah blah i don't want to do rate this company.  Why is this require and why should i judge them.  I'm asking WHY?"
good,"Nationwide Insurance World Headquarters in the capital of Ohio. Nationwide Insurance World Headquarters is in the middle of downtown Columbus, Ohio. Columbus is a fast growing city with so many job opportunities located everywhere. Nationwide Insurance World Headquarters is growing as well. If you get in you are in."
good,A good working environment with good growth. The working culture is fruitful and very cordial. everything is managed quite wonderfully. the technology stacks are updated
good,"The corporate culture generally encourages a good work-life balance, and values their employees, allowing a large amount of performance issues before terminating employees, letting people take medical leaves with no questions asked, and usually attempts to promote from within."
good,A typical day at work was prioritizing my desk and doing tasks in order so that I wasn't stressed. There was a lot to learn through webinars and meetings with team members and staff to troubleshot any issues. The hardest part of my job was making sure everyone was on the same page and that information was communicated to all team members. Change is constant. Culture was the ability to adapt and work as one team. One of hardest things about my job was when there was a lack of communication within departments. The most enjoyable part of the job was the level of open and direct communication. Another thing I liked was the ability to learn new things and take on more responsibility. The company is always growing.
good,"Enjoyable, always willing to work with you one on one. Open minded looking for ways to make the company grow and you grow as well. Once a month on going training course. Always promoted "" Customer Service Weeks that identify us with individual accomplishments."

good,"Great work atmosphere . It was a great place to work, they believed in helping you work and move up in the company. I would still be there if I didn't have to move and relocate"
good,Nationwide has been a great company to work for but very hard to get promoted even after obtaining a degree.  I have been the same pay band for almost 8 years.
good,This company encourages professional development. There is open communication with leadership and the overall benefits are great.I enjoyed most being able to participate in many professional development seminars that has increased the level of service I am able to deliver to internal and external customers. The most enjoyable part of my job has been my co-workers and being on a team that each day worked towards the same goal which is living our company's values.

good,"Associates are amazing. Pay is great. Great benefits. Great opportunity, would have loved to get into the company permanently! Excellent management,A+"
good,I would have stayed longer at Nationwide if I felt that I could move up in the organization. That was my only issue was upward mobility. However overall the organization is great and very supportive.
good,"A great place to start a career with so many positions for advancement. Given the type of industry, it's a conservative work place that is slowly adopting new ways as the industry is starting to quickly change. If you are not patient then you will become disengaged because it is very bureaucratic for a private company. Otherwise, if you are knowledgeable, skilled and able to navigate politics, you can go far in the company. I'm excited to see what the company has in store the next 5 years."
good,"Efficient daily scrums, bi weekly show & tells and retrospectives. "
good,Nationwide is a good company with great benefits. Employees are treated well and overall the atmosphere is well received.

good,"I have been with this company for over four years. I am pleased with my situation as I have been fortunate to have leadership whom emphasizes the work/life balance that I cover. The company values my contributions and takes great interest in me both professionally and personally. Advancement opportunities may not be as prevalent as I would prefer, but this is likely due to such fierce internal competition - which most certainly not a bad thing."

good,Before changes took place Nationwide was more of a family oriented business and made sure employees were rewarded regulary for their work. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the goals set especially during high volume months. Work/life balance became an issue as we all had to work a lot of overtime which we were not compensated for. I definitely learned a lot over the 11 years of working with Nationwide.

good,"Enjoyed working from home for 18 years, licensed in 11 states permitted me to handle claims in over 30 states. Management was supportive, peers in large loss unit were supportive.

Normally sales meetings were held weekly, as a ""scorecard"" to compare actual results versus projected goal amounts. Additionally agent was very ""EE friendly"", giving incentives such as gas cards etc. for good performance."
good,During my time with Nationwide as a Property Claims Adjuster.  It was fun but also very demanding.  You were to always have a client scheduled every day.  you were to get the work completed during your scheduled time with the client.  You were to diagram the entire loss and determine a fair value to repair said damages.  I would recommend working for Nationwide!
good,"Management is excellent. Not much room or business need for growth or advancement in the claims department, currently. Overall, it is an good company to work for!"
good,"The coaching culture at Nationwide is incredible, there's always someone willing to answer any questions you have, or help you in general. It's a company that exposes you to a lot of incentives and activities within the community."
good,"A typical work day would be supporting my team by providing coaching and feedback to our associates, attending team meetings and huddles, analyzing daily productivity, addressing behavioral issues as it relates to performance, peer mentoring, providing service to our customers, and managing schedule dependability among associates. "
good,Great place to work. A lot opportunities to grow and advance if you want to. The only reason for termination would be for unethical behavior or bad adherence
good,"Nationwide is a very fast paced and challenging work environment. Most times, if not always, the call volume is pretty high. However, the management was absolutely understanding and helpful in many ways. Very laid back, but stern at the same time in the sense that we can make the work environment fun and always boost the moral as much as possible, but make sure the work is done and done correctly. They have a great sense of direction and only hire individuals that they know can accomplish the task."
good,"Fun working with an amazing team and leader at the time. Hours were long but had option to change schedule if opportunity was available. Always something new to learn or new system to apply on the job. My supervisor was the best and worked with everyone in his team to always stay above. The workplace was great, awesome cafeteria and starbucks was a plus for the addicts! The hardest part was on the long 10x4 and working every Saturday, getting added new skills but no advancement. Most enjoyable was my team mates and all the new friendships one can build."
good,"job security and great benefits, but underpaid in the area "
good,Organization and development are very high on the list of priorities when it comes to structure. Knowing what is expected of me is prevalent. Development is encouraged and expected. They want you to find your dream job.
good,There is plenty of opportunity if you are motivated. They have great partnerships within local communities and provide the resources to build those relationships.
good,Good pay and friendly management. Answering calls can be annoying at times if you cannot understand them or they are just mad. The system you work with on the computer is old and outdated
good,relaxed environment. partial work from home week.  encouraged team work. hardest part of the job was claims load while understaffed at times and constant changing work flows.
good,"Loved the job, was told after 3 months would be converted to FTE. However only 1 conversion in the first year I was there and 65 people applied for 10 jobs! Was then told next conversion would be a cake walk in 4 months. 4 turned into 5, 5 to 6 and 6 to we don't know if we are doing conversions again. My supervisor in Des Moines was one of the best I have ever had and he really pulled for me. If you are young and have time to wait for a good job defiantly look into nationwide. Just remember you could waste 18 months waiting on something that never comes."
good,Great management and great people working there. My role I am on the phone all day and that is not what I want to do anymore and am looking for something else.
good,"This was a very fast paced job. Claims is very busy and I worked more than I wanted to with also going to school and being a single mother. I would still recommend this as a place to work for if nothing else, for their excellent management."
good,"Lots of opportunities to move in the ranks.  The benefits are great, and the people are great.  Unfortunately, I had to relocate for my wife's job, or would still be with the company."
good,"As a QA tester who has worked for 6+ years with 5 different clients, Nationwide has set the bar. The company culture was so warm and welcoming. All the teams were agile with open collocated work spaces. We were consistently getting work done without too much downtime or too much work that we couldn't handle. Our team got lunch together at least once a month."
good,"I was a temporary employee. I just helped out as they needed me or if someone was off sick. But being listed as an employee I did receive a discount on my insurance policy. I enjoyed working there. The people I worked with was amazing and the work was pretty simple. It was done on computer, but there was some filing to do."
good,"Rotational Assignments through various functional departments such as: Sales, Claims, Personal Lines Underwriting and Commercial Lines, Real Estate and Financial Services"
good,"I loved working here. I pay was good, the job was fairly easy once you learn it, the employees were more like a family. If this job did not relocate I would still be working here."
good,"Nationwide not only puts members first, but they treat their employees great too and value time with family. They are not fully on board with employees working from home, but if you have an emergency or are sick, then it's fine."
good,They take care of their people and have great job security.  I believe they are one of the best if not the best insurance companies to work for in the industry.
good,Great place to work at. Nationwide allows you to be yourself and takes pride and helping you developed into your career. The upper management are very down to earth and will speak to you no matter what your title is.
good,"I worked briefly for Harleysville when the company was going through a lengthy period of re-underwriting.  Due to concerns about the company's AM Best rating, I decided to leave the company for a better opportunity."
good,There is proper work life balance at this company. Flexible work schedules . Proper compensation. They offer proper training. There are advancement opportunities
good,Opportunity to operate a satellite office with little or no directions.  Learned to manage office independently.  Never enough time in the work day to get everything done.
good,"Nice corporate office in the San Antonio area. Pay was competitive for the entry level job (30K/$15 hr). Very ""friendly"" company culture. Too friendly for my liking. They are all about the ""work family"" and tend to make you feel like you're in the wrong for not wanting to participate is office social events."
good,Over all it is a great place to work if you enjoy meeting new people everyday and always looking to make a sale. Could be tough to balance if you are trying to go to school while working full time since customers call at any time.
good,I learned much about how insurance works. Wa able to help customers pick the correct coverages for their needs. Had very little problem with management or peers. I could get up and walk around instead of sitting at desk constantly. Yet still doing my job. The  state of Arizona began requiring licensed customer service agents to work there. So I left and went back to teaching. The position did not pay enoughto become licensed.
good,"Great company to work for, but there are constant changes within departments. My reason for looking for another position is that my job is being eliminated. Nationwide is a strong company, my only feedback is that there are continual company plan changes that affect the lives and jobs of employees causing unnecessary displacements and stress. Other than this, Nationwide embraces diversity, work life balance, fun and is a great place to work."
good,Nationwide is a great company to work for. I enjoy my time as an associate agent. Training and sales support is great. Getting the rates to accommodate your clients can be difficult at times.
good,"awesome upper management not alot of room to grow unless youve been there a while, great additions there, starbucks, game room gym... endless commission if youre willing to work"
good,A great place to work for. Laid back and relaxed. Great work life balance - not the best compensation in the market. Great teams and nice management.
good,"During most of my career as a security officer, I have encountered many and various situations that were unexpected; yet present. And to be totally honest, there was no ""typical"" day on the job. Throughout my career, I have learned various languages, how to defuse escalating situations, deal with bomb threats, maintain a continuous presence, how to operate a fire panel, and the list goes on. The managers were very good at what they did, and there were also very interested in any ideas that we may have had. The hardest part of the job was control room operations. There were a variety of things that had to be done within a very short window of time. However, Control room training taught us how to multitask during very stressful moments. What I enjoyed about my career is that I met some very wonderful people. You see, communication for me is vital, because people will give insight on things that could occur without your knowing. Yet with just a little dialog, you could have eyes and ears everywhere."
good,"I already submitted a review on Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, stating my bosses were excellent and were very flexible with me during needed times."
good,"They really care about their employees. It is not the typical call center culture. They make every effort to make employees feel included and they do what they can to be flexible when it comes to life/work balance. Sometimes the work itself can be overwhelming. They do have far too many meetings that take you away from the same work that you have several deadlines on. If you have a personality conflict with your supervisor, do the best you can and avoid them whenever possible. The drawback to an issue with an immediate supervisor is that these people have been working with each other for as many as 5, 10, 15 plus years. DON'T create any waves. You will lose the battle. Don't report anything to the local HR. As indicated, everyone there knows each other. If you run into any issues, just keep it to yourself or if it is really bad, just call the HR 800#. Sorry that it has to be that way but you do what you must to survive. It is still a good job, however, if you but heads with anyone, especially a tenured employee, just keep it moving. It is not worth the headache. But most of the employees are very friendly and the enviroment is pretty good. Oh and one last tip. The way the cubicles are designed, you can hear a pin drop in that place. So have something at your desk that can drown people out like a fan or something. Remember, there is no such thing as a whisper in the building. No matter how quiet you think you are being. If you want to discuss personal issues, wait until you get off work."
good,"Nationwide had weekly and monthly sales contests to boost sales production and further line the agents pockets! Nationwide paid well for the policies sold, and generated all of my leads for me. My sales training was top notch, and although I had previous sales experience I was able to absorb a great deal of new information from their trainers. I would highly recommend working for Nationwide's direct sales department."
good,I worked in P&C Controllership area. I helped coordinate the monthly closing process. I was responsible for analysis of changes in results.  I also researched issues that arose during the close.
good,"Answering multiple phone lines, account payable, clerical, bookkeeping, quoting insurance, basic computer skills, word, excel,"
good,My day is very productive and organized. I have learned so much about the insurance industry and it's importance. I have a very laid back and non stressful management team. My co-workers and I work very well together and are helpful to one another. The hardest part of the job is to not get self absorbed with the clients. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I have made a good impression on my clients and have assisted and advised them with their insurance needs.
good,"- 8 hrs work"
good,Nationwide cares about the environment that their employees are in.  I felt valued as an employee there and that I mattered.  Thats a rare thing in most employers.
good,"I work Nationwide as part-time and really enjoy doing the paperwork and filing I had to do. I enjoy the people I work for, they were understanding. Reason for leaving was my boss retired and they closed that office down. If it was still open I would more than likely would still be there."
good,"Worked independently from my residence the last 7 years.  Traveled middle and east TN and KY.  Received referrals from claims personnel and agents within the Nationwide Enterprise companies.  Much face to face and personal interviews with customers, policyholders and claimants.  Submit timely reports and give verbal and written updates on the status of my investigations.  Computer usage with several different platforms on a daily basis.  Clean driving record and no criminal history."
good,"The position I held was in a paperless environment and it was fantastic!  "
good,Overall a great company to work for. Areas of concern are corporate restructuring and upper management turnover.
good,"As a claims adjuster, you are able to work with people from the entire spectrum. Time management becomes a priority along with decision-making. Working with 7 states and policies enables you to learn their statues and laws thoroughly. "
good,Nationwide is a great company. Its primary focus is the customer  and providing exceptional service. 
good,The company is progressive in nature.
good,Good place to work but below average pay for the industry. They do pay well for CAT deployments.
good,"A typical work day at Nationwide consist of logging into the mainframe system, greeting my co-workers and then getting right to work. I experienced having great management overseeing me. Very concerned, dedicated & family oriented company. My co-workers were a joy to work with. We were always able to deposit something positive into each other and work as a team. We were more of a family than co-workers. On the other hand, the hardest part of my job, I would say, was adjusting to the everyday processing updates. Everyday brought a new change to the way we processed the policies. However, I accepted the change and processed as normal. I enjoyed learning how to process the different lines of business, while at the same time obtaining so many new friends/associates."
good,A typical day at work includes working side by side with talented and educated individuals all the while ensuring that the customers receive a positive and efficient experience through out their automobile claims process.

good,Nationwide cares about their employees. Decent pay and amazing culture. Great benefits. They will sponsor you and reward you for certifications. Starting out you may have to work in many different areas but advancement will come.
good,"This is a great place to work especially if you need flexible working hours . I am able to work this job while attending college and working two additional jobs ! I get paid here every week direct deposit which is a plus! The work load is light compared to most places, and you always have the ability to change anything you do t like ( location, time, days of the week) I also love that you can pick up and deny shifts at your leisure. Just woke up and have nothing to do for the rest of the day? Call and pick up a shift!"
good,It was a nice place to work but not for advancement. They gave you opportunities to sit with other co-workers in other areas to shadow them and learn about their job.
good,They treat their employees well and its a fun place to work.  You have a great work life balance.  They have an excellent training program to help associates succeed
good,"Working at Nationwide has been a pleasure, I felt very welcomed upon joining the company. When I started in July of 2017 I was under the impression that you can climb the ladder and move up. It's been nearly 2 years, I have near perfect attendance and I give it my all every day and I'm still in the same role. Overall Nationwide is a great company to work for but pretty difficult to move up."
good,"Nationwide provided a fun work culture with a lot of opportunity for advancement. It's a company focused on streamlining processes, and they seek the opinions of their employees."
good,"I worked for a local agent, who was very nice. All of my co-workers were enjoyable to work with.  A day consisted of filing, getting quotes for home and auto insurance, and selling policies."
good,"Learned customer service skills and how to relate with customers. I was encouraged to advance and learn my craft."
good,Overall Nationwide is a great place to work at.  Management is open and engaging and provide leadership skills for growth.  I have learned many new technologies at Nationwide such as Alteryx and Tableau.  I would recommend working at Nationwide to family and friends.
good,"Still an employee, love the atmosphere here at Nationwide. They offer great benefits, work/life balance. The only reason why I’d leave is because my spouse is relocating. Great Great company."
good,the sales academy workshop at the Nationwide campus in columbus is useful and was a good time a few years back.  It was cool to meet other agents and discuss strategies.  If you like the snow I recommend going during the winter! I left Nationwide because I've always wanted to join the military. So I did. Nationwide is a great company. I had a lot of flexibility in the workplace almost too much.
good,"Flexibility working hours."
good,"No micro-management; work/life balance; 99% of mangers were just great & helpful; you work smart since it is performance based; the hardest part first year was a supervisor; the most enjoyable part of the job, we had fun, respect, we looked after each other in regard to work balance, out-door activities, company cookout."
good,"The management was highly responsive. I have enjoyed the people I work with greatly, they are knowledgeable and positive."
good,I enjoyed working in the insurance business. My father is a retired insurance broker so I have been involved in insurance for a good while I am looking to expand my interests and am looking for some new experiences to add to my work resume.
good,"I enjoyed the 27 years I worked at Nationwide!  My plan was to retire from the company.  I started as a Technical Secretary making $20K and ended as a Consultant, earnings one year of $128K.  The company's training programs for its employees are second-to-none!  It's a GREAT place to work."
good,Talking to customers was not constricted by time; quality of work was emphasized over speed. Advancement came with work ethic and experience. Management focused heavily on self improvement as well as improvement amongst teams.
good,"Worked with a team, generally not too intense and had downtime for talking to team and making sure you can produce high quality work. The time frames for some work can be weird and end up taking much less or more time than the expectations but generally you don't have to put in extra hours to finish what is expected."
good,"I had the opportunity to advance many times within my tenure at Nationwide. I would like very much to maintain my employment, but I am not sure that is possible with my relocation."
good,"It was a very fast paced day pretty much everyday. There was ample support when you needed it. Days off were sometimes hard to come by, and guidelines were pretty strict. However, the pay and benefits were good."
good,Good company which values their employees.  The benefits and pay are about average and it is on the Forbes 100 Best Places to Work for the past several years.
good,"I very much enjoy this position, however it is extremely stressful.  The pay is high in order to compensate for this, but you will need to determine if high pay is worth high stress."
good,"Nationwide has always been a great place to work. I was employed there for 24 years. We always had fun, but we stayed on top of our work to make sure our work was done and our members always come first"
good,"Having been affiliated with this company for over 20 years, I have had the opportunity to serve in multiple positions. I have found the positions to be rewarding and challenging.  I will always have a wonderful affinity for this Fortune 100 company.  I made the personal decision to retire as an agency owner.  However, I still regard the company as one of the best companies work with and for."
good,"The compamy"

good,"The HP ServiceCenter 5.0 implementation here was very badly modified to not use best practices and what not possible to just upgrade using the upgrade tool. We were able to learn what could be used and implemented HP ServiceCenter 6.2 using all modules "

These events range from the Board Council (Presidents of Farm Bureaus and Chairman of Agriculture Cooperatives that Nationwide has relationships with), to Nationwide Leadership (Nationwide (NW) Board of Directors, NW CEO, NW Leadership). "

good,A typical day includes taking inbound calls to support various technical issues with operating systems as well as enterprise-facing applications.

I learned the importance of prioritizing and scheduling important events and meetings and utilizing my calendar more efficiently. I enjoyed collaborating with my fellow supervisors to reach our mutual business unit goals and target numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my team at a deeper level than just associate-supervisor level. This enabled me to gain their trust and to customize my coaching sessions to their individual personalities and strengths. The hardest part of the job was not being able to allow time off the phones for project and self development time when service levels and call volume were not in favorable conditions."
good,"Nationwide Insurance is a very well put together and thought out company. I have enjoyed my working years here. I found friends, as well as peers to look up to. The management tries to push you to do your best at all times and attempts to make a fun working enviroment."
good,"Nationwide Insurance is a great company to work for. A lot of great people and diversity. I started as a customer service rep, and was promoted to the underwriting department. Management can go both ways, some are there to help you advance, and there are some that I believe don't have the skills to help you advance. The time I most enjoyed while working at nationwide, was the volunteer opportunities, and the great team mates I had the pleasure of working along side. The hardest thing about working there, is if you are not custom to change, it would be a hard place for you. There are many changes among the organization, and you half to be able to adjust. "
good,I input insurance claims as the insure files or cause of a claim
good,"Login in computer,assist agents"

good,Advancement potential is fair-to-good. Culture is excellent. I wish I had never left and am trying to go back.
good,"Nationwide Insurance is an excellent company to work for in regards to compensation, benefits, working environment, training and advancement opportunities. The people are wonderful to work with and are more like family instead of co-workers. Nationwide is very diverse and focuses on this aspect in every way possible."
good,"Great culture where people care.  Love the gym. Parking is rough.  Management is generally good.  I really like the new CEO, Kirt Walker.  Compensation is okay but you really have to fight for it."
good,"Nationwide is facing the change of generations. 5 years ago I've been told the average age of the FTEs were about 48 years old. Today, most of the employees are still in the company. Although it faced several re-organizations. You can still tell that more retirements are upcoming. The resource is facing more challenge and more opportunities. However, the resistance from seniors is still strong."
good,"Nationwide was busy from the time you got in until the time you left. It was a call center environment and most days calls were back to back. There was a lot of room for advancement. The hardest part of the job were dissatisfied customers, but I could usually brighten their experience."

Over the last 25 years have learned about life insurance and how to work with other people within the company .

good,"Good company to work for, nice management and the perks are great. Some overtime is needed and getting leaves is very tough. More over the CEO's leadership into making the company the best in the Market is realistic and achievable."
good,There isn't a day that goes by that I regret leaving Nationwide. Great management and employees. Pay was ok but for Central PA was better than most. If you work here or are planning to here is some advice. Stay! The job is demanding and requires a certain skill set. But the rewards outweigh the long hours. Good people and I miss having authority over my decisions and pride in my work.
good,Fun work place with supportive management.  Managers are very active in development and coaching.  Career progression is available and up to the individual.
good,"I supervised teams of 15-25 customer service representatives in a call center that employed about 350 CSR's.

good,Nationwide has provided numerous opportunities to grow and lead.

I learned to read medical reports and to manage claims workload. Management was knowledgeable. My co-workers were diverse and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was the commute. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to cross-train."
good,"A typical day at work involved researching and drafting legal documents, analyzing documents, rules and regulations and communicating relevant information to business clients.  In other roles, a typical day involved managing a large team of individuals to successfully implement a class action settlement, using settlement and mediation skills to resolve disputes in the best interest of all parties involved and making financially sound business decisions within budgetary constraints.  I managed litigation and negotiated settlements regarding life and health insurance and investigated fraudulent life insurance claims.  Earlier roles at this company involved processing health insurance claims, reviewing medical records and compliance functions regarding life and health insurance."

good,It was a great experience that taught me a lot about a typical office job day of a 9 till 5 job. However i found that i was just watching people for the majority of the time as i wasn't able to have a login because my work experience was only a week. But apart from that it was an fun and enjoyable experience.
good,"Nationwide as an overall company is great. They have a great new building and they seem to really care and take of their employees. However, they have a serious problem in their homeowners claims department. A reorganization combined with bad weather has lead to a toxic environment where people are quitting in droves. I personally left because it became clear that they do not have a plan to rectify the problem."

good,"Nationwide is a great place to work even if it's just temporary. Your coworkers will be amazing and more than likely become great friends. The management team there is there to help IF you do two things, be used to constant change and show up on time all the time. The number one thing NW frowns upon and will fire you over is not coming in to work or being late. Being even 1 minute late is unacceptable. Also in the employee guidelines it's at the manager's discretion if an abcense is excused. That means issues with your children, extreme sickness that can be proven with a doctor's note, or any other unforeseen circumstances that might arise will not be excused. Other than that your day down to your bathroom breaks is timed."

good,I contact our existing members to ensure satisfaction with thier current insurance and tried to interest them in additonal lines of insurance.
good,Wonderful place to work with understanding management and great work life balance.
good,I had to leave because my son fell ill in CT. He needed a heart transplant. I had been working for Nationwide for less than 1 year and they would not hold my position for me as I did not qualify for FMLA. It was an upsetting situation. I really did enjoy my time there and the supervisors loved to collaborate and really encouraged team participation.
good,"Involved in Coding Using Struts and Spring Framework. "
good,"A  typical day for me is answering the phones, and helping the customers with questions or billing issues. I make all the late payment calls, and also followup calls to customers who have had a claim.   I process payments for 3 companies, and reconcile the money at the end of the day.  I have learned a lot about home and auto insurance rules and the types of coverages needed.  The owner of the company is a friend of mine and she has been very family friendly with the employees as in when you need to attend a child's school event or sickness.  Because the office is small I know my co-workers well.  The hardest part of my job happens when the is a time crunch and we need to process insurance coverage quickly.  The best part of my position is getting to know many of the policyholders either by speaking to them monthly when they call to make their payments, or when they stop by the office."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to come in around 9:00, open up office, get computers booted up and ready for the day. Call on customers, run reports, etc. I learned so much from this job. I deal a lot with customer service issues. The hardest part of the the job was not getting in touch with certain people when I would call for collections. The most enjoyable part was working with my boss. She and I have a great friendship."
good,This is an awesome place to work. You are busy and it can be somewhat stressful but are well compensated.
good,My typical work day consists of taking calls and assisting customers. I have learned all about the auto and property insurance business. My management team has been there to help me and I have enjoyed working with others. The hardest part of my job is providing all accurate information to the insured. The most enjoyable part of my job is everything!
good,Compensation is good.  There is growth opportunity. They are evolving to different ways to file and track claims .  Management is approachable.  Flexible work hours.  Big on health maintenance.
good,"Nationwide nice is a culture. All of the people are great to work with. They just have too many re-organizations. I had one boss for 3 weeks. Then they have way too many layoffs. It's really sad. In order to get promoted, you have apply for another job and they have a 50 mile rule. Full time remote workers must live within 50 miles of a regional office. This rule does not make any sense. We have lost a lot of great people to other companies. Those of us that are left are the best, but there is not any job stability anymore."
good,"Great company to work for and they take care of the employees. Hard to move up, but still a great ""9 to 5"". Bonuses are okay and raises usually occur daily."
good,good opportunities to learn and grow.  Productive and good work environment.  Management assists you in achieving your goals.  There is definitely not enough work life balance
good,"I was in the pet division with good life work balance and a fun vibe with people who care about pets.  Fun, good people.  Autonomy, good manager and caring colleagues."
good,"Prepare and reviews complex federal, state and local statutory financial statements and reports, supplemental and statistical forms and data calls, and/or employment, premium, sales/use and personal property tax returns as well as related journal entries as assigned in accordance with state and federal laws, regulations and/or instructions"
good,"had a company car, "
good,"Great place to work! The people are great, there are opportunities for personal development, and a lot of time to invest in the community (community service and blood donation). Not to mention, Nationwide does provide a great product for members. I would recommend working for this company!"
good,"learned a lot, great culture, great company to start your career. slow to change. leaders reinvent the wheel too much which ends in a endless circle with no end in sight. no advancement once at a curtain level."
good,The pay is great. The values and culture of Nationwide is also great. It is a little difficult to advance internally into other departments of the company. In my current role you are constantly learning new things. Out of training it is constant self-taught learning.
good,There is a lots of room to grow and they genuinely care about their employees. You will feel valued working there. They do not always live up to their own systems for changes and we get surprised a lot. There are systems in place to make changes work but we just do not do enough communication about changes that impact all of us. They are trying to be innovative and if they would include users and key players in *all* the decisions I think they would be so much further along.
good,"I love it, it’s just time for a change. There ar meant different departments to work in and we all deal with different things. I take calls, process work, deal with financials and soon will be doing death benefits. My team deal with annuities."
good,5 stars for culture and peer engagement. Great benefits and pay is high for the area. Not many positions open other than in claims very often. overall great
good,"The environment is very fast pace. Management is very hands off as long as you have clearly defined goals and objectives.  "
good,Nationwide provides ample opportunities for individual and team development.  An enjoyable part of Nationwide culture is the ease of developing partnerships.

good,Nationwide really cares and listens to their employees. It's a great place to work. They have amazing benefits too! The place is very relaxed and just an overall great place to work.
good,I loved working for this company.  They take pride in taking care of their clients.  They have great benefits.  Great schedule.  My only problem was the agent I was working for.
good,Best place to work. Friendly environment. Competition work. Flexible work hours. Team Structure is properly aligned. Goof Insight for the organization.
good,"Had I been able to work remotely, I would still want to work with Nationwide. I found it a very good place to work  I found the company to be well organized and fully customer service driven from an IT perspective"
good,"I answered phones, made changes to policies, gathered information for policy quotes, obtained payments, prepared daily deposit slips, daily filing, and assisted in filing claims. I had a great boss who was willing to work with me if I needed to leave early for any reason."
good,Ensure the safety and security of the overall campus. Review of the CCTV to ensure no infractions occur outside and in some inside areas of the building.
good,"I was a business owner, which meant everything was up to me and the team I put together to make the business work.  We were a top sales office in Tennessee."
good,"Great company to work for, they have excellent benefits and a great paid time off package.  Room for advancement is great and they have tuition reimbursement as well as flex time off."
good,Excellent company with good benefits.  The continuing education benefits are the best thing about the company.  This feature allows you to pursue additional interests to further your learning and growth.
good,Quality support system with a motivating management team.   There were several opportunities to learn from senior agents provided during and after training.  Unique from other sales roles in that agents were afforded autonomy over personal and product marketing in chosen market with few restrictions.
good,"Overall good company to work for, lots of benefits and advancement opportunities depending on what you want to get in to. Pretty flexible with time off."
good,Innovative and ever evolving to meet the demands of the customers.  Strives to provide products to meet the needs of the customer and relies on the employees to work together to deliver.
good,Good place to work if you are in Columbus.The closed all other offices and left only the two main offices in Des Moines and Columbus. Lots of people were laid off due to these closings.
good,"I worked here for over 10 years at the Scottsdale, AZ location and thought I'd stay longer, until my department was eliminated. "
good,"The only down side to the career at Nationwide was being a 1099 employee. Of course with this, there was no benefits. Otherwise it was a great experience."
good,In this job setting you work with alot of different personalities. You have to have patience. And also need to be able to deal with people who call in ipset about something. A good temperament
good,"good place to work. fun atmosphere. good coworkers management needs a little work. and job culture could use some work as well. but never any disputes over money, and money was always good"
good,"Being in the insurance business is something I value with great respect, there is never a dull moment. Texas Law is very unique and it changes all the time along with underwriting guide lines, therefore you are always learning something new. Accidents happen, and filing claims can be fun at times. The hardest part of the job can be that at times is so repetitive, and clients have the same questions over and over- What I love the most about my job is that I like to help our members, find solutions to their issues."
good,I did not work for the company headquarters.  I ran a quasi-independent legal office that was based in the East and did not have day to day dealings with home office as the legal division was basically under a different management team.  The office tried cases and worked out settlement of legal claims.
good,Similar to my other two reviews - this company has been the foundation for everything I know about the insurance industry.  Having knowledgeable bosses and co-workers to work with was a blessing.  I am thankful for the time I spent here.
good,Awesome place to work!  Enjoy assisting individuals with their needs. I love the fact that every day leads to different challenges.
good,"Excellent Job culture, flexibility around the company, lot of projects!!  People are really nice to talk and there are lot of options in downtonw for lunch and 3 cafeterias"
good,I was with Nationwide for seven years.  The work was stimulating and challenging.  They are a company of integrity and fairness.
good,I like the work I do.  I have been in claims for over 25 years and have been handling General Liability claims for the last 6 six years.  I have learned so much in this time regarding Defense and Indemnification as well as the many endorsements that come alone with the commercial polices.  I have a great team support in the office I work at.  I enjoy the professional banter as well as the friendships I have made. The hardest part of my day is getting to everything I have pending.  In claims it is never all done there is always more to do.  That is the nature of this job.  What I like about the position I have is that I have a lot of decisions to make some within my authority some out of my authority.  I like that my opinion matters that I present the facts and my position to my team and hopes that they see the plan as the most effective or that I receive feedback that will serve to the best outcome.
good,Your work was based on how you wanted your day to go you didn't have anyone micromanaging you which so the work day flowed better and you  could get your job done
good,"Allowed to work with all levels of management, as well as outside vendors and their representatives."
good,"Very balanced company. The owner is very good and gives you the opportunity to sell without micro managing. Also, has good income potential."
good,Best of my working experience.  Professional environment.  Excellent  training staff.  Excellent pay and benefits.  Opportunity for advancement professionally and individually.
good,"I greatly enjoyed working at Nationwide and would like to return into the ""right"" position.  The culture was superb, as so were the employees."
good,"Nationwide IT service desk was a great place to work. Its hard to get the job as a regular full time employee."
good,Sorry to see the service center close.  This has been a wonderful place to work for 18 years. Nationwide has given me a great work experience and taught me so much about the insurance industry
good,"Huge financial services company with lots of great people. Very good work culture and engaged associates. Professional management and good pay and benefits."
good,"I work for the Seasonal Property Claims Catastrophe Team. We work Catastrophe Personal Lines Wind and Hail Claims. We Train Adjusters. Review their estimates. The hardest part of the job is working 7 days per week, for 12 hours for 3 to 4 consecutive weeks for 6 months straight with only a couple of days off per month. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my immediate managers and coworkers to achieve a common goal and working with insureds to provide them with superior customer service."
good,"I was able to work with this company for 27 years, with great managers and fellow employees."
good,"Great place to work"
good,No two days were the same and the job provided lots of variety. Lots of ways to explore other career opportunities within the company.
good,"A typical day was learning the new insurance terminology, and studying to be licensed in Auto and Fire Insurance. I also typed, took dictation, filed, quoted rates, collected premiums, helped customers by phone and as they came in the office. I was the only worker besides the agent. The hardest part of the job was when several customers would come in at the same time and the phone would be ringing too. The most enjoyable part was being able to take care of those customers in a calm and timely fashion."
good,I worked in an agency that was a great place to work with people who enjoy being there.
good,"a typical day at work would be somewhat predictible. I learned how to file and input information for closed cases. My coworkers were very much helpful and friendly. the hardest part of my job was learning how to use the swichboard and the most enjoyable part was filing, it was easy"
good,"Great place to work and I am on great terms. I have worked at Nationwide since 2001 (11 years). My wife received an opportunity that she couldn't refuse, so we moved to Raleigh from Des Moines, IA. Unfortunately my job must stay in Des Moines. The company has given me six months to work from our Raleigh Office and to find another job. My position will be ending January 1, 2013."
good,I have worked here for 4 years and it would have been longer if they did not re-organize. I have had nothing but good experiences in their claims department as well as their underwriting department. If I was given the chance to go back I definately would.
good,Liked my job and the people I worked with. Like the flexible hours and working from home. Teamwork worked very well at this company. Everyone was always helpful.
good,"Work from home environment, great schedule. Could improve on engagement. Opportunities to show and develop leadership. Employees permitted to wear jeans daily."
good,"Management has great availability and support employees..."
good,It was a good work environment and hated i had to leave the state or i would still be working there.you had benefits weekends off and get as much overtime u want
good,Proud to work for the 2nd largest Nationwide Agency in the country.  Had the ability to communicate with 22 offices located all around North Carolina to provide excellent customer service to each client.

good,"Great work/life balance, decent benefits, expensive parking, great educational reimbursement, really tough to leave, but there are several changes happening in IT."
good,"Nationwide is a good company to work for, depending on the position you hold. The sales department i was in shut down a year after i started working there."
good,"Nationwide Insurance treats contractors well though a line does separate employees from contractors."
good,"Fast paced, statistic oriented, easy to work at home, nice helpful management, phone meetings often to keep in the loop and up to date on any changes happening."
good,It is a good place to work. I am looking elsewhere as I have advanced as far as I can in my current role and have been unable to obtain another position with the company.
good,"Nationwide lives up to it's billing as a Fortune 100 best company to work for."
good,"While it's not what it was 5 years ago, Nationwide is still a good place to work.  The only drawback is the relocation of jobs to Columbus, OH and the new move to using IEX/scheduling tools to plan everyone's day.  This is frustrating as a Salaried employee, as you'll get all of the negatives of being hourly, with none of the positives of being salaried."
good,"This job was honestly one that actually focused on making you a better person rather than just treating you as ""another employee"". The training period is a little long, but after that its a great place to work."
good,"Productive day at work consists of answering phone and handling customers policies, I also handled the billing accounts and took payments for commercial and personal policies."
good,"In the beginning years very laid back"

good,The staff of Nationwide are very helpful and make you feel part of the team. They are willing to help and go out of their way to make work easier. They are appreciative of all efforts
good,I learned more about how to be a lawyer in the short time I interned there than I did during the entirety of Law School.  This was a summer internship and it was truly the best internship that I did.

good,"This was a great learning experience for me. This was also my introduction to the insurance field, as well as being an office manager, and I excelled."
good,"It was a slow but toward end of week it would be steady throughout day with phone calls needing quotes, answering some simple questions and others were not so simple. In that case always call the Tech team and they usually had answers for things we couldnt fix on our own or answer. Also took payments, made adjustments to policies, explained to customers why or if their rate had gone up or down what the reasons may be and how could we fix it. Answered phones, took payments, Filed, made deposits etc"
good,"I worked varieties of positions at Nationwide Insurance, from filing clerk to a lot of customer service positions.  I am forever grateful to Nationwide Insurance Company for providing me with the opportunities to serve Insurance Agents directly as well as reimbursements for my Master's degree in Insurance and CPCU, CLU, ChFC and other insurance designations."
good,"Everyone is so understanding when ""things come up"" in life.  Nice to have that job where you can come and go as long as your work is getting done well."
good,"I valued my years at Nationwide and the work and learning experience. I was able to experience several different roles such as project management, design,development and implementation."
good,"It was a typical insurance sales/service position. On any given day there were customers who needed to make changes to their policies, or file claims, or start new policies. But what made it awesome were the people - co-workers, management, and all the company support staff from sales to claims adjusters to underwriters. There were paid days off for vacation/sick time as well as holidays. The only downside was the small size of the agency made it unfeasible to offer employer-provided health care, and paying for health insurance individually these days can be financially burdensome."
good,Highly recommend Nationwide as a company to work for. Nationwide management was always available to answer questions to help you find answers to your work related questions. Nationwide provided industry leading training Nationwide always provided opportunity to advance your career
good,"Friendly Managers and Leadership, Lots of opportunities to learn and grow, fair compensation, and clear performance goals and objectives. OVErall quick paced and collaborative."
good,"I had little supervision as I knew what I had to get done and when. My remote co-workers and I spoke on a regular basis but I did not have much interaction with management. The freedom to run errands during the day if I needed, was one of the best perks of working remotely. I wish management had taken the time to understand what I did for the company, had they, I probably would not be going through a job elimination."
good,I have been with Nationwide for over 23 years.  Outstanding professional opportunities.  Great work environment.  Strong community giving culture.  Strong brand recognition.  Overall a great company to work for.
good,"Nationwide is a company that genuinely cares about their members and employees alike. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone looking for a stable, friendly environment with plenty of room for growth!"
good,"Good people, and a company that cares about its employees. Tuition reimbursement is a great perk, and the other benefits are decent besides. Sometimes IT initiatives can feel a bit directionless, but things seem to always work out in the end."
good,"A typical day includes inspecting vehicles that have been involved in accidents, explaining to customers the repair process, being sympathetic to their concerns.  Treat each claim on its own merits. Answering phone calls and emails from internal and external customers.  Controlling rental days based on repair estimates and process of repairs with body shops.  Obtain value of vehicles in the event they are not repairable."
good,"Generally good company to work for. Executive Management and Directors have had issues coming up with a decent strategy for the company. Relaxed atmosphere, good opportunities for advancement."
good,"Provided opportunity to learn more in the healthcare environment. I was given a promotion within 1 year of temporary employment. I had no experience in the medical field. Initially, I was hired to file medical records.  Within 1 month, I was answering customer calls and within 6 months I was interacting with nurse case managers & folllowing up with clients."
good,"I worked at NW for 2 yrs. as a Project Manager, and found the people great to work with.  My managers were great, they cared about you and the work you did.  I was a consultant, but they treated as a part of the team."
good,"The culture here is like no other. Its just so fun and everyone gets along! The management is VERY encouraging and every day at work is a fun one! I have noticed that if you don't have experience with other departments you will likely be stuck in your position for quite sometime with minimal advancement opportunities. "
good,"Since this was a summer intership my duties and day to day experiences were much different than those who work there. "
good,"Nationwide corporate sounds like a wonderful location to be at, with all the trappings of a Fortune 100 company. I have nothing but nice things to say about them, I just wish I had a better opportunity for advancement at my current location."
good,"Fun, laid bacck work environment. "
good,"I enjoy my team and I believe Nationwide is a great company as a whole. My position requires you to stay focused with mostly computer work. The team meets with our supervisor every morning for a 15 min huddle to talk about production, quality, ask and answer any questions and discuses any upcoming changes.  "
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for Nationwide. They spend a lot of time training and developing their employees, will provide education reimbursement as well as ongoing training throughout your career. They have a policy of internal growth and development and personally was promoted twice. "
good,Hard work was recognized and I felt part of a team.  The company entrusted me to perform CAT work following Hurricane Wilma in 2005.  The job allowed me to make my own schedule and I always had great organization skills and management did not oversee that.
good,Typical day at work would consist of taking anywhere from 15-30 calls a day speaking to various individuals from all over the country assisting with insurance needs. P&C
good,"A typical day is busy, but that is fine, I personally enjoy keeping my mind active and cannot stand to not have anything to do.  Management is supportive and encourage us to continue self improvement.  The hardest part of the job at this time, is my department is being relocated to another state and not very many co-workers are going."
good,Great company to work for. Hard to be promoted within the same job role. If you are mobile there is more growth opportunity. The people here are wonderful and appreciate hard working dedicated individuals. Great benefits as well.
good,"- My current place of employment encourages:"
good,The company is great to work for because it values it 's employees and encourages them to apply for any position that will advance their career.
good,"solid stable company, depends a lot on who your principle agent is but the company as a whole has a HUGE advantage over the other large insurance companies.  You're still a ""Captive"" agent but you have other options as far as carriers to use.  Nationwide doesn't limit you to Just their products they have a huge brokerage arm that makes you a lot ore competitive then the other large insurance companies."
good,"Nationwide has been a good company to work for.  They may not pay the best but they have been more loyal, than most, and tend to care about people, and help the develop."
good,"Nationwide Insurance is an excellent place to work.  There are numerous opportunities to collaborate with others, and develop mentoring partners with co-workers."
good,"Being in a department that is quickly growing, high levels are expected during busy seasons, however, management lacks the ability to staff the appropriate number of associates year after year.  Associates are expected to effectively and accurately handle claims in all 48 states because teams are not divided up into regions.  This doesn't work.  Coworkers are great and hardworking people."
good,90% of sales are performed over the phone. I have a lot of respect for Nationwide Insurance. Supportive customer service team was always there to assist when being new to the company.
good,I love working for Nationwide. I have learned so much and continue learning each day. The only reason I am looking for a new opportunity is because I can not get benefits from them.
good,"Company has great life balance "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting in maintaining the day to day duties for which I was responsible.  I learned a great deal about team building and the importance of reaching goals.  The management was very hands on and put effort into employee satisfaction.  My co-workers were driven and goal oriented.  The hardest/most challenging part of the day was problem solving as it related to adhering to underwriting guidelines and retention of clients.  The most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with clients with positive news concerning rate reductions, discounts or birthday wishes."
good,"A typical day at Bradford Painting: Morning printing and balancing daily sales. Setting appointments, ordering product, weekly schedules for painters."
good,"I have learned to be efficient while handling customer issues.  While being at Nationwide I have broadened my knowledge about insurance and have kept the property and casualty license."
good,Working at Nationwide the last 13 years has been both good and bad. I learned many life lessons and more about diversity. I also mastered multi-tasking and working efficiently from one position to the next.
good,Good working culture and best place to work. Co-workers are very good and very helpful. Day to day work at Nationwide is very reasonable.
good,"I enjoy my position at Nationwide, a typical day includes making outbound calls to members to inform them of any changes or anything they need to be aware of, selling auto, home, and life policies and taking care of our members that come in to the office.  I have learned that customer service and sales really do go hand in hand because working with our members and providing them five star service earned me their continued business, their new business, and referrals.  So many of our members came back with more insurance needs that they wanted me to handle for them and a lot of referrals.  The hardest part of the job is not having the team I want.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the day to day communication with our members."
good,"Great Company, Management that care about Employee's"
good,"Friendly co-workers, supportive leaders and major focus on customer centricity and employee well-being"
good,This is a great job if you love typing.You work is constantly monitored. The best part is the culture and people.

It interacts with other modules to fetch the members data and based on that will calculate the monthly payments."
good,"Nationwide is a very large company based in Columbus, Ohio that has a large amount of opportunity for advancement. The culture is one that allows and encourages development of its associates."
good,I enjoyed learning a lot of what I know from Nationwide. Management was good the benefits were awesome.  The pressure that was put on the Agent to do everything under a microscope was unbearable.
good,"Work from and in Lotus Notes email, Citrix Program and application. Also, in Application of URBO and Epro/Peoplesoft. My managers have encouraged us to learn as much as possible and mix up our work as well as continuous improvement to help save the company money and us time on a job or process. My co-workers work as a team and together to better our processes and improve work flow. With My job there isn't really a hard part to it, it's all numbers and inputting.  I do enjoy knowing others and working with many others as we can learn a part of every aspect of our jobs."
good,Assist customers with their questions on their account. Quote and sell insurance. Collect payments and process bank deposits.
good,"Excellent work environment! Thoroughly enjoyed working with Nationwide, handling books of assumed reinsurance claims.

good,"- Very busy but enjoyable"
good,This was one of my favorite jobs. Unfortunately did not get to continue my career here because of an unexpected family issue. This employer had a great environment and flexible options for people with families.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, I felt valued as an employee and as a member of the team. The only reason for leaving is because the position was being eliminated."
good,"The employees and owner of the office were very friendly, understanding, and easy to learn from. Very laid back atmosphere that is family oriented. Owner was very involved in the community."
good,"Out of all my experience, Ive had some of the best supervisors. They've consistently shown how motivated they are to help and support you. This company is big on diversity and celebrates its brand. Very customer focused. I will say it is definitely a challenging job, you will constantly be learning new things. Its rewarding overall."

good,"Customer focused, internal and external, dedicated to best quality products and services, encourages associates to be involved in their own development, strong mentoring and professional development opportunities available."
good,"It was a fast paced environment, I was always learning new things and ways to be more efficient.  There was a ton of support from management and leaders in my department.  We had meetings/team discussions about our goals, metrics, and how are weeks were.  Overall a great place to start a career."
good,I enjoyed working there very much.  Work/life balance was very important and they worked very well with me.  I felt like the work experience this gave me furthered my career.
good,A great environment in which to work but some questionable upper management decisions.  The employees usually were employed there for 20-30 years which indicates employee loyalty. Would highly recommend this company.

Myself and peers have saved the bank over half a million dollars through a program that was put together collaboratively within the first quarter.  With that being said, we were not considered for other positions to continue employment within the company, and it is a little difficult to understand after the hard work and effort put into the bank."
good,"The job is one of critical thinking, and interpersonal skills. A great environment to work in with a wide variety of skill levels for each and every aspect of insurance."

I have learned a lot at this job from doing deposits to managing my time and being productive.

good,"Answering phones and assisting callers with filing claims for their homes or their auto from accidents or other scenarios.  The managers were always helpful and friendly.  The floor manager was always willing to step out of the norm to bring a smile to the employees. My co-workers and teammates were always willing to give helpful tips and advice. The hardest part of the job was when, no matter how much you wanted to help, your hands were tied due to the limitations on the customers' policy. I loved it when I knew the customers were getting prompt service (their claim properly filed, set up with a rental, set up for a tow, and connected with their adjuster) and at the end of the call, they thanked me for helping them, even though I was just doing my job."

good,"Nationwide is a strong employer with great job opportunities and a strong workplace culture focused on improvement and constructive criticism rather than harsh reviews and critique. Everybody working there is very friendly and communal, and everybody works actively to help each other. The biggest issue is the slight feeling of difficulty moving around in the company when you're just a CSR, since it's hard to gain the experience and skills that lend themselves well to another position you might be interested in. That being said, hard work and looking for a new position you can eventually breakthrough and get what you're looking for."

I have never had such understanding supervisors and management.  I work recommend this company to anyone.
good,"I enjoy working for Nationwide, but I have no issues understanding what is requested of me and adhering to said requests.

good,"There is always something different to look forward to at the agency. Because there is so much that goes in to insurance, every day I learn something new and get excited to educate my clients, family and friends on this topic. During my time here at the agency I have acquired patience and understanding. Each day you deal with people with different backgrounds and beliefs. And as an insurance agent that strives to build a relationship with our members, I have had to learn from my clients, how to communicate with each one and adjust myself in a way that assures me that I am properly taking care of their needs. What I have learned about management is that it is not about giving orders and leading , but it is more about creating leaders with the same vision to succeed. I have learned that a great amount of time is spent at my job with my co-workers, which makes them and work my second family and home. And as members of one family, working together for the good of all is indispensable. Each member has their own character and values they bring to the table and taking the time to learn from them, listen to them, and share with them has given me so much wisdom for growth inside and outside of work. I'd have to say the hardest part of my job is having see my clients struggle through a claim process because they chose not to select a certain coverage that could have benefit them so much. One of the most enjoyable parts of my job is that feeling you get when someone thanks you for explaining insurance to them in a way that n one else has, and now they are able to understand something so"

good,"Have always in some form worked with the public and that is the best part to a job.  Have had management position when I worked at banking which I did for 17 years. Something I have always wanted to do is work the Presidential and State elections, jury duty, and census have did that since living In Delaware."

good,"Nationwide was like being with my family all day. I started there when I was in my early 20s as a claims representative and had the opportunity to learn and grow into various claims positions and up to Administrative Services Manager in the Richmond Market.

I landed a Regional Vice President Position before age 30 and proudly worked selling annuities, life and pensions OUT in the field first in DC, MD VA then I was moved back to OH, PA, WV.

Shadowing and collaborating with other teams will open up plenty of doors for you."

good,This company definitely takes the time to properly train their associates and ultimately sets them up for success.  The amount of experience and knowledge in the insurance industry I've gained from them is exceptional.  I'd say the hardest part about the job is the desk restriction and the process of getting approval to get time off.
good,"This is the first employer that I've worked for that I actually can't imagine leaving for another position. The work environment is fun and very encouraging in your development and growth. After 2 and a half years I have never feared being laid off due to lack of work, in fact when companies are laying off, we're hiring more employees.

good,"Typical day:  customer service, multi-lining for new business (cross-selling), daily deposit."
good,"I love customer service, and I love to help people."
good,"Nationwide is an excellent company currently undergoing great internal change. Being a 30,000 man strong behemoth, that change can only come slowly, one step at a time. While working here I was thoroughly impressed with 2 groups: older experienced managers, as well as the young blood of the company. Specifically, the more quantitative minded employees here are just as smart as driven as many people on Wall Street. Unfortunately, the firm is extremely nice to its employees and I got the impression that unless you do something horribly wrong or have personal issues, you will be unlikely to get fired or laid off. The culture at Nationwide felt like the opposite of the Jack Welch mentality, which may hurt its efficiency in the longer term now that all the other insurance firms are undergoing draconian cost cutting efforts. Note too that since it is a mutual company, its primary objective is probably more to stay afloat for the long run rather than making mad profits."
good,"Flexible work hours, supports higher education and continuing education; my career skyrocketing at this company -- unfortunately, I had to leave for family reasons and then moved out of state; I still keep in touch with the wonderful people I met while at Nationwide; the company does expect a lot from those employees who want to ""move up the ladder -- not sure how I would be at balancing work and family; opportunities for growth were plentiful."
good,"Busy office environment, answered phones, worked with clients"
good,I came to Nationwide January 2009 and have loved being here! I work with great people and have a supporting leadership team. At this point I take escalated calls from customers and agents on issues that less experienced representatives may not be able to assist with. The hardest part of what I do is deescalating situations to a level where it is manageable.Which also happens to be the most enjoyable part!
good,I have enjoyed working at Nationwide Insurance. For a company of it's size it really has an engaged workforce that is striving for continuous improvement. Everyone on my team has been extremely helpful and cooperative. They live their corporate values everyday.
good,"Management was excellent, projects were GREAT!  If I wasn't moving out of state, I believe that I would still be there.  The people are pretty awesome to work with as well."
good,"Enjoyed working at Nationwide. Everyone worked well together, and worked the cases thoroughly.  I felt a certain amount of independence yet still working as a team."

good,Great people and a nice place to work for a copywriter. Good working environment. Energetic downtown location.Senior leadership solid. Opportunity for advancement.
good,"I loved coming to work at Nationwide. The leaders in our office always took an interest in their people's success. They understood that a high engaged group meant that people worked at their highest potential. When we closed our office the leaders made sure that we had everything we needed to find other roles in the company or outside the company. As I left I still continue to search for that company that's like ""Nationwide"". Best company I ever worked for."
good,"Nationwide provided a great deal of opportunities in regards to self assessment, development, continuous improvement, work balance, etc.  I enjoyed work balance and. the opportunity to advance my skills."

I was treated always with kindness, respect, and they would always have events celeraitng all cultures and our success at Nationwide."
good,"I was initially worried about working for a fortune 500 company, but once I was a few questions into the interview I knew that this would be different. The interview included many technical questions to gauge aptitude but most of the other questions were not normal in my experience. This isn't to say this was a bad thing, these questions were more based on how well you fit with the rest of the team rather than other metrics and was a welcome change.  I got out of training feeling like I had a solid understanding of procedures and proprietary software for the company. Work culture was top notch, the company loves food and will find any excuse to have potlucks or to celebrate in general."
good,"You manage your own desk and workflow, the mentoring is great, I've worked my way up the ladder so much room for growth. Casual work environment. The feeling of inclusion."

good,"My typical work day consists of helping customers file auto accident claims. I take them through a series of questions to find out about the type of accident they were involved in. Based upon the information keyed in the information provided to me will help me to better assist the customer by getting the claim filed and handled by an adjuster. I have learned a great deal about insurance and the process customers have to go through when getting the claims filed for the customers; whether is is for the policy holder, or the claimant involved in the accident. Each individual is treated with the same regard and respect whether they are a policy holder or a claimant, as this could be a potential customer in the near future based upon the service they received. I would say that the management at this company has been very outstanding and supportive. My supervisor has the same outlook as the managers and is ready and willing to get in the trenches with us.  I think the hardest part of the job for me has been to transition from banking which I have been in for the past thirteen years into insurance.  It is entirely a whole different type of work environment. The co-workers I have had the privilege of working with have been very enjoyable to be around and work with. I would say this has definitely been an eye opener for me when in comes to the insurance industry. I think the most enjoyable part of the job is being part of such a great organization that has a lot of offer."
good,"Working for Nationwide Insurance was an education for me. I was licensed in Auto and Home Insurance. I worked with many clients with fulfilling their needs. I worked with a small team that worked very well together. The best part of my job was my manager, he always bent over backwards to make work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was unsatisfied clients. As working in an insurance office there is many ways a persons insurance can increase in the premium amount. Not everyone understands that the office personnel cannot just change the amount of the premium, unfortunately. I always did my best to help where I could."

good,"My day was very enjoyable for the most part. I could actually listen to music and book tapes and still do well at my job. How great is that? Most of my co-workers were great people and I miss them very much. As far as management goes, we had some great ones and some that were not so great. I particularly felt picked on by one for no reason. But, it may have been because I questioned something she did and it turned out that I was correct. I just wanted to be consistent. It seem that Medicare has gotten a lot more consistent over the years, which is great. Consistency makes for correct payments to our Doctors and Beneficiaries. This person actually became my boss for a short time and my yearly evaluations went from high to low and nothing had changed. But, as soon as I got a new manager,they went back up again. Which tells me a lot."
good,"The Herberta J. Jones Agency is a small agency owned and operated by a husband and wife team.

good,"I worked at Nationwide for a little over two years. It was a wonderful experience and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I had great leaders who cared about my development and success. On top of having great leaders, I had phenomenal co workers that always made my day a little brighter. Having a best friend at work is so important in order to be productive and grow professionally, and I had that. Nationwide is a company that is family and friend focused, and not many companies like that anymore. It is a place that welcomes diversity and pushes for inclusion. They support all of their associates and clients, and value each and everyone of them. I can go on and on about how great Nationwide is, but you will just have to see for yourself. Go on and apply. You won't regret it if you get a job offer!"

Management has been above and beyond amazing! Hardest part of the job would probably be sticking in one area the whole entire time but other than that everything is great. I learned the importance of helping others out in a much calmer manner on those phones to ensure great customer service, because you never know what could be going on in someone's life on the other end!"
