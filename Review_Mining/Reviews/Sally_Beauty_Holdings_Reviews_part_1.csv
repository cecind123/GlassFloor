bad,"Basically, if you take away ALL of the things that a potential employee would look for in a job, you would be left with Sally's. Professionalism is non-existent. Management at ALL levels (the one's you CAN get in contact with anyways) are NO help. Benefits are ""minimal"" (at best). Associate samples/""Freebies"" are either threatened or NOT received by employees at all. (Most of the time we didn't get them at all bc they were ""out of stock"" in our store until AFTER the date we could get them had passed.) Spif payments for selling monthly sale items are never paid out correctly if they are even paid at all. Managers constantly threaten employees that ""we are all going to lose our jobs if we don't get our sales up.."" (However, they ALWAYS seem to manage to take their ""vacation"" every other month and they NEVER work on PEAK days, OR during PEAK hours?!?) Respect doesn't exist and even basic human dignity is put to the test. I, myself, thought ""Eh, maybe it was just the manager that was the problem.."" So, I gave them another chance and went back under new management and no change. Same issues, different manager."
bad,"You only get benefits if you're a manager & work full time. You can work 40+hrs a week & still be considered part time because they don't want anyone to move up within. They'll manipulate you into thinking you're doing super good, gonna move up & make bank & can only make bank at sallys b/c they pay ""good."""
bad,"Don’t get sucked into this company. It will kill you. No opportunity for upward mobility in the company, shipment is ridiculous as are the sales quotas, incentives are rubbish."
bad,Upper management doesn’t even understand the computer system that is in place for tracking production. Upper management doesn’t hold employees accountable for attendance or performance on regular basis. Upper management’s engagement is very weak and predominately just for one shift. Thus creating a bad environment across three shifts sending/delivering mixed messages.
bad,I worked for Sally 3 years.  Management was cut throat.  Always threatened my job over inventory loss.  I had no control over people stealing.  No support from HR or upper management..
bad,"This company is literally the fast food of the beauty industry. They believe their employees are essentially robots and are replaceable in every single, possible way. The pay is lower than nearly any other retail job yet this is a world-wide billion dollar company that is currently making more money than ever. The workload is debilitating. Even managers are paid as low as possible. They enforce an unreasonable amount of training on us but only on useless things that are completely pointless and they overlook and don't even offer or have available training for anything what would be useful &/or needed, which means that employees are only knowledgeable if they can even find the time in their personal lives to train themselves on how to use the products the company sells. It's a messy job and the store is filled with toxic chemicals which are spilled daily and as an employee you will be responsible for cleaning up every accident. The products that they sell are t"
bad,"I worked there for about 2 months. The management is crazy, the actual manager was on “sick leave” but was actually meaning on quitting but still wanted the money from “sick leave”. So that left the non official assistant manger in charge, and she went on a power trip. She was so unprofessional and I guess that isn’t her fault she wasn’t trained to be in management. They would tell me the dress code then when I changed what I wore it would change again and I got written up for not wearing the correct things when I wasn’t told what the right thing to wear is. All the women who work there are catty and mean, they don’t like accepting new employees into their circle, they are insecure and rude. I would not recommend working here ever!"
bad,"Sally beauty is full of corrupt, shady management and corporate is even worse. They don’t care about you and don’t give you a raise. You are forced to work a lot when no one is there and don’t compensate you for it."
bad,"Management is horrible, HR is horrible, customers get snippy and the amount of stress that this job gives you is not at all worth the amount you get paid."
bad,"This company is extremely cold, especially the DM and managers. They don’t see you as an individual with a life more so a number to their company, they could care less about if you have a dire emergency arise, they don’t give good work life balance they’re only concern is making money, they don’t care how anything affects their employees, they give awful hours and discriminate against their employees. It’s sad how many times I’ve heard people hire up talk awful about every employee there, when those are the people helping run the business, those are the people putting their time in. Doesn’t matter how hard you work, how long your there you will always have to “prove yourself to them” pretty sad. Avoid."
bad,"Low wages, hard work.  To make matters worse you would think corporate would be better and professional. I have been trying to speak with someone for 3days. I'll get to the receptionist be transferred, to only be put on the line for over an hour. I have even left 2 voice mails.  If you like being short paid overworked then this is the place for you. It's also a fixed-rate, no promotions"
bad,"The new owners literally are money hungry, they do not care about the employee at all and no matter how much you try to explain the obstacles you encounter at work they will not care. Managers have been dropping left and right and the few that are staying in the company are simply struggling to live. Sally Beauty is an amazing place to shop, a horrible place to work for."
bad,"When corporate made the ""Can do Culture"" Im sure they had big plans to make Sally's great! The experience I had with Sally was the WORST I have had with any employer!!! Lies and shady Behavior is all I experienced here. My district manager ignored employees and her Follow through was next to nothing. When I was hired I was told a wage and when I got my first paycheck it was $3 less. My DM and AM came into my store one day and we talked about goals and what I needed to hit to bonus. My team and I achieved that goal but I didn't get the bonus. District Manager hired employees from her last place of employment, paid them more than current managers are making, has current managers train them to take over the store when the DM fires current manager. So I guess my message to management is the culture ""can do"" only works if management isn't setting their employees up for failure!! I would really look at area managers and district managers to get a clear picture of what's going on down to the store level with high turn over rates."
bad,Managers at Sally Beauty did not last a year due to the company did not pay much attention to their stores. My location was robbed once and broken into several times.
bad,"- No manager for months and no cooperate help to replace "
bad,If you’re not a minority or don’t know someone there you won’t last very long. I was working there for several years put my time in an energy and it never asked for time off then my job asked to be promoted or if I had a future I won the time came when it seem like I was going to get promoted someone that was only working for a couple months who had several complaints from customers  All because she was related to the managerapparently was more qualified to be promoted than I was
bad,"the franchise itself is horribly run - at least in canada & this specific location i worked at was a mess. management is rude, discriminatory and breaks multiple labour law rules. they paid a couple of my co-workers $15.50 (they were not managers) & the rest of us were paid $15.00. they also often forget to pay you correctly on paycheques. do not work here ladies, please!!!!"
bad,Cheap pay and their expecrions are high. Cliquey upper management who pick and choose whom they want to succeed in company .corporate does not care about well being of employees
bad,"This company considers its employees throw aways. They push to always have more employees in there back pockets, the only thing they care about is money. Managers do not matter and are not valued after the very little training they get. DM has her faves and those are the only ones that count. Unrealistic expectations."
bad,"Total waste of time&space,not even worthy of a review,no respect for their employees,little pay,a total waste..don't work there..it sucks,manager to.."
bad,"They don’t pay enough for what you do for work , totally changed the way they do things and way too many rules and they don’t care about their employees you just another number ."
bad,"Mucha carga de trabajo ,cambiar todo de lugar por los planogramas que son estresantes te llevan día entero y  pagan poco no pagan extras ,te mueven tus descansos pésimo ambiente nuo hay crecimiento laboral no reconocen tu esfuerzo te mueven de una suc a otra nunca te llegan los bonos de despensa ni el ""bono"" por meta"
bad,"I worked here as a Brand Associate for nearly a year and during my time here I had 3 different managers assigned to the store. The manager they assigned to the store before I quit was completely unprofessional and bullied other employees, including myself. She had written in a journal in which she left in the back table for everyone to see nasty things about her “impressions” of all the girls working at the store. She also would do no work while in the store, rather just sit in the back on her phone pretending to do “schedules” almost every single day for 12 hour shifts. She would demand every plannogram be updated but never once in the few months I worked with her did I ever see her lift a finger to do anything in the store. She made us text her pictures of us mopping the floors, doing plannograms, front facing product, and the windows outside when she was not at the store, and if we didn’t, she would send out nasty messages in the group message saying she would write us up. I contacted the Employee Concern line multiple times more specifically about the journal situation and every time they were called the brushed it off and DID NOTHING ABOUT IT because the DM wants to play favorites rather than HELPING their employees when something inappropriate is going on. The manager made me so miserable I quit on the spot and texted her (since she was on “vacation”) saying I will not be coming back. Fast forward a few weeks later; she’s leaving the store and transferring to a new one. I contacted the same line requesting to be connected with the DM so I could speak to her about returning"
bad,"Everyone will say this is a great place to work in, not entirely true."
bad,"Well let's just say that hard work never pays off at Sally beauty . I was and still is heartbroken, cause I was let go for new changes that I didn't understand and a few months after I was let go they changed it all and I ask to step down from my manager position and they said no. So like I said hard work never pays off at Sally beauty."
bad,"Worked there’s for several months. My assistant manager was the store manager before and was also best friends with my DM. Together they made my job really hard and stressful. Was always pinned against the corner and held accountable many times without ever knowing why. I was harassed several times on the phone by DM and was put in situations that felt like a set up. Called HR and had hard time reaching someone so all the majority of my issues where never heard. When I did get someone my DM was notified and he was a my store the same day. He was never reachable. My management training was 5 months after hire date and my AM trained for a total of 15 hours in 3 days, when its a 5 day 8hour training session. I do not recommend slly beauty to anyone! They expect the employee to always take Accountability but no one in upper management has to follow the same same rule! Good luck !"
bad,"They expect you to run the store like a manager, but only care about $$$$. If you dont have high sales, you get your hours cut, then get fired. No excuse for low sales. Terrible & stressful."
bad,I worked there for almost two years and many times contemplated finding a new job and always decided against it until this last time I finally just quit and got a new job.  Most customers at my location were very rude.  Management was ok until recently.  I felt like my manager was more focused on trying to move up in the company and everything started to unravel.  The girls I worked with were ok sometimes and standoffish at others.  They mostly stayed in the back on their phones while I did most of the work.  The last two weeks I was there I did the bare minimum and it showed how much I really did for the store.  I quit because I didnt really feel appreciated and felt like I was being taken advantage of.
bad,"Before I go on, I am sure that this information will be very familiar to those involved. I have done the courtesy of excluding the names of those people and thus ask that no retaliation occurs for me sharing my experience. I had always loved Sally's and I'd shopped there most of my life. I was excited when I started, it was all new staff except for the manager and one employee. One person who was hired on with me had a family member that would visit, and this family member began to verbally attack me when I was shelving a product. My manager and coworkers were with her twerking so I continued doing my job and ignored it. Later that person punched my arm and began insulting me and following me around the store calling me ugly. I told my manager and she ignored it until the day her supervisor was there when she finally went outside and privately asked the person to leave (so her supervisor wouldn't see). However since nothing had been done so many times before, I didn't feel safe. I had been followed, insulted, and assaulted in my workplace and management did nothing. She also allowed this person to enter the back room of the building so I was not even safe in the employee only area. I wanted to reach out to tell the GM what was happening but I was scared I would be retaliated against by my supervisor. I truly believe I was treated differently because of my race, and I believe if I had not quit they would have found a reason to fire me."
bad,I was hired and was told we get a weekend or two off a month I work every single weekend because  everyone else wanted the weekends off and it was supposed  to rotate so everyone had a chance for a weekend off. The pay is terrible. You will be treated like a low man on the totem pole. I basically  felt like a janitor  there. All I did get to do was sweep and mop. There is a different manager now so hopefully things have improved.
bad,"Sally Beauty is a company to work for right out of high school if you want to gain customer service and retail experience. This company isn’t a future career, it just gets you by. Managers/ Supervisors are with the most hours (full time) and you only get part time hours even less then 18hrs a week. Your hours are based on how well your sells are and if you hit your quota (no commission). If you’re going to work in this company make sure you take your vacation time because if you ever decide to leave the company the company will not cash you out for your accumulated vacation time. Policy changed. So that’s how they get you. Anyways good luck and seek a job that cares for their employees and empower you to grow"
bad,"This is a David Brent style company, management spend more time preparing party's and trying to be liked than training staff. Zero health and safety, Tired drivers (working 12 hours with only 30 min break). Cowardly management, they would rather threaten an entire work force than deal with one person misusing company property. Sallys is a disgrace to the warehouse industry,  they really should be ashamed of themselves."
bad,"I started out thinking the job would be great, but management is too fast paced and they expect so much out of you when you have little training. They don’t give you anytime to reciprocate or absorb anything. There’s also very poor communication and stress off the job. If you want a life outside of work this isn’t the job for you. My manager straight up lied saying I should make myself more available to work, even on my off days . Her reason was that “it’s in the handbook that if you’re called into work even on off days that you have to work and come in” and I was constantly harassed by work issues that could have waited till I came into work. You work hard and meet quotas while it only benefits management while they sit relaxing. Management would had employees work front while she was either in the back abusing work tablets to text or FaceTime friends and family or getting off early or vacationing. Management picks favorites and district manager isn’t on employees side if you confide in them either. They just covered for the store manager. It’s very cliquey. There’s also no security cameras so it’s a high theft location which puts you in unsafe scenarios."
bad,"The entire place is so competitive you can’t breathe, and the drama is relentless. It’s just snotty teenage girls who bicker all day long. Management makes you do everything and sits back while you do."
bad,"First of all, they don't train you properly and leave in the store by yourself to figure out whatever you should do. Secondly, the reason for that is they want to dismiss you whenever they wanted to. The upper management is the worst. They come in the store joke around and insult you. Imply that you even MIGHT be stealing with no basis or insult you, treat you like you are an animal. They don't make you a full time employee because they do not want to pay for benefits.There is also discrimination, favouritism and bullying. They will consume all your time for their favour and give back nothing. They just bully you. The whole corporation is corrupted. Don't even bother applying to save yourself and find a better job. Anywhere is better than here. In the last 5 months, everyone quit I know working there."
bad,I was the assistant manager. An employee was stealing and the manager refused to do anything about it because she knew the girl since she was young. I went to the district manager who did nothing.
bad,"I was a part-time employee who worked at several stores in order to make any sort of money. After working there for over a year I only got a 16 CENT raise, while the people i worked with got even less than that. None of our customers liked the manager, and my manager was extremely rude to everyone if they didn't buy a lot (because of quotas we had to hit). The district manager was also unnecessarily rude, and the territory manager was even worse. The district manager had to make mandatory visits to stores, and she would waste time by being on her phone in the middle of the store calling her husband to talk about what she wanted him to make her for dinner. The company makes hour cuts in every single store towards the end of the year, and it never includes cutting any manager's hours, only associates. The manager would also put used products that had been returned back on the shelf. On top of all of that, out of all the stores I had to work at, the shipments of products constantly had dead/alive roaches, crickets, ants, and various beetles in them."
bad,"Hired with promises of advancement.  Was placed with asst manager duties yet refused the title but still made to do the duties. Was told I wasn’t being moved up because my “sales were the only thing keeping the store afloat” "
bad,As a company they are good to work for..but upper management needs proper training and people skills and understand life happenings! Support your manager .not take sides with employees
bad,It’s starts out fine as a part time but they expect way to much of its employee without giving them any way to achieve what they want. Managers are awful and so was the district manager
bad,I have never worked for a retail business like that before. The manager keeps you out of what's going on. They cut my hours so much I'm now looking for a new job. Don't wast your time working there. T
bad,It's absolutely ridiculous how this company is run. Management is dishonest and back stabbing. They hold you accountable for situations that are out of your control. Half the time stores are run on a skeleton crew. Worst experience of my life.
bad,The company basically used me to train other people to do what I was already doing for little or no manager's pay or position. That lies about training me and they lied in me to get rid of me.
bad,"at first i loved it, it was fun and challenging trying to help customers figure out what they wanted weather it was hair, makeup, skin care, but the management ruined it for me so left for a better opportunity"
bad,i was very excited to work here i loved it i love hair makeup and nails but the manager was horrible there was a lot of jealousy going on and made up stories to get people in trouble i was asked to go on my 30 min lunch break so i did and i can back in and was told it was job abandonment so i was set up ! but not only that i am a regular i do my hair i love there products i was told they would like if i didn’t come in anymore ! i i never started any issues with this company so i don’t know why i was told not to shop here ! very unprofessional
bad,"I thought I would love working at Sally's, and I did at first. I have a cosmetology license and making my sales goals was easy because I knew exactly how to help with complex customer needs. However, I began to realize that this was an unfair company; sometimes on the manager's part and sometimes in regards to company policy. I was hired on as part time (15-20 hrs/week). I found myself working 36-38 hours a week. My manager would work me just a few hours under full time so as to avoid having to provide employee benefits to me. In the four months that I worked there, I NEVER had a weekend off. I understand it's retail and weekends are a must, but one weekend out of the month would have been nice and doable since there were enough employees to rotate. During my last month there, the company made some policy changes that I highly disagreed with and was honestly the final straw. I would work 9 to 10 hours a day and had my lunch break cut down from one hour to thirty minutes. My manager was still allotted an hour lunch, even though she was not on her feet as much as we were. The next change that I felt was wrong and honestly unsafe was the fact that we went from closing with another employee during the week to having to close alone. I worked at a San Antonio location and thought that this rule put us at risk for robbery or harm. However, our manager said that they did not want to have to pay two people to close during the week because it was slow. Another policy that I discovered was quite unfair was their reimbursement to work at other stores. As I mentioned before, I lived in San"
bad,The management is overbearing and micromanaged everything. If u dont make certain quotas ur docked hours each week! So unprofessional. Over the years corporate added more and more applications to check everyday and more tasks the demanded done without proper help.
bad,"Beauty Consultants do everything a manager does with no bonuses. Beauty consultants also have to hit a daily targeted sales goal, If we don't make our individual goals we get penalized for it, if this goal is not met it affects your schedule, meaning if you have low sales, you get low hours.  There is no kind of reward or extra payment. We make goals and sales for the manager to get bonuses and we get nothing in return.  The job is nice for the discounts and monthly rewards, but the manager doesn't always tell you about them either."
bad,"Upper management at Sally Beauty did not care for the well being of the employess. They only care about making money. They hire horriable managers with no people skills, like to cause unnecessary drama, and who treat employees like trash."
bad,"At first work was great but then it got really bad . The store I worked at only had 3 other girls so it was a small work environment. My manager wasn’t that friendly , she was very disorganized. Literally when I told"
bad,"Horrible place to work point blank period! Managers play favorites and take advantage of literally everything including their associates. Mangers leave early without clocking out and then fix timecard saying they were actually there all day. LOTS of internal theft. Not paid nearly enough for everything they ask of associates to do. Managers should be lifting up their associates not talking about them behind their vack. just sont waste your time gete, bunch of washed up hair people and poor management."
bad,"Stressful work environment.  It is all about numbers.  Customers are numbers to corporate and they focus on what you sell them and not the customer experience.  The needs of the customer is not the focus of the employees, they focus on the wants of the company and try to sell you stuff you don't need in order to make the numbers quota.  This company has forgotten about how to care for the customer and only cares about money, thus making employees lose focus on helping the customer."
bad,Management was bad they work you like a slave it’s impossible to hit Production very hot company does not care about employees !  Managers do not make sure you are Properly trained before they put you in a zone every man for their self’s
bad,"Mediocre open door policy. Meaning don’t speak up about anything or you might get fired. These are evasive tactics used by upper, middle, and lower level management to deviate from issues within the workplace. Great pay but you won’t enjoy it because your hours will get cut at random. Also expect to be highly micromanaged. If this store would focus more on beauty and customer satisfaction and not  all about sales, and daily profits. This company could care less about customers or employees. It’s sad because there is a lot of potential for this to be a great company’s"
bad,I enjoyed working with customer but when you don't no anything about hair dyes it was a little awkward.. especially working at a beauty store.. They need to hire professional ..
bad,The manager threatens your job whenever you disagrees with her. She gossips about the employees to other employees. She asks employees to do her job. she complains whenever she has to actually do her job. She steals from the company. I walked in several times while she was painting her toenails in the back. This is the most horrible company I have ever worked for. I tried calling HR nothing has happened
bad,I love my coworkers and working with the products but I am not compensated for my knowledge that i give away everyday and being 30 years in the beauty business I should be a manager but it seems the DM in this district does not know how to handle business.
bad,Management was awful and treated the employees like slaves while they do nothing. Being constantly put down created a very hostile environment so I left.
bad,"Honestly if you have any self worth do not work here!! It is a horrible place to work, the girls I worked with were amazing and we were a good team, but it has high turnover and we work in small teams at the stores (usually 4-5 girls) and when this would happen they would expect us. (Getting paid minimum wage) to pick up the slack and work 40+ hour weeks since it’s open 7 days a week and worst part, you never get a raise (some people would only get 20 cents for being there for a year.) if you expect to work up don’t. This is a dead end job, not worth the time or money.. Plus on top of it all the DM is really rude and never understanding. I was sick one time to the point I was passing out and was told I wasn’t allowed to close and leave the store till someone else got there to take over before I could go to the emergency."
bad,"Hated working here, the pay was awful and the whole thing with selling the products up front by the register doesn't really do anything for you money wise."
bad,"The store manager had no managerial experience, she would steal from the store constantly, never did any work, let food and garbage pile up in the stockroom leading to bugs, would leave for hours while still clocked in, would talk badly of all the associates to each other behind their backs. Regional managers and higher ups seemed to not care about the store or employees. The list still goes on..."
bad,Don't even bother company is a joke and falling to pieces. Making barely nothing as a store manager is a joke. They pay you $2 more than the associates & than they expect the whole world & universe from you which isn't fair. No outside life so throw that out the window. Honestly will never think of working for this company ever again. Please just don't bother pay raise is a joke.
bad,"This store is being poorly run. The manager has a bad temper. And does not care about her employees. She speaks to them like children. When she gets mad, she cuts your hours. If you don’t come in on your day off, you’re “unreliable”. If she doesn’t like you, she will come up with ways to get you fired. She doesn’t take enough time to train her employees and gets mad when they don’t know what they are doing. Do not work here."
bad,"I worked for this company for 7 months and because i told the AM about her treatment to staff i was suspended then fired, with no real reason, company sucks there is no real room for growth, plus about 85% of their products are trash!"
bad,The manager is rude. She takes her anger out on her employees. I’ve gotten into arguments with her one too many times over bs. She only truly cares about making the store goals not her employees
bad,"Honestly save your time. The only good thing about working for this company is the fact you are decently paid and reicieve gratis every month. Other than that it is a terrible company. Save your time, apply elsewhere."
bad,Liers back stabbers 15 years with the company never a corrective action and never a customer complaint on me workered 22 days on a row open to close with no staff she was trying to get me to quit but i would not so she collaborated some letters all lies and dismissed me
bad,They condone mistreatment from other employees. The lead picker and floor radio operators are allowed to talk to people like they are dirt. I worked on the top level of the pick mod with temperatures reaching 90+ degrees and wouldn't fix the fan in my section. This is the worst company that I have ever worked for.
bad,"Very unprofessional from district leader,to manager ,assistant."
bad,I’ve been in the industry of sales and beauty for quite sometime. The previous times I visited Sally’s I could tell it was going downhill. The managers have NO idea what they are doing and expect you to learn all the system on your own. The district manager and managers have no idea what they are doing. If you raise an eyebrow on something they are doing wrong they get instantly defensive. I didn’t realize older women could act like high schoolers but the pay and drama was not worth it.
bad,Easy place to work in but the management is not good at communicating with its employees. Too much micromanaging.
bad,This job wasn't anything as I expected. The management is so bad. They literally hire ANYONE for management. This company is completely backwards. They are so unfair with pay. They tell you so many amazing things when you begin the job training but you soon find out it is all lies. This company literally is horrible and they do not care for their employees. I've learned from this job that nothing you do is ever appreciated. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.
bad,I’ll never recommend this place to anybody. Worst job ever. Poor management and not enough hour given weekly. The biggest issue was lack of communication.
bad,"treats workers very poorly, but very cool to learn about hair color and makeup products, sally beauty as a company teaches girls about hair products,,"
bad,"We got a new district mgr. she was very discriminating toward me and my disabilities, another manager of 15+ years let go, for not greeting right!WOW!"
bad,"Sally's is a great place to work, corporate office changes on a day to day bases, however if the managers pull together to reach goals for the district it could be a better place."
bad,"Horrible management, not enough pay for what you're expected to do, hours are horribly inconsistent and after over a year of working full time hours they claimed I was never given full time status so I have to drop down in my hours. In more recent times the quality of product an policy knowledge has decreased immensely. Given all the corporate changes in a very short amount of time, this company is failing and will take you down with it."
bad,"Sally is a cheap company that wants you to give your all. We had an employee stealing but the DM liked her so she got promoted to Manager. If your white dont apply at Rocky Mount,NC store."
bad,"Over these past few months they have been paying me under the amount per hour they told me I would recieve when I was hired. I've brought this up to my district manager for months, to the problem still not being fixed.My district manager has literally avoided my phone calls, emails, and texts for months."
bad,"Was fun for the first week, started going downhill due to all girls working there. Always had something bad to say about you, and talked bad behind your Val but acted like they like you to your face. Blamed for things I didn’t do such as “greet customers”...... but I DID. Terrible place to work, very disorganized and makes you dread going!!"
bad,"Siempre hay favoritismos por parte de las gerentes y distritales. "
bad,"During my time what the company I've seen 2 loyal employees fired or forced to leave. The individual had been with the company 12+ years. Sally had no interest in the employees after they ""began to make too much money"". I was told to write one of them up until they were fired. And the other had here Assistant manager position taken away with no warning and went from 40hrs to 20hrs a week. No more benefits. I also saw a young lady fired for being at the hospital with her infant child with no warning."
bad,One of the worst job experiences I’ve ever had. Don’t work here unless you like being paid peanuts and enjoy poor management. Overheard Regional management say to District management that he knew we were being paid peanuts. This is a 4 billion a year company that could care less about its employees.  Our store alone went through 3 store managers in a 4 month time period because they all hated it there too. Their idea of an ‘awesome’ pay raise was literally 10 cents and I was doing more work than the management and knew more about correct product usage than any of the other team members. Ridiculous.
bad,"This company is by far thee worst company I have ever worked for, I don’t have enough time to even explain everything wrong with this company and how they treat their employees"
bad,Poor management. Unprofessional . Rude. Not worth the headache !!!  Other stores might be better but the management at the Nampa location is the worst manager I have ever met !!!
bad,Management sucks. Corporate doesn’t care about you. Honestly if you are really desperate to get job then come here but please don’t stay long. This place is horrible and they only care about themselves.
bad,This is the wort company to work for!!! They do not care about employees. They expect for you to do all these different things for such a bad pay! Managers have their favorites and unless you’re one of them don’t expect to get anything over 20 hours in a week. Too much drama for such a small store I advise people to stay away from this store. Unless you want to get over worked and looked down on for only $10 an hour then go ahead. I’m glad I quit that job
bad,"As an employee you will be treated as a performing seal to make your customer buy no less than four items. If you do not you will be written up. All must report daily to DM , 5 times a day how much they sold to each customer . They pressure you to sell their cheap made garbage , or else."
bad,"The biggest joke about this place is that I actually enjoyed my job - helping customers get the right information about their hair (something i'm very knowledgeable about) "
bad,"The upper management is horrible. SHE sets unrealistic expectations, blames employees for literally everything, when a store is doing badly SHE does absolutely nothing to help, just gives more attitude to employees. SHE is the worst part of this job, SHE is the reason everyone quits their job here."
bad,"Benefits that were guaranteed to employees when they were hired were not followed through with. Simple things like requesting off for one day soon turned into a battle with a petty, racist manager who doesn't respect her employees opinions and ideas. Many of us find ourselves overworked when there are 10-15 customers in the store yet only one employee. We tend to work by ourselves for 3-4 hours on busy days like Fridays and weekends. The job itself at first was fine but now we find ourselves with a manger who can't even find the time of day to get back to us when we are in need."
bad,Working here was not hard at all everything was real easy once you got your flow going HOWEVER  management was a joke they hire any and everyone regardless if they have any background knowledge on hair or makeup they just hire so they don’t have to cover when shortstaffed managers take up hours of company time going to different stores to gossip about employees while leaving 1 employee to care for the entire store alone sometimes for more than 2 hours at a time they also treat shoplifters way better than employees even after store managers witness customers with their own eyes run out of the store with baskets full of merchandise if your looking for a company that allows you to grow and move up I highly suggest looking elsewhere there’s no room for advancement here they don’t value employees at all I was employed here for over a year and I never once got my raises on time they were always given to me 6 months after my reviews
bad,"I recently just quit this job. I worked here for 3 months and couldn’t handle it anymore. I was supposed to be a part-time employee, but was always working overtime. I was never able to get my 15 minute breaks due to always being busy. I would be on my feet for 10+ hours a day, and would constantly be in pain or exhausted. A lot of gossip and drama would happen, as all of the employees were young girls, including me. People would bring their personal life to the workplace, and constant gossiping was happening. Management was awful, as my manager would always ask about my personal life, ask me why I had doctors appointments, why was I seeing a psychologist, and if I was feeling bad because of my mental health, she would tell me I had absolutely nothing to be upset about. The girls would complain constantly about working here and would constantly bring each other down. I’d ask for a day off and my manager would make a big deal about it. If i needed to switch a shift with someone everyone would always be too busy, but I would always have to take someone else’s shift. My manager would sign my schedule off for me and change my shifts without telling me as well. Lots of toxic competition would happen and favouritism towards the DM and manager. All in all this was a horrible place to work at."
bad,"For the nine months I worked there. We had 2 different store managers and 3 different district managers and as of right now there is no in store manager. The turn over rate is horrible. There is no trust between the managers and employees. The hire up is unknowledgeable, catty, petty, unprofessional and would have you do a list of tasks that had little or NOTHING to do with customer service and would actually take away from the focus in the store. The management has little experience and the training is minimum at most. The computer system was old and out of date. The coupons never worked properly, the sales were at random. They are always hiring and firing. They were always rearranging in the store and pushing you to sell the worst products. ZERO job security."
bad,"Working here honestly sucked the life out of me, its unorganized and policies change all the time. Management is all over the place and always changing. You are only a number in the system to this company, if your numbers aren't good enough they will treat you like nothing. I felt unsafe and stressed everyday. I loved working with customers and helping them, but the company just honestly ruined it for me."
bad,The company does not care about their employees. They work you to the bone and will throw you to the curb the next day. You don’t get any bonuses your don’t get recognition. They will over work you and expect you to do everything for them. It’s a click at most stores. A lot of gossip between managers about employees. No one will vogue for you if you are ever contacted by management. They take weeks to answer questions. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS JOB TO ANYONE.
bad,"No pay raises. Long and HOT hours! You never know when you're going home, and management is horrible. Short breaks. They don't treat they're workers with respect."
bad,"I am a licensed cosmetologist and my manager at the time was not. She was giving advice that could have gotten the store into a lot of trouble, not to mention she was a full on racist towards her employees and customers."
bad,"Went from caring about its managers , core of company went too corporate and far away from what it used to be. All the management above all gone and the last three years went downhill at least to the store levels point of view. Its a job mostly for college students to work until they can get a better paying job not a job for anyone who has a life outside of them. To many stress issues for the low pay."
bad,"I worked here for 2 years, at first it was a great place to work then things started changing. They got new management and they only care about money they do not care about the customers or employees. Not enough hours whatsoever. I would never recommend this job to anyone."
bad,not a safe environment no cameras in store I got robbed and a police subdivision is in the same the s hopping plaza.Not enough pay. long long hours...
bad,"Staff on the work floor were fun. Management seemed to not care if employees advanced or not."
bad,"I found a great satisfaction working for Sallys the boy was okay hours were okay but the drama was awful, pay wasn’t fair my raise was late I was let go due to a despute with a corporate manager that has anger issues don’t recommend Sallys to anybody"
bad,"I have been a part time employee for 1 year."
bad,"Awful!! "
bad,"Very unprofessional place to work, corporate is very shady and will try to find a reason to fire you or have you written up, hours are very inconsistent, i was supposed to get a raise at 6 months and never got it after working there for a year, it’s like being in high school all over with the drama, the pay isn’t got for the amount of work that needs to be done, I would never work for this company AGAIN !"
bad,They have horrible management at the facility now. Terrible place to work. I  would not work there ever again. You are under paid and overworked. I am glad I left there.
bad,"Since working at sallys i've experienced human rights violations, had my manager go against employee standards, had my manager try to constructively dismiss me on multiple occasions, was written up or given a ""corrective"" for being hospitalized due to illness."
bad,"Do not advise to work for, they hide opportunities for hard working employees, and let other employees slack off and do illegal things while on shift at work. Alot of favortism, Especially bullying, and discrimination, whether or not this is a racist thing is another worry, but it all felt that way, coming from Managers and coworkers! They are not honest, Fair and will lie to you about positions, well, where I was located. Only use you for the sales, not dedicated to the employee."
bad,The new director and assistant director are rude disrespectful and unprofessional. With actions of racism and womanizing in which a lot of long time workers are looking for other employment
bad,"They promote higher positions outsiders, took benefits away to give us 10 dollars an hour, they also cut our hours, they pushed out long-term employees, they don't train properly, they lie about everything such as benefits, hours, evaluations, they play favoritism, people making changes are undertrained and inexperienced, weekdays one person closes alone even in hot areas, etc, etc, etc."
bad,They expect way too much out of these young girls. management is terrible and they truly dont do much of anything against racist/bigoted/violent workers. I wsa actually harassed and stalked by a previous worker here and the company did nothing about it.
bad,"Working at Sally's was great at first, and then new upper management came in. "
bad,"Mississauga districts "
bad,This company is for itself. The management here is very poor. They do not know how to interact with their employees. The disrespect is at an all-time high. This is not a place I would recommend.
bad,"Dishonest and unprofessional management. Takes hours from employees in system, disrespectful, late to work constantly and has had/gives zero training."
bad,"Sally will struggle in the future to compete on line. They are another Blockbuster company who just recently started selling on line. Sally's price points are being undercut by Amazon and other on line retailers. "
bad,"Customers were awesome, Sallys is focused on rebranding and don't care what employees have to say. Never offered proper training and they  are biast towards certain people"
bad,"Over the past year this company has slowly eat the soul of anyone who was long term employee. Not only has the company got rid of the DM's who help build this company in Canada, they pushed out the RD who was amazing to work for. Now we have a bunch of Bullies in place. No mangers in half the stores. We can't hire full time workers . we have to close our stores by ourselves due to reduced hours. "
bad,"Working for Sally’s is basically like being in high school. I’ve worked in all female workplaces but never anything like Sally’s. Truth is this goes as far as the management and higher ups. If you called in sick for a shift, you would spend your next one being ignored by staff as punishment. "
bad,"nonsupport no help, manager rude and disrespectful management isn't godwit communication .issues with shipment and theft is high . products aren't good"
bad,"Management Sucks. Only cares about themselves. Verbally abusive, Fired me for my son being sick even though I had a valid excuse and a dr's note. Threatened me, verbally abusive, talked about you behind your back, lies, favoritism, never allowed to use PAID VACATION that I WORKED FOR or Sick days.. forget about being sick... unpaid time off, forget about that as well..... all just a few things I experienced while worked at Sallys in Westminster, CA."
bad,The workers need more training as well as the management team. There needs to be stricter policies about enforcing codes of conduct.  Favoritism is unprofessional and has no business in the work place.
bad,"The job was fun and not difficult but thr manager was awful. She is rude, unthoughtful, highjacks your sales and then puniahes you for not meeting numbers."
bad,"Don’t EVER work for the Sally’s Beauty in San Antonio, TX!!! Horrible District Manager and even worst Regional Manager!!! If you enjoy being mistreated and working 50+ hours with no help or communication from your manager, then this is the place for you!"
bad,This is not a place I would recommend to anyone for a job. I was a good employee didn't miss work helped out when asked . Yet the district manager would not allow my store manager to hold my job when I had to have surgery.
bad,Hay que ser títeres con las gerentes desgraciadamente no ponen atención sobre la gente que contratan se portan muy mal con los empleados y no saben tener control sus empleadas no cumpliendo con el perfil la contratan nomás porque sí porque les hace falta personal  rapido desagradable ponga más atención y vayan y vean sus tiendas sucias mal acomodadas y personal prepotente
bad,"This place is full of women(&men)  who keep up drama in and out of the store.  Not worth the headache! They lie on everyone who do not agree,  follow etc. their opinions. They will make up lies (mostly ones about theif)  to get rid of those they just simply dont want around. They have an extremely high turn over rate.  Not only for associates but managers as well. This company will ruin your career & for some their lives.  The free products they give monthly are never anything worth the fuss. Very Small size or something you can not use on yourself. I dealt with a lot of racism from the top of the chain of command. The managers in my proximity where overly competitive,  rude and very sneaky. Please do not waste your time trying to fit in with this crowd.  It is not worth it!!!"
bad,Was supposed to be getting a job there they kept saying the DM would call me back but never did went on for weeks calling them and they kept giving me the run around and I’m a barber I have experience with all the product they sell horrible communication wouldn’t recommend this place at all and have told many barber and cosmetology professionals about this place
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for they treat the staff horriblly and they take advantage of their staff and much as they can, they have double standards, they will tell one person one thing and tell someone else another thing"
bad,Funny how I wasnt allowed to be with my family who almost passed away in the hospital...got forced to work and the real kicker is that a someone's dog passed away and they could call off. There was a lot of favoritism in my store.
bad,"Pay is min wage, treated horribly. Hours are not the best very late and get accused of many things. Manger call you phone and forgets to hang up and talks about you to fellow co workers."
bad,"The freebies every month are good. They will work with your schedule. Pay is horrible. They end up tagging a hundred things to your job responsibilities. Can be a fun working environment but with good management. The turn over rate is insane! It’s an ok job for a student. It worked out for me for a while. Had to leave due to new store manager. Doing a lot better elsewhere now, getting paid more. Know your worth!"
bad,Very biased and not organized as a whole. Scheduling was partial. Employee theft was outrageous. There is no room for advancement in the company even if you work hard.
bad,it was the same thing day in and day out. you could not go up in this company. Required to meet monthly sales quota to sell club cards that are worth 5$ otherwise written up.
bad,"The company was not very good, they were inconsistent, stacked up my hours which was not necessarily a bad thing, but it was not worth the pay. They did not provide us with the proper materials at the job such as watermark pens for counterfeit. When reaching out to a manager they never took what you had to say into consideration, nor did they acknowledge when you made a great goal in the store."
bad,DON'T DO IT! You will regret taking a job with this company. You are expected to work long hours with very little compensation. I ran my store for over a month with no training. You will get absolutely no support from your district managers!
bad,"Terrible hours. Management did not play by the rules. No raise in a year and a half. Schedule was not posted in a timely manner. Never was told what we were doing correctly, only what we were not doing correctly. Very high turnover rate"
bad,"Everything constantly changes. Rules, and ethics are out the door. It may had been good to work for when they were family owned, but, now with the new whomever running the ship, it's unethical, and  they are really irritating the associates. The store I worked at, they're unhappy, just like every. other. store."
bad,"Horrible place to work, I was there for two years and it was very stressful, poorly managed, and horrible unfair schedules. No paid sick time, drama every single day, no advancing opportunities, no raises.  My manager would cry almost every day on the sales floor about her personal life."
bad,Is a company that don't care about their employers. The people are constantly on the floor with no experience at all. The DM are never to be found due to constants trips instead of dealing with the company issues. People are on the floor with poor knowledge of hair products giving people the wrong advice. They constantly changing managers to poor decision on management positions.
bad,"The upper management has favorites, allowing people who are underqualified and/or overtly stealing to remain in management. No  care for employees personal life."
bad,"Sally's Beauty Supply is an awful environment. Special treatment by the district manger to people she liked  Others received poor, unfair treatment.  Hired employees are allowed to yell and scream and throw fits at their bosses. And are also allowed to choose who, what when and where they will work. They also allow their current employees to do drugs and shut down the store whenever desired. And make false reports and call police on customers for getting yelled at. and making false accusations on people. I do not recommend this store to anyone. Use amazon."
bad,"Store 5509: Manager takes advantage of employees when it comes to breaks, and vacation days.  Inexperienced with writing schedules that cause some employees to lose their hours. Creates gossip and conflict in the workplace.  Rude when explaining policies and sales to customers.  Takes long breaks and sits in the backroom for the rest of the shift."
bad,"This place is a joke, the mangers are not doing their jobs. Poor allocation, rude and condescending behaviour towards staff. Sally's managers are covering each other's back which is leading to poor treatment And poor hostile working environment."
bad,"corporate is extremely cut throat and expects too much from small employees, very over worked, very very under paid, and when certain outrageous sales goals are not ment hours are cut from the whole staff, highly effecting the ability to meet goals. they have serious in house problems throughout corporate and overall its just a very poorly constructed buisness and they treat there employees very unfair"
bad,"My experience was unpleasant working for Sallys unfortunately due to bullying and unfair treatment. Management were very unprofessional and this led to many problems within the workplace. It is not an ideal job for anyone who struggles with childcare, they are not flexible at all and frown upon staff with children. Rewards for good work tend to go straight to management rather than staff."
bad,DO NOT WORK HERE! The company does NOT appreciate their employees and does not protect them during robberies either! They are expected to just let it happen and if you attempt to protect yourself or the products you are fired.
bad,"Sally Beauty is not the place to work if you want to advance, make a name for yourself, or pay the bills you have accumulated. I worked there for several years, I was never appreciated, I worked when people called out, I did not get paid sick days, and I spent more time working than I did with my family. I worked full-rime until I started college. I didn’t even get a full twenty cent raise when my evaluations came around each year. They are cheap cheap cheap. I made less an hour after four years than anyone else I knew in retail. People treat you like garbage and the managers suck. It’s nothing but drama and THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. The customers are allowed to walk all over you and you are required to take it. It’s pitiful. Understand that you are just a body filling space, so they can make money. And if anything happens and you report it, you are the one that gets into trouble not the accused person. They will fabricate, cover it up, and make you the bad guy. Typical. If you’re trying to make a living, you have a better chance somewhere else. So if you’re a high schooler , then this is the place for you to learn how much better you deserve in life. Do not work here. It’s a sesspool for negativity."
bad,Very poor management and very inconsistent schedules. Manager was a hot mess and has me drive to  different Sally's to cover call-ins and low employee counts.
bad,They are not there for you they are there for the money that is it they will not help you and when you get behind they will chew you up and spit you out
bad,"Disgusting manager verbally harassed me everyday made inappropriate comments to me and other employee's about race, corporate office swept it under the rug when we complained"
bad,Management was poor. The pay was too low for the work that was being done. The ability to move up in the company is low and not a good incentive. The pecking order dynamic makes for a negative experience.
bad,"Management believed themselves to be much more powerful and important than they were. While having a strong customer service belief, the respect held for customers left employees with no respect and were often given the majority of the blame. Unless you're the manager or assistant manager, all of your hours will be closing shifts, constantly, with very few days off and unevenly spread out."
bad,"Poor management, bullied by manager and staff Into eventually quiting. Personal issues of the manager became public with the staff. Soon everyone became involved, everything was pinned into one girl and the work place environment became hostile and uncomfortable."
bad,From my experience very poor management also verify unethical things that go on within the company can go on but will just leave it at that because honestly they don't pay enough for all that they put you through there.
bad,"The managaer is very mean and stuck in her ways. I worked three weeks straight every single day, with no days off and didnt recieve my paycheck from the company."
bad,my manager only made it so she worked every morning shift and screwed everyone else over. Plus pay sucks.  the only good thing was the discounts. very slow paced too.
bad,"terrible pay, no overtime, customers are rude, company spies on you . no benefits, they constantly accuse all employees of theft but allow managers to physically and verbally attack employees"
bad,worked here for 3 long years and sacrificed a lot for my store and got nothing in return. All of management is bad and could care less about there employees. I cant stress enough how not worth it this job is!! keep looking!
bad,"Absolutely no management support from manager, dm, hr, or so on. Everyone who is employed at Sally Beauty likes to start drama instead of work. Poor customer service with customers."
bad,"horrible place to work, would not suggest to anyone, the management was rude and I worked there for 2 years, you also cant have NO Saturdays off.  I would"
bad,"Unfair management"
bad,"low hours, low pay, hate hate hate. what a waste of waste of four yers of my life i would not reccommend this place to anyone. unhappy unsatisfied kkkk"
bad,"Does not appreciate the hard working employees they have and way too much favoritism in the whole company.  "
bad,Management was the worst! low pay. no room to move up. No security! manager would let someone steal! by far the worst job I have ever had! Customers are nasty.
bad,Very stressful not enough pay No body appreciates the staff or management . The Human Resources Mgr in corporate is a joke this woman knows nothing about the company and always sides with the District Manager
bad,A horrible environment to work in. Management sucks your job is threatened on a daily basis. If you don't make their numbers you are threatened to not have a job. The managers are stuck up like you should owe them your life. I have been with the company for two and a half years with NO moving up. The managers take advantage of you they leave you for hours by yourself and expect you to do everything. If you don't sell there discount card then they threaten you with either firing or write up. Raises are horrible  the most you get is 50 cents which is ridiculous i. You don't move up. Your just a sales person with bad pay and no commission. I would never suggest to work here. You will be treated like a slave.
bad,All staff are overworked under paid and are not treated with respect get told you have to do over time or ya won't get past your probation force you to do on error time work Saturdays and bank holidays
bad,My first ever job. Was still getting the hang of working. Boss was horrible. Yelled at you instead of teaching. Besides that was actually not a bad company as a whole to work for.
bad,"Nothing bad or good to say, This was not a good experience for me and phone sales seems like its a overseas kinda thing now.The people I met seemed nice, But it did not seem like a great goal oriented place. It lacks in service and did not feel good coming home is all."
bad,I was there a long time ago and the work flow was nice.  It was a seasonal employment while I was in college.  Management was good and I enjoy working there.
bad,"Upper management doesn't care about anything, no help is given when needed but they expect you to slave for them for less than desirable wages. Constantly cleaning up after children, drama in the workplace, they expect you to push sales on people who don't want to be pushed. I've been with the company for 4 years now and I've only seen ONE raise of .25 cents. Overworked and underappreciated, I would NOT recommend working here."
bad,"this is not a good job i only got it for a second job. the company didnt send me my last few things i was supposed to get while working there. for example i was supposed to get a $50 gift card, i never got it and i also won a scratch ticket and i picked a $10 starbucks gift card, never got it."
bad,"Worked for this company for some time, they treat you horribly and have no concern for any of their employees. Didn't experience even one well managed store. Poorly run and I personally witnessed many unethical decisions throughout my time there."
bad,"Sales part of the job was wonderful. I learned quite a bit and loved working with the public. I hated coming to work Simply because of prejudice coworkers. Do yourself a favor, apply elsewhere."
bad,I don't want to bash sallys but i do not recomend working for them. I basically was bullied out of my job because i sold a bottle of shampoo that my manager put in the back. Sally's was o no help.
bad,"Worst place I ever worked! At first everyone seemed friendly but then it turned to a nightmare. Horrible management horrible pay and hours. They don't care about you or customers and are understaffed. They have employees giving hair advice that have no prior experience.  This is for all of Calgary, my advice..RUN!!"
bad,"Rude people, rude manger and everything. Old systems, bad hours and if you have surgery you will still have to work and if you dont you will be fired and if you book days off a month in advance or more for a funeral you probably wont get it off."
bad,"Worked minimum wage while working my butt off and doing everything the manager was doing, first raise only after 6 months IF you pass their review. VERY poor management. I used my Sally points from selling products to purchase a gift card, and then left the company a week or so later and I am now being refused the $50 gift card, even though I rightfully purchased it. Company does not care about its employees. Rude, passive aggressive management. I was not happy while working there at all."
bad,"At first it was great to work there due to the fact my manager was so nice and always appreciated everything, but she left and company hired a new person who doesn't know how to do her own job but critics everyone else. Honestly worst place ever to work at. She also created a lot of drama by far the most unprofessional place I've ever worked at."
bad,"Pay is terrible, security is terrible, upper management horrendous. No way would I recommend Sally Beauty to anyone I liked."
bad,5 thumbs down... for instance it was my first job. I acquired no training and the management was something to be undesirable. Then that minimal management left and the coming management was degrading and disrespectful to the new employees. I dont even shop there anymore. Used to be my favorite place to shop. It was probably that particular store. But it is what it is.
bad,"Absolutely awful district manager. Save yourself the hassle and don't apply. The job itself and the customers are great but the upper management is a disaster! Low wage and unrealistic expectations for so little money: A lot of useless people with poor customer/people skills. If you live in Calgary or surrounding area, there is a better job out there!"
bad,Never work here. It had horrible management and got robbed a lot for the razors . It was very unorganized they let anybody touch the money and the manager was hardly around.
bad,"Everybody stocks, does cashier. Also if you have a car its mandatory that you do the bank deposit. And you have to know your hair products if you don't their is no point of working their."
bad,Horrible company horrible management not understanding doesn't let you go if there's a family emergency! They said they are flexible with school hours which is FALSE! Cacaroaches in the break room
bad,"This whole paragraph is a lie.  No chance in advancement, probably one of the most boring jobs on earth. Pay is horrible, 8.50,   Hours suck 23( if your lucky).  You cannot support a family with this job!"
bad,Research Research Research the company that you are applying to and considering.  Management doesn't communicate needs or goals.  Systems are 20 year behind other companies.
bad,"poor work place, terrible management, manager harassment "
bad,"They work you like a dog and bleed you dry then try to pump more blood out of you"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for them, it's a large chain they don't care about their employees just their bottom dollar."
bad,"SALLY'S has horrible management in Meridian Ms. From store manager all the way up,Especially the district manager!!  RUN!!!"
bad,"Very unorganised, overworked and underpaid. Their systems are very old and impractical. Very cheap, they will do anything to save a dime but it end up costing them more in the long run. Lie about raises just to get you in the door, then when asked about it postpone it till the bitter end. Say that you'll be part time, then work you full time hours just to prevent you from getting benefits. Nothig scans properly, especially on sale items (watch your receipt ladys and gents) I wouldn't recomend working there or even shopping there."
bad,"La oferta de trabajo en la OCC dice $6,500 de salario y cuando vas a la entrevista te dicen que a ese salario le sumes bonos, prestaciones, vales de despensa y ayuda de transporte diaria. En la primer semana no tienes tu día de descanso para que disque la nómina te salga completa, pagan cada viernes, pero oh sorpresa esa semana SOLO te pagan 3 días SIN la ayuda de transporte de $60, tienes $605 la primer semana, en la siguiente semana te debe de salir tu nómina ""completa"" me salieron $1000, mi ayuda de transporte no me la pagaron por alguna razón extraña que nunca explicaron y casualmente me enteré por una compañera que le verdadero sueldo es de $4,800 al mes, con $200 de vales de despensa al mes, que puedes empezar a utilizar solo cuando ya lleves 3 meses trabajando. Te contratan con demasiadas mentiras, tienes que ir a cubrir a otras tiendas que no importa si están del otro lado de la ciudad, no te quieren dar tu renuncia por que les hace falta personal, no te dejan sentarte mientras trabajas, tienes una hora de comida, trabajas mas de 9 horas al día, lo que se roben lo pagas, lo que falte en la caja lo pagas, en tu finiquito te descuentan cosas que inventan, en fin, la peor experiencia de trabajo, abusan de todas las chavas que tienen una necesidad económica muy muy grande"
bad,Manager was lazy and took credit for everything employees did. Very hateful toward her employees. Employees do all the work while the manager gets the free trips. Manager forged signatures and initialed documents for employees without knowledge at the time.
bad,"The management played favorites constantly. They over worked us and under paid us. They were very hypocritical. It was definitely nice to receive the free gratis, but even then there were times that we didn't receive our gratis that the companies told them to give to us."
bad,I typically got to work before my store manager. It was a very unorganized workplace. I taught myself everything and was asked to take my store managers place within only two weeks of working there.
bad,"I worked my butt off for an entire year and all they did was treat me like dirt, you get free product, MAYBE. the manager started hiding the free product from the sale's associates to keep to herself! it was the worst place I ever worked."
bad,"Stock shelves, attend to every customer, help customers with beauty products, answer phones and assist customers, scan products and bag products, price changes"
bad,"Employees are not appreciated. "
bad,"Poor. Management is unfair, no structure no advancement. Minimum wage and no benefits. You're not realized for all your hard work."
bad,"clocked in, boss started to complain about some new problem in her life, then left leaving me and one other person there all day."
bad,"I was a great customer service job experience. I learned a huge about stock, inventory, and banking. Taking the time to assist customers played a huge role in my position."
bad,"Upper management is horrible and when you report them to the employee concern line, you get treated even more horrible. I was discriminated against. My last dm was the worst and the tm was on his side. Both of them can go to h e LL. I would never recommend this place to anyone unless its out of Florida.... I felt bad for all the managers of district 332 felt I walked out and said screw this seven years..."
bad,"Although I wouldn't go back, I truly enjoyed the work atmosphere which made things real easy and laid back. It's just not an ideal job for men."
bad,"This place lacked appropriate compensation for amount of work responsible for. Advancement is extremely conditional and hard to attain. Work environment is hostile, with no Management support.  Micromanagement and no security when making complaints of work place abuse, and harassment."
bad,worst job i ever had i work long hour i open and close the store for little pay and a 10 cent pay raise
bad,If you like being over worked and under payed then by all means apply. Worst job I have ever had!
bad,"Pleasant day at work"
bad,"Not the best place to work, but may work for someone attending school"
bad,"A typical day at work included sitting in a cubicle with loud neighbors who got upset if you were talking at all and would tell on you.  Management is very nit picky and opportunity for advancement is rare.  People were not friendly and made this job miserable to work at.  I should have known you weren't going to meet welcoming people at a corporate office.  BTW, the raises they give are less than walmart's.  I got paid 10 dollars/hr for a job that pays 30k anywhere else and they took into account my degree and experience and offered 10/hr"
bad,Hours and pay are horrible . Manager was rude to employees and customers
bad,at sally's the people were nice but you don't get the pay you deserve for all the work you do
bad,"Hated working here. Mainly because of management. Ike the fact boss was very rude, and she made working there very hard. She did not like the fact that I was going to school. She did not want to work around my school schedule"
bad,Little to no opportunities for advancement. Company prefers outside hire
bad,"I worked in the help desk deptartment for more than one year. The management is inexperienced in handling employees and use favoritism. A typical day of work is receiving calls from clerks at Sally stores and helping them out while trying to tune out the other help desk employees cursing up a storm because they are receiving a support call... The hardest part of the job was trying to tune out the profanity from the mostly inexperienced help desk employees. It was also hard for me to try and become a favorite of the management, as that is not part of my style... There was no most enjoyable part of the job, they used to let you access the internet but recently started using websense and blocking content."
bad,"I was a key holder which consisted of me opening and closing store, making deposits, preparing deposit, other duties included stocking, sales associate."
bad,Too much high-school drama
bad,"People are friendly but management/tenure employees are stuck in old business way of thinking. A billion dollar company but still running dos. Employees will have job security if they don't speak up. Compensation is none, expect to pay employees in IT department very low, next to minimum wage."
bad,"Clock in and have a group employee meeting. Report to work area and make boxes to pack out the store orders in. Scan ticket to pull product for each store order and label the box with the store number. Place on conveyor belt and let it go. Do this for about 4 or 5 waves a day. Clean zone, put any needed product back in its pick location and make boxes for next shift."
bad,"A typical day at work would start by clocking in. Then i would head to the manager and ask her what are my task for the day. After i get my job duties I would either get everything ready to do what i was asked or go to the register or stay on the floor and help customers. My coworkers were all very nice people although some didnt have too much work ethics therefore i was stuck with doing most of the work. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with the manager who expected too much from me, considering i was only a sales associate I was expected to take on managerial task and so forth."
bad,A typical day of work was always the same come in stock empty shelves or spots face and front ring up customers and up sell. I didn't learn anything. I was suppose to be trained for assistant manager and the store manager always had an excuse to not train me. The hardest part of the job was going there everyday to be bored. The most enjoyable part of the job..... There were none
bad,not the best management. enjoyed working there great employees and customers.
bad,Ethical vs morals value are in question with this company. Neither applies to Sally is important. Honesty has no value with this company. My Honest moral value is why I was wrongfully terminated. Anything I know that was my mistake i will fix no matter what it cost and i will try to make it right that is everything that you do in life. Management was lifeless with no high sprited values and because of that your employee turnover was to high due to management selfishness when i was working 11 people had left in one year thats terrible. No employee that walks in the door has a chance to move up and learn more information about the company and how it works. This comapny believes more about quantity than quality of its merchandise and people are comfortable with familiar faces and not changing faces.
bad,"Terrible company to work for. You put your entirety into them, for nothing. Not a thank you, not a raise, not a promotion. Extremely disrespectful to the employees. Better management would have made this job an amazing career, instead management left me with a bad taste and a promise to myself I will never return."
bad,"i would never recommend working for sallys at this location. management is horrible and it is filled with petty drama. Unnecessary pressure to meet sales goals with no incentives, and horrible management"
bad,"The in store management varies. I work in a great store with a great manager. Above that is different. Hard work goes unrewarded, but favoritism and sleeping your way up is totally a thing. "
bad,"Very poor  place to work. Very little change for advancement opportunities - and if there were opportunities, they were very selective. It has become a toxic atmosphere - since 300 employees (including myself) were RIFFED in April 2018. It now is a graduate college - get a years experience - then move onto  DFW area -where the salaries are more competitive."
bad,"After holding the job for over 1.5 years I was terminated for bein late due to a situation where my life was threatened thus causing me to be late for my shift. "
bad,The company doesnt care about its little people. Most of the apps are full of glitches. The company tries to shove 10 yeara of technology down your throat but even the tills are decades old. The companies ONLY focus is sales. Staff who've been there for 3 years still making  minimum wage...
bad,Not worth the stress or headache. Management is aloof and not tuned in the day to day happenings in the stores. The compensation is not competitive. Turnover is high which means your stuck working no show shifts. Would never recommend to a friend.
bad,"You really don't get paid enough for the work required from you. Management is extremely ridiculous with their expectations. They expect you to care about the numbers &how well the share holders are doing,If paid by commission, one would care more. This corporation can afford to pay a living wage but doesn't. The current manager in the Niagara falls, ont store is the worst!"
bad,"This job is okay if your current going to school, it is not a great job to stay at forever. Depends on the coworkers there will be drama, too much theft by customers not enough safety for your well being. I worked here a year prior to coming back for another year to be assistant manger and the first time I left was because of management, the second time around there was no balance for life with my kids and too much work and being over worked is not okay"
bad,Managers are always overworked and required to work overtime. Impossible to hire and keep store associates when regional and district managers force them to move to other stores. No care for the safety of the managers or employees.
bad,"manager picked favourites, employee harassment at windermere location, CEO does not believe your complaints as the store does not have cameras and manager was never around."
bad,"As Store manager of 4 years this has been the worst most stressful and discouraging place to work ever.Poor leadership starts with corporate.Regional Director doesn't know how to talk to people;that's customers and employees.The District Manager is low key racist and has been under investigation before regarding this matter which speaks volumes about the overall company seeing that it's swept under the rug and he's still in his position.He disrespectfully addressed me as a slave driver to ome of my associates,in front of a customer.He talks about employees to other employees as if we don't all communicate with one another and threatens you with his authority when his actions are questioned.He shows favortism amongst stores and only advances those on the favorites list.The company is always changing so when employees have questions the DM never knows anything and talks to you like your stupid with sarcasm.There are always issues with paychecks.Coupons never work so we as employees have to deal with angry customers because of corporate errors.This company only cares about their profit and not the employees even if you have a license or degree bringing forth the knowledge required to boost sales they way i did which made me a top performer in my district but no credit was ever received.The DM only seems to care when it makes him look good on paper to corporate and when he is receiving a bonus on you store making monthly quota;The managers receive bonus too but part time associates get nothing which pushes them to quit.They don't advertise and promote ethnic or multicultural hair"
bad,1 out of 5 stars would not recommend.  The management at the location where I worked was not fair. Favoritism flourishes and gossip within management to employees.
bad,You need to be part of the top management circle to be able to be promoted. Only part time positions and if you are sick you only get pay if there’s enough hours for the store that doesn’t go over their weekly allowance.
bad,"They didn't want to pay me for the holiday I worked.  Management was horrible, if you had a family member  that died they don't care,  just don't work there they only cater to there own race"
bad,Sally’s is a terrible place to work. You can be the highest performer in the store and still be paid less than everyone else due to favoritism as they use the excuse that “pay is based off performance” when it really isn’t. Managers will discuss your pay with other part-timers as if that’s appropriate. Other part-timers will be paid possible 2-3 dollars more to do the same standing around you’re doing when the store isn’t busy. The environment is a very high school clique type of place. The district managers are so supportive of their managers they won’t even notice that they’re the problem. High turnover rates for your employees should signal an issue but they ignore it.
bad,"I just started working here and the district manager was manipulative with what I was supposed to expect at the workplace. She tempted me with lies and once I started working there I got bad hours, unfair pay, and I didn’t even get a break half the time. They messed up my training the moment I started working there. The products break easily and when I have gotten things from there it hasn’t even been worth the price. There is no upside to this job at all."
bad,"There is a lot of work you need to do and most of the time you have to do many things at once. They don’t care about you, only about them reaching their sales goals. They pressure you into trying to achieve unreasonable goals."
bad,"I worked for the Sally Beauty in Shawnee, KS and my manager was horrible. She only cared about herself. She always left worked early. She never did any work but sit in the back and FaceTime. She always had mental break downs and if you did anything wrong she would contact the distract manager first before you could to make it seem and as if you all the wrong doings. No enough hours were given. Too many promises being made and nothing happened. I will never ever go back or ever recommend it"
bad,Upper management doesn’t do anything and piles it all on their already stretched thin managers and employees. They will hire from the outside rather than promote from within.
bad,Worked for the company for 3 years and the last 6 months was getting harassed by the district manager who did not even know a single thing about Sally’s as she was with the company for a month.
bad,"Worked here for six months. Taught me a lot as it was my first retail job, but management is VERY sketchy. They are like a high school clique, whispering amongst themselves about others, sabotaging employee success. Huge lack of disregared for personal life, managers have a power trip. Very unfortunate, as I greatly enjoy beauty/hair but it is not worth it to stay in this TOXIC environment! Save yourself the grief."
bad,"The new DMS And regional director are horrible to work for. They have no commitment to their employees. Pretty much all staff who has been there for longer than the new management has left. So all managers are new and not trained substationally due to the fact the district managers don’t even know what they are doing! This company is a mess. They are trying to reinvent to compare to other competitors since they are clearly doing horrible in sales as a company. Expect hour cuts, poor managements, working by yourself, no full time positions even though they will say they are available , no training and underpaid. With all these cuts they have you doing everything from merchandising, hiring fixing a bathroom sink and getting in your hands and knees to clean the old stores. But I cannot stress enough the worst part of the job is the DMs. So disrespectful and arrogant, no communication skills whatsoever. This place is so unprofessional. Don’t expect help when you have a problem. I know so many managers who had complaints about this new DMs port management skills and how rude she is. It is impossible to work here There are no actions done to fix anything."
bad,Quite frankly i cannot wait to leave. This is the most toxic set of employees and coworkers i have EVER worked with. They are petty and they like to stab you in the back. There is atleast one person almost daily calling out and i cover for them every time and the one time i called out for my sister who has CANCER nobody bothered to step up or try to help me. I didnt end up going in and every employee definitely made sure i knew how they felt about me afterwards.
bad,"I was with the company as a store manager for 1 month and during that time we went through three district managers and 2 territory managers. I was given 5 days of training, not even in my home store.  I am brand new to the company. I was given the lowest performing store and told to just ""fix it"" I had 5 employees all under 6 months and with no prior training at all. This company SUCKS"
bad,Sally's worked with my schedule. Went through 3 managers in the 2 years I was there. Am not working there but still buy my products from them. Have long lasting friends that I met at Sally's
bad,Sally's Beauty Supply Is Some What of a good store to shop the only problem is that they have some stores that have people that don't know how to treat others
bad,Overworked on a daily basis - I put in 11 to 13 hours per day but it was not appreciated nor rewarded. When I would complain about the hours my boss would roll her eyes at me and tell me the job wasn't for everyone.
bad,It is like working for hitler they just don’t care about there employees or how much they depend on there jobs cutting hours and losing money it has gotten so bad last two years it was nice before and we got a new manager that lies all the time to our dm
bad,"I really enjoyed this job before new management came and took over. She is poorly dressed, picks favorites and rude to customers. Writes up less favorite employees up for petty things, leaves work an hour more early and over all does nothing while she is working."
bad,This is a very very easy job to have. It is a very mindless job. The only good thing about this job is that you learn a lot about hair care. This company micromanages to a fault.
bad,I worked at sally beauty supply for 7 months at first it was a great job manager was fantastic. When the manager transferred  my hours for cut . I was never late always on time and I worked hard but she cut my hours down to the bare minimum leaving me no choice but to quit . Sad to do this to a licences stylist with 3 kids needing this job . I don’t recommend working for the location I was at .
bad,"Asco la gerente llegaba cruda y borracha "
bad,"This is the first company that I have worked for that is so unorganized and are willing to tell us that a customer that is stealing that they can have the item that they have changed tags on for the tag on the item. As a sales associate, we can't tell customers when they ask us about a product that we haven't used that we haven't used it yet."
bad,"The people that worked in the store were great. The district manager was only concerned about sales, period. She had no regards to anyone having a life. If you had no one to work, you were working it, didn't matter how many hours you already put in."
bad,"Customers come into this location to steal constantly. Some customers use their kids to steal for them. The older employees gossip about each other to each other.  Work Scheduling is fair. No one has any respect for each other. The older employees will pull you into​ gossiping. The manager doesn't know how to properly manage the store. There should always be monthly staff meetings to tell everyone about the several sales going on. The store need a surveillance camera for the store's and employee protection. Overall, Sally's need to hire all license professionals. It makes no sense to hire regular people off the street to give hair advice to the public. It's stupid!"
bad,"Corporate is judgemental. They are never consistent. District manager gets away with all kinds of illegal stuff. The company as a whole is going down hill. There is low pay for alot of work, but I loved my job, and they did not care.  They will not fight for you."
bad,Sally's was a good experience. The management wasn't all that great. They cut hour almost every month. I did enjoy working there because I been dealing with hair for the last 10 years
bad,"Management was a joke.  The work was ok, I love beauty products and would stayed a lot longer if it wasn't for management."
bad,do not work here you should avoid it like the plague. management is ridiculous they push you to push an unnecessary amount of products on a person to buy and basically force customers to sign up for store cards. if your numbers aren't met then you get write ups and after so many you're done. hours are very inconsistent so your paycheck is very inconsistent.
bad,The district is in need of an extreme overhaul. They want people with more skills but are only willing to pay minimum wage. It is not a good company for advancement.
bad,"When I started at Sally's Beauty Supply it was a great beginning but as the months went on it was very unprofessional. The manager and staff was talking about the customers and the people they work around everyday, they let many individuals walk by with out greeting anyone. I learned never to talk down on my team members, once we work together we are a family instead of strangers. Also, take your time and grow as a unit that's how things will come together."
bad,"I have been employed at Sally's for over a year. I have worked my butt off only to be reprimanded for not  being in ""compliance"". Over and over negativity from the store manager who happens  do.exactly what he/she wants to do no matter the rules. The District Managers are another story. They are even worse. You just can't seem to do enough no matter how hard you try. Being written up for not selling enough BBC's, IOM's and warranties which anyone with any sense knows there is a factory warranty on appliances. It isn't fun working in a place where you are not appreciated, and not paid enough for all your hard work. It is absolutely ridiculous what you are promised and then what you get. I wouldn't recommend working at Sally's to anyone anywhere  that wants a calm kind nice work place. I now see why there is so much turnover. The DM should be  the ones to be reprimanded yet again they act like they want and don't have a license to do hair yet give advice. I was also surprised that really they can't even ring up customers and they ask you want to do. This is the most unproffesionalexperience I have ever had in the work place...DM who can't even run their own stores yet you seem to be the problem. I would RUN FAST and never looked back if I were giving advice on whether or not to work for this company. If any company needed an "" undercover boss"" to judge the management of a Sally's this one certainly be the one."
bad,"Easy and fun job but, you dont get many hours, and their was always a problem with the managers at the location I worked at."
bad,"In the time I was at Sally I saw many BAD employees kept and promoted while many really good employees were let go or driven to quit; simply because the did not get along with the District Manager. The Territory Manager was very good friends with the DM so complaints were not dealt with. Several great managers were accused of theft (with no proof), written up for silly offenses (leaving a penny on a filing cabinet), etc. The DM was also a very big gossiper and often talked about other employees and managers to anyone that would listen. "
bad,"I was promoted several times at Sally. I was there for thirteen years total."
bad,"Promised a lot of great things but none of the promises are kept."
bad,"before you leave because if you don’t depending on your state you won’t receive your vacation pay at all. Hopefully your manager informed you but mine didn’t. Unfortunately sally beauty was the most stressful and draining job I ever had. The pay was good but when the hours went from 29 hours to 5 hours a week to literally 0. in a matter of a month or so. They say you must sell, sell, sell  and make every sale 3 products minimum each customer. If your percentage and your $ amount are low then your told you can lose hours and even your job. I’ve worked for 2 locations and my first manager was so nice and empathetic to her employees. Higher up management said the managers had to do a ranking system from first place to last place. The last place employees had the least amount of hours per week. Yea that would make anyone extremely stressed going to work each day."
bad,"I’ve been working at Sally’s for over 4 years now and the ONLY reason I have stayed is for the benefits and the fact the girls I work with are amazing people. The benefits are really good IF you can get them (They are pretty strict about that). Getting samples are nice as well, when they aren’t stingy about them. And there you have it, the only two reasons to work at Sally’s. The company itself and upper management is a disaster. They put far too much pressure on their stores and do not give any credit to ya when credit is due. They constantly belittle and make their stores feel like garbage. They don’t care about their employees well being or their life outside of Sally’s. It is a disgusting company and I don’t wish it on anybody. Stay away from Sally’s. They don’t even train their employees and instead just throw them on the floor without a stitch of training. Just do yourself a favor and don’t work here unless you want to constantly feel not good enough and be under appreciated and stressed because this company won’t hire the staff they need to make sure a business is running properly."
bad,"Pay is terrible with the work they have you do. You get very little training, all they care about are sales and numbers and not employees! They will work you like a dog for little pay and will not give you more than 25 -30 hours a week because they DO NOT want to give benefits. Extremely unprofessional management as far as DM and up goes. Store manager is amazing! Go Walmart where they start cashiers out at $11 per hour!! where"
bad,"I opened the store, counted the register,  restocked the shelves, attended customers, memorize codes, bank deposits,  organize, filing, close the store, and close the register"
bad,I worked for this company on and off for a total of 15 years. I've always been a loyal employee. I hated working here. The customers are rude and the management is TERRIBLE. They give 9 cent raises and hire any Joe Blow off the street for management. I was fired over a dollar and fifty cents. After fifteen years of loyalty to them. That's what I got. And guess what. Another employee did exactly the same thing I did but got to keep her job. Don't waste your time here. It's awful.
bad,"The job was amazing and fantastic until they brought in a new district manager they transferred from Sally's. One of the most horrible people I've ever been ashamed to know. The territory manager district manager as well as human resources manager are terrible people. District manager discriminates against anyone she does not like or stands up to her. She has been known and witnessed discrimination against gays, against people with health conditions, and men in general. She is a narcissistic and she's supported along with her horrible Behavior by the territory manager in our district."
bad,I worked for this company 10+ years until recent DM. She was horrible made me hate the company. Gave us petty assignments that would take away from CS
bad,"While working at Sally's, I was not trained until 4 months after I had started the position of store manager. I did inform upper management that there was an internal theft issue with in the store, but it was ignored. And internal theft continue to go on during my tenure. It wasn't until I had resigned and found another job that the enquiries were taken seriously."
bad,"I started out at Sally beauty in Pittsburgh at a location where everything was well handled, sales goals were so easy to meet we ignored them, and the team was as drama free as you can get at a $10 hourly retail job. I had to move to a new area and my manager even helped me keep my job by transferring my location. "
bad,"When I was first hired on it was amazing and my manager was great, but because of how they treated her she stepped down. We had to ask him integers while I was there they did not care about our store and had absolutely horrible communication nor did they care about us as workers."
bad,Its a good job if you go to school but management is HORRIBLE. if they were to work on upper management and give the promised hours or desired hours it would be the perfect job.
bad,La distrital es muy mala con su personal las amenace a cada rato de cortarlas por si no venden se supone que Sally es una marac que sin necesidad de buscar ala clientes ellos vienen y casi casi tengo que estar en la puerta rogando al cliente que entre a comprar yo era de nuevo ingreso y ya me exigía como las de tiempo se supone que tienes que vender unos combos si no los venden la distrital anda pegada a su computadora haber que hace cómo si fueras una ratera
bad,"They don’t care about their employees safety your just a number to upper management , not enough hours to staff the stores and no upper management support. Especially the District Managers on a power trip."
bad,"Mucho rollo para contratar, un horario demasiado absorbente, no te da tiempo de tener vida personal, las empleadas no están capacitadas, exigen mucho y no te preparan para poder brindar una buena atención al cliente, te controlan hasta las veces que vas al baño, en pocas palabras, buscan robots no personas."
bad,Sally Beauty started out as a great company to work for. Unfortunately it turned out towards the end of my employment to be a very stress filled environment. The amount of work expected was overwhelming mainly because of their ever changing polices and lack of help when staff was unavailable. They did not pay well for the amount of work expected.
bad,"Just stay away.  If your mental health is something you value just stay away.  There is a lack of understanding and compassion from senior leadership. "
bad,"Lots expected of you for such little pay. Management and upper management is rude, uncaring, unprofessional. I, as well as other employees, enjoyed the job, had happier customers, and store ran much more smoothly when we had no manager, or assistant manager for months."
bad,"The employee who sells products sallys is promoting at that time will earn points to redeem online, and the online choices range from Coach purses to Ray Ban sunglasses. Knowledge of hair chemicals is needed for customers who want to do a service on there self and need to be taught what products to buy and the potential risk using chemicals if done wrong."
bad,I worked there almost ten years and left with not even getting paid 9 dollars an hr. There quotas are impossible..they will fire you if you dont sell there beauty club cards that hardly have any discount. You get paid vacation but can hardly take any time off. The only good thing i got out of that company was free products that they gave you. They do give you benefits but they are so expensive that working on 8 dollars an hr wont be enough to pay it. The job is stressful the managers are the ones that get the bonuses when the employees are the ones pushing the sales. One time we went weeks without air condition they didn't even care. They expect you to fix the computers when they break down instead of sending a tech who actually knows what they're doing. They are the cheapest company ever. They try and find anywhere to save a buck.
bad,"This company does not offer any full time positions, no benefits, & no room for advancement. Each store in my district was allotted 73 hours of which the manager worked 45 of them. This may work for a kid or a bored retiree, but not for someone with real bills to pay."
bad,"Hace falta muchísimo seguimiento de parte de RH porque las Gerentes distritales y regionales llevan las tiendas de la peor forma, se encargan de cansar al personal hasta que renuncien para no pagarles conforme la ley. En mi tiempo en Sally de personal que ya teníamos antigüedad 7 de 10 salimos de la empresa por malos manejos de las Regionales."
bad,I was a former employee when I first got hired it was great 6 months later we got a new manager who was all about favoritism and by that I mean she hired her family member which she was giving most of the hours to. This manager was very unprofessional in the way she approaches her employees. Not only that but it’s a very competitive place to work at considering the fact that everyone has to be at each other neck on who makes the greats average sale to keep 30 hours. If you live in California and are used to FULL TIME this is NOT the place for you. Full time is only considered 30 hours and anyone who doesn’t make the average sale gets less than 20 hours. With that being said I notice her family members would get overtime when she would infact tell me there was no such thing as extra hours. She also played with my payroll and when I confronted her about the situation she tried to act as if she didn’t know what was going on. It is a very frustrating place to work at if you want full time.
bad,"Job from H-E- double tooth picks no joke. Never appreciated, expectations way too high, if the manager didn’t like you she would make it as awkwardly obvious as possible, public humiliation, degrading, if you are expecting anything positive, we got free products every month and when the boss was super hungry she would buy us lunch. Treated most everyone like crud, even the ones she liked. Thankfully I heard she got “relocated” no clue how it is now. Oh and I didn’t get my raise until 3 years later when I quit for the last time only a dime after 3 years"
bad,"Looking for a better job, I want to feel at least safe. Managers getting into your personal life, raising their voices, sometimes even cursing and being not professional, don’t let you to take your vacation hours  when you want to take it, they always try to decide when you should take it (not fair at all) "
bad,they do not care for their employees at all. too much responsibility not enough pay. they are constantly trying to change day to day routine and are always adding more responsibility with zero compensation
bad,Manager we had dated employees and was not fair to the other employees but other than that was a good place to work and very hands on with repairs to equipment.
bad,Terrible unprofessional environment. Customers were amazing and made the job worth while. Hard work goes unnoticed. A lot of gossip. Hard to want to go into work.
bad,"*This company has potential to be a decent place to work as long as the store you are working at has a full staff, which most stores do not. *The benefits are decent in regard to accruing PTO for holiday/sick/vacation time, but actually being able to take that time is iffy."
bad,"It has been almost a year since I quit. I feel that people looking to work for this company should know, The management is horrible and the entire company is bass ackward. Save yourself the disrespect."
bad,With large work loads impossible deadlines and unbalanced staff...it was a nightmare. I've worked in customer service for almost 6 years now. I'm used to the quick paced stressful workplace. But here? Was a whole mother beast. My manager played favorites you only got requested days off or holidays if she personally liked you. One co-worker got 2 weeks off when her brother in law passed. I got asked to work the day of my grandmother's furenal. And then got written up for not comming to work due to refusing. My manager would constantly remind me that I could get fired at any moment. She was rude to customers and sucked up to the bigwigs to stay under the radar. I have never seen a place so poorly run. Both inside and as a whole company. Save yourself the stress unless you REALLY need less then 15 hours a week or unpredictably over 30 a week. Don't. Just Don't. The discounts aren't worth it.
bad,If you are a high school student who needs a summer job after you graduate this is the one for you. If you are looking for a good worthy full time job this is not for you.
bad,"Sally's is hurting right now and they made major changes in upper management , which caused a effect of reduction in force. I was one of the highest paid manager , I  moved from Cali to here as they asked  and was there Number one in the district our area."
bad,"They don’t give u a chance to grow , only care about who’s covering a shift at the moment , pay is not fare , they want u to do too much and offers outsiders more than long time employees, too many people Quit ..,, cuz SALLYS BEAUTY is Full of it !!!"
bad,"honestly save yourself the hassle,"
bad,They would expect us to work 50 to 60 hours a week but then get mad at us because we were working so much. They would not provide us with the proper staff to keep the store staffed so we would have to compensate the shortage of staff as a store manager. They also were very one sided if it did not work out in the upper management's benefit they would not care about the lower management's benefit
bad,Managers need actual management training on how to communicate with employees. They will tell you one thing when you’re hired on and then change the rule a week later. I don’t suggest working here.
bad,"I did love my job working at sallys but once i realized how much the employees are doing; not worth minimum wage."
bad,"If you love being overworked,  underpaid and not having security for a store that has been held up at gun point multiple times and they never add cameras. Work here.  Their associates do not come first. Associates and managers on drugs. DM would pop pills in front of me."
bad,Manager calls out but cuts your hours if u do. Pits employees against each other. Falsifies her own hours. Both regional and district managers do nothing about it. Employee complaints are NOT confidential abd there is retaliation. Ive been a retail manager for bigger companies and this is the worst run company ive EVER worked for.
bad,"This company is terrible!!  They randomly hire people. My co workers  don't know what it means to be friendly or nice (to fellow employees.) When there was nothing to do, I tried to do a simple task (markdowns), the person who usually does them was angry because someone did her job!! I have never seen this much foolishness in a retail atmosphere. I've applied for another job. Hopefully, I'll get it."
bad,This company DOES NOT pay for anything and management sucks! All they care about is pushing to get customers in the store. They do not treat there employees like they should be treated. I would NOT recommend this company to anyone. If you ever think about calling corporate offices about a situation be prepared for them to just ignore what you told them for them to listen to the District Manager. This company is just a bunch of lies! The ONLY good thing about this company is the great returning customers who see how hard you work.
bad,"great place to work only with right team members and right management. Easy job, unless you have the wrong people managing. i loved the store in oregon."
bad,Do not care for working there would not recommend. I had to leave due to disrespectful management.  The best thing about the job was the customers. Other than that it is was s horrible place to work
bad,This company is not in touch with how employees are treated by District Managers in certain locations.  Employees are treated unfairly and make working for this company unpleasant. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company.  Licensed Cosmetologist barely make above minimum wage.
bad,"Work environment is not stable, management needs improvement. Breaks are not a priority to management. Coverage always shifts since so many people quit on the spot."
bad,Sally beauty to the eye is a very nice place to work. Customers are usually very pleasant and it's great to work there if you have a passion for beauty. Though behind the scenes there is a lot of turnover and the managers don't really do their job like they should.
bad,"Sally Beauty is not a great place to work. They don't schedule employees the right amount of hours. You bearly get paid over time hours if you work overtime. Customers are very rude some tend to play the race card. They also tend to not hire people because they aren't ""visually appealing"". In my opinion anyone could work there no matter how they look, as long as they know the product and could sale then it shouldn't matter. The lunch breaks at some stores are only thirty minutes."
bad,"I worked for Sally's less than a week.  The schedule was off and I missed a shift and the manager literally wrote me off the schedule for a week while she was on vacation so that I could have more training.  The first bit of training consisted of how to run the register-thankfully I had run one before.  "
bad,"I worked very hard for this company and they let the customers come in and treat you horrible! The pay is so ridiculous and they care NOTHING for their employees. They only care about numbers. They let some employees blatantly steal from the store and NOT fire them, but then others they let go in a heart beat. Stay far away from this back stabbing company that doesn't care about ""most"" of their employees."
bad,"I was employed there for almost a year and since day one it was nothing but drama. Zero room for advancement and the management was TERRIBLE. They don't care about their employees at all. Working there wasn't worth it, everyday throughout your whole shift you won't stop thinking about quitting."
bad,"terrele small work  space less than minamum wage pay  dirty environment rude work staff "
bad,way to much turn over!  Can not compete with pay around the area.  HR is very inconsistent.  Has changed hands in upper management all the way to corporate.
bad,"The management was horrible. In the year I worked there, two store managers just left in the middle of the day. Only 3 people worked their at the end of the year and we had to run the store without a manager"
bad,"Work was easy and fast paced, from cleaning to stocking and straightening shelves. ringing up customers and handling payments, returns, and exchanges. Had issues with my schedule, my manager wouldn't work with me about it after asking several times. Co-workers are wonderful, nice, and very helpful only real downside was issue with hours conflicting with school. The hardest part of the job was the amount of standing, but it's a retail job so it's only expected. The best part is easily the occasional trial items we'd get to see and how much you'd learn about all the different products."
bad,What I learned was that you couldn't confide in any of the management and not to trust anyone. They didn't know what they were talking about when it came down to what they were selling or what the customers wanted or how to talk to customers. The management was all for the money but when it came down to the happiness of the customer they didnt care.
bad,"Are typical day at work would be:"
bad,"It was a good job for me to learn basic skills, along with starting my management skills. I am glad i got the opportunity to learn new skills."
bad,"As a Store Manager at Sally Beauty Supply you are obligated to spend 47.5 hours per week at the store. However, after your 30 minute lunches are subtracted you only end up working 45 hours. But since managers are salaried, and our salary is paid out as though we only work 40 hours per week, you end up getting the short end of the stick. "
bad,I have worked for Sally Beauty Supply for 2.5 years.  I was promised repeatedly to be put in a management position.  The latest was last week.  I'm sure it is only in this district that those promises are made and not kept.
bad,"customers can be very rude, I really don't care for the corporate part of the job. management can be very sneaky. your job is no secure. I love my cowokers. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the management."
bad,I love the people they are always there to help you but the company itself isn't the greatest.
bad,"A typical day working at Sally is assisting customers, cash handling,  and the daily assignments that are routine schedule each week. I learned that I can independently work alone and handle managing a store and my employees. The management to this company I feel they don't support their employees and the professionalism is poor among other managers. Sally has about 3800 stores and each store has a store manager and four to five employees to a store, therefore the dynamic of the team becomes like a little family. The hardest part of the job was the expectations the company has on its store like managers has no extra hours on training staff properly, short staff on holidays extended hours making employees work more and dealing with new company changes every month. The most enjoyable part is when is having a great team and making the work duties easier for each other. Having great prizes and earning rewards each month of completing monthly quotas for store manager and all employees.     "
bad,Lowest paying job I have ever worked with the worst benefits and zero employee appreciation..
bad,"bad energy, bad treatment, bad hours, would not recommend. If you put in the time, you're better off finding a more useful job. Discrimination and unprofessionalism occur often."
bad,"Fine if you're looking part time. They don't pay well at all, I worked there 3+ years and even managed. I got paid $100 more per paycheck as a manager, than I did as an assistant. "
bad,"Sallys would have been a pretty great job except my manager at the time was very unprofessional, aggressive at times, attitude intolerable, the way she talked about customers behind their backs when she got upset was a huge eye opener. It got to the point where I had to quit my job! How messed up is that. And I loved that job for the most part, all the customers I've come to kno."
bad,"Not enough hours and way too many duties. There's no accommodating certain stores in dangerous areas. Management never cared.  when I ask my manager for help with all the new apps that were coming out, she always said Okay with a barium enema help. I asked if I could have an assistant manager due to the fact that my store was in a dangerous area and had more knowledge and was full-time to help out who had more knowledge to help out."
bad,Sally’s is an outdated company unable to keep up with the rest of the cosmetic business. If you’re just starting out or looking to grow in the industry Sally’s will start you off on the wrong path and you will learn nothing but gain bad habits. It wasn’t all bad but it’s definitely not for me and I don’t recommend it if you wanted to be taken seriously in the industry.
bad,You will do more work then the manager! The higher ups only care the managers not the associates. They will have you working during the most dangerous weather conditions. Overall not a good company to work for.
bad,Lack of upper management support including tech support. Long hours working by yourself is a security issue. Only one entry/ exit is an OSHA violation. Technology/ computer system issues are a daily occurrence. Waiting for IT support impreeds customer service as you do work alone often for periods of time.
bad,"The only thing I enjoyed from this job were the customers. (I won't say anything too personal about my experience working here.) I was a Beauty Advisor/Store Associate who provided great customer service while recommending/selling products and keeping the store presentable too. I received a lot of compliments from customers personally, and they were told to my manager about me as well. Management was absolutely horrible (Not management material), and some of the coworkers later on became controlling and rude for no reason, as if it was high school all over again. In the job description while applying for this job, I was told I would be trained for everything in/of the store, including knowledge of the products. I wasn't. I practically educated myself on products I was not too familiar with, but still made more sales than most of the employees. (I am more experienced with makeup/skincare, while this store sold 95% of hair care.) I worked hard and did my best to make everyone happy except for myself. I thought I would make good friends there, but everyone is only there for themselves. I was always polite to everyone, accepted my own minor mistakes, but was still being mistreated all of the time, then later on my hours were purposely being cut down every week. (I worked here for nearly two months.) I was always stressed out and felt uncomfortable just being there. This job is a great way to grow your communication skills, but it is not a steady job. My personal experience was almost toxic, but it could be different for you."
bad,I love working at Sally’s beau de I was a hue beauty fanatic and I went to cosmetology school and loved educating people on new products. After a year I started to notice the manager was complacent and not very good at hiring long term employees. I loved the job and customers but management and corporate did not care to ensure their employees were happy and taken care of. I worked for a month with no heat.
bad,"Sales associates get paid 10.00 With 20 to 30 hours"
bad,"I really loved working with the products and the people but the management is unprofessional, put in hours for herself that she didnt work, was passive aggressive towards her employees."
bad,2nd key holder maintain staff customer service opening and closing of store fronting the store mopping sweeping dusting rearranging the store back stock freight weekly
bad,"This job is okay for someone that’s is just starting out, or is going to school and need extra cash. They refuse to give you full time hours unless your management. They tell you about all these great benefits that’s you can get with the company to find out you can only get them if you are full time. They talk about how you can grow with the company fast and have so many options. In reality there’s only assistant manager then manger. But they don’t like to hire with in so chances of that’s are rare. They cut hours a lot. It’s an easy job but not for long term. You can’t really grow and pay it not good either. The raises are .25 or less a year. Beside free samples every month the company dosent really take care of there employees. And when people quit they expect you to run the store on your own do everything you can for the company and you don’t get rewarded or even a thank you."
bad,"Gerente Regional sin cultura de como tratar al personal Gerente Distrital parandose el cuello con el trabajo de las demas y echando pestes de las demas tiendas en cada una que visita, en General no es la empresa es el personal que lo maneja. Presion para pagar productos que te roban y que no esta estipulado en contrato y si no lo haces te hacen la vida de cuadritos."
bad,"I worked at Sally Beauty as a manager for 5+ years and it was the worst job ive ever had...only stuck around for so long cause I loved my staff. Upper management is literally garbage and doesn’t care about your well being at all. They want you to eat sleep breathe Sally Beauty. Pay isn’t worth it at all...save yourself the hassle and look for another job, unless depression is what you’re looking for."
bad,"Started off as a good workplace environment, but then I got serious health issues and all they did was complain about my medication and cut my hours.."
bad,"This job was not the worst job, but it was not the best. The communication is horrible. The management team is not that great. They tend to play good cop bad cop roles. My direct supervisor was not very knowledgeable and she had a very hard time training. Rules and policies consistently change. Most of the time it is done without notice. Very high turnover. The only thing that was good were the health benefits."
bad,"Its fun as a part time job, but you cant support yourself on the low pay. The free monthly products and employee discount were great. "
bad,The stores are understaffed which leads to poor customer service and lack of coverage during peak times of the day and when the stores receive a shipment. The managers are expected to overcome what are sometimes insurmountable obstacles and reduce theft with minimal security measures.
bad,"Upper management very unfair devious and showed too much favortism. Company cut hours so much employees cant qualify for benefits."
bad,"Upper-management is deceitful and underhanded. I would NOT recommend working there to anyone. In store management was fabulous until she had to cover her own butt, then she proved to be nothing more than a lackey for the upper management."
bad,The day to day work did not coincide with the work described during the interview.  The new manager was an extreme micromanager and the director condoned it.  During the interview they pride themselves on flexibility with the option to telecommute. This is a lie.  They are not open to you taking advantage of that and throw it in your face if you do.  No one speaks and stays in their cubes all day.  The atmosphere is weird and cold.  You are unable to use vacation time for 6 months and do not get health insurance for 90 days.
bad,this company takes advantage of you as much as it can and none of the managment really knows what they are doing. they managment was the worst part because you never get fully trained you kind of have to teach yourself.
bad,they say you can move up in the company but then never give you the tools needed to move up. like proper training. they managers are over worked and underpaid
bad,"Hours were horrible and you had to have open availability"
bad,"Working at sally beauty is okay for anyone who's in beauty school, if the manager is willing to work with those in school. My manager did not want to hire anyone in school. Scheduling could be adjusted on the day of work without knowing. You had to have complete open availability, you pretty much had no life. I was constantly pushed into working at another store as well and was working 6 days a week, all closing shifts. Pay is horrible, especially for those who are licensed. You do not need a cosmetology license to work here, but I think those employed at sally beauty should BE licensed. I cannot tell you how man times we've had people mad at employees because they were given wrong information by someone not licensed. There were also no security cameras where I worked. Sally beauty is a cheap a greedy company."
bad,"The amount of robberies that each store experience are astounding.  "
bad,"Sallys was an okay ... just bad communication skills  DM and upper class were rude and awful to there employees . Other then that the staff are great , have great Monthly freebies from different products handlers to try their product  .getting to know knowledge of the company and hair color etc , pays for comostology schools"
bad,"Las gerentes distritales en este caso de guadalajara son pesimas personas para dar instrucciones son poco profecionales esto devido a que se ensañan con sus trabajadoras, cuando les das buenos resultados te tienen en la gloria pero un pequeño error y casi te quieren pisotear, no te puedes enfermar y no puedes tener vida propia ni planes en tu vida, y cuando ya no les sirves te cambian de tienda asta que te cansas y renuncias por ti misma."
bad,"Worst management I have ever seen. Every manager talks about each other behind their backs, if you make a complaint it takes months for someone to actually look into it. Only thing that was nice was the free products we would get but we wouldn't even get them until the end of the month which I am guessing just depends on your ""manager"". Customers suck because they forget that at the end of the day this is retail how are we suppose to know if they don't know how to use a product especially if they don't ask us for help."
bad,"I was a management at Sally in pa . I love my job always on time .wen I get the position as management everything change . I get sick ,I don't have any support from the Dm, and  my mom die and they have the nerve to call me and said that was not my mom ...... I believe the Sally as corporation is not a bad place to work , is the little people who treat the employee  like the are not human if you want a success business you have to get you DM on training  how to treat a store management do investigation and ask why so many manager quit Sally in Lancaster pa  . Once again I love to work for Sally . They have to improve how to treat the employee thanks"
bad,only good thing is you get to test out products before your recommend them to customers other than that I didn't learn anything from this job
bad,"Sally Beauty was such a fun place to work when I started with the company over a year ago. I really enjoyed the store manager and my fellow co-workers. That all changed when the extremely unprofessional manager began treating employees poorly and speaking ill of her employees to other employees! In the year I have been with the company I have seen 5 employees quit or be fired from the company. The manger does not take the time to train her new employees, she will attempt to close with new hires get frustrated and just do the work for them so they have to learn from other employees. The manger has been with the company for 10 years and feels she is untouchable/irreplaceable. Over a month ago myself and 4 other employees submitted statements to our DM regarding her behavior. That was a mistake because all she did was hire 3 more employees and cut the hours of the other 5 girls in the store. When it comes to letting customers know of any coupons they have we have be instructed NOT to inform the customer about the coupon because it brings down our average sale. Love girls I work with too bad someone won't take a good look at management.."
bad,"The managers don’t stay, the employees don’t stay, you learn most of your hair care knowledge on the sales floor, nobody wants to work as a team, the company handles issues in a very shady way, there is no commission, there are no real benefits, they only care about you getting better sales so they can make more money."
bad,"Trato de lo peor de parte de altos mandos,no te dan los premios. Que ganas,te vigilan como que les vayas a robar,te hacen pagar todo lo que la gente se roba diciendo que tu culpa por no vigilar,te exigen que vendas algo que el cliente no.quiere y si no lo haces te sancionan a cada rato te pone actas administrativas."
bad,"I worked here for a month. Didn’t have a manager in that time and once we got one everyone’s hours got cut to the point we were working 2-3, 4 hour shifts a week. Not worth it in my opinion."
bad,"Would do lines on the back room table, manager was lazy and sits in back room and watches videos on her phone, and if the manger and co manager doesn’t like you they WILL gang up on you."
bad,"You have to do everything yourself in the store, pretty much take care of the entire store yourself, they give you no credit or thanks, pays people poorly for all the work you really have to do at the end of the day."
bad,If youre hired on as a beauty advisor get ready to bust your a$# for no reason. No career advancement theyd rather hire managers and assistant managers from outside than promote. Honestly dont waste your time. I only made 16$ an hour as store manager!!!! If you feel like wasting your time this is the place for you!
bad,My experience working at Sally's was that I was not treated fairly. Only about a month in i was doing the job of an assistant manager while only getting paid to be a normal sales associate
bad,"Management non-communtication, inpatient,displayed preferential treatment to others and was very lazy. Promotions were denied,  employees subjected to completing management duties regularly."
bad,"I learned my career at Sally during the first 18 years. With new Management, over 800 people have been laid off and continue to be laid off. SBH is slowly losing both it's base long term employees and customer base."
bad,"The manager doesn’t respect the employees nor the customers. Employees have to walk around watching the customers that shops there making them feel uncomfortable because the manager thinks everyone is there to steal. I love helping people but, it makes me feel very uncomfortable and it puts our lives in danger."
bad,"Sadly after 3 years at a job that personally was fulfilling i threw in the towel."
bad,"Sally Beauty Supply is great for a first job or right after high school, however there is hardly room to move up in the company. I would not consider this a career by any means."
bad,Management is poor and there is no room for advancement and managers get all the rewards. Associates' are not compensated for there hard work. u work long hours and they give u little raises
bad,For being a store manager there was no real structure in the work place. i was thrown to the wolves after training. other store mangers seen my potential and did not want to see my progression. there was no job security. if you messed up once that was it.
bad,I was there for 5 years and knew more than half of the employees and professional customers. No advancement bc they don't want to pay you. I was never offered a managers position and new employees got higher raises than me. The company it's self is good but the supervisors suck.
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"While working here, the original manager was let go,  the girls and I kept the store running until they found a new manager. When they found that,  big changes happened and it was all and all good changes to help improve the store. I did so much for that store to help keep it successful, but got put on suspension for clocking in ONE MINUTE late. I was in the store before,  but was helping a customer because everyone else was busy.  They never called me back,  I waited 2 weeks to come bac into workk before I quit."
bad,I worked at the store briefly while I was in cosmetology school. I found this environment the most rewarding. I was able to help customers with their hair and make up and nail inquiries. This job is very rewarding because I love helping people
bad,the management team has no clue on what's going on there.working overtime when it's not necessary.needs major housecleaning.there is no accountibility there people basically do as they want
bad,"Great place to work but when something goes terribly wrong, like raw sewage in your store, management from out of town expected you to work and then threatens to fire you for not working and calling OSHA."
bad,"Lack of support"
bad,"This is a good job for someone who isnt looking to advance. If you work a certain amount of hours you get vacation. There aren't many people to cover shifts. The company expects you to do 100 things at once and be paid minimum wage to do so. The only thing you could ever get fired for is stealing, no call no show, or crossing the line with a customer (like cursing, or blowing up on them). They teach you most of what you need to know as far as advising on hair color, hair products, etc."
bad,"Would not recommend this company to anyone that considers themselves a professional in Customer Service and/or Retail. Training is poor, managers are inadequate."
bad,"Right Hand doesn't know what the left is doing. Immature management, no internal growth. Lowest pay I have ever received. Each employee has to do everything, including the managements job. Every employee expected to wear every hat. No security in store for employees. Upper management doesn't care about anything but quota and numbers."
bad,Hacen que pagues los prdocutos que faltan en tienda yo dure 4 meses y pague como mil pesos en mi finiquito todavoa me deacontaron 500 pesos segun de faltantes si no firmaba el descuento no me darian mi finiquito pesima empresa deben de tener un seguro conttq robos porque almenos en mi tienda los clientea se embolsaban muchas cosas y uno terminaba pagando se supone que la empresa tiene canaras y como quiera te obligan a que lo pagues tu si te niegas a pagqr te quitan tu bono mensual
bad,i wish i never took this job. The manager made me do grunt work for the entire year i was there and only gave me 8 HOURS A WEEK!! The new girl got 16+
bad,couldnt get properly trained to even switch to the location i applied at ......no uniform or name tag after a month....rude co-workers.......no help at all
bad,"i thought i had taken enough bc they were lying about hours to me but when my current manager said i have crabs, i drew the line and i have made the decision to quit. i’m part time but they refuse to make me full time and now with school, they actually have a reason. i have bipolar and somehow my manager found out through word of mouth bc i trusted a co worker and he told me working with me is like doctor jekyll and mr hyde."
bad,Pay is so low. Management is horrible. They make so many changes it’s so difficult to keep up. I worked here for 3 years and barely got any kind of raise.
bad,"While working at Sallys Beauty Supply my typical day at work honestly was stressful with the unprofessional management. My hard work was taken advantage from me, and I never got the credit I truly deserved from there. The manager would put me and another coworker against each other and make up lies and even lie to our faces. It was a terrible working environment. The manager there came from ulta beauty (minding you I was there alone at the store for about 3-4 months until the store got an actual manager). When she came along we needed another beauty advisor so she hired a girl that worked at ulta with her showing her so much favoritism by giving her proper training which I never had I got thrown on the floor my first day working there without a clue how to use the register and learning the system. I told the manager this and even asked her for training. Also while working there they didn't have cameras and my belongings always got stolen from me whether it was my money, medication, and other things. I highly suggest not working at Sallys Beauty on Rochester Rd in the plaza of target because its by far the worst work experience I've ever encountered"
bad,When I got hired no one was nice didn’t know anything about ther products. I put filled out my application form and my employer gave me a call but then later said she couldn’t work with my schedule. I kept to myself my employer was upset when I was quiet so I started to talk to the other coworkers more  and more but they would just tell all my business every time we would talk so I wasn’t really comfortable at work because I couldn’t talk to anyone nor was I showing appreciation for my job. I was there on time I was even there two hours early when I was called in and still perform my job.
bad,Don’t look at this job as a permanent income. The company loves cutting hours and making up new rules all the time so we can’t used our PTO. And the management is a total mess. The company doesn’t seem to know what it wants to do. I love the products but the company needs some work.
bad,"Es buen trabajo siempre y cuando seas títeres de las gerentes distritales haciendo todo con la cabeza agachada, te exigen demás sin pagarlo, si falta personal te mueven descanso, horas de comida, te sobrecargan la mano y no lo pagan, cualquier cosa que se pierda o suceda será tu culpa, si falta dinero lo tienes que pagar, si algo no les parece buscan como correrte o meter presión para que renuncies, las gerentes distritales no apoyan en nada y solo están para chismear con gerentes, no motivan, no trabajan, en general sería una buena empresa si tuvieran el personal adecuado y bien capacitado, puesto que el trabajo es bastante entretenido, puedes aprender mucho pero solo si tú personal  ya que si uno entra sin experiencia estás por tu cuenta porque si no te toca buena gerente nadie te enseñará hacer nada..."
bad,My job role changed shortly after starting and I could not do the new role (financial assistant).  I was terminated because I could not master the new position.  Also the training was deplorable.
bad,A typical work day is I come in sign in with the Cashier. I learned the different products Sallys has. Management does not know how to professional speak with their employees.  I do get along with the co-workers and they make it enjoyable for me. They do not pay you what you are supposed to get each pay period.
bad,La empresa en si es muy buena lastima por las personas que tienen a cargo. (Gerentes distritales y gerentes tienda) son personas prepotentes que se sienten tocadas por dios y ni estudiadas estan e impiden el crecimiento laboral he ahy el por que de que tienen tanta rotacion de personal ahullentan a las empleadas solo por que ven potencial y no quieren verlas crecer en la empresa y empiezan con el hostigamiento laboral. No generalizo solo recalco que esto es en torreon. Atentos sally beauty esa gente ahullenta a buenas vendedoras con ganas de trabajar.
bad,"This was by far the phone strenuous and unkind work environment I've worked in to date. A bunch of girls were fired before I quit due to their attitude and cattiness, but another store near us closed and their workers came to our store and it was the same bad attitude and unkind comments as before. They keep the stores perpetually under staffed as there are only 100 total hours to go around for all workers per week, so they only keep 2 working 50 hours a week or two working 4-43 and one working 10-15 max. It is tiring when one is fired and the other is on vacation and you're forced to work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week with your manager for two weeks. I loved the perks and the advice to clients, and the knowledge i gained, but I work in an office now for double the pay and 30 hours a week and I've never been happier."
bad,"It doesn't matter how inviting this place seems at first, this company is a sham and a trap. Horrible hours that are always being either cut or threatened. Management that does nothing at all most of the time. Over worked and underpaid while the company bumbles about doing nothing. Don't bother."
bad,"A typical day was quite simple. Take care of the task at hand and assist customers. I learned how to handle all kinds of different people with different problems relating to personal care. My store manager was a very nice person, but her assistant treated me very poorly. It got to the point that I had to contact my lawyer because she was harassing me about physical things that i could not control. The hardest part of my job was leaving. I loved a lot of my regular customers, and my store manager was my role model. The best part of the job was helping people look as good on the outside and they felt on the inside."
bad,"El corporativo te exige mucho y no paga a tiempo tus bonos."
bad,"Manager was very rude during the interview process, “orientation” if you could even call it that, training, and after. Treated me like a dog. Ridiculed me often. She used to “shoo!” Me away, gesturing and saying “shoo!” Or she’d just flat out say “Move!”, refused to help me help customers if I didn’t know the answer, constantly told me everything I was doing was wrong, insulted me over a family members: death because I couldn’t make it to work.  It was horrible. I left soon after."
bad,"my district manager was terrible. worked for 6 years as a manager in northern California an was never paid more than $14 an hour. yes, benefits were good, but the cost of living is too much for this cooperate conglomerate to cough up. would not be able to survive on the lack of wages provided to managers."
bad,"I worked at Sally for about two years on and off. The pay is terrible, and they will start you at 7.25- 7.50 if you have no experience. The second time I came back I was kept at 8.50 for a whole year. Getting a raise of 20 cents every time they review your file is like mission impossible. If you have any tardies or call outs consider the raise out of the question. My manager would usually say that she was speaking about our wages in her meetings with upper management but to me that was a lie. If the company never made an effort to retain employees by acquiring better incentives, then they were never a good company to begin with. One of my coworkers overheard a district manager commenting on the dissatisfaction of our wages, and all he had to say was that we were all replaceable if that was the case."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of mundane unrealistic goals. Trying to get customers to spend more money and purchase a discount card they'll hardly even use. We get paid for the items we sell that are sitting on the countertop, not necessarily recommending them to you because they will benefit your situation. We aren't allowed to have any input as far as sales go or what our clients really need. Corporate has us rearrange the store every week so the customers complain EVERY WEEK about how they can't find anything. The hardest part of the job is recommending products that will not benefit our customers in any way but we must make quota or have our jobs threatened. Best part of the job is the comradery, you do make long lasting friendships."
bad,I worked my butt off for this company. I got relocated to a store near converse Texas and no matter how great I was with selling and with customer service I was told it wasn't good enough. I would schedule myself at 8:30 am and would arrive to work at 7:30am every day to clean and make sure store was always 100% organized. Never called in or arrived late but was told I wasn't dependable. Never would go back to this company again.
bad,I loved my job at Sally. I think i rocked it everyday. I learned all of my products so well so quick and it paid off to know what i was talking about. My sales were huge and i did as good as my manager 2 months into my job. Unfortunately my manager made my job hard for me and corporate wouldn't investigate into the false hours and work i was doing for her. It was super hard for me and my co-workers to leave sally but the company did not treat us well. Now on another note i made wonderful life long friends through Sally. I like there products and enjoyed learning and achieving from them. I set goals and met them i just wish i would have been treated better as an employee.
bad,It use to be a very wonderful company to work for. Now you have to worry about high theft and getting robbed. The theft causes managers to have high shrink in their stores. Also the computer systems are very sslow and tends to crash a lot
bad,"The management is so poorly run! It's run by kids basically, manager very rude and to customers. No respect for The team. Only care if it benefits them."
bad,dm  and tm over rated. do not follow guidelines. Out for themshelves. if you do not kiss there hindends then they are out to get you. that is why they go through so many people.
bad,"Assisted associates with their daily duties. Counted registers at opening/closing. Made daily deposits. Assisted customers with great customer service, advising them with their needs and giving them a helping hand. Read emails on a daily. Learned of new promotions, and trained associates. Changed monthly displays, and plans on sections for new products."
bad,"My specific location has very high maintenance customers, which puts a lot of stress on employees. New management took over and all they care about is money. No concern for their beauty advisors."
bad,"Management was okay.. If I'd make one mistake, she'd call me out and embarrass me in front of the customers. She also would talk down other employees to me and vice versa. I got along with her well, despite these things. She always made sure the store was nice and orderly. The issue lies not within management, but with corporate. They seem to be a bunch of cash cows, making us work Christmas Eve, new years eve, and new years. Some holidays they give you off, and some they don't. The company expects its associates to put the company before family. Don't ever get sick (normal human function), you'll be belittled and will never hear the end of it, especially if you try to call out again, even if it's months apart. They're constantly rearranging the store, just about every week, and you are expected to have these things done in an unreasonable amount of time. No vacation time unless you've worked there beyond 2 years. Don't get paid enough to keep up with their ridiculous requests. Advancement is minimal, and you can forget about it if you have a single absence. Had to take up some managerial responsibilities for the same rate of pay. All in all, Sally's doesn't care about their employees at all. All they care about is how much money you can put in their pockets. They also don't properly train you but still expect you to be on the sales floor the next day. The only good thing is the employee discount. On occasion free samples, if management remembered to get them to us. And meeting a few humorous customers here and there.. You never get praised for what you do outstandingly, only"
bad,"Don’t work at this job if you want to be “full time”- They’re docking every full time person to 15 hrs a week. Expects employees to do all the renovations while you’re helping guests and also has unreal expectations. Management is horrible and upper management is a complete joke. The job itself is awesome, the company just expects too much for $8.00 job. Also the “manager” doesn’t really have the ability to actually fire someone."
bad,"I thought it would be fun to work with all girls, I was totally wrong drama filled. You get in trouble for things that did not happen and complaints that come out of no where. Hours are not split equally neither are work duties. Also opportunities to move up in the work place are not given equally or to individuals who earned it. I had the unfortunate event of loosing a family member, and I had asked for services off and they were marked as call offs. I even let them know that my family member was not doing well and loosing her was inevitable at this point. I worked there for 6 months and the stress and drama was just to much for me, I understand it's a job but it's not worth dreading every shift and the stress endured."
bad,Awful company. Reported that there was internal theft and bullying going on in my store and neither my manager or the loss prevention team were interested. Had to leave as I couldn't deal with a company that thought behaviour like this was acceptable. I left within a year. However my other manager colleagues were very friendly and made me feel welcome.
bad,"Aprendizaje de cada uno de los productos"
bad,The manager is so rude and disrespectful and the upper management doesn’t care they force you to work hours and the management just sits on their butts and do nothing at all but complain / worst experience ever
bad,Hated extreme long hours no weekends off nor did they have good management berry berry poor management!Had sick time but could never use It unless you were actually hospitalized!!
bad,Pésimo trato la gerente de tienda muy dura al hablar no tiene modo.
bad,For the amount of stress and work load you have to put up with is no where near the amount you get paid. Honestly take your skills some where else so you can grow in an amazing company unlike this one
bad,"All I can say is unless you have no other talents and desperate for money, you should do your best to look for an opportunity elsewhere. WASTE OF TIME & you will NEVER see your family. The only  thing great was the training functions but the corporate micro management, the manipulation, the ridiculous amount of work, the backstabbing, the pettiness, YOU NAME IT! I thought I had support and love from the other managers and my staff. The moment I was let go for something so incredibly stupid & technical, NOT A SINGLE ONE of those people contacted me to ask what happened.  Do not work for this company. TRUE FACT"" Beaury Advisors quit upon average person store:3. And the managers?"
bad,It is a great place to work if the management was better. There is a lot of she said she said and the manager talks about everyone to other employees instead of telling the employee she has a problem with themselves.
bad,"I worked there for 6 years with absolutely zero negative reviews, as well as perfect attendance. I had little pay and overwhelming work with lean staff that I could not schedule any hours to. They eliminated all full time employees and made every one part time. Meaning no benefits. In turn the turn over was horrific, could not keep people in positions. I was terminated on a trumped up allegation."
bad,"Hostile work environment , the new store manager is very rude knows nothing about the product. She steals company time a bully over her employees ughh"
bad,"I loved my customers and what I did, but as a store manager you can't do anything to your employees if they no call no show, always call in sick, can't make kpi,  etc.  You don't have the ability to do anything at all to them and they know this, all you are is a glorified cashier.  I wouldn't waste my time and wish that I hadn't ever wasted so many years.  They will pick a lazy slob of a employee over a manager that can hit every mark"
bad,There are many changes at Sally Beauty being that the company is trying to save its self. This company used to be a great place to work for  but now they do not care about their employees. Everyone is just a number and you are told by TM and DM that you are replaceable. They are taking out all 10+ employees. This is not the company that it used to be. Make the unreachable goals if not you are out the door.
bad,Management was out to get me once I started. All about drama. Always pointing fingers. Accused of everything under the sun. No proper training. Only time I worked with the manager was to watch videos even though they didn't have much to do with job details.
bad,They want you to do manager tasks while still only paying minimum wage. Working harder does not equal better money. The entire company is doing poorly. Their products are substandard and they do not take care of their employees.
bad,"From store managers all the way up to corporate managers, there is NO management structure. The lack of structure along with HORRIBLE pay is what drove me to leave my position."
bad,"It started out great. A real job after moving to a new city. As I began reading and finding things out about the whole company, it turned ugly, fast. The management also sucks. They have no idea what they're doing and sweeping the bad under the rug seems to be a norm for them. The overall company is really sketchy, I think."
bad,"Cashiering, backstocking, front facing, answering phones, customer service, communication, stocking shelves, training employees, cleaning, handling store delivery calls, entering data into computer, counting inventory, organizing shelves, paperwork, and customer satisfaction."
bad,"So basically I started at Sally’s the start of October. For the first week or so everyone (I say everyone by that I mean two people they were that short staffed) was friendly. Then someone came off sick and two other new starters started and all of a sudden cattyness started and I wasn’t liked because my face didn’t fit. I thought I’d get on with it until I saw the Christmas rota then I decided to look for another job. The manager had made it fair for everyone else except me! Then I had my two month ‘probation review’ we’re I was basically told I wasn’t good enough for the job (no idea why as I did no less than anyone else) and told to book my ideas up, I was annoyed as the manager was never ever on the shop floor to see how I worked! Clearly the catty staff members had made false comments about my work. Very sad and pathetic. So after that I thought that’s it I’m leaving and I quit. Didn’t want to spend my Christmas in that environment, still find it funny how the manager claimed I wasn’t good enough yet I was good enough to cover everyone’s hours over Christmas! Pure cheek. Glad to be out of there avoid like the plague especially if you have kids!"
bad,I have worked at Sallys for 3 years and have had some of thee worst managers (5 of them ) my last manger was a horrible and fired Me and this employee...
bad,"Good coworkers, always kept clean and organized. Assistant manager was fair with everyone and equal. Flexible hours for employees who were in lunch and on the floor helping clients."
bad,"Management only cares about what is beneficial to them. I worked for the company for seven years, I was a store manager only getting paid $12.00, people made more than me that had come in with little to no experience."
bad,"they make you work way more then what they paid you, salary sucks, they always have people in and out for the same reasons, they don't care about their employees"
bad,"This job is extremely stressful,  you do literally do everything: cashier,  sales, visuals,  clean, open/close store by yourself, and be security all for a pay that isn't worth it. Customers are extremely rude and always trying to steal. Not the mention the turn over rate is so high that you'll find yourself with no days off."
bad,"No consistency in hours or pay rates. Despite carrying out manger duties, no raise in 4 years.  No benefits or accountability."
bad,Horrible company to work for with all the activity going on. Very bad management. If you try making corporate complaint nothing will happen
bad,"Worked for two years and decided to leave. I started in one store and at first I was fine. after the manager treated us like garbage, it would tell us crude, often heard her speak ill of us in talks by phone with other managers. he mocked the district manager, she really was not professional. There was a time when I crash a finger in the store and she told me not know what to do on that occasion and spent ten years working for sally. we played to us to deal with their states of bipolar mood. he also did a report on the Department of Labor because she did not want me to deliver my last book, and even erase me hours, often at all. really that manager is a disrespectful and disrespect. I made him a report on corporate and did nothing, which led me to lose respect for the company. I transferred to another  and at first everything right, very different manager, very nice and worked in a totally different environment, until they forced me to follow clients through the store, watch your bags, close the door when a client had something in your wallet and to force her to pay. on many occasions I had to call the police. that is not right, because that is against the policy of sally beauty. force you to make your goals, alter special coupons and mislead the client."
bad,I really enjoyed my job with Sally's. I was able to meet a lot of different people that really relied on my expertise in the products that were being sold.
bad,everyday was unpredictable in which I love. I learned something new everyday. The store manager and DM wasn't at its best. My co-workers were pretty good and enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of my job was some difficult customers and that was something I had no problem dealing with. Problem solving and helping people is something I'm really good at. I believe that I had the most fun working with the people.
bad,"Daily tasks included, payroll, making the schedule, proper zoning, ly/goal numbers, focus on 100% customer service, training/hiring/firing all associates including management, and overall morale."
bad,this compay is a great place to grow and learn a lot if toy want to be in the hair buness. Sally is a family buness that makes you feel at home 
bad,Everyday was good and I enjoyed it. I didn't learn too much because of my knowledge and schooling. They need to get a new store manager. There was nothing hard about the job. I enjoyed helping others how to care better for their hair.
bad,"This company is a waste of your time. They do not care about their sales associates at all. If you are lucky enough to be a manager, then you get treated a little better. The pay is lousy, and not enough to live on. I worked there for some time and I was constantly miserable. I tried to contact corporate several times to report a horrible manager, and they just continued to shut me down and eventually they fired me. No one listens to your concerns about the job and it is just a horrific place to work. Please do yourself a favor and know that you are worth more and don't apply here....EVER!!!"
bad,"It's not a nice place to work anymore and they are getting way too strict with their policies, they are constantly changing stratagies and they are way behind in technology."
bad,You can learn a lot about the beauty industry. Do not expect to advance. Openings are few and far between. When you can advance they work you to death. You learn a lot about the chemicals you sell.
bad,They are a great place to work they reward there employees they are very fare equal with all employees. They honor there employees good work environment
bad,"Seriously if you are looking for a job in the beauty industry,this is not the place. On the real this place is awful from t the customers all the way to the managers. They would much rather hire and give the upper hand to someone who does not have a license or any knowledge with anything to do in this industry."
bad,"I've had some ups and downs. Met some wonderful people and some I would very much like to forget. Some of the other managers are real kind and understanding, but the one in store 821 is just horrible. She is rude, yells at the employees on the sales floor, belittles you in front of customers and is always in a bad mood. I've tried talking to the company but they just look the other way. I guess because shes been there so long. If i could have just had a different store that would be great. But I guess they don't do store transfers so I just quit. It's a shame too because there was a lot of good. most of the girls i worked with were nice and helpful. But the drama and gossiping that the manager spreads is just unprofessional so I left for my well being. I have never been harrassed in a work place as I have while working in that store. I would say be careful working for this company and most certainly DONT apply in store 821 west and shaw. Unless you like being treated like you are worthless."
bad,Never Really organized and the manager doesn’t put in to consideration your needs or listens to your concerns. If you give them the opportunity they will take advantage of you.
bad,They catch you by saying if you have an open Availability you get the hours you want. It's a lie. The area manager talks badly about everyone she meets and always puts down the workers to make them feel less of a person NOT WORTH IT
bad,"The entire company is unclear about diverse hair. Hires minorities for show and won't give many hours. Terrible pay 10/hr, management, and company poilcy doesn't work well with college student or mothers."
bad,I have worked at 3 locations my favorite by far was in Maryland because we were a true team there and the last store I work at was in Louisiana and it was awful the manager told me I would work a  minimum of 25-30 hours and I never received more then 20 my last week I only receive 15 hours which is unacceptable  and no one can live on that !
bad,"Boring job, company doesn’t care about you. No opportunities for raises or bonuses unless you’re a store manager. Beauty advisors are the ones who mostly get the sales and don’t get rewarded for it. If you make month, store manager gets a bonus however no one else gets anything."
bad,Pay is horrible. The warehouse in redrock pays more than what assistant managers and managers make. Always short staffed and have high turn over rate because everyone they hire is really young and hired on only pt
bad,"Upper management has never ran a store but expects a lot out of employees. Unrealistic goals. No coverage, they expect the manager to do everything..."
bad,"I’ve worked in a store with 2 other girls for 3 months keeping the store open and working 50+ hours a week each.  When a district manager finally comes in they rip into us about how we haven’t been doing things right and over hire for our positions, but have not hired a manager."
bad,Worked for them for over 3 years and when applying for another job they wouldn't even recognize that I worked for them they worked long hours no lunches no breaks open to close by yourself. Poor company to work for.
bad,"My boss was never at work, she would come in clock in and leave. I wouldn’t see here. She would give me a list of things that needed to be done that day and if there was an online call she would show up 5 minutes before the call. My co workers were lazy, I always did shipment and most of the time I did it by myself. I would work back to back doubles and it would get annoying because most of those Shifts I was by myself doing the work of what 3 people were doing. I was constantly stressed out."
bad,"The store I worked at was fun everyone got along. a good team."
bad,I didn't like that I went to school and women who didn't got a job there and got paid more only if you were a manager. Not only that you only learn by watching videos. I had a girl that fried her hair because my co worker told her to use 40 volume. Like no!
bad,She yelled at me at least twice for simply asking a question! She thinks she cant do anything wrong and not giving co-workers any respect! No one should get yelled at for simply asking a question!
bad,"I loved working here when I started. After the first month, people were talking bad about each other. My manager was telling my co workers how much I was getting paid (which wasn't good pay). I was very sad while working here. Not a good environment at all"
bad,"I applied for a 20 hour a week position and got the job, but it quickly went from 20 hours a week to 40-45. I was working full time with no other benefits other than an employe discount. I didn't get any of the benefits that a full time worker did, and I never got paid overtime. You have to worry about selling a certain number of Sally's cards and Items of the month and if you don't make the numbers, you'll get written up. I even got written up for not wearing makeup one day. There's so much more to be said about this place, but I'll leave it at that. Do not ever work here."
bad,"Beauty advisor. Stocking, checking out, assisting customers. Plan o guides, tags, price changes, creating sales, backstock, cleaning, learing products, organizing."
bad,Its a stressful day when you come in and punch  in for work. The store is short staffed. and nothing gets done. ITs ditrty and no communication. And manager at this location isn't friendly
bad,"They get your hopes on things just to get you to learn and do there job, do not pay you anymore. everything about them probly is illeagal if looked into really well. they are masters at getting you to there job everyday"
bad,I learned to be a good sale associate and got along greeted with customers and my co workers. I did have to leave because of personal issues
bad,I was never properly trained. I was often left alone to close. which is a major security issue. since I was young I never said anything. pay is not great and co employees were never pleasant to work with.
bad,Not a great place to work at. Poor management on all levels. Constantly being told how to do things in different ways. They build you up to make you think you are growing with the company when you're not and they treat you poorly.
bad,"La empresa no se hace responsable de sus trabajadores, dicen ser muy ""abiertos"" y cuándo tienes un problema no te resuelven. Las gerentes distritales y regionales, si se llevan bien entre ellas por zona, ya te fregaste, por qué te pueden fastidiar entre gerente de tienda y gerente de distrito, y no harán nada las regionales MUCHO MENOS en RH. "
bad,"I think its crazy to have people who are licensed getting paid the same as people who are not. Plus managers aren't licensed and they get a raise if quota is met... not the rest of the employees. You'd think with this being a beauty supply store they would want licensed cosmetologist there, they don't. You are talked down to like you don't know things. Things they teach you about products are wrong and when you correct them they tell you to just go with it. And if you have a child... don't think about working here because they do not care. You can go from working over time one week down to only working 3 hour shifts the next week. This job is more for kids who are right out of high school."
bad,Te contratan pero no te dan una capacitación y luego si algo mal pasa o no les funcionas es tu problema
bad,"Sally Beauty is a place where I learned a lot about hair care, aesthetics, makeup, and customer service. Over time Sallys has definitely changed for the worse! The management that is currently employed are partial to certain employees, very drama driven, and are pitted against their employees instead of focused on trying to help them! I would never ever encourage anyone to work at this place, if you were focused on your relationship with your coworkers being great, but if you care more about a check and a decent relationship with some customers, I would highly encourage it! You will learn a lot about hair care and color, but you’ll be teaching it to yourself."
bad,Poor upper management to the point of harassment.  Marketing was wishy washy and unstable. False advertising and shortened sale periods.  Hasty decisions from hour to hour. I feel sorry for many customers that enter a store looking to save money and do their own services at home. Every store should have a licensed cosmetologist on duty and paid their worth!!!!
bad,"Extremely low wages, even in higher positions."
bad,"Sally isn't a bad place to work, if the store is located in the right spot. The unfortunate thing about Sally is that it's heavily reliant on foot traffic. The store I was at had very low foot traffic, so for 4-5 hours I'm standing around doing nothing. Even after stocking (which isn't hard because the store is small) there was still nothing to do in the store. Easy money is boring money."
bad,"It was not a good working environment and it did not work with my health issues, It was not a nice place to work and the hiring process was horrible.."
bad,"Constant running around you rarely, have a chance to breath. More times than not you have rude customers. You learn to plaster a smile on your face, even when people are yelling and threatening you, (customers, and upper management, both). All upper management did was come into town, and tell you what your not doing right, there was never really a good word or compliment. Rough! The hardest part, was trying to make everybody happy, while following policy so you didn't lose your job. There where few customers, that would brighten up your day, and there where times when you would find a good deal on products."
bad,"Firmas contrato donde dice que pagaras cosas si el cliente se las roba y es tu culpa. No te explica que todo lo que falte tanto en caja como mercancía lo tienes que pagar tú. "
bad,The beauty industry is always fun and fast paced but you deal with alot of angry customers whos hair went wrong or whatever. The industry features lots of drama but if you can avoid that and just do your job its super busy and fast paced. Lots of small things to remember where to put away.
bad,Very unstable environment. Transferred to 3 locations in my area within 6 months due to management and various issues concerning with Human Resources.
bad,Working at Sally's 5 years ago was horrible ... management was horrible! But now I think that it has gotten much better with new management.Constant tweakers coming into store and shoplifting!
bad,They treated their employees terrible! Managers would leave the store for hours at a time! District manager spoke to you like you were ignorant. On a positive note you got free samples of new products.
bad,The sales associates and I worked very effectively as a team and together created a great work environment however once you hit manager and above the trouble begins. The managers don't care about you and are very unprofessional. To make that worse you cannot take anything higher because upper management and above do not care about their employees. You would have better luck asking a brick wall for help.
bad,"Sally offers no advancements. There are never enough people to work, so if you have to call in because you are ill, you get in trouble because there is no one to cover your shift. You get written up if you miss more than 6 days, so If you have something like the flu, which can last up to a week, you will get written up. They don't offer over time or extra hours unless they are in desperate need for help, so Sally is really only a good job if you need super part time. The managers can call in whenever they want and take sick or vacation days, but employees get in trouble if they get sick. They don't offer paid sick or maternity leave. My coworker had a baby and she had to quit for a few months, only to be hired because they don't pay you for time off when you have a baby."
bad,"They would basically force you to work more than you are scheduled, They would change the schedule on you without letting you know, pay isnt enough for the work, management doesnt do any work."
bad,People would call in quite and I would be left openin g and closing all the time. An making not enough to live on. It was retail I was a manager of a store.
bad,"The job itself I enjoy with the benefits of trying free products and discounts. Past that, their is nothing to great. Hiring signs state of all these perks of working for sallys as a full time employee. Once you're full time you find out it is only for management. You get a raise once a year and not from the date you start . You get a raise 6 months in and not till that same date the following year. Very little raise. Their are small incentives for selling products but no recognition for hard work. Management is awful, sallys is always trying to cover up poor management."
bad,"Low pay, too many hours and management that lacks in professionalism a ethics. Most of the reports are hand written and the company has a poor investment in IT and tech. Stay away."
bad,"I have never been more abused by a work place. I do most of the work while others just stand there. One girl takes a smoke break every 10 minutes and, in one incident, has done a drug deal on the clock. We have had numerous shoplifting reports."
bad,management is very unprofessional; was very much shorted on what I should have been paid compared to my job description
bad,There was too much negativity from workers in this company Otherwise great place to work.
bad,The management and corporate do not care about you. You will make next to nothing and deal with catty women (including your district manager and store manager) talking and lying you behind your back. Save yourself the frustration and stress and avoid the company at all costs!
bad,It was a good learning expirence. I was able to use new products before being put out on the shelf so the customer can really get a honest answer on how it works before they use it for themselves.
bad,"My store was suffering in our sales because we just weren't getting the amount of business we needed. Instead of brainstorming how to get more business, our higher ups just blamed us for the lack of sales and punished us for it. We also kept getting our hours cut because of it and there were barely any hours for everyone and we weren't even fully staffed. Our manager was also very bad about playing favorites with other employees."
bad,You have no protection against aggressive customers and aggressive theft. It is a very unsafe environment to work in. The Charlotte district manager is insecure and will not train you well if you pose as a career threat. If you go there always have a back up plan.
bad,"the pay for a beauty advisor is $10/hr no commission. the amount of upselling and big-ticket items you sell, I wish there was commission. only managers get commission if daily/monthly goals were met. long hours on your feet, management wasn't organized. staff was always gossiping about one another."
bad,"The location in my town (Sarnia) constantly advertises as they're hiring. Although, when you go in to drop off a resume they tell you that they aren't hiring and they have to advertise they are because management wants them to. Whats the point? It's false advertising that they're hiring when they aren't!"
bad,"Management slacked in professionalism, coworkers were amazing. Although since I was the youngest, people felt they could take advantage of me and got away with it. We weren’t fully trained with everything so work will pile up causing us to get in trouble."
bad,"Firstly, none of their locations, as far as I know do not have cameras. If they do they are fake. This is really bad as theft goes on all the time inside the store. I stress this again because if you are falsely accused of something, there are no cameras to prove it. They are a really bad company to work for. I wish I could write more."
bad,"I worked at the Muncie, IN location. At the time the management and people above them were utterly terrible. The manager of this store, that still works there, would get mad over small silly things and retaliate by cutting your hours with no explanation. Us coworkers were actually a very tight group of friends after working together for while and the manager didn’t like that so she would try to turn us against each other which she ended up doing and ruined some friendships, She was also the worst micromanager i have ever had at any job, Essentially she was always out to get some one."
bad,"Working as an associate was a fun job, would have been better if I'd had a better manager. When I got promoted to management I had to commute and was only making about 1.50 more than regular employees to run the entire store. Raises are a joke and goals are unachievable."
bad,"The store I worked in had unreasonable sales goals given our location, and management preferred to use scare tactics and manipulation to ""encourage"" employees. The amount of things we were expected to keep track of multiplied by the day and was overall overwhelming, and manager micromanaged and consistently contacted employees on days off with things that could've waited until we came in for shifts. Scheduling was always done poorly and erratically, with shift gaps and time off requests rarely recognized. We were told there were no blackout dates for the calendar year of 2019 until we tried to request off for vacation and the time never got approved. I was assaulted in-store and nothing was ever done because my location had no security camera system and none of my coworkers witnessed this happen. Management played favourites and there was never-ending drama. One employee was given little to no training, so our DM told the SM to give her three hours a week as well as demeaning tasks such as cleaning mildew from windowsills until she quit, rather than firing her. Overall, worst job I've ever had. The lack of compassion and professionalism was astounding."
bad,i worked there for 6 years ! First 5 years were amazing. Then new upper managers came in and treat people like garbage! Don’t bother applying unless you worked with them before !
bad,"Sally's pretends their employees are part of a community yet they dont allow employees to work more than 29 hrs so they dont get benefits and managers work more than 50 hrs a week at 45 hr salary. They've cut back almost all incentives for employees to upsell yet they demand you do so. You might get $20 for a pizza party if you outsell all stores in your territory (there were about 500 in min) they used to have a good discount, used to reimburse employees for school in the beauty field, and used to offer scholarships. Now you might get a t shirt for a product launch. Horrible pay with small raises even if your evaluation is graded high as it can be."
bad,"This company and their managers DO NOT CARE about you as an employee. If you are good at sales and know every single thing about all of the products the job will be easy. The thing is, they will not teach you how to be good at sales and you have to already know everything about the products. The managers and the company itself is not worried about the customers or the employees they're only worried about making money and if you think they actually care about you, that's just another way they show how they're good at sales. They're selling themselves to you to make you think they care. Worst company ever."
bad,The only enjoyment with the job is decent coworkers. Management is terrible. Hours are terrible. Haven’t gotten free samples like promised in 4 months.
bad,"This job was one of the most horrific experiences of my life. Manager was selfish and childish, she only cared about herself. I received no training and was looked down at when I had to ask a question. Push you to make sales to the point where customers get mad at you. I was scolded for not selling enough product when I worked a 3 hour shift and half of the shift I was told to clean. My schedule would be posted 2 weeks in advance but would change last minute without warning. I have never seen a manager less professional in my life. Forget calling out if you're sick they will basically punish you for the next three weeks. I would never ever tell someone to work there."
bad,Very messy gossip job the manager started problems with two co workers because she didn't want them to be close started a lot of drama called me out of my name and the district manager didn't even do anything but if with right team can be EXCELLENT part time job for students or parents
bad,"When I 1st started it was a great company to work for slowly as time went by their focus on raising prices and pushing products just became more and more in the end it was a horrible place to work stressful understaffed with no support from upper management"
bad,"Sally’s has a huge lack of proper management, you will be overworked and scrutinized by higher ups, very demanding you will have no social life and be stressed out trying to pick up the loose ends created by the poor management and unorganizedness. Hours are NOT flexible there is little staff so you won’t have much room for an emergency If you need to call out. Higher ups are very insensitive of personal issues as well."
bad,"Before lay offs were announced, there was a lot of tension.  Even management was unsure about what was happening so they could not tell any of us.  It was difficult to focus."
bad,Fast paced environment with costant movement. Never a full moment. Assist numerous customers and will learn multi tasking skills. Will learn skills to help perform better sales and stay motivated
bad,"i did everything and had all the management rights, keys,overrides, not the title nor the pay they gave me 34 hours so they did not have to make me full time. i got fired for comming in late to cover my boss shift that she called off"
bad,"Sally's doesn't care much about the employees."
bad,Sally Beauty is such a fun place to work but after a while one of the managers became beyond unprofessional and it took a toll on a lot of the employees. The manager started bringing her personal life to work in which she would take it out on her employees depending on her mood.
bad,Working with customers was great. I loved helping people find what they want and help them with beauty solutions. how ever the management was horrible.
bad,"It is so fun to sell and work with beauty products. But the corporation itself is very cheap. They don't take care of their employees. No break room. No decent drinking water. No where to go and sit during a break. Not enough tools to make the tasks of a retail shop more comfortable. They don't pay well for the amount of product knowledge and education we would dispense to clients. I am a licensed cosmetologist, and I worked at Sally's between jobs at a salon. I handled the customer consultations, helping them understand and choose products, walking them through difficult dilemmas, yet I got paid minimum wage along with the inexperienced 18 year olds that just started working there. There should be a seniority program in which pay is increased based on knowledge and  the ability to provide customer education.  We were pushed to reach certain ratios within the week. These ratios are cold numbers and don't take into account the store's demographics and the shift of the employee. If you have evening and weekend shifts, of course your numbers will be better. Morning shifts are much slower. Not that it mattered. You could bust your butt to get your numbers up, but when you did there was no tangible reward or benefit. Again, it could be a fun job, if the corporation invested more in the comfort and welfare of their employees."
bad,"The company is moving in a new direction fairly quickly. I believe this is good for the company, however, they are not being realistic in their time frame of when store managers should have all of these new processes learned and in place. They push for  your to constantly train and coach your team to make them better, but when you ask to be retrained on something you are told no, read it in the iPad. As a manager you are left in the store by yourself for hours at a time but are not allowed to lock the door to use the restroom. They expect you to constantly write your Beauty Advisors up for little things. I believe this causes some what of a hostile work environment between the store manager and beauty advisors. That results in constant job abandonment and having to hire and train new people all of the time. Most store managers are responsible for running the store entirely by themselves because they aren't given enough payroll to have an assistant manager to share tasks with."
bad,Want you to work on registers not assigned to you. Inappropriate remarks to employees in front of customers or otherwise. Not teaching employees needed skills to perform job appropriately. Misrepresentation of employees.
bad,"There can be good managers- depending on where you go and they can help you move up in management. But overall, working there is a dead end job. The only things that are excellent while working there is that you can learn outstanding customer service, how to stock and put out shipments in a timely and efficient manner. I hated the way customer service NEVER has the employees' backs. Customers get away with EVERYTHING. Great job to start out with if you've never worked a day in your life but no career opportunities there unless you happen to be under an excellent store leader that enjoys seeing their employees go places."
bad,This company was a really good company till they got new owners. The expectations of this company are ridiculous. The dress code is outrageous. Your on your feet all day and they don't allow walking shoes. They pay and hours are not worth it.
bad,Once was a wonderful place to work until they went public.  They have lost sight of who their customer is.  Too many management people not familiar with the professional beauty industry have come in and gotten rid of the people who knew the business.  Stock has tanked as a result.
bad,"It's a good place to work like if your retired already or a student or just need a little extra income. "
bad,"At first, this job was great. I love beauty products and know products in the store like no ones business, but the expected work does NOT match up even close to the pay you're given. Management does pretty much whatever they want with no repercussions. We are frequently understaffed and so the work load is pushed onto everyone BUT the manager. We're forced to sell unnecessary products to customers and essentially do things that should be considered working for commission without being paid for commission. Raises are measly and hardly given. There's 0 room to move up in this company and anyone who has a desire to do so is nuts anyways. We have numbers that are to be kept in line every month and are threatened with write ups if we aren't in line with the company's goals. Ive dealt with ""know it alls"", racists, snotty professionals and tons of petty thieves. I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,The job its self was easy. poor pay and poor management. You get a free product every month. small store has good security. By alot of other convenient store.
bad,I worked at Sallys for 2 years. My manager never wanted to get an assistant manager to help out which was just chaos for us. Really snobby DM and TM. Id never go back!
bad,Depending on your location and manger you'll either love it or hate it here. customers are rude and think associates are idiots. Don't get stuck in this dead end company.
bad,I worked at the easton sallys and i do not recommend you apply there. There is a reason they are always short staffed and cant keep anyone. In the last 6 months at least 5 girls quit me included. The reason i had to leave was because i was treated badly by the other co workers. The girls there are not nice and management does nothing about it. My manager says things behind peoples back and just does and says things a manager shouldnt do. I had two of the girls attack me with horrible messages and the manager yet again didnt do anything. The only good thing about this place is that you are always busy. Other than that the pay is not worth the drama you go through working there.
bad,"When I had a pregnancy, at 8 months my manager still made me do shipment although it was not required of me knowing I had an at-risk pregnancy. They had me making Full- time hours but not placed as a full time employee so I could not reap any of the benefits. After making my quotas and selling high in the store I had asked for a transfer to somewhere closer to my fiancé once I deliver the baby and was denied."
bad,"I like working here, it isn't too bad, the only thing I don't agree with is the money. The money is good at all. Otherwise, a decent place to work."
bad,"People is nicest part of working at Sally. They are working on changing the culture of the business as they still have a very strong ""blame culture"" ingrained to the core that starts from very high management and it escalates down to everyone else."
bad,"Good discount is the only good thing. Pay is bad, only get 10 minute breaks, bad management, makes you sale bad shampoo to customers. If you dont, you dont get a good raise. Use to love it but boss is just rude and harrassful. (not all are like this)"
bad,Working with people that don't want to work was hard on those that did work. District managers the two I seen in the 9 months I worked there totally unprofessional.
bad,"I've worked here for a little over a month, I am always  on time and I only had to call out sick for a day...I was screamed at over the phone for a good 10 minutes by my manager because I was sick. She is extremely inappropriate and talks about things that shouldn't be discussed at work."
bad,The management was terrible. I found it very hard to have a personal life as just part timer working full time hours and if you had something to do out side of work it wasn't their job to care.
bad,"Loved my daily work, employees and store.  The company expects 47 1/2 hrs a week from the managers.  They have no security in place to protect the employees. Employees are expected to spend many hours alone in the stores. Upper management are not truthful and were not willing to help. They are very distrusting of employees! Employees are not allowed to confront theft but are disciplined with more hours when theft is high.  Many day were spent in the store from open to close since sales were not where they wanted them to be and mid day would become mandatory that the manager be there to increase sales.  Managers were also expected to buy things from their store in order to make quota goals and other company set goals."
bad,I learned a lot about beauty supply when I was working there. I cant say that it was bad and I cant say that it was the perfect job for me either. I enjoyed my time spent at this job. Just need something more producible.
bad,"Its a starter job"
bad,Great place to obtain a side-job. Not a great place for career advancements.
bad,"I gave this job my all, I was promised a management position if I quit my second job.  I quit my second job went full time with Sally's and needless to say I never got the management position, instead I was forced out.  Therefore, loosing my job."
bad,"My typical day at Sally Beauty included dealing with theft on a nearly daily basis and either an absent manager or co-workers that I'd have to cover for. Our machines were out dated and we had to type everything in by hand rather than using a scanner. All I learned, I learned from customers who knew more about the products than the people selling them."
bad,"While I LOVED the work itself, I did not love the management."
bad,"Typical day would involve assisting customer find the perfect skin or hair product,and stock merchandise."
bad,"As a Key Holder my job consist of opening and closing of store. You complete daily paper, as well as large cash handling and depositing."
bad,"Rude management, non flexible schedule. Very picky company. Everything you do isn’t the right way. The job was great at first but slowly got worse and worse"
bad,"This job is a joke! They can't keep a manager and when they do get a manager they are very unprofessional. They talk about the other employees, they don't appreciate anything you do! My job title was beauty advisor. However they had me doing management work at $10 an hour. I finally quit, I'm a licensed cosmetologist and I was an asset at that company but like I said very unappreciated"
bad,Really only care about sales so you have to know how to sale to customers. Manager let’s employees get away with everything so you have to work twice as hard to get something done. So the pay is NOT worth it. Hours are okay if you go to school and they can somewhat work with you.
bad,"If you're placed in a good district, you may not experience the same issues that I did. You work 45 hours a week and are not allowed to have weekends off. It took me 4 years of working my way up the company to have a job that I felt miserable in. There was not enough time in the day to get things done, even with being there 9.5-10 hours a day. I was not given support when it came to hiring employees. My district manager was an absolute witch. She could be seen as successful in a bird's eye view, but only because people were TERRIFIED of her unprofessional outbursts"
bad,Management is poor supervisors move as if they were drones with no true understanding of there job purpose they are led by a directed director who is bipolar  tyran with Holger like attitude
bad,I worked at Sally’s for two years under 3 different district managers. The district managers don’t stay around long and I think it’s because the lack of sales and difficulty keeping up with the competition. Sally’s is still stuck in the 80s and they have just begun transforming certain stores to match the current trends. Store managers aren’t very enthusiastic about running the stores because compensation is so low considering other stores pay their managers way more. Also beware of favoritism or discrimination of some sort because Sally’s is more willing to hire someone off the street than a dedicated employee that has been there for years. You’d think it’d be easier to promote from within rather than hire a random. There’s no loyalty in this company and forget about compensation and growth. Find better.
bad,"If your looking for a job where your hours are repetitive weekly this is NOT the job for you. One week you may get 23 hours a week the next week 8 hours. I found this place also like to favour certain employees and if you didn't go to there after hour get togethers and parties you weren't on the favorite people list. I worked there for 8 months and twice (that I had noticed) I was shorted a days pay of my cheque..likely plenty more but I didn't notice..The girls where the most cut throat, fake, drama starters which made going to work very uncomfortable...Management also like to talk down about other employees to you and the other girls..Very unprofessional!!! This was probably one of the worst experiences I have worked for. I would NOT recommend this job to anyone. No one can feed a family or pay bills on 8 hours a week!! A huge let down."
bad,"District managers only care about sales and not your safety even after requesting more hours for the store you will be left alone a lot of times, coworkers are amazing."
bad,"I worked there for about 6 months and saw 9 people leave, (10 including myself) and there was never a manager who stayed longer than a couple weeks. Mind you that this is with a very small team in the first place, they only had 5 or 6 staff members working at my store at a time. This meant calling in sick just was not tolerated. If you even breathed in that store or forgot to face one shampoo bottle at the end of the night everyone would be gossiping and creating narratives about it the next day. The amount of gossip there was unbearably annoying and it really sucks because the job itself is actually super easy and fun. Talking to customers there was enjoyable and the store never got too busy so you could focus on proving customers with good service, it was rewarding in that sense."
bad,Working conditions are horrible . Infested with rats and roaches. If you call maintenance to come fix something they’ll come right out but never come back to actually fix anything .
bad,"Its ok for a part time job, theres minimal hrs, no room for advancement, a manager who doesnt know how to manage. Raises are a joke. No I would not recommend this job to a friend."
bad,"I worked at Sally's for a total of 5 months and it was good at first but then I came to realize that it wasn't what it was cut out to be, there are no cameras so customers would steal all the time yet my boss would get mad at us if we did confront the robber but that wasn't in my job description, then towards the end of my time with Sally's I injured my ankle severely at home and was unable to work due to being on crutches and unable to walk. Mind you I had doctors notes/ hospital papers proving my injury, I kept in contact with my boss and she was upset that I could come in but I kept telling her I still couldn't walk she then ignored my texts and calls, so a few days letter I call one of my co-workers and she said my job was taken. I wasn't so mad because I was already looking for new jobs because of the drama and pay but I was upset about how unprofessional and childish she acted."
bad,"I was hired for a store close to my house,  they relocated me to a store 30mins away, I specifically told them during my interview I was not intrested in the store that was that far away because I couldn't drive in snow."
bad,"I’ve been with the company for almost a year now. I was promised a raise at 6 months when I was hired, I just received my raise at 11 months and it made no difference. They change rules and policy very often, nothing stays the same and it seems they can’t make up their mind about ANYTHING here at this company. I’ll be honest and say I feel they don’t care much about employees. I’d absolutely LOVE the job if it was fair. But it most certainly isn’t. This job has taught me a lot of product knowledge and how to better serve customers, but I feel it’s all just for the company’s benefit."
bad,"It was fun for a while but they didnt have any opportunity for growth in the company."
bad,"In all honesty, if you plan on being a cosmetologist in the future; YES APPLY... if you're looking to build some knowledge on hair products. It's a good job to start off IF you are hoping to learn HOW TO approach and counsel clients in the future when you are a cosmetologist."
bad,"The culture of this company......not impressive.  Can't offer any positive comments.  The hardest part is to watch management sit all day while you unload the truck, answer the customers questions and then tender their sale."
bad,"I worked for Sally’s for 6 months and was poorly trained , general manager did not communicate with me at all . When I called I always had to speak to another store manager because she had no idea . I was under staffed and they would not help me but did not want me to be at the store more then what I was suppose to be . I got in troubled for a store that NEEDED soooooo much work but they never bothered to actually send me workers . And when they did they sent me a lot of lazy people besides one manager that would try to help me turn the store around . I would not work here again . Then suspended me and decided not to call me letting me know I was terminated I had to call HR to find out . Mind you I’m 21 with a child . I’ve told the general manager if I’m terminated I need to know because I have a child to take care of so I can help myself out . Wanted me to do so much for little time and pay .  My stay there for 6 months was very disappointing and I hope my new job can make things sooo much better . She also denied my pink slip for unemployment. But hey atleast you can wear different colors in your hair  overall I met some really great women that are amazing at there jobs .."
bad,"Many much needed changes, Upper field management in my area were not competent  and did not hold everyone to the same standards. Payroll hours have been cut 3 times in the last 2 years, leaving people to work and close alone to be in compliance."
bad,Dont pay enough to have good employees turn over rate is high upper management sucks  employees are not reliable as a manager you are working mandatory working 45 hours plus when someone doesnt show up you have to cover all other hours they do not have paid maturity leave they are not a family company it's all about cooperate they dont encourage you when you do good they only belittle you when you do bad.
bad,"This company no longer appreciate its people. I was honest and loyal to them for 7 years because It used to be a pleasant place to work even tho the pay was pretty low. I made lifelong friends and even cancelled 70% of my family vacations in those years due to my loyalty to my team and company."
bad,"It is not a good company to move up in they don't reward you for years worked. Management is not on top of reviews, raises, paperwork or changing status on employees. Management doesn't work nights or Sundays."
bad,The job is extremely boring and you are stuck in a tiny store without anywhere to go. The break room and office are tiny and are basically a storage room. The girls that work there are also extremely rude.
bad,"A typical day would include me opening up the store, turning the alarm off and counting the draws and making sure the paperwork from the night before was correct. After insuring all finances are complete and balanced I make sure the store is clean and well kept. I learned more about hair color and different hair products that work on different ethnicity's. Their wasn't anything to hard about this job. The most enjoyable part would be the relationship grown overtime with customers and samples we got as well."
bad,I really enjoy working there but there were days that I didn't want to go in cause I didn't get the hours and the pay were not good  you can't live off that but I love being there to help the peoples and to tell them about the products there were nothing hard about the job the work place were too small felt cramp not enough room for the peoples and the staff to moved around in there without bumping into someone.
bad,"Ton of benefits, but way to much drama! I have been with sallys for two years and I am always walked over and taken advantage of. To much turn over as well."
bad,There is a lot of drama within this company and it tends to have issues. I would not recommend many people to work at Sally's. The whole cooperation just has a lot of problems.
bad,"I open my store.Greet customers and help them find what products their looking for or help them find what products could work for them."
bad,"Sally was one of those jobs to get me by for the summer. It wasnt crazy busy because the people I worked with were fun. However, when we got a new manager, everything went downhill."
bad,"typical work day includes a ""duty sheet"" of things that must be accomplished within a shift while the manager stays in the back room to get ""important stuff done"". But the Girlfriend In The Know is the most important part of your job. As soon as a customer walks in the door, we have approx. 30 seconds to physically greet them, ask them why they came in, walk them to the product, and stay by their side the entire time they're in the store. It makes no time to get the ""duties"" done, which leads to write ups, being scolded, and a whole lot of unnecessary stress."
bad,Demasiado trabajo y carga excesiva gerentes prepotentes y despotas
bad,"A PR campaign directed at the workers, and the store management, and the shareholders.  Software development is amateur hour, and the operations side of IT pays the price.  "
bad,why doesnt sallys hire from within? your lead sales should at least get an interview. instead we were left w no management for over 6 months. no management to see no shananigans by employees.
bad,"I understand that customers are difficult sometimes, however I was being harassed by customers on a daily basis, coworkers have been physically assaulted by shoplifters in the store. I would daily wake up to angry texts from my manager directed to everyone about just anything she found to complain about, even if I hadn't been working the day before which fueled negativity in the workplace. A very inappropriate coworker would frequently use racist and homophobic slurs."
bad,"Some days are better than others. Management could use work, more training or making sure managers are skilled for their positions. Upper management needs to understand they are not the ones working in the store and they need to allow store workers to manage things to the best of their knowledge"
bad,"Working at Sally's is a pretty laid back job in itself, but other factors such as lazy co-workers and bad management make it unbearable to work for long term."
bad,"The last two months I was employed there was no store manager and the District manager went on vacation. When the position became available, those of us already employed, attempted to apply and were quickly told no to bother. By the time I left, there were only two other employees remained."
bad,"upper management (dm) is a psychopath - will cut your hours, make false accusations, play favourites, and try to run you out of the store. the job it self is good, customers are friendly, girls you work with are (usually) friendly, good quality products, but as far as upper management goes, you will hate your life."
bad,"The floor-level management is usually pretty good, but the district manager is a sociopath.  She is unpredictable and manipulative, including turning team members against each other to ""spy"" on one another and report back to her, regardless of the efforts of the managers to keep their teams whole.  Scheduling with people who aren't invested in their jobs, due to the over-all corporate culture, is often frustrating, and there seems to be a lot of slack customer service with many of the sales people."
bad,"Not the best management,! sechdule was changing all the time and not posted on time. A lot of pressure to sell warranties and items of month!"
bad,Do not agree with the way my store is ran for the most part. Sally's could make a lot more money if some things were changed when it comes to the running of the stores.
bad,"coworkers are mean"
bad,very unprofessional place to work seems like a fun and easy job until you actually start working there  its seriously hel on earth in every way imaginable except the pay at least for the sallys on rose and gonzales in oxnard ca
bad,"I really enjoyed working at sally beauty supply, working with product and getting to know more information about hair,skin and nails. The management sucked, horrible employee relationships. Lots of drama within one store of 5-8 employees also depending on the mood they came in with. Hardest part was honestly working with dramafilled co workers and i would say the best part is again is overall beauty knowledge."
bad,I got experience working with others and helping customers. The DM of the store did a poor job of running the stores. The hardest part of the job was working on some of the displays. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with kind and hard working employees.
bad,A typical day as store manager meant checking paperwork from previous day ensuring all done properly and do banking. Sales and customer service as well as calling on salons. I learned a lot about hair care and color as well as skin and nails and much more. Management wasn't around to help too much so it was my store.  My co-workers were mostly young people so that was interesting and challenging at the same time. The hardest part of the job was the long hours when short handed I worked every day. The best part of the job was helping customers.
bad,it was a really fun job and I got a lot of free products and could buy stuff with the points I got from selling products of the month. management unprofessional and childish. my wallet and phone got stolen when I was on the floor alone while the manager & DM was in backroom and they didn't close back door and they didn't care or do anything about it. would make me work full time hours and I was there for almost 2 years and they never put me as full time employee so I wouldn't get no benefits. employees are very rude & childish to customers & each other.
bad,"Daily duties include: Customer service, retail sales, explaining products to customers (how to do their own hair color etc), answering phones, stocking shelves, put away shipment, inventory. "
bad,"Loved the people I worked with on a daily basis but did not enjoy management and their unavailability to staff.  "
bad,"- Clock in for work"
bad,"If you want to be treated like a child, belittled, and see what segregation was like, this is the place for you. From day one, I was shunned away by other employees (and yes, even the manager and DM) because of the color of my skin. I was talked to like a child, and treated with zero respect."
bad,"The work there in general is fairly easy. My work day mostly consist of providing great customer service, maintaining the upkeep and appearance of the store, back-stocking merchandise and some minor cleaning duties. I like helping the customers and informing them on different products and such. I wasn't very well trained at all, my manager mostly made me watch videos, very little hands -on training. I often had to ask my coworkers questions in order to learn most of what I know. My manager isn't a good one at all. She's very condescending, non-supportive and treats some employees like garbage. She often abuses the power she has with her job title. I rarely see her actually do any real work. Most of the time she's on her phone and she makes my coworkers (myself included) perform tasks that are in her job description and not that of inside sales. She also doesn't divide the hours for our work schedules fairly at all. My coworkers are all very nice and I enjoy working with them. The hardest part of my job is trying to deal with my manager. I've tried talking to her, as well as reaching out to her bosses, but nothing has really changed. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers and working together with my coworkers."
bad,Sally beauty was not very professional they had no cameras so some women would take things that were suppose to be taken off the shelves and sent back to the cooperate office . Women weren’t friendly to work with .
bad,"Working at Sally Beauty you have to know the products. These customers will put you on blast if you aren't sure what it is you're selling or if it sounds like you don't. Workload is tolerable, not much heavy lifting or assignments."
bad,"Easy job to work at. Very little hours in the beginning, to nights and weekends every week. Manager wasn't fair to rotating employees schedules so that 1 employee can have 1 weekend off, but no I worked evenings weekends the whole time I worked there. Manager was good the 1st time I asked for a couple days off, but the rest were not. I would purposely ask for 2 days off, and she would only give me 1, until I had to bring it to her attention. There"
bad,"District manager had very poor communication skills, would be sweet as pie one minute then very disrespectful the next. Often spoke out both sides of her mouth contradicting herself. Felt very unappreciated. The pay is a lower side for all that's expected of you and your associates. Other then her poor management skills I loved sally's beauty it's a great opportunity to build a great team and learn about a business. Merchandising is also fun. You will be responsible for inventory and controlling shrink.  If you are not the type to let your boss get to you I would recommend giving Sally's a shot."
bad,The managers lie and favor employees. They help as little as possible and then decide to cut your hours if you do something they don't like. They never acknowledged when you worked hard. Felt like a piece of garbage. Not worth the mental toll.
bad,"Retail.Beauty retail.Bottom line. Expendable.That says it all. That's Sally Beauty now & it's a shame. Long term meant nothing, rebranding and tech investment & new store openings took over,while re-districting & upper level lay offs constricted the life line of the industry- the employees period."
bad,"I was the Store Manager and it was a very stressful role because there was so much work for the SM to do. Everyday tasks include customer interaction all day, being on your feet with no possible break, repainting stores, working overtime, required weekends, and covering shifts by myself which would be from 8am-8pm on some days. The position is good if you have a great, hardworking team and motivated employees. If not, then it is hard to succeed and to stay positive. The upper management was not very caring or involved unless they were ready to write you up because you are unable to work shifts for your employees (because you have your own life as well). I wouldn't recommend this position to anyone unless you are looking for a career that pays at least $30,000/yr and you want to build experience in management."
bad,"Sally used to be a great company to work for but the last 3 years with upper management constantly changing and no one knowing exactly what their job is the quality of supervision has gone down. Now they are out to protect their own behinds and often throw the workers under the bus in doing so. The hardest part of the job is not speaking up for fear of losing your job, so employees just go with the flow. The most enjoyable part of the day is going home. Sally used to offer full time hrs with great benefits, now very few stores have any full time positions , so most people only get to work 14-19 hours."
bad,"They're currently coming after people for having second jobs, school, anything outside of Sally's. They want ""full availability"" from everyone but refuse to actually give full-time hours. So when you go get a second job to compensate the hours you aren't getting, they cut your hours even more. Great place to work if you don't have anything to pay for."
bad,Company is disorganized with racism problem within hierarchy. District manager is scatterbrained and biased. Company has lack of concern for employee safety unless voiced by Caucasian team members.
bad,"But then you realize how unprofessional the people/workers are. And I’m talking EVERYONE. Just a place for tons of cattyness. If you’re into that, than this is the job for you."
bad,"I worked at sally beauty for over a year and I have nothing but negatives to say. I was in training to be the assistant manager but all the drama and fighting between the employees working there was too much to handle, not worth it for how little they pay you. I had to take over for the manager as she just walked out cause she couldn’t handle it and I wasn’t technically the assistant yet. The girls kept quitting due to it not being a good work environment . Plus you are penalized and can be fired if you don’t make your high sale quota"
bad,"The company doesn't care about employee safety at all. There have been workers held at gun point and tied to chairs and the managers don't care and say that we're making too big of a deal about it. They also want employees to trick customers into signing up for their bogus reward card. When concerns were expressed to manager, she said it's not technically illegal so do it or hours get cut"
bad,"Working at Sally's started off good. You get a decent employee discount, and they were flexible with my school schedule. However, they care way too much about your sales. You're expected to have a certain average sale each day, and for the month, and if you don't meet these numbers, they they threaten to cut your hours. If you do meet the numbers nothing really happens except someone might tell you good job. No reward or incentive or commission for meeting or exceeding sales. Upper-management is always complaining about something that needs to be done differently, yet they hardly ever come in to the stores or interact with lower level employees. Almost no room for growth within the company unless someone retires or leaves. Corporate would prefer that mangers hire more people than give current employees extra hours (probably so they don't have to offer benefits). All jobs at the store are part time unless you are the manager. Don't expect to get much more than 20 hours a week, and paid minimum wage. Also each store is likely to be run differently because managers like to make up their own rules, so this is just my experience mainly. On top of sales you're expected to reorganize the displays almost constantly. They give you a hard time if they aren't done on time, and if you aren't trying to up-sell everyone while also reorganizing the entire store then just expect to get chewed out. It feels like you're always doing something wrong, and that management will never be satisfied. I've also been asked to come in to my opening shifts early and work without pay until I ""learn how to"
bad,This company requires that all manager work at least 45 hrs a week. I enjoyed being able to help people with any hair/beauty needs. Working under the district manager I had was incredibly stressful with constant criticism of tasks I wasn't properly trained for.
bad,Conoces mucha gente. Y si tus compañeras de trabajo te caen bien el trabajo es menos pesado. La capacitación es buena. PERO las metas son imposibles de alcanzar y casi nunca recibes bonos.
bad,"Worked for the company for 10 years. Very little chance for advancement unless someone is fired, retires, or quits. A ""pick me"" culture. The environment is very catty and nitpicky no matter what location you're in. Outside of the customers and free items (you're product Guinea pigs) it very stressful. They control your life through your schedule and make it hard to even use vacation/PTO without having to be aggressively adamant about it being utilized. If you just want a pt job or extra income, then it works. If you're  looking for full time, don't bother."
bad,"Unrealistic sales pressure, without commission? Upper management does not care about employees and considers everyone easily replaceable. If you enjoy stress this one is for you."
bad,"I did like working at Sally because I knew about the products from having a career in this field. I enjoyed helping people find what they needed. I would help to restock when not busy and did not have stand around time, which made me keep busy and not become a boring job."
bad,great customers and co workers. You are underpaid. They allow you extra hours only when it helps out the manager. They no longer hire full time/ part time only.
bad,"Tuve la mala suerte que me tocó una sucursal donde no había personal, solo eran 2 o a lo mucho 3 chicas en el turno, incluso había ocasiones en las que te dejaban totalmente sola, tenías que hacer todo, limpiar, atender y cobrar y si te llegaba a faltar producto te lo descuentan a pesar de que sabian que solo hay una persona atendiendo para toda una tienda y a las supervisoras no les importa."
bad,"Really enjoy working for the company and for the interactions I get to have on a daily basis with all different types of people, including the rude customers because the good always outweighs the bad.  Don’t really care for the free products. You do not get ANY basic benefits/insurance as a part time employee (which is terrible considering one store is able to make $2000-$8000 thousand selling small product in a single day?). The raise is very little and only happens once a year 6 months from your date of employment and it’s only a 5-10 cent raise. The employees are the reason the company is making money AT ALL. As they tell you in training to “keep the customer coming back for more.” Give a little more recognition and praise to the people who make the brand what it is. They are the reason that the company is even thriving. Money hungry, cut hours, no benefits, very inflexible scheduling. Difficult to even get a day or two off due to low amount of employees because the company is cheap and doesn’t want to pay employees.  The management is terrible, nothing is organized, poor communication and constantly gossiping about customers and even THEIR OWN employees. I guaranteed sound like a person that absolutely HATED their job but all in all, loved working in the environment but Sally’s Beauty as a whole, is a no from me. 2 whole stars for the work environment! There are better jobs out there with better opportunity and praise for you. "
bad,"Typical day of work included logging on register used. Customer service advocate for customer looking for products or advisement. Keeping store clean, stocking shelves, product training, and computing sales input at the end of the day. I was scheduled for back surgery so the hardest part of the job was that I was required to maintain store appearance."
bad,I loved my job. Best job i ever had. Until i was unable to come in on time one day they told me to bring in my keys and that i was being fired but then said i quit. The district manager is crooked.
bad,I started with this company as a part-time cashier within a month I was at 40 hour assistant manager 3 months later I had my own store I did nothing but excel in this company I turned High shrink and low cell stores into the opposite I I excelled in all my numbers expected I went to trip every year I start at the lowest volume store within six months I was at the 3rd to the highest then on to open a new store which flopped and lost money then I went on to the million dollar store and turn it into two million where I was turned down for an advancement in a company only to train an outsider for the role I had some things come up in life and I was basically torn between raising my son of my own or staying in my position when I decided to take my time off I was not given my short-term disability not giving my pay and everything I paid into I didn't get back and shortly after this I was severely bad mouth by the company after being blocked by my manager for the position I wanted I love this job and it sells like no other but I was blocked and talked about when all I did was dedicate my life to this job for 6 years I was if I was at home I was on the phone at work I worked on my days off I went out of town I did everything
bad,"I was comfortable working for Sally Beauty Supply, and I did learn a lot! My manager did cut my hours once I got serious health problems and cut hours."
bad,"Really nothing to say. I have only been here for a year now but can say it's one of the more stressful jobs in retail I have ever had. Barely have a voice. Company policies change quickly, was hired as an Assistant Manager, only to have my title, pay, and hours taken away for absolutely no reason at all after 9 months. ""New president, company trying to save money"". Absolutely no job security. Still told to act as assistant manager but have no recognition as one."
bad,"They have had massive layoffs and is rumored to have more in upcoming months, Massive job insecurity for people who are there still working. Also I hear they are stressed out and are overworked due to the layoffs."
bad,"* There are no typical days. every day is different, full of ups and downs, terrible customers and wonderful customers. "
bad,Sally Beauty doesn't care about you and the managers suck. You learn a lot about beauty products while there though. I would never work at another Sally ever.
bad,Sally is undergoing a lot of change right now. Change is never a bad thing so if you like the challenge of a changing environment then it might be a great fit for you.
bad,"The turn over is so high, you can't be in a state of comfort. The culture change is annual. The over all infrastructure is antiquated. Needs a major overhaul."
bad,Watch the area you work and knowledge of security that is around. Customer will blame you even if you told them not to color their hair that way or that color.  Some managers and staff have already got a bond going and new employees aren't wanted or welcomed.
bad,hated how they took advantage of their employees at one point i worked without a manager for the store for 6 months and was basically running the place but not getting the benefits.
bad,It's a fun work place to work at but management and support are minimal and training for your role is also minimal. So you spend a lot of time confused and inconsistent.
bad,"My experience at Sally Beauty was situational, due to poor management and relocation. Must know all products, customers are very difficult to handle regularly."
bad,"the most I enjoyed about this job was interacting with the customer."
bad,"good job in concept but the management is horrible. My manager played favorites, talked bad about me and other co-workers to her favorite employee. The manager at the Bluffton location would turn on her employees and make the rest of the associates turn on them too. I was not the first employee this happened to. I was hired as a full time associate, and she cut down my hours to 20 a week after hiring someone new. When a manager from a different store saw this, they investigated and told her to give me more hours, so she decided to be rude and unprofessional to me every chance she got. The work itself is enjoyable, the customers and products are fun to work with, but I have never been treated so poorly by a manager. She also participated in drug use with another employee."
bad,I made some great connections with customers they were always so nice. What drove me away was the fact that my own manger had been lying to me not only her but also the district of the company. I didn’t learn a ton there most of it I already knew about the products they sold. We also had something to do so there was never any excuse as to why we weren’t working and just sitting around.
bad,Even though the manager worked very hard the work load was very difficult  for employees. A few employees did not want to carry their own load which caused othera to work harder.
bad,"Very boring nobody help you, I had to work late and  was never able to spend time with my family I worked every weekend there were no kind of I incentives for anything. Also the other employees didn't work at all so I was stuck doing everything when it was something to do"
bad,"There was a recent corporate restructuring and the company is still in chaos. Not only will you deal with unrealistic goals and expectations, but also you will be expected to work off the clock and use your own money for meetings and projects. There is extreme confusion between upper and middle management and policies change at the drop of a hat. They claim they want to invest in their employees but they only let you hire at 15 hours a week and laugh at you if you suggest someone is capable of excelling."
bad,"si le caes bien al personal gerencial te dan muchas maneras de sobresalir, siempre y cuando las ideas que des se las acredites a la gerente regional, nunca serán tus ideas ni te daran credito por ellas."
bad,"Company tends to have associates do management work for entry level sales associate pay.  Long process to get a raise. Most managers tend to feel they can show up and leave when they feel, leaving all of the work to the associate's. Forced to sell over priced products that most are unwanted by the customers (IOM's). Most stores have 6-7 employees, if lucky due to the fact that almost everyone quits and they are expected to do a complete store turn around almost every month."
bad,"I enjoyed my career at Sally. The work is very fast paced and the industry is super fun. I learned a lot about P&L management.The workplace culture and corporate level management turnover made it very challenging. I worked with wicked, amazing people for which I am forever grateful."
bad,The management there is terrible. They overload you with work to get done with no help to do it and no store hours to give away to get help with anything. The only good part about it is that you occasionally get some free product at the beginning of almost every month.
bad,Working there was okay. My manager created a very stressful environment. She didn't like technology so we weren't allowed to use calculators for counting the drawers. She was rude and unpleasant to be around.
bad,"This job requires a lot more than your average retail job. Sally's expects you to be able to walk people through hair coloring, bleaching, perming, curling, etc. You basically have to teach yourself all these things. You have to almost have the knowledge of a professional because you're expected to give people advice. Aside from that the technology used here is pretty outdated and the register constantly freezes in the middle of transactions.The stores are constantly short staffed. Associates know that even on their day off they could get called in after working 7 days in a row. The compensation is on the low end, no commission. The higher ups are always on the associates to make all these impossible goals.  Overall I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,"Repetive job, no room for moving up or getting a higher placement for the company. Most workers are fun to work with, staff could be better."
bad,Great for teenagers looking for extra money or retired people for extra income. If you have limited availability and want 15 hours or less and no advancement may be a good match for you.
bad,I love helping customers and giving them advises and give them the heads up of the new trends their is. The only think i dislike from this job is the location the store was located it is the worst. The cameras from the store don't work. The securities they had on the building  are older man securities and they weren't always their. I learned to have a lot patience with some customers who had a bad day and would like to take it over me and my co -workers.
bad,"The company will work you to death without appreciating what you do for them. If you get a raise of 20 cents, you are lucky! Bad management, no organization, no proper training. Overall, very bad experience."
bad,"I worked here for 5 years without advancement. I worked my butt off and only made around $1.30 more than when I started. Upper management sucks and does not care about there employees. Free stuff is nice, the flexiblity was nice but the rest of it sucked."
bad,little training. tons of duties that are not explained well enough or are always changing. worked for company 8 years. no assistance from upper management ever. no positive feedback from employers.
bad,this job was pretty dull and boring most of the time.management was pretty nice but my co workers werent to friendly or nice.
bad,"*productive"
bad,"typical day at work helping customers, stocking. I learned cashiering, stocking, opening and closing of a business. My co-workers were great. My hardest part of job was it was quite slow not enough work. My most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and interacting with people"
bad,Managment was horrible and I was not trained properly for my posotion but i learned as I went.
bad,"Enjoyed the job itself but had very poor management, no room for advancement, constant changes in the schedule and unstable hours, no vacation time"
bad,"great for a high school kid, but unfortunately you have to be 18+ to work here. Local supermarkets pay more than this employer and don't do half the work sally's employees do. Horrible pay/ bad district managers."
bad,You have all this responsibility with being paid minimum wage pay. All this company cares about is saving money and it doesn't matter if you need to work all day by yourself as long as an employee does not get paid overtime. Sally's as a very high number of overturn because no one lasts a long time at this job. Mangers get away with a lot of shady things and treating employees horribly as long as the store selling good. The low number of staff make it even more miserable because when someone calls in sick its impossible for someone to get a normal day off. Nearly impossible for someone to take a vacation and you to have a day off when they do. Not a good place to work.
bad,• Inventory/ Stock
bad,Typical day at work include unproductive meeting and urgent project assigned on a daily basis with unrealistic deadlines.  Under new management that doesn't have a clue what they are doing.
bad,This place has really changed its not the same place you would want to work at anymore all they care about is the stats n not their employees. It was a great place.
bad,"Por meter a gente recomendada en puestos gerenciales las sucursales no funcionan bien, no hay capacitacion y las gerentes regionales y distritales no ayudan ni apoyan."
bad,"Working here is nice if you are all about  customer service, there were never enough of available hours so that you can make a decent paycheck. This is the type of job to have as a part-time on the side job or if you're only looking to work 10 extra hours per week. Love the products, management is not good, dead end job really no room for advancement."
bad,"Es una buena empresa, con buenas prestaciones lo malo es el personal que tienen a cargo en algunas de las sucursales por eso la gente renuncia, a eso le agregamos el estrés porque te llenan de pendientes."
bad,"This was a great job, when I first started. 1 month in, we were robbed, our manager was stealing, HR and Loss Prevention are intimidating, making you look incompetent. Petty drama in the company. If you want to be ridiculed and accused of theft, knock yourself out! No full time employees, and less than 20 hours a week."
bad,DM’s and loss prevention try to intimidate you and make you quit. Very unprofessional environment depending on your stores location. Management has a high turn over rate as well
bad,I’ve worked with Sally Beauty for 5 months and haven’t had a manager the whole time. The DM has no clue what she is doing and blames everyone else for her mistakes but won’t hear any excuses from employees. She doesn’t know anything about the products we sell and only cares about sales. The “Great Lakes” region needs new management.
bad,"I loved my team when I was just a beauty advisor, it was pretty relaxed and I adored my manager. But, the company overall sucks. When I became a manager it was a fend for yourself type of situation. I had no proper training and the turnover rate was extremely high. I had to learn as I go. The pay was a joke even for managers and the benefits suck. I also felt like I had no time for myself or my family I was always at work.If you’re looking for just a place to work while you’re in school by all means go for it. Other than that it’s a dead end job."
bad,Management is entirely unprofessional. The environment can be very hostile. Unreasonable work hours no matter how well you work. They support favoritism & don't treat new employees well. Nor do they train properly.
bad,They don't have A/C nor Heat it is to hot in the building and on a good day it's ok Management needs more training and the hardest part is the Heat and when it's cold having
bad,This company needs to have a security guard at every location. They don't pay you enough for everything that they want done. It's all about $ & greed!
bad,"Manager was poorly trained, District Manager was little to no help what so ever. Was no order, turn over rate of employees was awful. Manager hardly worked just stood outside smoking."
bad,"expectations are high and stressful, district managers are awful and corporate does not care about their employees. if you're a store manager the job is extremely demanding and it is very hard to even enjoy a day off because you're always technically on call."
bad,you work 9-10 hours a day with no appreciation from the immediate supervisor which ride you about meeting numbers everyday lie to you on a daily basis about stopping the overtime and its been 2 years still working 50-60 hours a week. no work life balance at all its sallys or nothing
bad,They refuse to care about the health and safety of their customers I refuse to let me go home even though I was on the ground in the bathroom throwing up and my manager would push her duties off onto me and leave me alone at the store for 10 hours at a time
bad,"You are expected to hold people accountable to unreasonable metrics and expectations. The company is constantly changing and adding to your workload weekly and you're not given a chance to catch up or a reasonable time frame to get things done. When things are not done you're told to write up your team, even if they're are new and still training/learning. I was told one day that I couldn't leave the store until a particular project was done, no matter if I'm by myself and working to after midnight. And this was told to me after many of the Houston stores got broken into. I didn't feel like they cared for my safety at all! As soon as you get close to catching up and getting things in order something always happens and you're back in the hole and field management just wants you to write everyone up. The other locations maybe different but the Lufkin TX store is a fail.. They need to do better to keep good people!"
bad,Nothing else to say. Stop trying to make me come up with more to say. I answered the questions and have nothing else to say. Let me move on from this review.
bad,stock shelves and follow plan o grams. brought in inventory and put on the shelves after checking it in. cleaned store and was the closing key holder so did all the end of day closing resposibilites
bad,Sally Beauty Supply was not the greatest place to work the store manager was very unorganized. Again the hardest part of working there would be the unpredictable schedule
bad,The first two years working at sally beauty was great. I had great managers that would work with me one on one. And would make working there pleasant. After the two years sally went through major change and brought in new management with few or little experience. My guess is to save on payroll. Which in the long run effected them.
bad,Very unpleasant experience.  The company had great potential but only worked in the same archaic patterns of the past and these methods did not serve them well.
bad,"Found this company to be extremely biased, very high turn over rate in employees.  Contradictory instructions from one moment to the next, managers do no support employees and concerns."
bad,"A typical day for me at Sally Beauty is working a 10 to 12 hour shifts for the last 2 yea. s, I was doing my job as the Sales Associate, we were short handed so I was also doing Assistant Manager duties, manager duties when she was gone on vacation or days off. The Assistant management training was taken from me due to home life. Not a good way to treat loyal employees."
bad,"Local company, that is a good way to get your foot in the door with limited experience. They have multiple locations throughout the United States and abroad."
bad,its an okay place to work for very dis organized could be better. managers don't know what their doing half the time and the people don't know half the stuff.
bad,"unrealistic expectations, fast paced, high stress level to try to accomplish all that is required of your job. I enjoyed what I did and even who I worked with, just the stress was too much"
bad,"My manager was/is the best person to work for and I wish I could have taken her with me, but the company itself was terrible. From the rude distract and regional manager, to the terrible conditions they had us working in. The prices are terrible and the customers are constantly rude. The managers above my manager honestly never cared for any of us and made sure to note that on constant occasions. It is no fun working in a place where your store is so close BECAUSE you all are not liked by upper management collectively. I would never work here again and I do not recommend others working here."
bad,I would have enjoyed working at Sally Beauty Supply had the company paid their employees more for the work that was being required of us. I left the company because the cons out weighed the benefits of position advancement in the company. I realized it would not support my life even working as a manager of a Sally Beauty.
bad,"The hours were very inconsistent (because retail) but that's to be expected.  The shifts would usually be two very long shifts (9 - 9.5 hours) and then several short shifts."
bad,I was store manager my main concern is that no time off never could take my two weeks of vacation off together. I always went to work sick over all ok place to work.
bad,"Worked for sallys for about 7 months and the manger i had was awful, well actually they all are. Orem manager is THE WORST. I was trying to go to school an work but she cut my hours without consulting me and talk about me behind my back. when i was around she speak to the bilingual girls about me in spanish and laugh in my face.Please find a different place to work, you can find better management and coworkers many other places. sorry for this rude review but i dont want others to go through what i went through."
bad,"As a Manager I had to work alone all mornings, which was very uncomfortable and disliked very much. Each day varied because I had different duties each day, ie receiving shipments weekly, price changes, plan o guides, inventory alerts and waiting on customers.  As a manager, the hardest part was always being available if someone called in sick and working All days of the week including holidays. The only enjoyment I had was gaining confidence from customers and making them return."
bad,District manager was clueless and wasnt even around. Didn't know anything about the store or its employees. Tried to change what was a good thing and lost 2 good employees. Made to do management work without being management.  Would go back but only as a manager and would make my store great.
bad,Manager chose favorites. Customers were rude. Scheduling was unfair. Hardly hours unless you want to move up. No benefits. Did alot of small extra work that you dont get paid for
bad,"Unless you are fresh out of school and need a starting job, then this may be OK. The overall corporation has LOW moral value and truly lacks any concern for their employees. Support Center and HR have AWFUL attitudes towards you every time you call.They do not care to provide properly working equipment in order to do your jobs efficiently, expect WAY too much of everyone, and don't compensate well for management at all. This company has a bad habit of contradicting policies in the handbook. There is also many ways to get in trouble, and too many ways to set you up to look bad and fail. No structure, no organization, everything is just a mess. Plus, everything is 1 sided completely. They seem to only talk about attracting ladies when they want to offer men's products, yet never include them. They always seem to send too many plan o guide updates and price changes that literally have no difference, or waste time and paper. You reset and ENTIRE aisle, a week later you have to rest half the aisle again. Never in my life have I worked for a retail company so terrible. I DO NOT recommend this job to anyone with good retail experience, and management experience."
bad,"lots of work needing within upper management that will hopefully fix the rest of the teams."
bad,The Job is hot and fast paced setting. you have to stay hydrated because its a dry warehouse. the company pretty much creates a home for you with the lunches and cookouts on top of the things they give out at the end of the year.
bad,"It's a  fast pace environment, must be alert . However, tending to the customers is our first priority. Greetings them as they walk in and helping them with hair color instructions."
bad,a typical day will be pulling sales in the morning. Technology is not really up to date. They still have dot matrix printers and they have finally gotten ipads for the district Managers
bad,"Aprendizaje "
bad,"The job is just stoking, standing around. Its fun to look at the products and learn about them but it is not a beauty heavy job."
bad,"poor mgt in all stores - smoking I store, etc....  No work ethic, managers come in after nights of partying. They favor different employees and do things that should not happen in any retail stores."
bad,it was stressful with a side of no follow through from management and employees who shouldnt be working there. i worked almost 45-50 hour weeks sometimes with no days off since other people didnt want to show up. the pay was not worth the 2 other workers slack i was picking up plus doing my own job.
bad,"My day started by opening the store. Doing the daily paperwork, preparing the bank bags. Getting things in order for my employees that had to come in. Doing reset checking in the new items as the come into the store networking with outside businesses."
bad,I enjoyed working with my co- workers. The work environment was positive for the most part. Management was flexible and worked with my schedule in case of personal matters that needed to be taken care of.
bad,"I enjoy working for Sally Beauty.  The work is interesting and it could be fun if you don't fall behind and know how to manage your staff according to store needs and be ahead of the game."
bad,"This was an interesting job. If my manager messed up, we would get our hours docked because of it. I had my hours cut to 4 hours a week because my supervisor left the food unlocked for a night. I love the products they offer though."
bad,"Not a bad overall workplace. At times there were communication issues, and efficiency issues but nothing that cold be blamed on one individual."
bad,Not somewhere to want to stay or grow with. My manager violated so many policies and would come & go when wanted. Hardly any supervision.
bad,"Small store, small employee staff, not much room for growing with the business. Bad life work balance, one employee per shift."
bad,"First of let me start by saying, my first day there the manager called off work (again) so I had no one to report to. The coworkers are great, the life is terrible. They lie and say its a (1st shift) 7-330 shift then you don't get home untill 8PM!!! That's 12 hours a day every day (yes even Saturdays) I have no life. Not to mention it reaches up to 106° in there! Just terrible. The job itself is SO EASY. The conditions and management disgust me."
bad,"My average day at work involves restocking items, assisting customers with purchases, and promoting various products."
bad,"It has been a while since I worked there, so I don't have any real comments to make at this time. This is a fast paced , retail store distribution outlet that drives numbers and picks per hour."
bad,"For a young person living with their parents or looking for part time work, this would be a good job especially if you plan on pursuing a career in the beauty industry. For a person with financial responsibilities like rent, car payments, children etc this would be a good side job but not primary. You never get 40 hours of work in a week and the pay starts at minimum wage even if you are a licensed stylist/ barber. Their management is ok but can be improved and their store quotas are unrealistic unless you force ably sell a product, which they say not to do."
bad,"Started sally's as a second job with plans of only being part-time because of school. Upon my interview I noticed that the manager was kind of ""odd"". She's quiet and awkward. Not the things a manager should be. Once I was hired I was rushed through paperwork and quizzes only to be thrown on the floor while her and the assistant manager talked and were on their phones in the back room. I knew nothing about most of the stuff they sold because of the lack of training and I would get swamped with customers while they were ""busy in the back"". One of my family members fell very sick and Sally's wouldn't even schedule me so that I could go see my family member that was almost dead even though the manager would always let the assistant manager off for no reason. The manager at first had me off on a certain day and I told her I couldnt work and that i got someone else to work and she said it would be okay just to ""let her know"". I let her know and when i come back to work she has the nerve to WRITE ON THE SCHEDULE ""no call/no show"" and when i confront her about it she avoids it. SOME MANAGER HUH?!?! Now today I look at my bank account and money is missing! YES! they took money out of my bank account for god knows what reason!  "
bad,"Great working environment! Head managers are terrible! Work is the same each weeks (certain days, certain tasks), Your evaluation determines your raise which ranges from 9-50 cents as an associate per year! The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find what they need and explaining how to master certain tasks such as coloring their hair or doing their own manicure. The hardest part of the job is doing everything you possibly can to get your job done and doing what you are supposed to do, but never getting acknowledged or appreciated for it! Also, they basically want you to beg on your hands and knees for a promotion."
bad,"There is always something to do but at your pace. Yoi have to watch people from stealing and still do whatever projects you have for that day. I work from 11:30 to 8:30 which is most of the day, does not give me much free time. My training I feel did not prepare me for this job. most of the job you learn with time and on the sales floor specially dealing with rude customers. you must have patience and allow people to belittle you, but not every customer is bad. every month you do get free items to try give first hand experience to your customers and you do earn points and rewards free. selling certain items, making quota and other certsin things are a must unless you want territory managers or district managers belittling you. I feel that I work so hard for the company and my hard work is not recognized, only by my manager, even then I have only received a 19¢ raise. overall it's a good experience but not a good job to take seriously."
bad,too much work for the pay that i got- it was not the best job but i learned a lot about beauty and hair in general. it is not a job that i would return to unless i made more money there.
bad,Upper management is awful. They do not car for their employees. They care more about making their money than the life of their workers. I worked there for 4 years and was fired for not meeting ratios. I was 5 months pregnant at the time but they did not care. It seemed like the managment would purposely find things to fire someone for. Forget benefits and pay. during the duration of my time at Sallys my raise came out as a total of $1!
bad,"I worked at a Sally's for about 4 months. I really liked the job, however, the manager was new and young. Instead of coming to employees when she had a problem all she would do was gossip to her employees about other employees, and it got to be really frustrating. I wanted to confront her so badly but my husband and other close family advised me not to do that. And to just do my job the best I can and come home. Unfortunately I didn't leave the job in the right way, i just quit because my husband started a new job, and we had a hard time finding a reliable sitter, so i had to be with my kids. But a few days before i decided to quit i had a last minute issue with my sitter, and wasn't able to come in and work my shift, which was only 4 hours that day..my manager ""acted"" understanding. Only i found out the very next day from a co-worker that she bad mouthed me the whole time saying ""I could have gotten someone to watch my kids"" and ""my job should be my first priority""..anyhow after that day I had to call out because my CHILD had the flu..Keep in mind I NEVER called out before all of this. My manager seemed ok with it. Well i ended up catching the flu too so i was sick as well. And i never went back. It was just too much for me. I did however apologize to the manager for having to leave so abruptly...she again seemed understanding..then I found out from another co-worker that after I told her I wasn't going to be able to work anymore, she told the other co-workers that ""she had already decided to hire someone else and cut my hours"".... Anyhow I wish i would have left a 2 weeks"
bad,"while it has many wonderful perks such as trying new products and getting discount on merchandise this company overall lacks stable management within the locations in Georgia, the pay is poor and all employees are expected to do manager duties without pay and title."
bad,"Its differnt from what I thought,you have to sales thing at the counter. If not you will be written up"
bad,Training isnt fun its slow and very old school. Sally really needs an upgrade everything is done by pen and paper and they expect you to count every item in the store and also put put 100 boxes of freight between two employees and customers who ask so many questions. Sally says customers first but they expect us to finish everything and help them its way to much for someone to handle especially when you have co workers who are always wanting you to pick up there slack. The most fun part of this job is the free stuff which really isnt even something to look forward since most of the products are all watered down. Management is so unfair and they think there big shots when really there just rude.
bad,I liked working in this store and helping customers. Managment was terrible and when I reached out for help they didnt care. I ended up quitting because of the unhealthy environment.
bad,Sally beauty is a great start out job for a young cosmetologist. You learn a lot when it comes to hair care and skin care. However it is not a good long term job.
bad,They hiring young useless drama young kids. Its h.ell to work with the kids and as a manager you get no say so. It's not worth the stress. Upper management can be ok. Other managers let the little bit of management go to their head. They all talk bad about each other as if they are in high school
bad,"there wasn't much management at the store that I was working at. There was a lot of unprofessionalism between higher management and lower staff, at the time there wasn't a store manager, so most of the work feel on the store associate."
bad,"Very low pay for the busy work and long hours that are expected, if you don’t sell enough of the monthly promo you get written up and after enough of those disciplinary action is put into place"
bad,"They basically just tell you what's, what and let you fend for yourself. Management sucks and I've been there for 2 years and they've already the replaced 3 DMs. They don't care if you're sick. They don't care about you at all they only care about sales if quota was made good job if not you get yelled at.."
bad,"Sally Beauty has great products and the people I work with are great, but upper management micromanages the stores to death. I've worked for this company for almost 3 years and make $0.20 more than a girl that was hired a couple months ago because of New York State minimum wage going up every year. So needless to say they don't have competitive wages. Stores hours were cut to cut costs so now im not getting the hours i was hired for. That is why I'm seeking other employment."
bad,I used to love my job at Sally’s but since the beginning of this year everything has gone down hill management wise and makes it a horrible place to work
bad,I think it is a terrible company to work for. They are a backstabbing underhanded company that pays poor rates for hard work. They expect much from their employees but dont reciprocate.
bad,"Managers favored certain people, worked the rest of us like crazy.   Raises were horrible, less than 3%.  The favoritism was blatant. Management wasn't really happening.... they were hardly ever around.  Sat in the office and ate."
bad,"The workplace culture is on point. Sally's is unified in the structure and brand standard. Unfortunately at my location management is unable to keep employees. Because the pay is so low, they consistently hire young girls who don't have much adult responsibility and have no problem walking out when the mood strikes. I am a 40 year old separated retired cosmetologist and mother of 3 with management experience. I have stayed for 6 months with the hopes of at least being considered for assistant manager but I will also be leaving soon because I am unable to survive off the money I make here and work too many hours to pick up a second job. It's unfortunate that my value has not been recognized here because I am very good at what I do and have been licensed for 20 years."
bad,The job had required that i do Assistant manager duties when in fact i was not the assistant manager of that certian location. I do not mind helping ever but at the same time still getting paid to do entry level work. They are very unorganized in their work and have only just recently upgraded to new equipment that was needed before to complete certain jobs at hand.
bad,"Not a bad company "
bad,"I worked for CosmoProf for a very long time. Things were amazing until a new DM was hired for my territory about 10 years ago. Upper management is the only problem with this entire company. They care nothing about you as a human being and your personal life and think that you should live, eat, breath, sleep CosmoProf just like they do. If you don’t, your life will be made miserable and you will walk around with a huge target on your back. Upper management makes it a point to lie, make up stories, push people to quit or fabricate situations so they can write you up until they get rid of you. And don’t even think of taking any sick leave!! Got a medical condition? You better hope you won’t need time off! "
bad,It was an ok place to work. They were very quick to lay people off. I never saw the CEO sacrifice any of his compensation for the sake of others. The people there are great to work with
bad,I had a great experience working for this company. The company refused to pay me once I got promoted to Assistant manager and my job entitled me to do all the work due to my manager not doing her job.
bad,"I didn't mind this job, the management wasn't the best, but that isn't a reflection of the company itself. The learning experience on how to take care of your hair is amazing and helps throughout life, not just in the job."
bad,"If you're a college student, only wanting part time, and don't mind having to do more than you signed up for, this is the job for you. The pay is minimal, the days are long, associate turn over is high, but since managers stay forever it is hard to advance.  The easiest way to advance is to over sell products that people dont really need or want to make the company more money. The incentives have deteriorated over the years as well as product education for those who weren't fortunate like myself to be a cosmetologist."
bad,"Its like any other corporation, they expect you to do a million things while paying really low. Its full of drama with co-workers and its only good if you just need something part time while in school."
bad,"Great for students or anyone that doesn't mind making 7.00 an hour. Very laid back, rarely got busy. Not too much pressure to sell or meet sales goals..overall easy place to work."
bad,Gerente regional no maneja bien su trabajo aparte cobran ppr mercancia robada quitando nuestro salario cuando uno en su contrato no estipula pagar las cosas robadas.
bad,"Servicing the public on the beauty industry. Giving advise to customers about how to use color, perms....Products. Learned about new products. The manager  was very unfair with employee hours. Favored a certain employee which caused bitterness between other employees. It was very hard on my personal life having to constantly work 12 to 9 most days. I did like the computer system they had. This job also was not a great paying job."
bad,"Has the potential to be a great company, doesn't listen to store managers or employees, does not pay well, not a good place if you want to be a parent or have family time. Does not care about the safety of the employee's. Can be slow often. Training is all over the place sometimes to much of unimportant things and not enough for immediate training to use when first starting out. The best part of this job is the people that you meet."
bad,I love working with customers and they loved coming in to see me. Although management was very poor the interactive part was an experience I loved. I learned a lot from the months I worked there. Especially in communication.
bad,If you want to have a life I would not suggest working here.  Really for a single person with no family.  Open 7 days a week and have to be available on holidays.  But if your children are grown and gone from home.  Just the hubby and you then go for it.
bad,"I enjoyed this job. Anyone with common sense and a lot of patience works well. The pay was terrible. I felt secure in my job, but not with the hours. No one works full time except the manager and assistant, hours were flexible and not consistent in the amount. I could work 45 hours one week, and 22 the next! Nobody can pay bills like that! Manager was a tyrant and if you did not kiss the ground she walked on, she ignored you. She always had her ""favorites"". It was a good job right out of school, but definitely not a career."
bad,"I would like to start of by saying that Sally Beauty, the company, as a whole was a good company to work for.  They provided us with ample learning materials and training to provide the customers with top of the line information and products. There were incentives to sell products and rewarded employees with free gifts and even trips to exotic locations. I think that they have a management problem and are too worried about their bottom line. There wasn't enough oversight of their managers, who were allowed to run the store like dictators. There was bullying that went on and fear installed in, not only myself, but other workers as well. Our manager was mean, called people nasty names and threatened us with our jobs regularly. Management above the store manager was aware of how we were treated, but never did anything about it.  I would like to recommend Sally Beauty as a great place to work at, but not at the Muskegon MI location."
bad,"this company was an OK job, had a lot of repetition. price changes every week, hours was all over the place, and the pay wasn't good for a master instructor"
bad,This job can be very stressful due to management. They are under qualified and are not appropriate for the job.
bad,"I worked for Sally's for almost 4 years and I worked with 2 different managers. My second manager was a horrible manager. She lacked communication skills. Customers were always asking for a number to report her and employees were always quitting because of her lack of communication and laziness. She would mainly sit in the office doing ""paper work"" and would usually assign me to do most duties. For all that I did for the store, the pay was bad and she would hardly acknowledge my work ethic. My district manager acknowledged it more than her and I rarely saw him. She also always wanted to be in everyone's business and would talk about the other employees when they were off. And every new employee would get horrible training from her and she would leave me to work with them which would leave me to properly train them."
bad,"Sally's beauty supply  would  have been a great job if they wouldn't have went through 7 mgr's in just a short period of time they never found anyone that done there job right. I had a death in the family at Xmas in 2010 and i was supposed to get 3 payed days off for being an employee with the company and they didn't give it to me because they did not have a reliable mgr so I decided to quit because if they were having trouble meeting the requirements of there on rules then i honestly did not think it was getting any better so I quit. I was working over 60 hrs a week away form my children and husband  when I finally quit and moved back to VA to help care for family instead. The most enjoyable part of that job was to help the customers with any questions about the beauty products as well that I did indeed have a passion for this field of work I loved working with the beauty products its what I know and loved I always wanted to work for a sally's since I was a kid but this one helped me make money and that was all, it was the kind of job where you really had no choice but to watch learn and train yourself and i did just that. We had a mgr come in once and at this time we had no security cams, system, absolutely nothing including no mirrors on sealing for theft or anything of that nature and so Sally's decided to get some security well this mgr said she could help that she knew someone in that field of work that could do it for a reasonable price so sally's said OK and proceeded to get the work done keep in mind this mgr had only been there for about 2 weeks when this happened"
bad,I learned how to do bank deposits and inventory. And everyday we would get all different kinds of people. So it was  like an adventure everyday.
bad,"I would typically open or close the store, provide customer service, stock, promote sales, face front and keep the store clean.  "
bad,"Store manager was amazing."
bad,"Every worker and management that I had the pleasure of working with was either underutilized, or pushed to the breaking point,  with very few resources being arranged in order to better the situation despite requesting being put in regards to it."
bad,"The management of this company is inconsistent. My store was told we could use coupons from purchases customers didn’t want to claim, and now my coworkers are being fired for it, but myself and another are not. AND THEY TOOK THEIR WORD BACK on saying we could use them. I am being REFUSED the number to Human Resources! THERES NO MANAGER NOW because the one I had was let go suddenly, and no one in our area is any help."
bad,"I worked at this Sally’s for less than a year & I would not recommend working in this area at the least. Very little training and expected the most. The manager is unprofessional. Has zero patience. Small temper. Treated almost everybody poorly. Does not communicate properly. Instead will handle situations in a poor manner. Things I experienced while working here were that she would talk behind my back to my coworkers, call me by an offensive “nickname” , cut my hours dramatically, got angry if I took my break after 5 hours of work, did not give me my benefits OTM & much more. I decided to quit because it was a very toxic environment. Keep in mind that I am a teenager & this was my first job. Instead of being taught, I was belittled. Do not recommend."
bad,"In the beginning it was great, I learned a lot about the products and what is best for certain hair types and needs, however the manager always picked favorites and never cared about my needs. I asked for MONTHS about trying to get more hours and when I finally did they only gave me two more extra hours. I was constantly being pulled aside by the manager and talked to about my behavior, when I wasn’t the one breaking any rules. I ended up quitting because the drama was unbearable and couldn’t stand it anymore"
bad,"No real perks or benefits to working here except for employee discounts. Full time employment is not offered, no paid holidays, no overtime and no benefits and it is extremely hard to work for a corporation that doesn't see value in their employees."
bad,Sally Beauty has given many great opportunities and chances to be promoted.  I learned management skills and customer service skills.  The hardest part of the job is the irregular work hours and non consistency.
bad,I really don't have anything to say about the company so writing a review because its required here is difficult. The company management underwent serious changes therefore it changed the vibe of our team and people didn't feel as motivated as before.
bad,"I only had the title of an associate but was given the roles of an assistant manager. I helped manage everything but other employees. I did not write up, fire or hire any employees. I did all paperwork, plan-o-guides, blue notes (merchandising notes). I know the store and a lot of our product more than the manager in charge does. The associates are expected to bend over backwards for the company while the company does nothing to reward or encourage the ""good behavior""."
bad,"The workplace and work I did was fine, I do not shy away from hard work, but we simply did not have enough employees to adequately run the store. The manager did a great job though."
bad,"I've haven't had a great experience. Management always seem very lost and doesnt treat employees like a team at most times. I love the products and most customers. Unfortunately, I've seen a lot of good employees quit and walk out because of how they were treated, including being accused of stealing. Very unfortunate ):"
bad,"You learn the basics with skin and hair care. The customers are all women who are chatty and willing to listen to suggestions. Never stressfully busy, and Christmas isn't too crazy either."
bad,Rather not say.  I prefer to keep it private for the sake of the company.
bad,"i have worked for sally beauty supply for 5 yrs i loved the organization with this company i loved my job.  Wanted more pay but i was happy and received bonuses for achieving quota goals.staff was solid low turn over got along with my district manager very little to no micro managing great communication and professionalism.  I moved to Texas 6 months ago and transferred with the company. I immediately recognized the difference in management. i have had a great management base to start and then i start to experience the worst I've ever seen. Extremely unprofessional ,unorganized and unethical behavior with upper management. high turn over. micro managed feel like your opinion is consistently ignored. I realize now that its not always the company in a whole but the territory i can honestly say there are some good territories out there but there are also some bad ones."
bad,Working at Sally Beauty Supply has its pros and cons. The pros are the fact the you get to try new product for free every month and get a great discount. The cons are that you can only advance in the job if you are a licensed cosmetologist and you have to deal with some very rude and or needy customers daily.
bad,To the greatest place for advancement but nice perks. Got free stuff a lot in the beginning but now those perks suck. Typical day was like any other retail environment. Management was great at my store.
bad,It had all the toiletries necessary to make sure you looked your best.  Being an employee allowed me to get a discount on make-up and other personal items used in routine hygiene.
bad,Good place everyone always welcomed. Good energy. I liked to work there at first it was a good experience but as time goes on . If you are not close to the other employees they distreat you. Very UNPROFESSIONAL
bad,"I loved my job until about two months ago when we were informed that all full time employees would be reduced to part time. Then part time went to between 5-15 hours a week. "
bad,"Worked many hours as a manager. Director was nice and helpful. "
bad,Helping customers find products for their beauty needs was a challenge. Skin care and nail care and hair care was fun and customers are very receptive to advise and new products.
bad,I was store mgr. there was so many detailed tasked that it left little time to complete them. If fully staffed that would make that easier to complete but because of the very little pay under $9 hr. staff didn't stay long. and those that worked hard they became very disappointed with a  .15 cent raise in 6 mo. I liked the company and was able to work through many obstacles but when it changed the company structure  stress became normal. People quit and I as mgr began to work 12 hr days with little or no assistance from my district mgr. who also was over worked having 30 stores all over Houston to oversee. During my employee I had 3 CEO's
bad,There's a routine every week you become very used to. Its fast paced as things are always changing and there are many deadlines but it is doable if you're very hard working. Management isn't always great and moving up is impossible unless you've been there forever and have become friends with the right people. There's so much paperwork that I now have great experience in that but its a lot for just an associate.
bad,"My title says it all. I've worked for Sally Beauty twice, and it is no different than the first time. The teams are great, at least my teams were fantastic, upper management however was zero help on many many occassions. As an assistant manager, I kept sales driven and the team focused. The new manager however, liked to leave early, leave while on shift to attend to her many ""appointments"" and treated her employees like absolute garbage. Again, uppermanagement had no help, and refused to help. I came from a staff of ten, and all ten, including myself, quit under the direction of this manager. Sally Beauty needs to focus on the Alberta area's DM, and TM's. Corruption is afoot."
bad,"Huge restructuring time.  Trying to bounce back from decades of neglect and under-investment.  Going through enormous change and headcount reduction.  Once things level out, you may want to give it a chance.  The new CEO is definitely worthy if the board will stop managing and take off the shackles."
bad,"In my time working for sally has been great, but at the same time there was a lot of drama especially when working with just ladies. It demanded a lot from the workers but barely got recognized for the work."
bad,The pay is terrible and they expect you to do everything that a manager would do. The sales goals are ridiculous and super high pressure even though you don't make commission.
bad,"El trabajo te exige demasiado, te piden ir maquillada a más no poder aún haciendo tu gran esfuerzo, nunca están conformes con tu imagen, pura hipocresía y la distrital es muy exigente, piden metas demasiado altas y con eso te sobornan, luego si llegas a una meta ""tu recompensa"" son cosas echadas a perder y cosas de devolución de clientes, para eso quieren que cumplan metas las trabajadoras? No te pagan las horas extras a tiempo, te depositan hasta la noche, no cuando debería ser, te prometen días de descanso en fin de semana pero siempre sacan algo para no dartelos, etc, muy mal trabajo."
bad,"This is a job that is very productive on most days. This is a busy store, but there are not enough staff members to help out. There is new management so it should be better than whenever I was there."
bad,"Great company for a cosmetology student. Did not enjoy management, they were not helpful with training as I was NOT a student or familiar with this line of work when hired. although I expressed that during my interview, I did my best to make it work for both the company and myself until I started correctional academy."
bad,"A typical day at Sally's beauty was assessing customers with their beauty questions and concerns. I learned a lot about products that I didn't know about, the good and the bad. The management was horrible. She provided no training,acted like a child,constantly threatened employees, and lied to customers. The hardest part of the job was convincing customers that a certain product was what they needed to purchase,and not just me trying to make a sale. The most enjoyable part was working in an industry that I was passionate about and working with great team members."
bad,My manager was very kind and organized she made our jobs very easy. She created a very relaxed and fun working environment.
bad,"sales and customer service, you can use what you learn to advance to a different company or career."
bad,Directed customers to products and recorded all sales in the Point of Sale System.  Recruited and trained staff members. Managed employee hours and maintained financial records.
bad,I go in at 8:30. deactivate there alarm. count the registers. get the deposit together. put the deposit in. take the deposit to the bank. set the new ads for the store. get on a conference call for an hour. help customers find what they need. continue to reset the store. complete the ad. clock out at 6:00
bad,I had only taken off two days in the four months I worked there. When I had gotten meningitis and was in the hospital for two days my manager told me it wasn’t her problem and that I needed to find my own coverage or come in. 17 girls quit on her I reported her to HR and no action was taken
bad,Sally's was not bad but some of the people I worked with were the laziest people I have ever worked with. They wanted others (ME) to make their pay check and that does not go well with me. The main excuse was that they did not speak Spanish and I did and I had to help the customers and finish the shipment delivery. In the back of my head I was mmm how did you manage before I came along.
bad,"The pay sucked, the hours only got good when someone got fired or quit. No room for growth in this company.  They always get mad when sales are low and put pressure on the manager."
bad,"My manager can't pay anyone nearly enough to do all the things we are required to do. Holidays are not paid in over time, and if you work part time you get no benefits or vacation hours. You can earn a measly .50 cent raise if you get the best review possible after six months. Not to mention there is very little opportunity to move up in the company."
bad,I loved the job and helping the customers. There were some management problems that were taken care of. Great atmosphere. I learned a lot about the products that they sell and the befits of shopping at a sally's compared to buying your beauty needs at say a Walmart or any other local drug store.
bad,"This company is going through some changes recently so maybe some of what I'm going to say will change. There is no room for growth, you only get a very small raise once a year. There are a lot of requirements to be met on a daily basis and if those are not met ""corrective action will take place"". I enjoy the different displays that I get to set up and organizing them and doing inventory. This company just isn't willing to invest in a good worker. ""We can all be replaced""."
bad,"I came in with no experience and was expected to do my work perfectly about two weeks out of training. And when I say perfectly, I mean 0 mistakes. Instead of taking me off and training me further, I was greeted with a threat of disciplinary action. "
bad,Drama among management and with employees. You can move up in this company if you get along with the management or will be promised opportunities you may not get.
bad,Typical day of stocking and running register. oi learned that this was not the direction I wanted to go in. But I learned an awsome amount about all beauty products.
bad,Sometimes you work with great people....if your lucky many of the policies are ridiculous and make it difficult to handle the job. But its alright for a college student again that is if you have great co workers like I did.
bad,store is dirty. they cycle through employees every few months (high turnover). management will randomly leave to get food during business hours. customers have been left in store unattended to. management is basically “whoever stays past 6 months gets to be a manager” kind of people; not based on experience or skill but really based on who doesn’t leave. i can’t believe they are still running to be honest.
bad,"They only offer part-time employment, only managers get full-time employment. 10.10 is not enough for the work you put in. My store is very small they are a discount store. And every week we get new shipments and management expects you to put it away. Even though there isn't enough sufficient space, which is very irritating."
bad,"As a store manager at Sally's, I always felt like my workload was way too much in comparison to my pay. It was very hard to keep a good team because they also pay their regular employees so little while expecting a cosmetology license."
bad,Loved working with the regulars and my co workers but felt quite embarrassed and disturbed by how the manager treated the customers... very rude and unprofessional!
bad,"El sueldo es base, a comparacion con lo trabajas es poco y tu trabajo nunca es suficiente, no existen bonos, ya que las metas son estadisticamente inalcanzables, estás a cargo de muchos jefes que No son nada profesionales, en esa empresa buscan robots, no personas, te piden disponibilidad de tiempo las 24 hrs los 7 dias de la semana y tus desacansos no son seguros, no pagan horas extras."
bad,"La empresa cumple con lo que promete pero su personal es nefasto, hay mucho acoso laboral y preferencias de parte de las gerentes"
bad,You can not work more than 29 hours a week. so you stay part time with no insurance or any other benefits. they dont expect you to request any time of and you are not allowed to get sick. They sit very high atv goals and will threaten your job every day if you do not meet them. Upper management does not care about team members. we are replacable. their words not mine.
bad,Not as organized as it could be. The interview process was the best part personally. I do not have the proper tools to move up within the business. I would like for the pay to increase with the amount of work that comes along with it.
bad,As a teen the workplace may seem fun and exciting but once you get to see the real side of working at Sally’s it is none stop stocking change of inventory or visual display. You can only work partime and the hours are so incosisnt and are never liniant you basically work when they need you or want you to cover for someone.
bad,"I can't say I enjoyed my two years at Sally's. I loved the professional customers I interacted with everyday, my close co-workers, all the skills I learned but I do not enjoy the company as a whole. My store manager was fabulous but the district manager was a real snob."
bad,"not the best training"
bad,"This job was a job I did while going to school. My typical day was cleaning the store, organizing the merchandise, and following a Plan-O-Gram for the products. Unfortunately, the management ended up being very unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was that I knew there was something more challenging out there for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I made the customers happier than when they came in."
bad,To many people trying to play manager. Didn't work with school schedule at all. Rude managers . Picked favorites with employees.
bad,They don't take the time to properly train you especially if you're not licensed. They just throw you into the job. You have to look up the sales for the month on your own through a packet instead of the cash register just doing it for you. Associates are basically doing manager duties but not getting paid for it. I do not recommend this job.
bad,Working at Sally  Beauty supply was a hectic experience. I worked 8 or 9 hours a day and I was a part time employee. Customer's were very rude. I only enjoyed the people I worked with.
bad,Horrible inexperienced management. I take away the ability to use point of sale system and generate business reports. I enjoyed the product knowledge. The hardest part of this job was dealing with unprofessionalism.
bad,I was just a sales associate and could do most thing in the place. It was fun and a great learning experience. Sadly management wasn't what it should have been. As a non-smoker I would be left on sales floor while the manager would take personal phone calls and smoke in the back for an hour several times a day on some occasions. I can say she was a nice fun person just not the most professional and my co-workers would sometimes be the same. Other than that I thought it was a great place to work.
bad,Picking product orders and cleaned the warehouse. I learned how to use their scanners. Management was demanding but helpful too.  The hardest part of the job was how you were to get the quota for the day and the stress of all the co-workers.
bad,"Learn more about hair and beauty products through assisting customers, also get free products by company allowance. The pay is not conducive to independent living."
bad,"* Wrote Schedules, Kept on top of the metrics of the employees and the stores, Bank deposits. "
bad,"I would open the store and do the bank as well as paper work. I would interact with customers and help out with product selections. I would front and face, and count down the register at the end of the day. I had keys to the store to open and close."
bad,Dealing with beauty products and helping others to put their best look forward was nice. I met really nice customers and had my favorite 'regulars'. The bad thing about this company is the really high turnover rate of sales associates and managers. Sales jobs are known for low retention rates but the managers were quitting or getting fired left and right. What does that say about company and its practices?
bad,"I loved my job at Sally's Beauty, but had a problem with management near the end of my time there. I loved helping the customers to find the products they needed and whenever they would come back to show the finished product I was truly excited. Unfortunately a little over a month before my termination I put in a request for 2 weeks off to see my grandpa who had contracted cancer. Less than a week before I was planning to leave my manager told me she couldn't approve my time off. I told her I wouldn't be in due to the nature of the situation and purchasing my ticket. The day before I was going to be back home I messaged her to let her know I was having trouble getting back. She told me I no longer had a job because she put me on the schedule and I didn't show up to my shifts. I miss that job honestly."
bad,"I walk into a mess, my manager still hasn't figured out the system we've had for 7 months. I close every single night. I have learned that if something needs to be done, do it yourself. My manager is a nice person but not a leader. She doesn't manage time well, her work space is a disaster. She is very forgetful. The hardest part of my job is having to close every single night. The most enjoyable part is knowing what products can do for my customers, and the free samples are pretty awesome too!"
bad,"A day at work can either be blissfully slow and full of free time because everything is running smoothly, but more often than not everything is broken. Management does not enforce rules or generate policies, so everyone does their own thing and management only gets involved when something has gone wrong that they might be held accountable for. It's great learning experience for those without a degree or working towards one. The hardest part of work is figuring out which team is responsible for helping you resolve an incident because no one wants to accept responsibility and they waste your time blaming each other when they could be fixing the issue so you can do your job. Since management is relaxed, co-workers are pretty awesome!"
good,"Cons:"
good,the District Manager for area 500 was so aggressive about sales . She would sent our emails to her team Informing everyone that if they do not make the daily quota it will result in getting a correct of action
good,"Todo estaba masomenos bien pero la gerente nos ponía en contra a todas las vendedoras y tenía su favorita, si eres nueva y no le caes te hace la vida imposible y te inventa problemas para cubrir su deficiencia como gerente"
good,"Its a place to make a pay check , but not a place to stay if your NOT the right color. "
good,"its not quite what you think poor management, no room for advancement, shaky job security, very inconsistent low hours and inconsistent work schedule."
good,"I learned so much at this job and when I started out, I absolutely LOVED it.Once the management changed, things got ugly. Quickly. All three employees that worked there (including myself) called and reported out concerns to the higher ups and they just tried to sweep it under the rug. I do NOT suggest EVER working for Sally Beauty. They only care about lining their own pockets."
good,"Es un trabajo absorbente, no tienes tiempo para casi nada. "
good,"I loved my job but it does not have any room for advancement ,  unprofessional managers,  scheduled conflicts,  time changes done without approval,  hostile environment."
good,"Managment talked behind employees backs to other employees. She was not very buisness like i came in did mt job well over and there was nevy any appreciation.only bad talk and what wasnt done, even tjough we would do everytjing we could to get everything done...i left the company, needing the job. But unwilling to under go any more ridicule.."
good,"did not like the fact the manager treated their employee very poorly , they screamed at you . customers are really disrespectful , its the same thing over and over again . only part i enjoyed was working in a beauty place"
good,I loved the customers but the employees were rude. It was fun at times. I learned more about hair products and how to use them. Management was ok but it could be better.
good,"The hours are so low  (15-29 a week & it fluctuates) for the huge workload this company expects individually. It is a part time job, however there is no consistency in your schedule. The pay is laughable and there are no quarterly raises, or even incentives for consistently good work. I have been with this company for years and I am drained from doing my job AND management’s job as well. There’s a lot of hiring from outside, which sometimes results in lazy managers who have no experience or expertise with the beauty industry. If you’re not a manager, you will never have full time hours nor qualify for any form of healthcare. I am leaving this month as I simply do not feel appreciated nor do I wish to continue to do the job of those paid more than me. "
good,"When I first started working for Sally Beauty the employees had incentives, it was less stressful and it was motivational. Now they have changed so many things for employees and management. The pay is not good and benefits are only for full time employees and to get get promoted it’s hard. This is an okay job if it’s something temporary."
good,"Fue un poco desgastante, solo había un día de descanso a la semana y el día se iba rapidísimo. El ambiente fue bueno pero la administración era pésima"
good,"Sally Beauty is a great place to shop with hundreds of amazing products and dozens of new deals each month, but that's where the positives end. The managers are poorly trained (often times they don't do anything), district managers and territory managers don't care about problems within the store unless it interferes with making money or selling IOMs, and much more. I loved being able to help dozens of people each day with their unique issues and varying cultures and backgrounds, but with all of the afformentioned attributes, I was unhappy. Yes, this company offers tuition reimbursement, but only for those in the realm of cosmetology who are also completely graduated and working full time hours. Oh, and you must have been there for over a year. The hardest part of your job at Sally Beauty is keeping a sane mind."
good,"When I started working here , I loved it. Then co-workers started to quit due to management and the hours were put on only two employees. It became very stressful and overwhelming."
good,Sally's was a customer driven business with very little consideration for its employees. Long hours with no breaks and very little pay. The upper management had zero compassion for the store level management and employees.
good,Not as fast paced as a typical retail job. Expected to make sales even when the store was super slow & was threatened every shift to get written up for not making quota. Customers were the rudest I've ever dealt with in all my jobs. Management never worked weekends. High turn over rate due to poor management.
good,"They wAnt you to do more than what you get paid for "
good,there was way too much drama even the manager was involved even started. she talked bad about employees even called them names. The best thing about working there was the free products and the discount. for a thriving hair stylst it was a good temporary job.
good,"I love my coworkers and my job, but management is something to be desired. No praise for job well done, required to do multiple jobs aside from your own, in trouble for the actions of others, and advancement is passed over for people with experience and knowledge to those who have just started and have barely any knowledge or experience. Raises every year, but only up to a quarter. Managers get to sit and play on there phones while workers pick up the slack."
good,"Management needs to be looked over, very confrontational. Teamwork a must. locked in hours no room for a shift change or life work balance. May have changed over years."
good,"The manager was young and very passive aggressive. She relied on her assistant manager for every decision she made, instead of making decisions for herself."
good,"is a good company to work for, pay can be bad if its a low volume restaurant"
good,"My typical day at work was basically stocking the shelf's and running the cash register. I learned that people will spend a lot of money on their appearance. The management was decent. My manager did not seem to professional because she would complain a lot about my co-workers to me about the things they did wrong. My co-workers were great people, very kine people. There was not much about this job i found to be hard. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was seeing the customers be happy when they left the store."
good,"A typical day of work was full of duties, and challenges."
good,"First of all, this review is exclusive to the one I worked at. Anyways, I enjoyed working there. It was a fun job and my coworkers were nice. However, the reason I'm giving it a 3 star review is because the manager was AWFUL. First off, he was only hired as manager because when the old manager quit, he was the only one who could work full time. He refused to hire anyone that wasn't around our age, so early 20s. Also, he would take time off repeatedly so he could meet people out of state that he found on grindr just so they could hook up. Once I was able to work full time, he denied it because ""It would take away some of my hours"". He was so unprofessional and I couldn't handle how I was treated."
good,"I worked here for 2 years. The work was easy, many people come and go because they are lazy and dont  want to clean and set up the new product. management hardly new that people were late and called off a lot"
good,Not a great company. They except you do to the managers job with no pay raise on top of doing what your actual job is. Not good for someone who needs this job to be full time to pay bills and make ends meat.
good,"This company DOES NOT value it's people. All they care about is numbers. They dont care if your alone in the store for 6+ hours EVERYDAY as long as you are making month. Dont give enough schedule hours to train employees but expect them to know everything in one work week. Management constantly gets In trouble if beauty advisors have more than 20 hours. RIDICULOUS turn o er because the amount of work vs. Pay. "
good,"The job is fun . Expectations are high.sale there strict on hours, sales goals.Management do not care about employee's thats why they quit left n right or never return . they dont care if u have strept throat or a emergancy you have to be at work or you get a write up.manager make it a competition for sales n put there employee against eachother for hours .poor girl had 10h one"
good,The company itself is decent. Sometimes management is not. I think we should get paid more for the work we do and customers we experience on a daily basis. A plus is the free products we receive every month.
good,The manager at the store that i work in is very unprofessional and not fair. She doesn't know how to do schedules and is always making mistakes and excepts the staff to fix for her.
good,At Sally Beauty they really push you to up sell and meet unrealistic sales goals. They are constantly changing  and  cancelling sales making it hard to keep up with what sales are going on.
good,The girls here sit in the backroom until a customer comes in. This is the only time they do their job. It was frustrating trying to pick up all the slack. You don't get paid enough to deal with some of the stuff that goes on. Lots of drama.
good,"There is a lack of steady management in my store, the one who is acting manager is very immature and unprofessional. The customers aren't the problem here, it's the way the company is run. They only pay attention to detail when they feel their reputation is on the line or someone is paying a visit."
good,Mean and Rude managers make the job unbearable. rude staff and customers. low care for workers by managers. favors workers over others and treats some workers like garbage.
good,"Muchas veces no respetan los dias de descanso por la rotación tan grande que tienen, no cuentan con medidas de seguridad para evitar robos y tu junto con el personal tienes que pagarlos, es dificil para que te paguen las horas extras con dinero, por la cantidad de horas que trabajas no tienes vida social. No es un empleo estable ya que te hartan cuando no quieren tenerte en la empresa."
good,"Horrible place to work, horrible area, management seems not to care about employees, associates are to busy worrying about each others business. manager doesn't communicate effectively with employees."
good,The management at my job was horrible. She never came in on time she always was leaving. The customer service was not helpful as the computers always have issues.
good,Sally's Beauty is a wonderful retail store to start your first job at. There are task that need to be completed on a weekly basis. Having top notch customer service skills is very important when thinking about applying for a job. The incentives are wonderful and keep you wanting to work more without any complications.
good,It’s ok. But not permanent. Low wages. Not a lot of support from anyone higher up. A lot of times you work alone for possibly hours at a time. It is a fun place to work and it offers an excellent employee discount
good,A work day was stressful. I learned nothing. Management was difficult to explain yourself to. The work place was toxic. The hardest part of the job was that you had to do things you should not have been required to do.
good,As a manager its extremely stressful trying to staff the store with such a high turnover. You are required to work 46 hours a week. Of course if an employee calls in you have to cover being short handed its usually you the manager. The pay is super low with such a high demand.
good,its been a very eye opening expierence for me working at Sally Beauty Supply for the past few months honestly. At first I really enjoyed it. I definitely gained alot of knowledge while working at the job . I have made more money than I ever have so far but unfortunately I am getting less & less hours each week . I am confident that I can & will find something better in time .
good,"I really did enjoy working for Sally Beauty. I liked the quick pace and the atmosphere. However, the manager was manipulative, dramatic, and took advantage of her employees. She also did not train us properly and often asked the employees to do tasks that she was required to do (That was found out after she was fired).  Had she not used the schedule to punish her employees for personal disagreements, I would not have left."
good,"Over all this company was an okay company,,work place was fun. got to interact with different types of customers that i was able to help out in many different ways."
good,"Every month we had a chance to beat our previous years qutoa, if we did, the crew would get scratch tickets to receive prizes. There were times I opened and closed the store by myself on a Sunday. The hours were from 10am till 6 pm."
good,They had me working really weird night hours. It was hard to balance as a single mom. We never got breaks or lunches. We weren't trained properly. They do no care at all about your family life.
good,"- A typical workday consists of opening store assisting and greeting customers , as well as finalizing purchases and any other duties that are given by management. "
good,Great opportunity to progress in my skills as a customer service rep.
good,"I work from the time I get out of school at 11:50AM until 7:15PM. On days I am not in school I work all day, including weekends, and am given no time to study for my exams. I am usually the only person on the sales floor assisting with customers when there are usually two people in the store at all times. I have learned how to handle stressful situations and multitask when the store is busy. Management will not hire another part timer to give me time off for my studies. I only have one other coworker, but she has another job and is rarely there. The hardest part of the job is trying to get our shipments unloaded in one day, usually by myself. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet the needs of my customers."
good,"Management wasn't all that great but I loved my co-workers. I feel that Sally takes advantage of its customers mostly when it comes to the savings cards. IOMs were a pain to sell and you would get in trouble if you didn't meet quota, as if it was that important. I would continue to work there if management was better and things were a bit more lax."
good,sally would be a better place to work if the pay was higher for the amount of work load given to us managers. we are expected to work on our managerial duties as well as working to be the best in sales.. there are not enough hours given for each beauty advisor to complete each job thoroughly. the best part of the job is the other managers and the employees. and our customer base is amazing. I think sally has a good training program with certain things and poor training on others. I hope sally beauty realizes how amazing there workers are and how hard they work for them. I love sally though and maybe one day ill work with them again.
good,"Como cadena comercial es un ambiente exigente, tienes metas de ventas y siempre debes estar activa en el piso de ventas."
good,"Starts out being a fun place to work, but usually I just dont think everyone works together very well as a company over all.  It's a little disorganized."
good,My most enjoyable part of my job is helping ladies feel beautiful.  Helping them with hair problems and beauty issues . Love customer service and inter acting with people .
good,Sally beauty is stuck in the past and all of a sudden they are trying to catch up with the times and it is not working. They have way too many apps to keep up with and a lot of them don’t work properly. There are still problems with the coupon codes working in the registers (we’re getting new ones soon— but still too late). Management is absolutely lazy and doesn’t help the beauty advisors when needed
good,"A typical day at Sally Beauty Supply started out slow, but there were days when it was busy without being too busy. I learned new skills that I actually didn't mind doing. The manager is someone that I would describe as ""Jekyll and Hyde"" because there were days when she would be nice and then she wouldn't be so nice and professional.The workplace was quiet and everything was always organized, the hardest part of the job was that I couldn't get along with the manager, and the most enjoyable part of the job was that I had a chance to help the customers as much as I could."
good,It's a beyond Easy job. Unfortunately they are severely under staffed. I have expressed my needs and my needs are not taken into consideration. I'd love working here if there was staff and proper training.
good,Worked at Sally's  for a long time.  Who wants to for a company with No benefits. The people who want full time work get cut down to 20 hours. Hire  people that will not work.  Dm don't care. Tip is : Stop running your workers out.
good,"I enjoy working at Sally’s, but I have had no legitimate opportunities for advancement. I am also not given enough hours to afford my bare minimum needs."
good,Once a manager gets on the DM's bad side it makes for an uncomfortable working environment. It is not helpful that the store managers don't have anyone else to speak to besides the DM.
good,"My Sally beauty work experience is mixture between a love for the job itself and a strong dislike as well. The pros are, if you’re passionate about beauty and beauty products you will receive free products every month. The products you receive are sometimes travel size and sometimes full size products. You will also learn about products and how to sell those products to customers and how to recommend products. You will learn about color and how to apply color and how to determine what is best to recommend to customers. Lots of stuff to learn of you love what you do. One of the biggest cons, there is no room to advance within the company. Bad management, understandstaffed and undercompenstated."
good,"Sally is a fun place to work, depending on your coworkers. They have interesting ideals about training, manager only did the minimum amount required, the rest was up to my other two coworkers to show me the ropes and how things were done and ran. It took awhile to learn the different products, where they were, and anything I should know as an associate to help better the customers service and give good detail and facts about each product."
good,Everyone in the upper management are best friends and have each other's back over the employees. Nothing ever gets fixed or changed when addressed during meeting. They expect too much from employees without giving correct advice or instruction with how to deal with things.
good,Sally Beauty is a good starter job for students who are in cosmetology school. Typical work day isn't so bad. Basic customer service and product knowledge helps a lot when it comes to certain people looking for certain products. Not enough staffs though and management is barely there to help when it comes to in-store issues. Sometimes they'll over work you because there isn't enough people to work certain hours through the day. It's hard to have a normal daily life outside of work when all you do is get called into work on your days off.
good,overall a good job but there is not much upgrade or advancement in this job. They are very strict about meeting goals but ober all a goos job to be at.
good,"Although his place was a great place to work the big company was constantly cutting the stores total hours while also asking too much of the store, this put a lot of stress on the employees, because we didn't get enough hours, and we weren't really paid enough. But we were constantly being asked to do more and more."
good,"Typical day is help each customer have a great hair day.  "
good,It's literally just an alright job. Honestly just catty and very rude towards guests who are not liscenced cosmetologists. Sometimes your boss gives a good pizza party. They say they're open to work with your schedule but no not at all. You get very minimal hours per week and are payed biweekly. Not a liveable wage with those hours.
good,"I loved the company and the products but definitely hate the working environment of it. Pay and hours were horrible. Hardly no room for advancement, but you got free products every month."
good,"I was a tenured employee"
good,"There are only 5 people including the manager working at the store. While the store is small and empty at times, the store does get really busy quite often. Only two people work at the same time. You work 12-hour shifts often. You barely get to take off or get time off because you are so relied on as a worker because there is only 5 of us there. The manager barely did work and left me, and another new employee alone when both of the registers stopped working, forcing us to check customers by hand, running back and forth to get the code of each product."
good,"Stocking was the worst part about the job! Tons of shipment every Tuesday, products had to be on the shelf immediately or possible penalty if not complete, while still managing store and attending to customers."
good,I was in management for over 13 years.  Thought that putting in 40 to 60 hrs would advance me to a hire position after proving myself.  Overlooked after traveling/opening & closing store etc.  The position demands 110% and becomes your life when in management.  Low Associate pay makes the retention high.  I loved my job but became over whelmed after so many years of giving that 110% and so many hours.
good,"Its been so long I work there, 2011-2013. While I was working there, the pay was really bad. Managers and staff sometimes would make the same amount. I once took a vacation out of town, I was asked to come back earlier because they were short staff when it had been approved months before. M"
good,"Minimum wage job, with very few hours, but it worked for me while I was attending cosmetology school to help pay for tuition. You do learn a lot about the products and get great discounts."
good,"A lot of system errors when checking people out ,you have to double check after yourself. I started working for sally in Thomasville  ga, the staff there was very professional and friendly. I transfer to conyers ga, like night and day! The manager was rude to costumer's,  yelled at employees in front of costumer's. There was internal theft that went unresolved. Just a very unhealthy environment! Hr was never helpful with complaints. Basically told you it was your fault and to leave if you had a problem."
good,"Great job! I love working here. Not too fast paced, but a normal working facility. It's in a great area here on the beach, and the customers are lovely!"
good,management could have been better co-workers were great insurance not so great. Good discount and free  hair care items were given every month. also very hard to move up in management.
good,I love doing hair and learning things about hair skin and nail care . That is what made me want to work at Sally but after a while the work becomes redundant. You can't sit down even when nobody is in the store you have to remain standing. You can't go on the phone even when everything is done you just k keep standing there. It's fun someone's doing nothing but doing nothing like completely nothing is the worst. You don't get paid over time your raise after 6 months is max. 20 cents. You don't get paid extra for working holidays. No sick days. You basically do everything that a manager would do you just get paid minimum wage.
good,As a company its a fine retail establishment. The draw backs are the management. who will openly admit to not liking you and wanting to keep you from moving up in the company.
good,"dealing with snobby customers who act like they know what they're talking about yet i have a license in cosmetology, only one coworker of mine was difficult but management was understanding and someone i could confide in."
good,The higher managers were awful and they weren't helpful at all. The the store manager was great though. You really need good customer service skills to work there but the girls I worked with were very helpful and very sweet.
good,"I learned some people never forgive you for mistakes depiste if everyone around you has, an applauds you for your hard work and dedication to the compnay."
good,As a normal employee this should be okay. If you plan on staying Assitant manager may be okay.... but as a manager they seem to not take care of you as they should.
good,"While at Sally's I enjoyed working closely with our customers in helping them with all their beauty needs. The co-workers were great. However, the management wasn't so great. There was time abuse from management. The company over all was nice to work for with their employee incentives and free product sampling monthly."
good,Love working for this company. Manager needed to be equal with all the employers. I learn a lot from this company. Not everybody had benefits only 40 hours employees.
good,"Job was great until they hired someone who knew nothing about hair care or color. didn't even have managing skills. I was very pleased with my job, but not who I worked with. We even lost customers because of the lack of management and how situations were handled. Its a great job for people who are in high school. Too much backstabbing and drama for me."
good,I enjoyed working for Sally's because I was always learning what the latest fad was in beauty. It was a part time job to help get me through school so I never looked at it for any advancement.
good,"A typical day of work at Sally's was mostly myself opening. Count drawers and complete mornings paperwork in a timely manner. greet each customer and assist them with any desire. Had to be very knowledgeable of today's cosmetics and style. Knowledge of chemicals such as permanent hair dying and bleaching techniques is was very much needed. Ive learned so much about taking care of my own hair more than anything. Management was very motherly to say the least. You'd have to have a strong sense of humor and tough skin to work under her. My coworkers were much older than me but still welcomed me and taught me so much. The hardest part about working for the company was staying in line with stores quota. Although i did very well with selling my part of the quota, pushing people to purchase things is very uncomfortable. 9 times out of 10 they would return things the very next day. Most enjoyable was getting free products to try out myself so that i could inform customers of my own personal experience with our products. It made me feel better of a person not lying about how good or bad something was just to up-sale. Also was i made friends with customers, i really enjoyed meeting new people and looking forward to them coming to visit me. Last but not least was the discount, i was able to purchase better quality hair care products for myself and my family that is filled with women."
good,"Typical work day if you are a coveted ""million dollar store"" is pretty hectic. Great for those who like fast pace. I have learned NEVER trust those above you and always protect your behind. My co-workers were really great, they are hard dedicated workers, happy and go-lucky. Although if this says much, almost all are looking gor different jobs while they are there... hmmmmm?"
good,"Good environment depended on workers/management. Very strict, not enough pay. If you plan on calling out, can be dying etc. Make sure it’s worth it. Because they do not care about your well being just making sales ! Literally 2 absences in a month is too much. Also not enough hours for beauty advisors. management always gets their 45hrs"
good,"It was a great job and had a good opportunity  learned a lot , got trained as assistant manager and answered phones and did conference calls , learned competitive sales  and met goals"
good,"There is always something that needs to be done resets, sales and customers are the best. It just takes a lot of time and  patience to keep up with everything."
good,You had to be friends with someone to be considered for a higher position. They only liked you if you sucked up to them (bring them small gifts and food or other things.)
good,"The job is extremely sales baed, other than that it isn't bad. Theres chances to earn a couple extra dollars from commission. Hours are ok, tend to work a lot of nights"
good,"The manager at the Roanoke store is just awful. She makes work awful and she doesn’t follow the rules she lays out for her employees and likes to trash talk employees behind their backs. Hours are bad, manager only cares about making her hours without care for making sure everyone else is accommodated. I wouldn’t recommend this store to work in for anyone, even my worst enemy."
good,"I’ve been working for some time now and the manager is horrible. She worries about her raise and her money and makes it where her team sinks. She boasts on how she is guaranteed her hours and we need to worry about hers. It is stressed that we must have a certain ATV but the manager takes all the good sales so she looks good then tells me to worry about my job because my ATV is low. Every time I clock in everyone disappears leaving me with every sale whether it’s good or bad. Also, the ladies at my location are very messy and talk about each other."
good,Very little room for advancement.  Been with the company for 4 years. You basically do the manager job. Hard to make a living off of 20 hours a week. My store location isn’t in the best area and we have been robbed repeatedly but recently (they had guns) the company didn’t care about our safety. Takes patience customers are extremely rude at times. Good for someone going to school.
good,"Sally beauty is productive, but not the busiest place to work, but the management is not so productive. The manager says that there is no work that needs to be done but, on her off days, she will give us loads of work. But thankfully the team I work with is very productive and we get it done."
good,"I quickly advanced from part time associate to full time and then assistant manager. Within a year of being hired I was running my own store. And then 4 years later I'm still a manager despite taking on DM level responsibilities multiple times. I have taken advanced training in preparation of becoming a DM as per my TM suggestion. I have applied for multiple DM positions, but despite Sally Beauty's Can Do value of building talent, they have time after time hired from outside the company for any positions over SM. You CAN grow with Sally's. But only so far."
good,Too much management drama. Not enough team work within management... more like throwing daggers. Only a second job for me..... could never work there full time
good,Store managers trying to keep up with ever revolving doors where low payroll allotment allows for single store open until mid day and numerous locations closing daily business with single associate (holidays time included) at night.
good,What I learned at Sally's Beauty is that training for communication skills is very important when dealing with customer service. We would have daily shipments every Monday so we can stock up the shelves for every product that comes in. The hardest part of the job is knowing who to trust while working there because there is often a lot of gossip that goes around if you mess up on a task. The most enjoyable part of the job is having team parties when the store has reached a target goal for the quarter.
good,I enjoyed the staff & clients. It was exciting to see the newest trends. I consider it a laid back job other than being forced to try and sell hot items to customers just to reach a goal.
good,Worked in a store that was very busy. Was promised a promotion for over a year that never happened. Verbal abuse from the manager. Most enjoyable part was coworkers and some regular customer's that were kind. Most customer's were verbally abusive and management did not stand up for the workers. No benefits and low pay.
good,"The co workers were great. Everyone got along and they were very supportive. There are only two people inmanagemnent that genuinely care, but the rest don’t, they only care about numbers, and if you weren’t meeting them, you lost your job. Good pay for what you do. Always afraid to take charge with calls, because you will get told you did something wrong, yet they incourage you that you have the power to do so (although you never really do). Always felt like I was walking on my toes, even when I did my job correctly. The managers in the building could really improve on how they treat their employees. Constantly sending emails, and you could sense the anger in them. Not much respect for the company after working there for a year. I will never go back."
good,"Don't bother if you need anything more than 10 to 15 hours. this company has cut its full time employees to less than 20 hours. There is no room for advancement. Even if you are a part time employee, if you do not have open availability you get the bottom of the hours. being there a long time does not matter. They also teach you to follow policy and when you do and a customer is unhappy they make you look like an idiot and cater to the customer so their policies only count when people don't complain."
good,It is good for a person looking to work a few hours a day.  If you have a family it is not the job for you because you will not get a chance to go to there school events.
good,"I was a top seller in my district for IOMs and honestly that’s the only thing that made this job worth not quitting immediately. I love the beauty industry, however $8 an hour is horrible and you’ll never get a raise or promoted. It takes forever and generally they’ll outsource for management even though they say they hire from within. The management benefits are complete garbage, you literally only make a couple dollars more than your associates and don’t even receive quarterly bonuses until you’ve been a manager for a year first. Also don’t ever get the flu because I was told if I didn’t come in I would be fired.... so I went to work threw up in a trash can up front all day long and even passed out on the floor sick... really not an ideal place to work. At least not as a career."
good,I started out under great management but after she left the store became all about who was friends and who was not. Friendship was valued more than work ethics.
good,"The work was sometimes hard, having to re-do sections of the store all by yourself and on a limited time as well. The hours were usually long, sometimes you had to work all day depending on staff. They do not teach you much about the products that you HAD to sell, I ended up looking them up in my spare time only to still get criticized by customers by not knowing enough about our products. You also get blamed if you don't make plan no matter how hard you try. This job was not worth the pay.."
good,There has been a high volume of upper level positions over the past 5 years.  There have been recent layoffs and more are possible in the future.  Employee compensation is not on par with compensation for similar positions at other companies in the industry.
good,"Great people to work with, but very poor management. Management was hardly present and was more concerned with personal success than team success. The store is open 7 days a week, and the responsibility is divided between 6 people. Your vacation time depends on how much the manager likes you."
good,"Good discounts, it was fun to help customers with their hair and answer questions, but the hours were poor as was management. Coworkers would often call in sick so you'd be forced to work alone or asked to come in on your days off. No benefits."
good,"Sally's is a great place to work in retail, if that is your thing, very relaxed atmosphere, and you learn a lot about different products which will become valuable in the long run when you have long left this job to start your career"
good,"As far as being a salary manager, it does not pay enough! I was very unhappy with the amount of hour they required you to work as a manager and it’s effect on home and personal life."
good,Hard working and excellent customer service everyday.  Ability to work in a fast paced environment while giving the customers great service. I have the ability to see the good in everyone.
good,"A very fast passed place, and days that can be slow. Don't take things personal and stay positive. Management can be worked on more. People can be very rude sometimes but always keep an smile and remain calm and do your job. Always do great customer service. When working for a beauty place its not as bad because you also meet people who appreciate on what you do. Helping them with information that they didn't know at all. Making them feel important. That's what we do as beauty adviser."
good,"I was responsible for morning paperwork, cash handling skills, exchanges and returns, merchandising, correction counts, unpacking inventory, keeping the store stocked."
good,"Worked as an assist Manager traveling between three stores, Some stores where great but and hour and a half a away from home. Travel pay was for miles not covering food or gas, this was when gas was $3.45 a gallon. I did love my customers and my job, I enjoyed working with Sally's because of the customers.When I returned to my home store there was a click formed that I tried to disband, I was not able to. I found my self in a minority setting."
good,Sally's Beauty has great products and I love working with the customers. Store manager treats employees like children and talks to them in condescending ways. Manager will frequently tell staff one thing depending on her mood and another day will be something different. Overall the company is good to work for but the store I work at needs improvement.
good,"great place to work, i learned everything you would need to know going to cosmetology school. The most enjoyable part of job was learning new things everything building my knowledge on things i didn't know. The hardest part was them changing the rules and not getting your two raises within first year and bumping minimum wage for the company and people coming in making the same thing you are."
good,"Fun place to work but carried a lot of responsibilities and did not get pain enough for the amount of work put in. Not enough hours. Free products, great discount"
good,"When first working at Sally's it was a great work place with a lot of potential for growth. Over the last year, however, management has diminished the moral of the company. At the moment they are doing company cut backs and trying really hard to have long standing employees, like myself, to leave the company by any means necessary. New hires come in and work only a couple weeks before they quit, due to excessive standards and terrible treatment. The management blatantly expresses favoritism and special treatment to certain employees."
good,"The hour requirements are below average, and the district leader in this area is below average. There is no opportunity to advance (beyond store leader) unless willing to relocate."
good,"My experience here was not all that great. Although I liked working here, I made good friends learned a lot about products and made good $$$ at that time. I had an unfair situation with the store manager and her boss. But other than that its still a good place to work if your into beauty products. Holiday times are busy but makes the day pass by fast and you meet professional hair stylists and business owners"
good,"Sally's is a good place to work, and it definitely depends on who your manager is, cause mine was aweful. She was very self involved and relied on her employees to do everything but then take the credit for the work. She takes advantage of her employees and makes them feel as if they are not as important as her, and when I left I used my points to get a gift card and a t- shirt which I never received and I had tried on several occasions to contact the manager and she never responded. I'm convinced she took my items I ordered."
good,A typical day at work included working with management and helping customers. I learned to work with inventory and register's monetary accountability. The hardest part of the job was trying to put out merchandise while assisting customers.
good,"Management could be better, carelessness lead to associates feeling unwanted and unneeded eventually. This store goes through associates more than Walmart and Tim Hortons combined. Customers complained that they come in only on weekends to avoid the manager, also say they don't shop at this store at all when its the closest to them."
good,"There were great people to work with.  The demands on the employees was a little bit over the top but, otherwise a good job."
good,"i worked at 2 different locations for this company and i should have stayed with the first one. I could have been an assistant manager there and could have kept some of my employees there. "
good,"My very first day I walked in my store I overheard the ONLY associate on the floor telling a CUSTOMER ""Yea *another assoc before me* got her own store and they brought someone new in which is B******* bc that should've been me"" now after introducing myself and being brought back to the office to meet my store manager who's first statement to me after introductions was ""I didn't hire you, you were sent to me but I don't know why we have enough coverage"". I was hired by another DM as an assistant manager in training hired at a certain rate which FYI never got fixed "
good,"Manager would bring personal drama to work."
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers on the sales floor and helping them with their beauty care products.  You also handle their monetary transactions and try to get them signed up for the Sally's card.  I learned a lot about hair coloring, how to properly take care of your hair and the best way to make sure that your manicure and pedicures stay perfect.  Management was okay, but she just seemed to have favoritism towards certain associates.  If you did not have some type of training, such as cosmetology, some questions that customers had were difficult for you to answer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and learning more about the world of beauty."
good,"My job is to create the Customer Experience by providing product information, product selection assistance and memorable and personable customer service. I maintain merchandising standards, stocking, facing products and processing shipments. I also assist in store security, safety and the management of store inventory,  provide the sales associates with tools, training and resources to be successful."
good,"Typical work day consists of sales and various customer service duties; store maintenance, product education and knowledge is essential."
good,Awful company to work for with little chance for growth and development. Management cannot decipher personal vs business.
good,I love working with people very much. This jobs put me in the front line of being able to assist and help people. I would really like to see upper management improve in helping their store managers to be great managers by providing a better training program with more hands on and for the district managers to engage with the store managers more often to help them to succeed.
good,"Not a fun work environment, too uptight and demanding of every employee and manager. Not enough incentives and lacks moral within the workplace. Management is recognized with a yearly manager only trip if they make all of their needed totals required to qualify, the only incentives are scratch off tickets monthly if the store reaches all goals. Free products monthly to try for each employee is the only good incentive. Management does not like to work on employees schedules as needed. As a single mom, it was a very difficult job to maintain and they do not like to advance from within, they would rather hire outside for new management, I was an assistant manager and was always overlooked for an opportunity to become a store manager."
good,It's a good job to start off with to build up your work experience. I like it because it help me build up my work skills.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking merchandise, and pulling back stock. Assisting customers with hair products and hair appliances. I learned a lot about hair and beauty products. I know all manager and district managers are different but the two at my specific location were horrible. Very rude and not equal opportunity."
good,Overall the company has good benefits but management was not effective or fair.
good,I wasn't crazy about working for Sally's. The work wasn't hard but the hardest part of the job was to lift extremely heavy boxes on a daily basis. The best part of the job was helping the customers get the correct products and appliances for their hair and them coming back happy with their hair.
good,"Opening POS register, restocking products on shelves. Assisting customers of finding products."
good,"Making sure store is ready for customers, shelves stocked, enough coverage in the store."
good,"Typical day at work is always greeting and assisting customers with their every beauty need. I had to have knowledge of over 1,000 products and keep current the with the trends. I learned a great deal with interpersonal relations, and how to speak to higher ups in the company. My co-workers were amazing people once I got to know them, and we all worked well with each other. The best part of the job is when a customer comes back to thank you for helping them with whatever it was they endeavor. "
good,The hardest part is learning about the thousand products they sell. Its a beauty supply store so there is a lot to learn. Its very laid back but the pay isn't good at all. 
good,"Working at Sally's can be a great opportunity as well an enjoyable experience. Truck day is my favorite day because you learn where things go as well learn about new products. The down fall is, at the sally's I worked at the big bosses abuse their authority. If that changed sally's would be an ideal place to work."
good,"A typical day would include balancing previous business days transactions, banking, ordering, inventory control, cleaning, managing employees and customer service and sales."
good,we had a manager that never had worked or had experience in the hair industry. she didn't know anything about it and would basically set people up to fail when she would tell them about a product because it was only what was written on the back of the bottle.
good,it doesnt take a smart or a expirenced person to work at Sallys. Its the most easiest job ive ever had and enjoy it. But the Schedule is always different with unreasonabable shifts.
good,First I will open the store shut off alarm. Then i will have to count the drawers down and get the deposit ready from the night before. Make sure the store is in order before opening. Assist all clients with any questions or concerns with any produc.t
good,"Working at Sally's was steady and dependable, and I learned volumes about hair care products.  My manager was flexible with my schedule.  It was a good part time job for all intensive purposes."
good,Sallys was a good job for anyone that wants a part time. I personally need a job with more than 15 hours which is what I would work most of the time there.
good,"Upper management is constantly changing. They also have introduced many changes for the employees in the store to carry out that make doing our jobs harder. The DM, RM, and TM have never worked a sales floor, so they have no idea how the new changes will actually effect us in our daily lives. The store manager does not maintain a good team. There are a few coworkers who work hard and are overall amazing employees. Then there are two members of our team who don't hold up their end of things, resulting in the rest of us having to do their work as well as our own. I have helped out at other stores and I'm noticing the same pattern of lazy team members. Management is going to vary with every store, but from what I have seen, no one really cares about hiring good, hard-working people and holding their team accountable."
good,"During the 10 months that I worked there we were robbed 3 times and each time it occurred, we were expected not only, to have only one closer and opener in a shady part of town but, continue to work as if nothing happened. Also had 3 completely different managers come in and then go and we were often left without a manager and no clue what to do. Not a great experience."
good,"I've worked for Sally's for 2 years. Although sales goals are to be expected from every job, Sally's is ridiculous - other stores near my store have a lot smaller sales goals than our store despite lower traffic at our store. Refunds are allowed on almost anything but they absolutely trash your numbers for the entire day and YOU'RE blamed for it; no way to recover from it. No paid maternity leave. Manager never takes availability into consideration and then gets mad when I had to call off because I couldnt get a babysitter. The manager has no power to hire or fire someone without higher ups approval and shes too nice to do it so you're left working with a bunch of people who dont want to be there. No one is on the same page here. You're never given an employee manual or store brand standards manual but you're expected to know everything within both. "
good,"I enjoyed various parts of my job, but compensation was poor, management was poor, and the hours were not compatible with family life as assistant manager- they are much more flexible if you aren't in management or are in higher management positions. Compensation was not high enough to afford childcare. They did have very good benefits and even benefits for part-time employees."
good,"In my opinion, Sally's expects you to have Sally's as your life and really doesn't like people to enjoy their lives outside of work. Every store is different, but in my store we were never given enough hours to work with so therefore we were constantly understaffed. Lots of 9 hour days. I was lucky to have an amazing store manager. Each store has a store manager, some have assistant managers too, but they expect everyone to do management responsibility without the pay they don't even pay their managers that much. I was assistant manager for awhile and got $1 raise. You do learn a lot, as far as how businesses are run and how to help people with hair. It's an exhausting job though. The higher ups try to make everything run smoothly, but a lot of their previous changes have just made things worse for employees, and also professionals customers. They aren't making their sales goals and are panicking about going bankrupt, I was never told this by anyone but there are many signs pointing that direction."
good,"I’ve worked here part time for a year. You’ll get 12-20 hours maximum if you’re new. No set schedules and everyone works weekends. There’s cameras in the back room so good luck feeling ‘comfortable’ while you take a ten. Different shifts range from a three hour, 4, 6 or 8 hour shift. Your lunch is 45 minutes."
good,"The place wasn't bad, although Sally Beauty doesnt respect schedules and hours. They expect you to put your life on hold and focus on the sales 24/7. There's dedication for the job and then there is being forced to be at work 12 hours a day for 6days a week."
good,A typical day was challenging. a sales goal was put in place everyday that we had to meet everyday. Management was very involved and infinitive. The workplace did not have much culture. The hardest part about the job was interring the Sally Beauty promotions and meeting the daily sales. The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with the customers.
good,"If you like learning/teaching about beauty products you might like working here BUT it’s a very competitive environment. Management expects a lot from their employees for little pay, and unless you are someone’s favorite you wont go far working here."
good,This has all of the same problems that a retail job will have. You really have to work for the perks and there are not any guarantees that you will get them even if you put the work in.
good,"Management was not the greatest, they had no care for their employees. They expect you to have the knowledge of a trained cosmetologist, yet this is not a requirement to work there."
good,"Sallys is half working with customers and half keeping the store up and running (reorganizing product, tagging items, back stock, paperwork). You learn about the product and how to use it so you can help customers and the register. Management generally is either to hands off or micromanaging. Hard dealing with the management and not being trained well. Love learning about new product and helping customers."
good,"The work is very easy , the store slow paced. Not too busy, no hours, poor management, drama filled environment, discount is nice, nice co workers. It’s a decent part time job if your looking for extra cash"
good,"They will diffidently train you on hair dye and hair care. There were a lot of hour cuts, they even change the company's policy to work with the hour cuts. It's a fairly easy job The P.O.S. is outdated and can be confusing to understand."
good,"The work wasn’t hard and the people were fine but there was no room to go anywhere, it takes years to be promoted and unless you’re someone’s favorite it wasn’t going to happen anyway."
good,The company has the standard benefits. Compensation is below average. Job Satisfaction and security largely depends on the department and the department's relationship with executive mgmt.
good,"Our slogan is ""Girlfriend in the Know"" we're supposed to be a ""girlfriend"" type of friend to our employees, but our regional manager didn't seem to care about her employees much, she was very quick to write you up for the smallest mistakes. "
good,The overall job or skills requirements are great. I love interacting with customers and Advising them with products that will meet their beauty needs. If the store would on management I believe that it would have been a great opportunity
good,"Co workers wouldn't show up, call out, and manager wouldn't ever encourage being on time. wishy washy. Manager is still there, and turn over rate is so high."
good,"Difficult to work here everyone over worked and underpaid, and frustrated. Constantly worrying about loosing your job and not making enough to make ends meet."
good,"The manager is in charge of store operations and is a fast peace job and enjoying. Unfortunately, the payroll is very limited making the manager always working extra hours to complete the tasks. Company's culture is good but no work life balance. If you have kids this job would not work for you.Oh and pray nobody gets sick because you have to cover for your staff. DM's will not help you."
good,"This company does not currently offer stable job security.  Many positions and jobs were recently cut, and this was the second round of layoffs in two years."
good,"This is not a place to grow. The company did not anticipate the changes in retail, and are paying for it now. Please don't attempt any new ideas or put forth any changes in the smallest detail,  It will not work. Take what you can from there, and leave s soon as possible."
good,"Sally Beauty Supply has all the potential to be a great company. However, the reason they are not is because they do not hire the most appropriate people needed for a position in a beauty supply company. They also do not provide enough training or pay enough. They expect their employees to be as knowledgeable and skilled as licensed hair dressers, but they don't want to pay them a comparable salary. Their computer systems and software are out of date, slow, and often crash. However, they do offer a very nice discount on products for employees, and they give employees a lot of free products to try for themselves. It is a great job for anyone who is in school. It is not a good job to make a career in if you want to make any money."
good,I loved working here. Beauty is clearly apart of my career considering I am a hairstylist. I had a lot of issues with the district manager because she had a personal problem with me. Which led me to leaving the company. The pay also sucks.
good,"No one really liked to work or do their part , one person can't make the store hit goals.  Poor management. Say they would make you a manager and always avoided the moving up ladder. Never ending inventory to stock.  Be ready to answer a lot of product questions.  Know your stuff."
good,"Scheduling is inconsistent, my location could not hold a manager longer than a year, worked full time hours plus overtime and was never placed into a full time role, promised to move into an assistant manager position but when district manager ordered my training supplies he was let go the next day and supplies were never received."
good,"I was promised a higher starting wage because I was a licensed cosmetologist and was able to give hair advice, but was given a lower one when I started. Then I found out (by accident) that I was getting lower pay than another employee who wasn't even licensed!! Then I was promised more hours and that didn't happen so I had to go store to store to pick up hours so I could have enough money for a roof over my family's head. It was an easy job, sometimes boring, but looking at all of the pretty things in the store would always perk me up."
good,"A typical day of work was helping customers and making sure the store stayed nice and organized "
good,The manager I worked under was extremely rude and controlling. She was unreasonable when it came to days off for things like doctor appointments or being sick.
good,we would come in an sit an wait for our supervisor to give us the run down for the day. we would the go to our stations an make the boxes for the product we pulled. I would use my RF scanner to get me going with pulling my stores. you got to move like the wind if you want to keep up your percentage. loved the fast pace an hated how i had to carry other people with their job when i know they can do it!
good,"A typical day at work is good but they expect you to the managers job plus what you do daily. I learned that no matter how flexible you are they always want more. Management SUCKS and they will never keep anyone if they don't work on that. Workplace depends on the manager. The hardest part of the job is counting the money at the end of day, paper, and change over the store every month for new sale. I enjoyed talking with different customers about hair and exchanging tips with them and also learning from them as well. Furthermore, they ask for availability but that's just for paperwork they don't care at all.  The manager never want to close and make the schedule around there time. They are you to be flexible and they will never give you the same in return. They can't keep a manager and they don't stress customer service at all staff at any location are very rude. If you don't have a life and this is all you have to look forward to this is the place for you."
good,My time at Sally Beauty was very stressful and busy at times. There was too much to do in little time but constant customer service at the same time and we were always short staffed.
good,Management was awful they were horriable teachers! But the employees were wonderful! The customers were great I love when I can put a name to a face. hours given for EVERYONE was awful! It was not a job you could honestly make a living off of it was more play play money more then anything. It is not a store that you can expect any type of advancement from. The job its self wasn't hard it was very easy. I enjoyed the fact I was able to work around beauty products since I am very familiar with them it was very easy for me to work there.
good,"The three years and a half years working for Sally Beauty were great , but no raises were really given .your always on your feet there is always something to do , You also have to be good at learning fast and listening well to help customers with their needs .Nevertheless, once you get a good amount of time with covering everything about Sally Beauty it becomes a really nice working environment ."
good,"I enjoyed working there but not all employees were nice. Manager would talk behind everyone's back. Manager never taught me how to do anything, I had to learn on my own and had to be asking so many questions and they would get upset with me for not knowing."
good,"I think this job is very easy and perfect for students or those looking to work a small part time job as an extra source of income. You get free samples all the time and the company gives points when you make your sales goals then you spend those points on products from their shop."
good,"A typical day at Sally Beauty would include interaction with customers and staff about new product and trending products.  "
good,"This would be a good job for someone straight out of high school that is interested in beauty. Its minimum wage, not too many opportunities to advance. A lot of favoritism and unorganized ."
good,"Unfortunately I did not receive raises on time & no back pay was given, decent management but ""corporate"" was worse. Open on most holidays. Very slow registers which can make customers upset"
good,"This job is fun, but fun doesn't make up for inconsistent scheduling, lack of employees, and rediculous store hour difference between stores, the pay isn't worth the effort, and time"
good,"There were too many times I had to go work because one of the sales clerks didn't come in. Very little personal life. Enjoyed the business aspect, of ordering and processing of supplies. Love customer service with the public."
good,"For the short time I worked there it was a catch 22. On one hand, the discount was really deep and every month you get at least 3-4 free items from the new lines they drop. You learn a lot about hair colour, hair products and about the items that barbers and hairdressers come in for. It's actually a nice place to work and on Sundays, they open at 10 and close at six, so that was always a nice plus. "
good,Its fun when you are passionate about your job and the products you sell. Success comes with ease. Learned alot about customer service and the importance of product knowledge. Enhanced my merchandising skills as well.
good,"The company has always been great to work for. The only issue you will have is when you are the manager, it is tough having the right people and people who are wanting to learn and work hard. There are misconception as to after I interview them and welcome them aboard, they just become lazy and too relaxed. When you are short staffed, you are forced to work doubles and alone. Don't get to see your family much. The economy is changing and so is the company. It's getting hard to understand."
good,The thing I like the most working at Sally beauty supply was helping customers with products...giving them the right products. Sally beauty supply is a good place to work at.
good,"Although I do enjoy my job, currently I am looking for something different.  I am in College and need more time at home while I am pregnant. I love beauty and makeup, but sales can be overwhelming. The corporate office likes to dictate certain standards and we get flooded with guilt if we cannot live up to expectation which I think is dehumanizing and unfair.  If we don't get enough people in to make sales, they make it out to be our fault."
good,I've been with Sally Beauty for 2 and a half years. I do love this place but I am ready for a change. It's been a blessing to meet the people I have and got to experience new adventures.
good,"Sally Beauty is good for someone looking for a part-time retail job who doesn't mind staying part-time for a long period. Upper management within the company seems to care little for the experience of the retail workers, but rather how they can make the company more money. Not a bad place to work when you have a good crew within the store to help improve the experience."
good,"I do live my team and the work isnt hard at all. But for the work load you have to do, it's just not worth the pay. I love my team, but for the stress of the numbers, 9.00 an hour isnt worth it."
good,I spent last 5 years working for them just to be let go. When I was there it was ok but poor pay and undesirable mangers. Good luck if you think you can advance.
good,"Long hours. Have to be able to lift, bend, stand. You may be called in on your day off because someone called out. Must be able to be professional st all times and able to answer customers questions."
good,I liked working with the customers and making them feel better about themselves. I feel the company its self cared more about its numbers and personally thats just not for me. Learning about products and how the worked on everyone differently was interesting too.
good,"Providing knowledge on beauty supplies, for beauty schools, students, and salons. Fun environment if management is correct. It's been several years since I've worked there."
good,"My job at Sally's Beauty Supply was to help the customer with question they made had with hair and nail question, Money transaction, and opening and closing the store. I did not like the management team, They made the store an stressful environment to work for."
good,The good part about working at sallys was the deferent opportunity I could move up but I would have to relocate  to make money the hours were great spent time raising my only daughter. Who I is now at unversity West Georgia  her last year.
good,I learned how to get organized  how to put things together how to do shelving I also learned how to handle monies in opening the store and closing Ienjoyed building and rebuilding when new changes came.the hardest part is when all you want to do is a good job and you are critizied for it overall i like been busy.the hardest part was standin on my feet working short days instead of longer days and more days off.And not getting a raise because you dont like me and i bend over backward to get things done.then you have to work a whole year for a raise
good,Sally's is a great place to work... As a former Manager they should try to hire in District Leaders that can actually lead... The potential for advancement is there with the company pending on Your district leader... Always favoritism... Enjoyed most of the customers the other 60% are rude and privileged... Other then a few minor issues the company overall is good to go... Pay could be better for Managers... They can afford it...
good,"This is an amazing company, but the members of the higher management staff are incompetent and rude. I was yelled at, talked down to, and treated like dirt. I was thrown into a severely unorganized and understaffed store with three days of management training. Instead of being treated with respect, the managers are talked down to and treated like children. I loved my job and my employees, but the people who were higher up in the company need to learn how to talk to people."
good,Management was not open to new ideas; management was reactive not proactive; company politics were the norm; departments did not always work together
good,"There is really no typical day at work when working at Sally's, which is why I like this job. Working at Sally Beauty Supply is a great way to interact with the customers and coworkers as well. You become a little family and help each other throughout the day. Working here helps you gain knowledge on products throughout the store and at the same time stay presentable with the best customer service and quick on your feet. For example, you learn the types of hair products to use on different ethnic groups. If you don't know little things like this, or that a hair color needs to be mixed with a developer before applying it to your hair, you would not be able to help and give the customer the best products for them. Another would be how to handle situations that you never thought you'd have to deal with before. Sometimes you get those grumpy customers that are just plain rude but when you kill them with kindness they end up turning out to be very thankful for your help.The hardest part of the job would be to keep an eye out on the store while you have to get your tasks done before the day is completed. The most enjoyable part is being able to have conversations with customers and seeing how different but similar people really are. It's pretty amazing."
good,"its a great company, customers are fun, you get to learn a lot about hair. the pay could be a lot better. i truly enjoy working there."
good,"I learned a lot about product and sales. My co workers all were very friendly and helpful. I liked working in this field it was good experience and I'll apply what I learned there, as I advance in my career."
good,"I loved my job. However when I got put in charge of doing everything at an employee pay and catching slack from my manager's wrongdoings towards valued customers I had to call it quits. A typical day would consist of smiling because you get to be around girly stuff all day, bank deposits, counting the drawer, helping wonderful customers, and making the store look wonderful throughout the day. Management I wish could have been better when I called out for help I got threw in the trash. My coworkers were great as time went on. The hardest part of the job was knowing I would not be able to do it much longer with school, sickness at home, and planning a wedding, it became unbearable. The most enjoyable part was opening those doors counting those drawers and feeling like a boss. I would take the chance to work here again in a heartbeat management or not. I've learned sometimes you have to stick it out and just go with it until it gets better. Usually it will get better."
good,"A typical day at Sally's is fun, fast paced and a continuous learning experience, i especially enjoy teaching customers about our new products."
good,"Good team environment, Good Hours, the management at the company is poor but they are doing enough to keep the store running.  My co-workers are amazing people and I am glad I had the opportunity to work with them."
good,"An ordinary day at Sally's Beauty Supply would be pretty simple and straightforward. I learned different hair techniques such as coloring, bleaching, perms, deep conditioning, styling, and etc. I did learn how to color hair. The co-workers were fair and understanding with each other and we all got along well. The hardest part of the job was using a cash register having to type in every 6-digit item including the coupons but now they have scanners just like every other businesses. The most enjoyable part of working at a hair store was helping customers pick out items, helping them find items they needed and also when they would be coming into the store the next time letting us know they loved the product and thanking us for their help."
good,"Pros:"
good,A typical day at Sally's I would open up the store. Count the drawers making sure they were at the amount suppose to be. As the store opened and the hours went by my duty was to do review last nights receipts. Around noon do the deposits. As the store progressed keep the drawers stripped and shelves clean and organized.
good,"Customers are the first priority with high focus on sales and quotas. "
good,"I learned alot working at Sally's. But not much for advancement, employee harrassment. Not enough hours for work, when wanting more hours."
good,I enjoy working here don't make very much money get to work atleast 20 hrs a wk part time management is hard working and great to work for
good,I worked there for about almost four years. Knew all there was to know to become an assistant manager was even given false hopes. They like to keep you under their shoe. Had way more potential than their lazy workers that didnt always follow company policies. Never gave me the right documentation when they were demoting my position.
good,"While working here i learned a lot about products and hair. I really loved this job and had plan on working here through college. The company does not care about the employees. Yes they do have incentives but the pay sucks and it does not compare to the amount of work and customers you deal with on a daily basis plus the district manager always down your throat. They really do not care. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you want to get barely paid anything for half your life thrown away. Also they will hire anyone that they ""think"" will be good for the job but even when they cause so much problems and can never do anything right they will not get fired. This job almost never fires people. The person in charge of the write ups said we can not fire someone because they are a problem. Well then what is the reason you fire people???? Overall its an okay place if you want to get walked on and taken advantage of."
good,"During a typical work day at Sally's, I would hand out flyers with coupons to customers as they walked in the door and offer my assistance if they need it. I made sure that the sales floor was neat and organized at all times. I would walk around the sales floor periodically to make sure that all products were front and faced to ensure all products were properly displayed for the customer. I would ring up customers at the cash register and ask them if they had a club card and if they did not I would explain the benefits to them and the savings that they would get with the card. On wednesdays were the stores' frieght days, where a fellow employee and I would unload frieght and stock the sales floor as well as the storage room. I also per managers' orders, utilize the pricing gun to mark up/down prices on listed products in the store. After the store closes I count down the register to make sure that the money to go in the drawer is even and the deposit for the bank the next day is correct and document it for the manager to review. Then I set the alarm before I leave and lock up the store."
good,this job was a second job for me..I was in charge of the register and maintaining store appearance and customer service.
good,This was my ideal job but managment was not cooperative at all. No room for advancement. Over worked and under paid.
good,Company is going through cuts in all departments as they are restructuring. Difficult to move up because management has been there so long and there are no positions that open.
good,"During my time in Sally Beauty, I went through multiple changes in management with each manager having a different form in running the store. I was never properly trained. Also, my most recent manager was unprofessional and never had a positive attitude in the work environment."
good,"Considering all Sally stores are small in size, shipment and inventory are a breeze to get through. The only negative aside the co-worker environment, was the management. Not only mine, but other stores as well."
good,"Great work place. There are many learning tools to help employees be successful at their jobs. HOWEVER, depending on the store you are placed at, you will find yourself over worked and under appreciated because they will take advantage of part time workers. Leadership starts from the front, except at Sally’s—it depends on your manager."
good,"It wasn’t the worst place I’ve ever worked. Management was constantly changing and was always slow so we were often without a manager for long periods. They worked really well with your schedule as long as you tell them ahead of time. Time off is first come first served. "
good,I felt I liked job but the management was unprofessional and showed favoritism to employees who disrespects her authority. I only worked two days out the week but I'm fine with that because I don't engage in work drama. Starting as a part time person was kind of challenge because you want your money but you don't want to put with foolery at the same time.
good,"If you enjoy beauty products & knowledge it’s a fun atmosphere for the most part. The main thing is they are constantly hounding you to hit sales goals so I feel it’s taking away from the customer service aspect of the job. When you do meet goals, bonuses go to management not even the employees who are hitting all these absurd goals."
good,"15-20 hours a week if you are part time, evenings and weekends but a good work/life balance. Management could be better. Good discount and free products."
good,"When I first started working there, they helped pay for beauty school and some benefits. The company has undergone many changes within the past five years. It has become very obvious that online shopping has hurt the retail industry and Sally Beauty is trying to save as much money as they can but by doing this, they have let their employees feel highly replaceable and not valued."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers. It was stressful keeping up with all the planograms and being short staff was both good and bad. I was fully trained and doing everything before the new manager got there. If you get a job at Sally's just know that if you're just an associate, you'll end up working so hard for so little."
good,Loved this this company for 12 years until a new DM came in trying to make a name for himself and cleaned house with most of the managers who had been there 10 years plus. I didn't agree with his work tactics so I decided to resign from my position.
good,"It’s a fun experience to work there. The schuedules are flexible, you learn a lot about dying hair and beauty products. But the management needs to improve."
good,"I loved working at Sally Beauty , but they had a high turnover in management. That is one of the reasons why I left the company. Another reason why I left is because they never gave me a raise when I was due for one."
good,"Great and Friendly place to work, very  easy going and relaxed. "
good,"I’ve never worked in retail before this job, but the management so far is not great, there needs to be more training for employees and management. New hires are thrown to the wolves to figure it out as they go, and any complaints to upper management are left unheard. The manager will make or break Your desire to be there. You will do all of the manager tasks to be treated like less than a human. There is no sense of being a TEAM."
good,It was fun while it lasted . Learned alot but the managers never lasted. Really wish they would of given me a raise I would of stayed there.The location was perfect and the people I worked with were reliable for a bit.
good,I worked at Sallys for 3 years. In that time my first raise was 6 months late. My second raise was a month late. I was doing everything an assistant manager did without the pay because they didn't want me to be full time to recieve any benefits.
good,"i currently work here. the management doesn’t care. my first manager was okay but she was rude and always lost her patience with customers. we got a new manger temporary. she was great. my current manger could care less. he doesn’t do anything and isn’t willing to try and learn. he wants to quit at least i’m pretty sure. the other locations (hartsdale and pelham, not port chester, are mostly rude to a few of us in the store. they don’t care that i was hired as part time but i’ve been doing full time hours since october and won’t make me full time. i’ve asked for promotions and got told that they weren’t doing anymore in store promotions but everyone in the other locations (including mine) was promoted but me. i do the most sales and work out of everyone and my manager acknowledges it but doesn’t say anything to my dm to try and get me a promotion or a raise."
good,As a manager for Sally beauty I am literally exhausted all the time.  They are constantly changing their policIes and updating multiple aspects of the company at once making it difficult to keep up with no hands on training.  Managers are sent to webinars and expected to learn on their own.  They have not offered pay raises.  Managers are now only allowed off two Sundays and one Saturday per month.  Underpaid and understaffed company.
good,Workload as a Manager is a lot with not so great pay. It does offer benefits and there is opportunities to grow but not at a fast pace. It’s a physically demanding job and you are on your feet for 8-12 hours per shift you work.
good,"The job is easy and I loved my customers. You can make extra money by selling certain items and the schedule is flexible. I worked with all females which resulted in eveeyone turning on each other, being fake, and spreading lies. The manager was at the center of it all (so mature) and the first to say bad things about the employees. There is also little chance for advancement and the turnover rate is high."
good,"They will only pay you minimum wage, regardless of merit, unless you have a cosmetology license so it's a decent job for students in cosmetology school."
good,Manager was filled with negativity and there was nothing but drama there. It began to get draining and toxic. The pay is ok for a college student. Easy job with free hair products monthly. The customers are spoiled so if you do not get what they want they began to get rude. If you do not sell enough for a day they are going to push you to sell more.
good,"Unless you’re a manager, you’ll be hired as a part time employee. As a part time employee I regularly worked about 40 hours each week with little room to request time off. The overall environment was great, aside from the ridiculous customers. The company as a whole however is rapidly going downhill and it shows, higher ups demanding higher daily quotas and abruptly cancelling specials because “it wasn’t making us enough money.” There’s no core care for customer service, just sales."
good,The location I worked at went downhill after the regional manager fired our store manager. The manager wasn't replaced and the store went into chaos. Before that happened the job was fun and I enjoyed working there! Super easy job for 10 an hour!
good,"I love the company, but the hours are not very good, and it is not easy to advance in the company. The pay is good, but there are not very many benefits."
good,The job is really somple and easy to do but the manager and supervisor  is ABSOLUTELY rude and nasty to their workers and completely makes the job horrible to work for.
good,"Was very laid back, manager was never on the same shift as me I barely met her. Seemed super cliquey, pay was not good. The other employees never seemed to care."
good,"Management was alright, she was very nice and always gave you a day off if you needed it, she tried to to the beat with what she could but overall could’ve been a better manager by trying to offer loyal employees promotions and better pay, breaks are good but the company has unrealistic sales goals everyday, most of the week the store was slow with ridiculous sales expectations, salary was mediocre at best, above minimum wage but unless you’re a high school studen with no bills then I suggest you look somewhere else"
good,"I liked my branch of sallys, anyone above my stores manager wasn’t very personable.  They cared more about meeting sale quotas rather than our safety (during a huge ice and snow storm they expected us to continue throughout the day when no customers were coming and the roads were getting dangerous."
good,The job would have been a lot more reassuring and nice if their was better communication among peers and less drama. There was not a lot of work meetings with all staff and everyone was not on the same page. The manager seemed to gossip about staff to other staff when something bothered her instead of confronting the issue directly .
good,"This company is good if you are looking for a job that will teach you the basics in beauty and provides employee discounts plus occasional free samples. The overall work is very demanding for the near minimum wage provided, even being a licensed cosmetologist the starting pay is low. Should you request a set schedule, there is still pressure to work more as there is a high turnover rate. Advancement into management positions is rare and demands more captious work set by upper management. The company as a whole is shifting in order to cater to customers while not necessarily caring about the well-fare of its employees. How much an individual enjoys this job entirely depends on who their co-workers and store manager are."
good,"Working at Sallys is always fun, entertaining and productive. Most days are slow paced depending your area of work but other than that I enjoy and would reccomend."
good,i love my job i really do but i dont like how some things are done and its very unfortunate that the higher up people dont care if you are a great employee and cant afford to lose hours because its going to happen anyway.
good,"Sally beauty does not care about the safety of their employees,  even when the concerns are taken to corporate🙃no room to call in or switch shifts, not enough training for anyone who does not have cosmetology experience already."
good,"My manager is wonderful, fair, kind, knowledgable.. however, organization sucks, change happens abruptly. Sally speaks of ""brand standards"" being of importance but doesn't VALUE it's employees nearly as much as they value their customers. It's sad that Sally values and respects money more than people. Hardest part of the job is accepting the disrespect that your dignity disagrees agrees with. Most enjoyable part are the customers who appreciate and love your customer service thus providing them with a great ""customer experience""."
good,"... and retail is the Devil."
good,"The company has good intentions, but they don’t really care what happens to the little man ( store manager and team in stores) I think maybe one day they will get better at. But if you work for any of the stores in Florida you can count on being used. They promise promotions but never fall through or don’t want to give  raises for the positions. The highest position to get in Florida is store manager unless you move out of state. I don’t think there is really any  room to grow in the company."
good,"At Sally Beauty, if you are looking for a stepping stone position to get you through to the next path in life, its perfect. The incentives are great if you have the drive to sell purposefully."
good,"The manager often accused the workers of stealing her personal items, promoted favoritism, was very unprofessional, unreliable and irresponsible, and spread rumors and gossip about the employees to other employees."
good,"working in a place that sells all kinds of chemicals to people... with out much training on how those chemicals can do harm. I felt very unsure of my knowledge while working there, and almost all product knowledge i had to gain on my own time. I'm sure its different from store to store... but i did not feel like we were provided adequate safety information. Also, working in a place with only 4 other employees can get super familiar... in a good and very bad way. :|"
good,"The clientele is rude, pushy, and unrelenting. The management is unreliable and confusing. But the people and coworkers are fabulous and delightful to be around."
good,"The wealth of knowledge that my coworkers and customers had was enormous and they were all eager to share it.  I learned a lot about hair care and beauty in general while working at Sally Beauty.  Besides that, it was a ""typical"" retail job.  You stock shipments and provide customer service."
good,"I loved my customers and the products. Management was the down fall in my experience wit this com[any unfortunately. No team meetings, no directions, no training."
good,"Don't get trapped there, you'll be expected to do more work than you will ever be compensated for. Gain experience, move up, then use it on your resume to gain employment at a company that will actually value your hard work and dedication."
good,I enjoyed working with the hair producss and staff. The manager was never there and gave us little direction on setting up displays and so on. She was upbeat but quit after 4 months. She gave orders on what to do but did not engage in the activities to promote sales. She also made the schedule to fit her lifestyle not taking into consideration the hard work we did and that caused good employees to quit.
good,"all my co workers were wonderful, but the higher ups in the company love to be negative. location i worked was extremely sketchy - had no security cameras"
good,"Good place to start, a lot of different job duties to learn at an entry level. i was able to practice people skills and learned the basics of sales as a whole"
good,"A good first job, whether or not its stressful it all depends on what your coworkers and your manager are like. Not much room for advancement, hours are typically 20 hours or less depending on which store you work at."
good,"Working there is awesome and you learn a lot from not only training but from customers too. I have always experimented with hair dye and makeup and this was a really good job if you're into that. Most people I know did not end up staying long as the management is not stable and the managers / district managers need more training in order to lead a good group of employees. Unfortunately I ended up leaving this job because of the manager, but other than that I was okay with the work though I feel associates don't get paid enough, and who doesn't love a good discount?"
good,"I enjoyed working at SBH, the only reason I left the company was because wages were not competitive.  I was offered a temporarily job as an insurance adjuster."
good,I liked working with the public and was able to use my experience as an Esthetician to help customers with products. I liked the process of opening and closing the registers.
good,"Working at sallys was a good place to experience one on one customer service sales. The employment circle is small, so it has its pros and cons. My con was working evenings with a preschoolers and 2nd grader at home."
good,very under paid had to work two stores my rasie took four months to kick in for one of the two I got the other one never kicked in which was the biggest reason in leaving and did not retro pay for the one raise i did get
good,"I did mainly everything there was to do in that store, and the manager treated me like trash. I was there for over 2 years, knew the store like the back of my hand and worked my butt off for the good of the place, and she did nothing but replace her ""liking"" for me with hatred every time she hired a new girl. She promoted a girl to Assistant Manager, who had only been there for a few months and didn't know anything about the store, or hair care for that matter, even though I was the one who did everything. She would scold me for being 3 minutes late due to traffic, while waltzing in the store an hour and a half late with no reason, yell at myself and another co worker for things we had nothing to do with in front of customers instead of taking us in the back room and asking for our side of the story, and other things like that. She wrote me up for as many minor things as she could to get to the point where she could fire me, because she knew that I could take better care of the store than she did. I know that this isn't the company's fault, but this is the kind of management they hire, and keep sticking up for."
good,"I've been working with Sallys for a little over a year. The job its self is easy, just directing customers to products , giving them knowledge about products, backstocking, ringing up customers, so on. I am part time but I work 30 hours a week. The cons to this job would be that normally there is only 4 other employees including myself working there. So its hard to ask off, and if you're sick forget calling out, its hard to get someone to cover for you. Also the pay sucks 8.00 an hour and you do get a raise after 6 months but the max is like .30cents. My manager gets paid max 11.00 per hour , so really Its hard to make a living off this. But overall its an easy,fun job. Would be great for someone young and is needing easy retail experience."
good,Es una empresa muy bueno solo que requiere de mucho tiempo y te cansas de estar parada
good,The Manager was always trying to keep the store running. Policies always changed upper management always thought everyone was not trustworthy. Pay wasn't worth it for all the work a normal 40 hour person would do. Updates every weekend caused business to plummet because customers loose patience because computers wouldn't act right. They always seemed to change something. On pay checks they took out over pay? Management has to be on it with paid days off or you wouldn't get paid. Highest turn over rate.
good,"Un- Professional, workplace was full of drama. Coworkers werent ontop of their duties. Often times I had to take on their tasks as well. The management would often take too much time off of his work and leave it to be done by the lower staff."
good,"Once was a thriving entity succumbing to the pitfalls of e-commerce."
good,This Company might be a good place to work in a year or too.  Right now morale is not great due to a poor Q1 and several rounds of layoffs.  Many of the employees feel that the workforce reductions are only to keep the stock price up and no regard is given to the long-term health of the company.  Not much is communicated from the Sr. Executive staff.
good,"Sally Beauty supply is overall an okay place to work, you definitely want to make sure you work in the correct location. I learned a lot of customer service experience there, but over all the time and energy I put into Sally Beauty Supply got me no where. I was working over time constantly and kept getting turned down for a promotion that my GM fought for me to have, and I met all of the goals and requirements needed for it. I loved the people I worked with and loved helping customers out, but if you're really looking for growth, this is not the place you want. That's why I say its more fit for new graduates."
good,"Overall good work experience management seem to play favoritism but customer's were friendly. Sally's give you overall experience with customer service and ringing at the cash register, it also gave you knowledge on beauty products which we learned about through videos an advanced our knowledge on products with quizzes."
good,Sally Beauty Supply is very cosmetic and hair oriented. The hours are flexible however it is very difficult to get more than 25 hrs a week.
good,"Hello;"
good,"I worked during the night so that I could attend school during the day, I was becoming a stylist so it helped add experience to my schooling. I loved the customers."
good,I Loved working for the company but when you mix business with friendship that's a failure. You can't just praise certain people. Sometimes people need a little guidance and should be able to go to the person or persons above them without being bashed and without the WHOLE company knowing all your business..
good,"Great customers, great job security but management is dysfunctional and unorganized. management turn-over is frequent, so its very hard to adapt to the work environment/"
good,"I loved being with sallys, it was just they didn't always hire professionals so when they would give wrong or miscluding advice the customers would stay a little mad an hard to earn back the trsu but other than that management an the work was great"
good,Regular retail work. Day to day sales activity. Taking care of customers and help them find the products they need. Management need to improve relations with employees.
good,"Sally's has been an okay company yo work for.  Be prepared to work a lot of hour in your store.  Their benefit package sounds okay, but they will not let you use your holiday or vacation time."
good,"I worked the closing shift, which I did enjoy the hours.  This was my first job in retail, I did learn alot about hair care!  Unfortunetly, the Management, was the Worst I have ever come across.  I'm not quite sure how they acquired their positions.  My co-workers were the greatest we were definetly a team.  And we were all in Sinc, sort of in a competitive way and I like that.  Again, the most enjoyable part of the job were the customers, the PEOPLE."
good,"Sallys taught me more about the computer system and how to properly unload truck and document it accordingly. I wouldnt call it so much of a ""career"" as I would a good job for a college student to have. Personally, I wasnt happy with management. My co-workers were awesome and made the job fun."
good,"As a manager there was always a lot to do on a daily basis. This could be a bit stressful if your store operated with a small staff. Staying on top of shrink could be challenging as there was usually only two employees in the store at one time most of the day and only one at a time for the first 3 hrs. of the day. This was not good when store became busy. If one employee was out on vacation, maternity, or sick this made it hard for regular time off. Each day had its own tasks and I cross trained employees so everyone could do multiple things when needed. Shipment each week . Constantly bending, moving, and working with customers too. Kept a good environment with little to no drama. Hardest part of job was keeping down shrink due to small staff, and hiring reliable employees and training. Overall we had ongoing training, enjoyed free product, and employee discount. Enjoyed incentives for good sales and bonus, 401k. Was very rewarding when I got positive customer feedback, and overall pleased with the politeness of my staff and repeat customers. Unfortunately poor upper management with little to no support or lack of professionalism and communication. Poor H.R. I learned that time is of essence, good honest employees are a gem and how we relate  makes for good productivity and a  great environment. Had a good run, BUT....one bad apple spoils the whole bunch. This could come in the form of upper management or new employees. Beware of so called investigations and do not cross that line of respect you deserve from your employees and trying to be their friend. Also the company doesn't"
good,"A typical work day is basically having great customer service skills, assisting customers with beauty questions and making sure they leave knowing I did everything in my power to assist them and be willing to return. Since working for Sallys i've learned alot about hair coloring the basic necessities needed to know to begin the process of changing your hair as far as the base color, your color pigments etc. I've had four managers since being with Sallys and they've all been wonderful I started off as a part time employee and I was blessed to have moved up pretty quickly to assistant manager. The hardest part of my job has probably been dealing with irate customers and not being able to help them beyond my power I would like for everyone to leave with satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to satisfy customers and leave knowing that I did the best I could , if i did not succeed to help my customers."
good,I assist customers with choosing products that are right for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customer leave happy and satisfied.
good,"A typical day at Sally Beauty was basically restocking the shelves, fronting and facing, back stocking and cleaning. My co-workers were great. They were very sweet and hardworking. They just hired too many people at certain stores. My manager was amazing. She was super sweet and was extremely understanding about our personal lives and getting sick and stuff. There really wasn't a hard part to my job. Everything was pretty manageable. The most enjoyable part of my job was the team. I loved working with them. We got stuff done and we all pulled weight around the store."
good,"I have been working there for about 2 years and I must say that overall this job is draining! Don't get me wrong but the customer are okay, some are not and that's with any job but i feel that sadly there's not alot of team effort and more importantly no communication between the ranks.I am on my third cycle of new co workers and its nuts!"
good,"Working at Sally's was very fun. Chance to learn a lot about hair care, the importance of team work, and responsibility."
good,Was able to provide hair care/skin care products to any race.
good,"It is a fun work environment. The customers are friendly and patient. My co-workers are pleasant to be around and make work not seem like work. I enjoy what i do, but sadly, it is where i spend all my time. i never have an evening off unless i actually have the day off. Management is selfish and there are plenty of customer complaints about the rudeness of said management. There is emphasis of working as a team, but it's a team that management has no part of."
good,"From my personal experience i feel like working at sally beauty supply helped me learn how to deal with different situations, and give the best customer service to people i also realize how important is giving an excellent customer service helps the company make sales . it don't matter what kind of situation you have always keep a smile on your face ... i personally don't have a cosmetologist license but they trained you  and you have to take quizzes to learn about hair color and how to fix peoples problems. i love sallys !!! the employee discount is great !!! and it is not a hard job !"
good,"A typical day at work for me was if I opened the store I would unlock the door and lock it behind me, unset the alarm and clock in. I would turn on the radio to make the small building less quiet and then I would get the tills ready for the day and do the deposit. The store would open and I would read over the managers list of duties for the day assigned to me and if the day was Monday I would do inventory counts if the day was Tuesday I would do price markdowns if the day was Wednesday I would pull make room on the shelves to do shipment and if the day was Thursday or Friday I would finish up shipment and place the order for the next shipment. Saturday and Sunday would be pulling back stock from the back room getting ready for Wednesday shipment. "
good,"A typical day includes customer service, fronting/facing aisles, replenishing store shelves, cashiering, inventory counts."
good,"Must be able to multitask, work independently, and be honest."
good,Kan niet zeggen dat ik hier echt veel heb bijgeleerd in ruim een jaar tijd. Het was wel de bedoeling dat ik meer verantwoordelijkheid zou krijgen en meer bij de maandrapportage betrokken zou worden maar door de fusie is het daar niet meer van gekomen. Mijn collega's waren zeker aardig en behulpzaam. Het leukste van de baan waren de afwisselende werkzaamheden en het minst leuke dat er bijna geen onderling overleg was...
good,"It's an alright company if you want to stay in the same position for an extended period of time.  Yearly raises, very little opportunity to move up."
good,Good if you like people and retail hours.  Not for everyone.  Poor pay.
good,"A typical day was answering questions about hair care products and color, being able to direct and give proper information about how to use hair appliances on their kind of hair. I learned people skills and patience when assisting people. Management was helpful when it was needed and my co-workers were fun to work with, we all got along well. The hardest part of my job was trying to help people when they didn't want to listen to what i had to say, they would rather use the cheap products instead of the stuff that would actually help their cause. I enjoyed meeting new people and hearing the stories from the professional stylist about their clients and salons."
good,The best part of any day was being able to help people have a better day! Sometimes all we need is an empathetic ear and a smile. Being able to provide that felt good. The biggest challenge was helping people fix 'mistakes' and get them to where a place where they were happy.
good,"Sallys is a really fun place to work. There is so much to learn about beauty, skin, and hair. The best part of the job are our customers. i enjoy helping them learn a lot about themselves. i also enjoy their reactions to the suggestions we give. It is a honor to work with my manager. He teaches me a lot about our store and management. The hardest part about the job is to deal with such a large population in such a small place. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the effort we all put into making our store and customer service stand out and making the customers happy and excited about what they have learned and purchased."
good,"I learned how to help customers choose what they needed/wanted for their hair/nails/skincare,etc. My coworkers were all girls mostly and sometimes we would have problems because the girls I worked with wanted to pretty much just sit there on their phones most of the time. Probably the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers who also wanted to pull one over on us. Also basically having to be basically their human robbery lookout.... and if we didn't catch someone stealing something or prevent it we would get in trouble or get a talking to... They are also very cheap when it comes to not having or putting up a security system. The most enjoyable part would be getting free product or spending points you earn or great items online. They also have scratch offs where u can get prizes too for making your stores quota for the month. My managers I did felt like they had favorites tho."
good,"I loved this job, co workers were great, loved helping customers. Upper management was horrible"
good,its a fun environment . you get to meet new people every day. your managers are very easy to talk to i like working here 
good,"I was in a position in a store where a manager would not let me advance, although I had more seniority, I was told there would be no assistance manager position."
good,"opening and closing the store, Customer services and sales, unloading truck deliveries, as well as I've learned that there are alot of different situations when in retail, and taking and handling customers complaint, you have to be very tactful, and I love the job, its just if management is not together then a lot of work fall to the associates, and can make your work seem very overwhelming.Co-workers are great to have, they can make the difference in what required to be done and come up with a plan and assign tasks to be completed,the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers, they know you are there for them and they show they really appreciate the difference we make for them."
good,a great place to get supplies and if your a clerk but in management its very stressful.
good,amazing values and respect for the staff no matter your career level fairness was all around. Lacked in compensation but had a few benefits that catered better for others that wouldn't mind lack of dollars earned.
good,You work very hard for your money as a manager of a sally store.
good,Great people and learned alot but the hours weren't the best!
good,"Working there was neat in the beginning, but as you grow in the company, you are not paid out for what you do. Things are constantly changing in that company so it  essentially if feels like you are always doing the wrong thing, I would go back to that job if they paid you more for what you had to do. Also, customers are the worst you are never appreciated for everything you do in the company regardless of how many years you work there and how many items of the month you’ve sold"
good,Working here helped me better understand the sales aspect of this company. Each associate is responsible for reaching and exceeding a personal sales goal as well as having an individual logged sales report.
good,"Great place to work, pay is okay. And you get discounts on product in the store if you work there. The job itself is fun. I enjoyed working there. There is a lot of stocking shelfs and climbing up and down step ladders."
good,"This was a fun job. I enjoyed helping the customers, even picked up a few clients. Always gave employees free stuff to try out. "
good,"I enjoy working at Sally Beauty for the most part. However, since returning from medical leave, the new corporate guidelines and policy and multiple mentions of constant observation without feedback has made me feel more than uneasy. In the sense that, due to my new hire and probationary status, I might lose my job at anytime without warning or explanation. I do not feel that this is fair or right. I want to know if I'm doing something wrong so that I can correct my actions and not repeat them. Also most of us are only able to be scheduled for a certain number of hours which makes it very stressful on the manager."
good,"I loved working for this company and a lot of fun being able to relate or share techniques with customers or fellow advisors but dealing with toxic management was not worth it. Store employees were often pitted against each other and if you weren’t brown nosing the manager, you weren’t getting anything; hours. Management talked behind other employees back when not present to fellow employees and in front of customers, therefore no one trusted one another. Don’t let this deter you from working for this company, just know what you’re getting into if you decide to pursue working this store."
good,"It’s a very slow paced work place, you have to keep yourself busy. They have good hours but near the end I personally wasn’t getting the hours for the amount of time I worked there. Bad management at the end."
good,This job requires you to deal with customers and advising them on beauty aspects. Some knowledge in the beauty industry is needed. Sally’s offers a flexible work schedule.
good,"Need to focus more on training new employees! Need a better way to boost employee moral instead of such cut throat!  "
good,The manager I had was great but the people above her are very rude and don’t care about anyone. Good as a temporary job. They like to promise things and make you feel like you will move up but you won’t unless they need someone last minute because they hired an incompetent manager. You will only be part time with only 18-20 hours a week because they do not want to pay full timers. The clientele are very rude as well  and there’s nothing you can do because they force you to meet a certain quota. Besides that Sally’s has potential they just need to do a good clean up and actually start caring for their employees
good,"It was a nice experience to learn about the beauty industry, there are training videos to understand the right products for customer's need. overall good for extra money for part-time"
good,"It was nice to work there, the payment wasn’t good, but wasn’t hard to handle, the only issue was that because I was the only bilingual worker, they expected me to translate any customer doubts, no matter the language the customer spoke 🤷🏻‍♀️"
good,Sally's Beauty Supply offered little to no career advancement but I knew that upon applying. Their customer service training was subpar and their hiring processes lacked structure.
good,"When you first interview at Sally's, it's seems like it will be a fun job to meet new people and chit chat about different aspects of beauty with customers.  Then when you get hired, you instantly need to become a super seller.  You are required to have a certain ATV.  If daily sales aren't made--your manager gets chewed out and then you get chewed out.  All of a sudden, you get write ups for not making your ""sales"".  You have to do ""add to the basket"" , which means force people to buy things they come into buy.  Ex.  A lady comes in to buy some nail polish.  Now you have to find away to make her buy acetone, nail wraps, files, cuticle oil, buffers, lotion. . .basically anything.  If you aren't a seller, this job is stressful."
good,"I quit because I got sick on the job and the manager literally told me that she didn't care and she still wanted me to work with customers, rather than sending me home to return with a doctors note."
good,"It was always so busy at work with a lot of calls but the most enjoyable part about my job was my team member, they made it fun to wake up in the morning to attend work."
good,"Gave me the opportunity to move up ,unfortunately things had changed. Now they keep on changing upper management so is kinda difficult to keep up with all the changes,they are not on the same page pretty much."
good,"Atypical day was constantly interacting with customers."
good,Sally’s was a great place to work at but I do got to agree the manager makes the work place vibe. It’s a very good job and you get to help other women AND men empower themself and also find the right product!
good,It was a nice part time/ full time job while in school I would prefer to have more organization in the company and more opportuinty for advancement and benifits
good,"Overall experience completely depends on location. I loved my manager but higher up managers were awful. My experience at my location was great, very relaxed environment most of the time and training is thorough. When I started I knew nothing about hair color, now I feel confident with helping customers."
good,"I’ve worked at multiple stores and they all have a different vibe, other employees definitely help make the job all worth while. Once you start working everything is kind of overwhelming but as you get the hang of everything it goes smoother. If you’re not willing to interact with customers and be able to answer any and every question about the products Sallys sells it’s going to be difficult. It’s chaotic sometimes because of lack of communication from higher management. Corporate has very unrealistic standards on what is achievable, for example we had to complete a whole store relabeling (about 6,500 price tags). We were told that we only had 5 hours to do them, which is impossble. My manager thankfully realized this and let us work on tags for 4 days, and we still didn’t finish on time because of the sheer amount. Also we got a new loyalty program but none of us really understand it mainly because of miscommunication and getting different answers from different people. This miscommunication runs up even to the Vice President of the company, she didn’t know that two stores near us were robbed and that procedure has changed."
good,"Typically you help customers and try to meet your quota while make store look nice"
good,"I believe that because this job has a lack of training it struggles to find and keep employees long term. It was an easy job, but there was no management for a long time which created tension in the workplace."
good,I have worked for the company for a long time. There are alot of new changes. They expect alot more of you now and if you don't make your KPIs they will let you go. You used to be a person to them. Now your just another employee number!!  Their pay is also awful. Now they can not give you a raise at all. I don't mind change I don't mind working hard I just want to be treated with respect .theres that old saying you get more with honey then you do vinger..
good,I used to love it there. But it its so much about the bottom line they are getting rid of anyone who has been there for several years.Had a hard time hiring so you would have to work by yourself with no breaks. It was very hard to get help from other stores. Then they would be mad if you went overtime.
good,"i go to work i break skids down that had mixed product."
good,"make sure your enjoy beauty trends and enjoy keeping up with them, or you'll have trouble selling.  Management sucks though, they mainly put everything on the sales staff, never are working, but take all the credit for work that YOU do."
good,"Sally is a great place to start a career. I don't see this place as a job security nor somewhere where you can grow professionally. Some of the downfalls is  the lack of communication and favoritism from within, if you are not looking to get too invested in the company it may work wonderful as they have typically a understanding of who they want where."
good,"sally's is a great place to work if you have know about hair, skin care, and basic information on hot tools. You can not really grow in the company unless you have been there for years. but if you are just looking for a part-time job while you go to school or just for your free time then it would be great for you."
good,I loved that we got free new products to try there is only a handful of people that work there so you cant real call off. If you sale certain items you get point and with those point you can redeem for cool stuff like gift cards cameras bags..
good,I loved/enjoyed my time working at Sally’s. I love working with all the products and people. I would love to work there again but hopefully with a different and more experienced manager.
good,i ha d a lot of fun working there. my co workers was excellent. they upper management is terrible. they expect for you not to have an outside life beside the job.
good,"If your looking to make more than minimum wage this is not the place for you. manager is amazing and so are the workers, but even with a cosmetology license you aren't getting more than $8.50"
good,"no one is held accountable for their actions, you can show up late, or call out and no one is written up or given responsibility for their actions. as an assistant manager in training  expect to be able to hold my associates responsible when they they continue to make mistakes but nothing is ever done to correct any of the issues"
good,"You're just a way to make money for corporate. The benefits are lousy, the pay is a joke, and you're barely given hours. I would have loved the job and stayed there forever if corporate didn't make things so horrible. For the most part, the customers were friendly, and I loved getting to work alongside my interests (beauty products). But I eventually had to quit because after 13 months of employment, I was still only getting 15 hours a week, which is impossible to live on."
good,"It was pleasant job, full of energy and work, but like all the jobs, it had the cons too, like they don't pay benefits, I was working only part-time, so it was ok for me, The Manager was nice, there were moments when got stressful situations as usual like any job."
good,"It was fun meeting with different customers and helping them with their needs. I learned how to work with others and keep the company's asset save. The hardest part of the job is the schedule, you don't have a fixed schedule, So its hard to plan anything."
good,"A typical day at work includes helping customers with product purchases, information of the products and making sure the customer buys certain IOMs that offered for the month,s sale."
good,I really liked working for Sally Beauty Supply. I learned a lot about hair care products and was able to really help each customer with specific needs.
good,"My first corporate position right out of college. I learned that my role with the company was my only role. Expressing an interest in learning more about other roles is frowned. Don't expect a high salary which is a reason for the high turn over on top of how behind the company is in technology and very out of touch with its consumers. I liked my department and the people for the first year, but once the company decided it wanted to make changes in hiring and firing higher ups the company culture became cut throat and lead to a lot of the passionate people leaving or retiring from the company."
good,"If you really need the money go for it, the discounts were decent and the pay and work/ life balance was agreeable but the coworkers werent always the best but management was awesome!"
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers find the right products; running them through the cash register, setting up and tearing down of displays."
good,"if you are a licensed cosmo, this is a great place to work for discounts and freebies to help your practice! fun people and customers, flexible hours!"
good,Sallys is a good place to work if you want a part time job.  The pay isn't really high and there aren't really any benefits unless you are a manager/asst. manager or higher.  You do have to upsale items but they are good items that most customers use so its not too bad
good,Overall It's a stepping stone to a better job. There are better paying warehouses in the area. Use the job experience to move on to a better job. I wouldnt work here twice in one's life
good,"Started as a part-time clerk and worked up to Manager in a very short time."
good,Good team work  good hours drama  with people  ware break was on time good hour people helping others  fast speed  leave on time good pay get 3 breaks
good,My manager was a bit overbearing but i loved my coworkers as well as my regular customers. The tasks were not hard but there is little to no advancement in the company.
good,"If your looking for a part time job then this is for you. The pay is horrible for a store manager. The employees start out with 8 a hour.  So much paperwork and emails expected to be done when short staffed. Resets, tags, ringing , closing yourself which is dangerous, shipment . You barely have a life because your time is based off sallys! Great for someone who doesn't have a social life or any children at home. You always feel like your job is on the line and you shouldn't be feeling like that when you bust your butt everyday making sure the store is open just be prepared to stay open to close most of the time. Cheapest company I have ever worked for"
good,I love/ loved my job at Sally Beauty. I cannot say anything bad about the direction of the company. You always put the customer first and find out what she came in looking for and finding out other needs. And customer service would be my favorite part of the job along with working with my team.
good,"I really enjoyed working there. I loved working with the public and my co-workers.  I left due to them hiring a new manager. I got sick one day and was vomiting out on sales floor.  I had the flu and the manager would not let me leave because he did not want to stay and work the shift. The customers were mad because I was vomiting every few minutes and they were afraid I would make them sick, plus I was unable to wait on them due to me vomiting.  I had to quit because I didn't think it was fair to my customers or my co-workers to have to work with me in this condition and the manager would NOT let me leave.  I hated to quit but I felt like I had no choice."
good,"Although I am still working for this company, I am actively looking for a new job. 3 stores have closed in my district, leading me to believe the company is not doing well. I have worked for 3 years with only given 1 pay raise even though others got cost of living raises through our states minimum wage increase, mine never has been. I am a licensed cosmetologist and my pay rate doesn't reflect it."
good,"It's a good place to work, but personally I wasn't satisfied with the pay rate. Management is okay but could be better. The computer system at the register was really slow and was often the reason why alot of the customers complained. The good thing about working there is that you meet some amazing people that can potentially open doors for you in the long run."
good,Good job as far as retail goes however most stores only have a handful of employees which makes it hard to keep the store fully covered when one person calls out. Managers always get put last when it comes to call outs. Even if you plan your vacation months ahead your plans can get easily ruined by employees leaving or calling out.
good,"Day to day activities are fairly simple"
good,"My manager was great, co workers did not want to work together very often though.  I learned to manage a small team and work with all different types of personalities."
good,Sallys over all is a great company to work for. However the pay is minimal plus the hours. Its great for part time if youre enrolled in beauty school.
good,"Minimal hours, movement in company is unlikely & takes time, lots of management issues, alot of theft, work alone most of the time. Not enough hours. Alot of drama"
good,overall great place to work upper management not so good. Had some awesome co-workers we still keep in touch. Disliked working on holidays we only closed thanksgiving and christmas.
good,"Great place to woek. Hard work is rewarded. Management is not paid enough. Hours are great if you're in management. Overtime is required. You make your own schedule which is great. The responsibility out weight the compensation. Benefits are great. Great insurance, vision and dental. 401K is available they match 5 percent."
good,You have to know your stuff and have patients here. Customers are rude and always being aware of the floor is a big thing here. Security cameras only do so much. Have a good sisterhood in the store with your co-workers and it's fun! Chances to move up for everyone.
good,It's not a hard job but some of the management sucks. I like the fast paced environment and got along with my coworkers. The pay sucks and if you get promoted your pay almost stays the same.
good,"Fun times working for company, management changed and could no longer work for company.  Pay was ok for beginning, hours did not work with my home life. Working weekdays and weekends made no time for family life."
good,"The job itself was a great job and easy to do. However management  was really bad and had a bad experience with co-workers, overall I wouldn't recommend it."
good,"Typical work flow at sally beauty supply consists of focusing on sale goals, making sure products are stocked, ringing up customers, giving customers correct knowledge of products. I learned a lot about how to achieve sale goals and how to better the company. Management is laid back but sometimes too laid back. The hardest part was preventing theft. Most enjoyable part was making someone feel beautiful about themselves."
good,It sucked because it provided little hours and you have to do everything. Not the best place to work at and the pay was little as well. Didn't enjoy it much there.
good,"Every day I come to work its always something different . Some days we have a manager and some days we don't so I have to learn and pick up on other responsibilities quickly. I've learned to reset the store for a new sale as plan-o-guides , blue notes , paper work ect. My co-workers and I get along quite well considering the high stress of not having a manager . We split up the assignments equally . The hardest part of the job is being organized , every thing has a place sku make sure you put it back. I'm a people person so the most enjoyable part of the job is getting ot know and making a personal relationship with my customers showing trust"
good,"I loved working at Sally's because it was an excellent industry to be involved in and the job itself is very fun. I loved learning about new products and helping customers find what they need. This job has definitely helped me in my customer service skills."
good,"The customers were the worst part about the job. Rude people who didn't care about the advice you would give them or the help you were trying to provide. "
good,A very pleasant place to work I really enjoyed this employer. They had nice compensations for the managers as well as hourly associates. The only negative thing I would say is that the District Manager was not a pleasant person.
good,La sucursal los productos Son perfectos pero el personal y los gerentes son un asco te hacen la vida imposible si les caes mal y se meten mucho en problemas personales y te cobran todo lo que se pierde en inventarios también te cambian de día de descanso a su gusto y te cambian de sucursal si lo necesitan los bonos te los dan si quieren y si no te ponen un buen de pretextos te poden que vallas vestida toda de negro y no te dan dinero para la ropa o un uniforme te lo pintan muy bonito pero no es así
good,"Work wise is great is just the environment, the people seem to be so miserable working there. But made a few good friends after all."
good,"start by helping Customers, Consulting on products and hair, facing and fronting the store, cleaning o the store. l learned a lot about hair products and hair color. Hardest part is selling monthly quote items. What i like most is helping people."
good,un dia tipico era llegar ponerse a limpiar la tienda luego empesabamos asesorar alos clientes en mi caso era que me quedaba bastante tiempo encargada de la tienda y caja era divertido porque aprendia muchas cosas las cuales antes no lo sabia compartiamos con algunas compañeras de trabajo mucho eras bunas amigas.
good,"Overall great company to work for with limited advancement opportunities. Would recommend it as a good stepping stone to gain experience, but not for longevity."
good,"- Typical work day"
good,"Working at Sally's Beauty Supply helped me gain satisfactory customer service skills. I learned a great deal about beauty products, the process of hair color, and different biological factors that the environment has on hair, skin, and nails. During my time at Sally's I became certified in hair color. A typical day at work consists of stocking shelves, inventory maintenance, calculating daily, weekly, and monthly sales qoutas. Preparing bank deposits, going over loss prevention, helping customers with their questions, and keeping the store clean at all times. Memorization of SKU's was critical when doing a price look-up. It was important to have a strong knowledge of each product and what works best for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job besides working with my co-workers would be the all day interactions with customers. I enjoy meeting and helping different people with their beauty needs and making their day a little less hectic. By providing a friendly smile to each customer this greatly helped me gain sales on the floors and keep a high customer retention rate."
good,"The work environment is not very befitting to me. I believe they lack the ability to train employees as they should, and the computer and phone systems in place are outdated and do not suit the applications in which they are meant to be used. "
good,Right after I started working here there was a disagreement between corporate and our store that ended in the store only having two employees that had both just started the previous two weeks. I worked long hours and was often the only one in the store. I ended up working 40 plus hours a week while going to school full time. My classwork began to suffer and I had to quit. I know this was mainly a problem at my store specifically. I am not sure how it is working for Sally's with a good manager and team behind you.
good,Overall I enjoyed my experience at Sally's Beauty Supply. But I would not want it to be my life long career. Small space to work and didn't enjoy working late hours.
good,"Company incentive program is awesome. managers requirements not equivalent to pay. Unrealistic goals for programs. No holidays off with the exception of Christmas, thanksgiving and Easter. no day surrounding these holidays considered black out period, vacations depends on staff and store needs. must work one night a week, three weekends a month and also one Sunday per month. Do not like to let stores close in bad weather no matter if they have electricity or not."
good,"Sallys was a great job because it allowed me to get caught up on the new products and trends of that time. My management wasn't the best, but the company was great to work for because it allowed its employees to help individuals with everything that everyone needs to know, hair, skin, and nail care."
good,Dont really want to comment on this i have been a opinions some good some bad. I feel this is a place that your either going to really love or really hate
good,"Worst place to work."
good,"I was the only key holder besides the manager, so I opened the store when I worked day shift. And closed on evening shift. Morning shifts I would open the door and print emails from management. Count both cash registers. Do bank deposit by 12. Do inventory and shelf clean up. Open and greet customers with monthly sales paper. Assist customers with buying appropriate hair product using cosmetology knowledge and experience. Would restock the shelves with anything missing from backstock. On closing days I would count the registers. Clean up. Shut down registers and lock up. As far as hair knowledge Im a license cosmetologist so I pretty much knew everything regarding products. As far as sales I learned a lot about friendly approaches and sale pitches. Manangement was ok for the most part. She showed no consideration for feelings sometimes. My co workers were constantly changing. People could not take the pressure of not really being able to have an outside life due to limited workers. The hardest part of the job was not getting paid to do management work. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and helping them with their hair and having them come back and thank us for the help."
good,"Stocking shelves, front facing products, informing customers about new and old products that fit their needs, running the cash register, adding displays, greeting customers and cleaning the store."
good,"Job description: lot of stocking, unload shipment every week, cashier,  products knowledge, instructions on how customers can do it themselves, and plan-o-guides (everyones job)"
good,They don't work well with students who are still in school. They call you at the last minute to come into work when your not scheduled.
good,"Constantly busy, was all about push push to meet sales goals and never ending moving merchandise from here to there & resets taking away from customer attention."
good,"Some work days were hard as an assistant manager i had to deal with a lot problems but it never bothered me i like to help others."
good,"It is a great place to work. We dealt with hair care products, nail polish, beauty supplies of all sorts. I enjoyed working there."
good,The best part of my job would have to have been my employees. I treated them the way that I wanted to be treated. I enjoyed the customer interaction the most from this career.
good,Come in to people not working ive learn to keep up with what you do involving the companies money management was a mess co workers were dramatic the hardest part was working alone.The most enjoyable was closing time.
good,"Cashier, inside sales, learning the beauty industry. co-workers worked as a team."
good,"The Manager was very nice, enjoyed working there, just didn't like that there was no advance placements available."
good,I enjoy helping customers and my co-workers are really nice.  
good,The company did not pay enough and management was not very professional.
good,Really educating place to work for a newly license stylist! I learned a lot about product knowledge.
good,was a well balanced company which promotes from within. learned alot and enjoyed work. short time restrictions and very fast paced with limited hours and staff availabel . enjoyed what i did and loved the challenge
good,a fun laid back but also productive workplace.
good,"Cashier, opening closing store, sales, customer service."
good,Lead Quality Control manager for the SOX Audits. Delivered system test plans and scripts to support global Retail Business Groups. Managed the Quality Assurance Group nationally and globally.
good,"If you don't have a life, this is the place to work. You will have to work nights and weekends all the time."
good,Working here was amazing. I was able to learn so much about beauty products and how the chemicals work with you hair.
good,"I dont get paid enough or get enough weekly hours to be able to pay bills and continue to love comfortable for 2 additional weeks until I get paid again. It's an easy job and I enjoy the work and most of the customers. But my manager lacks integrity and doesnt motivate her team, proving that she no longer cares for her position or job."
good,"I liked tp work there at first, but npw everything has changed and so many rules now. They don't have enough hours for everyone to help anyone with there bills."
good,"I was a fan at first when I started working here, however, when I quickly discovered that this company does not like to pay for selling products (which is required) I wasn't a fan anymore."
good,"It is rewarding at times and you have access to latest trends. However, you NEED beauty experience and there's no chance to move up. Do not recommend."
good,Mi evaluación no es buena pues para los directivos los trabajadores no tienen importancia ni siquiera sus opiniones.
good,"I am a licensed cosmetologist with experience selling cosmetics and got paid peanuts. If I was paid what I deserved, I would have stayed. It's a fun job that can be fast paced but it wasnt crazy. I would go back if I was offered more money"
good,Some of the policies are outrAges and district manager is bad at a lot of things. A lot of pressure to get everything done on time but tasks are not given enough time :/
good,Typical job. Very stressful when you don't have reliable sources. Not enough incentives for associates. Only part-time hours. They promote from within.
good,"The job overall was very easy if you’re into what they offer. I was very good at my job. However, management can be hard to deal with at times. You definitely have to have a professional attitude when it comes to helping customers, they aren’t always easy. I loved my job there, only minor problems."
good,There's very flexible hours and management is alright. Get to learn a lot about products though. They just cant give you more hours if you request them is the only problem. You're stuck working part time .
good,"Pay is under market standards by at least 20%. There is no room for growth, and little attention is paid to current trends in marketing, advertising, culture or business."
good,"good job and good business. Bad location with lots of theft. The management made the job a lot easier, and was always very helpful. Getting coverage from another store was not hard"
good,"While the company does have a lot of room for advancement, it’s because they have a large turnover rate for managers. In less than a year I had three different managers. I personally was referred to as, and acted as, Assistant Manager. But never got the pay and DM never talked to me about past the initial conversation. Seemed to me like they wanted to take advantage of the work I did as long as they could. "
good,"Once I didn't like is when I found some customer stilling products and I told them to paid o put the item back, that was very scared because some people do anything to you to get away."
good,"I had only been at this job in to separate locations and had found that they were both very unorganized. after only being there a month i felt like i could run a more efficient store, aside from the bad attitude and unprofessional ethics both store managers had. not to mention non of the employees new anything about beauty products."
good,Depends on the district you land in. If you’re a manager like me then this job will pay the bills. Whether you get a bonus or not completely depends on which store location you’re running. If you’re running a newly opened store your goals will be super easy and you will make a bonus. If you take over and older store then your goals might be unachievable
good,"Sally's beauty supply main focus is about costumer services. On a daily base, you are designed to do a daily task and sign a paper to finish your activity. However, if a costumer walks in , you have to top your daily task and approach them with a welcoming gesture and engage with what brought him or her to the store."
good,Sally’s offers flexibility and creativity. It’s very laid back and easy-going. They offer wonderful opportunities to constantly expand your cosmetology knowledge.
good,"The job itself was very easy and understandable, but the management is extremely terrible, unfair, and unnecessary. The managers are very rude and disrespectful"
good,I liked a lot of things about Sally's. They worked well with my limited availability. Sally's is very organized. The training is easy to follow. I liked the women I worked with.
good,"As a Store manager you are required to work 50 hours a week, but you end up working more like 60. The salary really is unlivable unless you work a million dollar store and get bonuses. "
good,There is not much room for advancement within the company besides store manager and that is it. Sales associates do not get paid for the hard work that they do.
good,Sallys used to be a great place to work but now they're changing too much and are showing how little the care about their employees. Not great to be a manager or sales associate.
good,One thing I liked about working at Sally's was u could learn something new everyday and no two days were ever alike. We learned quite a bit of knowledge from our hairdressers who come in to shop. And I loved my customers a lot of them came to be like family.
good,"work with customers helping find products to help them with hair,cosmetics,skin care,nail products that works best for them."
good,"I learned a lot working here it was fun learning new things sometimes I'll be alone for 3 hours till the next worker comes in "
good,You dont NEED to go in with product knowledge but it obviously helps if you know a little about doing hair. If you dont know about the products you'll know everything there is to learn about them with-in a few months.
good,On a normal day at Sally beauty it’s really a relaxed controled environment we would get a couple rushes throughout the day but we could always handle it because our manger was such a great teacher! She saw the potential in me and she pushed me to do better. The best part about Sally beauty is the relationship you build with everyone around you from coworkers to you favorite customers!
good,They recognized their employees and rewarded them for a job well done. The hours allowed you to still have a home life.  The only bad thing I can say about the company is that the pay is low.
good,I absolutely love my job and team I work with but corporate is trying to micro-manage everyone and doesn’t have a clue what actually happens at store level. This company prefers you have some cosmetology background but will not pay what you are worth.
good,"Enjoyed my time there.  They paid a consultant to evaluate their processes and they did whatever they told them.  Don't agree in eliminating all employee relations reps.  with the layoffs, more people will be calling, with concerns.  However now there will be no-one to answer their calls"
good,Nothing  to say on here. It is stressful fast paced it is not a stand behind the register job. THIS company will always come first that is the top priority nothing else matters. Period.
good,"I would always do most of our shipment boxes while manger refused to do any then got mad when they weren't done on time. On multiple occasions checks were misses hours because manager didn't approve  payroll on time. Didn't get approved for availability time change when it wasn't optional, ect."
good,"Sally's was alright at first, I honestly have wanted to be a cosmetologist since i was 12 and this was as close as i was going to get without having a licence. It was so fun to help people but my co workers were competitive and my boss was petty. Specifically would make me upset on purpose. It wasn't working out, I wont continue to work for someone whom doesn't respect my full value."
good,Sally is a very reactive company.  They  tend to follow trends in the beauty business rather than create them. 
good,"It was a nice first job. The only problem was that the lunch breaks were only 30 minutes long, even if you worked 9 or 10 hours. Other than that, I enjoyed this job very much and miss it sometimes."
good,"I enjoy everyone that I work with for the most part.  We lost a good manager and after she left the assistant manager took over as our Manager.  I feel like the job title has gone to her head and is not fair to everyone. She is telling some that we have to cut hours due to sales, but turns around and gives another employee more hours.  I loved my job, but since I am a single parent I cannot not afford a cut in my hours."
good,Working at sally beauty helped me work on my customer service a lot. I was able to become more confident with my communication skills. I liked how I was able to help people using my bilingual skills.
good,"The girls can be petty, and the manager doesn't take your needs into consideration (mostly scheduling) She also just sits in the back all day on her phone leaving you on the floor alone. The incentives are pretty nice, for every beauty club card you sell you get like 10 cents or something on your pay check. Same thing with the ""Iom"" or the center items at the counter."
good,One of my favorite retail jobs just wish they held up their end of the bargain as far as pay was concerned. Had a very hard time getting paid what I was actually worth here.
good,"Sally Beauty is a fun store to shop and work if working with individuals who are focused on the customer, and bettering customer service. A typical work day at work  is usually slow until rush hour, or on the weekends, but normally between two employees it is manageable and not overwhelming. I would have stayed longer if management was more efficient and less combative when it came to scheduling and duties to perform. The most enjoyable part was being able to successfully help a customer and see that they are relieved and happy."
good,This job was very competitive and fast paced monthly deals drew a crowd at the door before opening. I loved the customers here and all the products the best thing about this job was the discounts and the worst I would say the changing of managers and no stability.
good,"a day at sallys includes daily duties, work on shipment. theres always something to do, customer service is a priority there. the better you do your job the more hours you get to work. its a good place to gain work experience. theres always something to learn. new products montly, everything you need to know wil be in the traning books."
good,"en mi experiencia,lo único que no me gusto es que no había tiempo para capacitarme ya que siempre hay cosas pendientes y mi gerente distrital era muy exigente así que yo me sentía incompetente para el puesto."
good,Mucha rotación de asistentes y no tan favorable los horarios que cambiaban en la semana.Marca excelente como empresa. Buenos descuentos.
good,"very slow days, not paid well, not very good hours, and doesn""t work well with your schedule. It is very hard to get days off you need. Mainly always working weekends."
good,"Its alright, nothing over 20 hours or less. good pay and breaks but over all just really strict part time. Truly a great company to work for nothing bad to say really."
good,"Good company to work for if you qualify for benefits. Hours can be intense during the holiday season, but with a strong team it can be a lot of fun. Must love people and retail environment."
good,"Company is currently going through excessive changes in leadership at top levels and is experiencing mass turnover and drama throughout.  Not the same company is was even two years ago, no longer employee friendly.  consistent untruths and deceit from upper levels."
good,It's nice to work with a small staff and you get to build relationships with customers and other employees. I like being able to help people feel good about themselves and it's very customer oriented.
good,"Company is restructuring, so they are hiring like crazy right now. The education you'll receive in training on various beauty trends and how-tos is nice."
good,"Save yourself the stress and just go work somewhere else! This company gives little credit where due and the small staff of USUALLY girls, very drama filled."
good,"Management long hours and lots going on through out the day lots of moving parts , lots of changes in stores  made it difficult to sell and work with customers . The customers and staff is the best part but upper management and office did not communicate well to lower levels which made difficult to relay to stores and not on same page ."
good,"Sally's was a great part-time job while I was in school, I just didn't make enough money there. And the manager was just terrible. Other than a few issues I had, it was a great job."
good,Company is behind the times with technology.  People tend to go to work there and stay.  Ability to learn different areas of work.  Has onsite cafeteria.  Overall good company.
good,The hours are horrible but the job is very simple. The DM is very rude. You mive up very fast but you are paid at a set rate so once youve gotten the assistant management position you wont get a raise or anything the only way youd make more money is to be manager.
good,"Although store management was amazing, head office managed to always find a way to belittle you and make you feel uncertain of your abilities. On top of all that you work like crazy for them and your yearly raise is maybe $0.10 to $0.15."
good,"Sally Beauty is a good place to work if you're younger (18-25) and just starting out. It's retail so we all know what that entails. I don't consider it to be a job that can be a career unless you're looking to become a District Manager or Territory Manager. Sally Beauty is very number oriented, meaning there are goals you need to make, which is common with retail. This company expects a lot from you (specifically managers)."
good,Sally beauty is a good company but so many things are changing in this work field especially in the higher up such as management. It's not the same and the work is not worth the money you earn. They do give some good incentives but all the hours and work you put in gets overwhelming for the pay.
good,The job was great at time but management was awful. Scheduling was off and they didn't know much about benefits if I was eligible for it. There were a lot of co workers that were good to work with.
good,"My opinion of a  typical day at work is providing good customer service in consulting and advising them with their concerns in the beauty world.. I have learned to resolve complaints in a timely fashion, organization and time management. Management involved maintaining company budget, keeping up with the company standards, payroll, banking and managing employees which was challenging but attainable. The co-workers were of different personalities but worked together to meet the challenges that were presented when needed. The hardest part of the job was learning the job with very little supervision with the opening of a brand new store. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction which resulted in higher sales."
good,"Hours are horrible when you're full time, but still flexible if you have other obligations and hourly wage is horrible."
good,"Buena empresa salario y comisiones jefe directo imss, prestaciones de ley en mi caso horario muy extendido y descanso entre semana no fijo variaba dependiendo de la necesidad de la empresa"
good,Good job if your into the retails work industry. It can be a great place to grow and advance with the opportunities they constantly have. Keep  in mind that in the retail word you have to be flexible with your availability.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of consulting with customers about hair products, as well as stocking products.The experience at at this job was overall good, and I had no difficult working at Sally's. The staff were great team members.However, there was no security or benefits in this job. I enjoyed working one on one with customers who were consulting with hair color products."
good,"A typical day could range from a lot of customers to only a few. "
good,"Customers are the number one priority, luckily there are a few people working at a time so it's easier to get the job duties done + help every customer with their needs. Helping people figure out from scratch, or just in general, what they want to do with their hair, them seeing them the next time they come in with their new 'do and how happy they are. As a hairstylist, having access to make-up and hair products daily helps me out with my appearance, and my work outside of work."
good,"- Poor management."
good,"Working for Sally Beauty Supply cooperation had its ups and downs. Management was hard to work with, they were a bit unprofessional but were easy to get along with. I learned A LOT about skin and hair care which i still use to this day. My co-workers were awesome team members and well educated. The hardest part was being knowledgable on products that customers rely on for a good appearance. Sales and bonuses were a plus as well as the free weekly testers and samples"
good,"typical day at work: daily paperwork, bank deposits, checking financials, keeping staff up to date, schedules, correction counts, customer service, price changes, responding to emails/voicemail's, making sure everything is up to date and my team is aware of any updates."
good,helping customer find products learning latest trends the only down fall is upper management as a manager you need to always be their the pay is not good and if you cant find coverage for your shift you can not call out even if you have a doctors letter
good,"I used to feel as though the company cared about their employees, but they do not. Some of those that are in management take it way too far and micro-manage to an unreasonably high degree. They try to belittle you instead of giving proper correction to help with improvement. I respect the new CEO however I don’t see the sense in some of the changes he has implemented. Due to those changes my position has suffered tremendously. Come April of 2016 I will have been with the company for 11 years and have had little to no opportunity for advancement. I never intended on taking my search for a better career elsewhere but I have to do what is necessary for me."
good,"I learned setting sales planners, accounting with outside sales, and helped with management duties when management was away. Small workforce, so must have a dependable team. Learned wonderful sales skills."
good,"Manager was very unprofessional and rude towards employees and customers. She often ""played"" the company when it came to paperwork and was very unrealistic when it came to assigning employees with tasks."
good,"Sally Beauty is a fast pace work environment. A typical day is helping customers with any questions and cashiering. There are requirements you have to meet from sales quota to ratios for KPI's. KPI's include how many club cards you sell, extended protection plans and items of the month. You are also responsible for inventory correction counts, putting product out on shipment days, backstocking, and making sure the store is clean and presentable for customers at all times. The management here is okay depending on what store you work for. Most of the managers are new and have no idea how to run a store. A couple managers that have taken over stores have pushed old employees out to hire new. The new district manager was hired almost 6 months ago and has just started training. I have personally learned a lot for this company and love the people I have met along the way. The employees are extremely friendly and helpful."
good,Been working at Sally's for about a year and i must say I love my job. I would love to apart of this company but due to my management I had no choice but to seek other employment. My manager acts like a child and to be honest doesn't know how to treat me and my  other coworkers. I again love the company but for the fact that I have been their for a year and already seeking other employment.
good,I had a lot of great days working there. But I had problem with a co worker. She would trash about me behind my back to the customers and the manger and her was good find. So I would get in trouble for her mistakes
good,My job was great until the last 2 years where I have without any time off. My Territory Manager is awesome and very supportive but my District Manager is not helpful. I love my customers and making them smile when they get the right product but the hardest part of the job is when I have that customer who wants to come in screaming but I can calm them down.
good,"I work t the corporate office.  It is a great place to learn, but not long term"
good,"•	Providing satisfaction for difficult customer’s needs"
good,"the store manager @ the Trussville location is very very unpleasant. I do not see how she has managed to stay with the company that long.?   the store has very poor scheduling, too many things needing to be done that aren't getting completed in a timely manner because of her micro management!  also there has been more than one occasion where all of us employees were@ risk of an illness that she was aware of and still made the employee come in with it."
good,"Maybe it's the fact it's a brand new store. Maybe it's harder to open a store than I thought, but logic would tell you don't do so unless you're100% ready to handle any hiccup along the way. A typical day would be price changes, or stocking, or fronting and facing. Oh yeah, and giving a flyer to everyone who walks in the store and answering the phone with a very long ""power line"" that you have to take a breath during to finish saying. After 5pm, dead. Dead dead dead. I don't know if it's because they just opened and not a lot of advertising, or the local stores around closed at 5, but you were lucky if you got two people- who most likely came from walking the center after dinner. Sure, I learned a little about hair care, a little about developer, such as a 20 will lift your hair 2 shades, a 30 3 shades, and so forth, but I wanted to be more confident, and I never got that training. I'd get a fast paced glossed over rundown, but I'm not a hair person. I never went to beauty school, give me something to read! Zooming over it like I know what terms mean or a basic idea of what it does is not how I learn."
good,"I was store manager, i would open store, do paper work, also would do the ordering and changes prices while i was assisting customers. I learn how to use a lot of beauty products. It was a team work all the time, the hard part of the job was too many hours and not enough people to help in store but over all use to love helping customer with product and suggesting what was best for them."
good,The pay was ok. You WILL learn a lot about health and beauty. You get to meet a lot of professionals and are able to learn lots of knowledge people pay for in school. Only real downside is that a lot of what you learn is what you pick up speaking with professional customers. Pay rate is average. Management do the best that they can with what they are given. 
good,I liked working for the company and I learned a lot about beauty products and hair products
good,Management is unprofessional and does not practice any ethnics.
good,"the management was horrible, shady, i loved working there but no communication and very messy workplace."
good,"Majority of your day will be one on one with customes, need to know about all product in detail and how to use, alot of ringing, floor plan changes and use of phone. You will get alot of customers with complaints of products and rough situations at times with customers. The management in certain stores are horrible along with a bad team. Co-workers are alot of drama and some but not all have horrible customer service. Even if a small store its very stressful because amount of work loads, goals, customers and co-workers."
good,"so this job teaches you to express yourself, if you are a shy person you wont be for long. you learn to talk to people you learn to upsell and responsibility, very great first job."
good,"Provided great customer service by answering questions, resolving complaints and handling financial transactions with over 100 customers daily."
good,"sallys is a nice workplace, but once again I do not make enough money there to support myself. The environment along with the employees is very laid back and nice. Its nice to see customers walk away with a smile on their face, and our help is very appriciated there."
good,"i liked this job, but when i walked in on the mananger taking money one day and asked me not to say anything. i called her boss and then next day she fired me..... as far as i know she is still working there and i have no desire to go back."
good,They provide a little work / life balance. They expect a lot out of the employees. Does not always own up to what is mentioned or discussed. Pay is low.
good,"This is a good job if you are young and want to move around a lot and have a car otherwise it shows you a lot of hair knowledge you learn about hair dye,perms,combs, etc."
good,the job isn't terrible if you know what you're doing and your boss isn't a liar and your district manager doesn't talk about things they couldn't possibly know about.
good,Fast paced call center requiring dealing with sometimes complex customer issues. Coworkers are friendly and helpful. Manager's support varies. Software issues. Sometimes deal with complex escalations.
good,Good entry position for beauty industry with a heavy focus on customer service and familiarity with loyalty and reward programs to encourage repeat business.
good,I have been here a long time with this company and I have always loved my job but as time goes on I feel the pay does not the best considering everything a manager actually does.
good,This company has a extremely high turn over rate with employees due to lack of organization when projects are needing to be handled also how training is done. I enjoyed my time at Sally's but there was no job growth.
good,"I really liked being given the opportunity to learn about the science of color, and about hair health. The monthly gratis was an advantage, and made it easier to learn the product in order to sell."
good,I like the products that is offered to the customers.  I enjoyed some of my time working with the company the treatment could have been much better.  It was a pleasure serving the customers.
good,"Easy going job. Part time mostly. Had to keep up with maintenance, customer service & inventory. Weekends can get busy but mostly easy flowing. Flexible at times."
good,"I loved working at Sally Beauty, my coworkers are lovely, in the locations I worked at least, but customers can be very hard to deal with sometimes and do not realize that we're only there to help and give them our knowledge about the products. Management seems to expect so much from employees when employees don't really get rewarded for the amount of work expected to be done. Also, I've worked at 2 locations for these company and the security isn't so great, or you might even say we don't seem to have any. But it's fun at times when you get to share your knowledge with ladies/men in the industry you might be in, in the beauty industry. Meeting professionals in the beauty world"
good,"Manager was great.   Company on the other hand wasn’t the best. Constantly changing the operation of the company. Also tried to say I was stealing from customers, the district manager that I had when I started made the manager I had wrote me up because I didn’t get to organize and clean the restroom after finishing my daily duties (after being told if I couldn’t get to it that day it was perfectly fine)"
good,"Upper management sucked. I heard it's even worse now, years later. The free products were cool, and earning the trip. I've had worse jobs than Sally's, but better by far as well"
good,"La empresa en sí es buena, lo malo es el personal, hay muchos favoritismos, te exigen demasiado para lo que la tienda vende, no te dan permisos porque no hay personal para cubrir, pero sin embargo si quieren que te quedes más tarde o llegues más temprano ahí no debes protestar, cualquier queja les vale y si quieres crecer debes ser preferida de la distrital"
good,"Loved the people I worked with. Definitely a place that is fast paced, a lot of hours, and potential to learn a lot about structure of running a business."
good,Sallys is a fun place to work they have a pretty flexible schedule and friendly people. Sallys has helped me in my understanding in how products work and how to use them safely.
good,"It was a constant stress of what is being said behind your back. It makes for not a good tram playing environment. You would go to the boss and it would get twisted when told to the higher upd. Then it went from there and nothing solved, but more negative working environment."
good,A typical day at Sally's Beauty supply consisted of interacting with customers and providing information about products to the public. I enjoyed this job because it was very pleasant to interact with men and women and advise them on which beauty supplies would fit thier needs. I also enjoyed my co-workers ability to work as a team and lend a helping hand if needed in a busy situation. I admired the managements flexibility in staff's scheduling needs and commitment to ensuring a positive work environment at all times.
good,It was a great job. The manager was laid back and chill but I never felt like i could move up in the employee scale and I never got the amount of hours I was told I would receive.
good,"I'm writing this so no one has to go through what I did. The pay was decent for part time, but more often than not, I was really stressed out. They really push you to up sale and they don't tell you this up front. I'm not licensed, I have no previous experience dying hair or trying a ton of products, but I was under constant pressure to make the sales goal. Over this past week, I worked 7 days with no days off. If I were to stay, this would have continued another 2 days making a total of 9 days working with no days off. My manager took a vacation and another co-worker quit. I manned the store alone most days, and all but one day was closing. We were slammed the last 3 days and had little time to get stock out. Well, it comes to today, and the MOD says that the co-worker that was supposed to be with me was leaving early and that I had to make $500 in sales as well as put out most (if not all) of the stock by myself. I might also mention that I'm diabetic, I haven't eaten all day, and the MOD told me I could eat the meal I'd bought if the other girl would stay. The other girl gave me 10 minutes. I went back and broke down crying I was so stressed out. I thought someone would tell me they were leaving, but no one did and I only learned when a customer called out for me. This was my final breaking point. I went up front, checked the line of customers out while I cried, called the MOD and quit. I was not going to bend over backwards for an employer that wanted to work me that much, leave me by myself, and stressed me to the point I cry in front of customers. In short, Sally keeps"
good,This place pays minimum wage and never gives full time hours. It is a stressful job. There is always something better than this place. The employees discount are good though.
good,"The company was a great place to work for almost the whole time I worked there, except for the last two years.  I worked in a great department with great people.  Once the company started to under-perform, and mass layoff events started to occur, obviously the work environment became toxic, and everyone walked on pins and needles. I hope they turn things around because there are still some real good people there.  It was hard to watch the company sour after all the years of success."
good,Beauty Advisor do everything a manager does with no bonuses. Beauty advisors have to do sometimes the managers work but there is no kind of reward or extra payment. We make goals and sales for the manager's to get bonuses and we get nothing in return. If we don't make our individual goals we get penalized for it. The job is nice for his discount and monthly rewards but the manager doesn't even tell you about that. And employees have to check each other's bags and coats.
good,"Never a dull moment. Constant flow of customers, and there were a ton of big personalities coming into the store wanting discounts. There wasn't much advancement or raise opportunity. You job relied on your numbers/percentages, but only if they were negative. Positive/good numbers never got you anywhere."
good,"Loved the job very fun place to work at always learning new things great company and you get to try new items that come in, they take care of employees"
good,Customer Service is always first priority and reaching sales goals. It's a fun place to learn about new products. If you are a people person then it's a great place to interact with customers and help them find the right products they need.
good,"It wasn't a spectacular job, but it was a good, relaxed starter job. Very little to no involvement from corporate. It taught me the basics of being a keyholder and helped launch my career in sales management."
good,Very difficult to achieve sales since a new Sally was opened just 5 miles from my store location.I normally was able to make goals but the new store took my Riverview customers from me.I was done 714 transactions from October 2018 to January 2019.
good,"Working at Sally Beauty taught me a lot a about opening and closing stores, the behind the scenes of managing inventory, and the importance of switching up the front displays in order to sell certain items more effectively. It was an amazing, layed back environment where I felt very comfortable asking as many questions as I felt nevessary to learn as much as I could about how to manage a store effectively."
good,This job is focused on beauty products for professionals and is very rewarding if you are in the industry. The hardest part of the job was the limited hours and opportunities to advance.
good,"It was a long time ago that I worked there so I don't fully remember my experience. It was the right job for me at the time, and paid my bills, but there wasn't any career advancement."
good,I was with the company for 9 years. I enjoyed working with the crew I had and the customers were great. It was a million dollar store that I ran. Started off as a sales associate and moved up to Store Manager
good,"i liked working at salley especially if your in to hair and makeup , you really leaarn alot i liked working there i got to learn about hair products, and hair in genral"
good,"* mejorar  ahorro "
good,"Job was awesome I loved it. The manager was great as well. Customers were always very good. Very busy help alot of people with picking out products for hair, nails, etc"
good,It's not a bad place to work you will learn alot from working there a while. The company has changed a whole lot since I been working there it's not the same as it was. They have got ridden of there internet site for employees to buy things with there pts u earned
good,"I was working there for a while and the manager was clueless on what steps to take for my training (which i never completed by the way) in the 3 month span i worked tbere and had me on the floor working anyway. Very very very poor management, would have family members stay in store in the employee room when they weren't supposed to, didn't know how to operate the Ipad for work, didn't take the correct steps for training."
good,"Sally Beauty was very disorganized when I started working there. As time went on and my position in the store increased, the store became slightly better."
good,Working at sallys is a great beginner job. It can get very stressful with very few staff working......................................................
good,expect to work parttime hours between 15 - 20 hours a week... managers work 45 hours and assistants 40 hours. things are always changing. customer ser
good,"I enjoyed the people I have met. Enjoyed learning new things. Our discount is nice to have. It’s a nice company to work for. I think it’s fun to be able to help the customers, seeing the smiles on their faces and having them revisit us is nice as well."
good,didn't care for the company and turn over is high. the management and the way things are done is really sad and its a fun place to work if they had it together!!!
good,"Really busy everyday I had to work."
good,"fast paced, non stop working, fun if you love hair and beauty. lack of advancement, no benefits, and no increase in pay, High expectations expected from store employees but no incentive."
good,"Very high turn-over rate, but overall not a bad place to work. The pay isnt great and you have to train in people often, but just your standard cashier job"
good,alright place to work for and a kind different environment to work in can be very fast paced at times but its been awhile since I work there could have changed since then
good,"No favorece el horario, te cambian de sucursal constantemente o te mandan a cubrir  por tiempo indefinido"
good,"It was a typical corporate atmosphere. Med-high turnover in my department. Initially this was to better opportunity, but eventually because of a person promoted to supervisor who made the environment unbearable. This person has since left the company so things went back to normal. Or as normal for an ever expanding company could be."
good,I had enjoyed working for Sally Beauty until my store manager was unfairly fired from her position.  I and my coworkers couldn't stay with a company that would do that.
good,"It was a very easy job and friendly atmosphere. Pay isn’t competitive unless you are a licensed cosmetologist, but even then it’s nothing great."
good,District manager was new so anytime anything negative was brought to his attention he was to timid to face it. Which put everyone in a bad work environment.
good,Teammates  and customers make this an enjoyable place to work. Learning about beauty and all the new techniques was amazing. Co-workers become your family.
good,Working for Sally Beauty was a great experience for me it helped me accomplish a lot in my life  and it was a great pleasure working for Sally Beauty supply.
good,"I had a really good staff that got along well, that made the workdays enjoyable. We were in a far off location which made it fairly tricky to get assistance from district managers though which made it difficult at times and kind of tied our hands."
good,"lots of customers , love the environment , products . management and staff are very professional. place is well organized ,  as company wise i loved working there ."
good,"Over-all an enjoyable place to work, although changes were inconsistent with upper management and employee incentives were considerable if KPI's were met."
good,"Sally Beauty is a fast growing company, with lots of room for growth. I enjoy engaging with the customers and putting a smile on their face. I reach classes"
good,"Working at Sally Beauty was very laidback and fun and had a lot of great benefits, such as the discounts and the monthly free samples. However, the pay was not so good."
good,I worked alone a lot of times because there wasn't a lot of business. There was a lot of stocking to do. The employees had a decent discount on beauty supplies.
good,Sally Beauty is a great place to work. It offers flexible hours and a comfortable work place. They offer great incentives each month. Associates receive free samples once a month.
good,"It's a nice temporary job, but it's nothing to keep for long-term goals. It's a fun job in the beginning, but after working there for three years and not being able to move up in the company, it's easy to lose interest."
good,I don't really have much to say about it.  It was an okay place with okay people but it can be very competitive  and stressful with the fast working pace
good,"Also known as sales workers or salespersons, sales associates sell retail products and goods, such as beauty, hair, salon products etc. Sales associates work with customers to find what they want, ensure a smooth sales process and process transactions."
good,I enjoyed majority of the people I worked with here however it is mainly a great job for people just getting out of high school. very flexible schedules which was fantastic and amazing discounts.
good,"This was my second job and learned to manage cash register,stock shelves,worked back stock/shipment, so basically learned everything and how to sell products."
good,It was hard to work with the public in this area. They aren't very nice which made things hard. I don't like working with the public very much. it can be really stressful.
good,"managing day to day operation of sally store is hiring, training staff, customer service, sales, store inventory, cleaning, keep up with stock of the store, managing a from 2 to 6 people, increasing sales all year around."
good,"Sally s was a great place to work very fun and relaxed it was a great experience, great customers, and great employees. overall it was a great job in my reference."
good,Not really any different than other retail jobs. The difference is the people are more open to suggestions on products because most are coming in with cosmetic problems they want fixed
good,enjoyed my job for the most part. fun with the right people and management but manger of store is the highest you will go without being willing to move
good,Like helping my customers. Managers tries to as flexible as possible with our hours. Dont agree with some of their policies. They are more about making the $ rather than bringing a customer back.
good,"Greet customers, bank deposits, offer membership to customers and  fill back on products on shelves.  The hardest part was when we received freight, because it was only two of us stocking merchandise on shelves.   I really enjoyed helping customers and answering questions."
good,"Pay was minimum wage. But i loved working here, i loved the ladies i worked with and they customers that came into our store. it was a very comfortable working environment."
good,"The only give you 20 per week, management get 40 hours per week, I love helping the customers with the products purchaser and explaining how it works."
good,Its not a bad job I would recommend it for a young person someone that is not single and has a lot of bills like a college student or high school or housewife
good,slow in the morning when you first open. Depending on the weather kinda tells us if we are going to busy or not. It is really under staff and no employees stay working there.
good,manager was great at making job duties fair for all employees and making sure we the employees were up to date with new prices policies and products in the workplace
good,It was a fast past place yo work for. Managers were willing to work with ya if need be. Not a bad place to work for. Hours were good for having a social life.
good,Freedom to have you hair anyway you wanted was great and helping people find their right products are perfect. Management is decent and employees get rewards for selling certain items.
good,"Managers are required to work 45 hours weekly, 9 hours daily, 5 days a week. I learned how to self-manage and train others, but the workload was nearly impossible to handle."
good,it's been so long since i worked here. i don't really feel i can give a good review. i just remember sometimes having to work by myself. i also remember always having to do truck day with like only two people.
good,"Competitive, Fun Specialty store with free samples and points for selling certain items that you can cash in for a gift card or items with the Sally logo on them.  Learned more there than I did at Beauty School."
good,Working at Sally's is a great experience because I get to learn about so many hair care products & hair coloring techniques. Depending on the location you start to create relationships with your regular customers.
good,"Preparing organizing duties"
good,Of course it get hectic but working at a fast was not the issues sometimes just customers themselves would be a little rude but overall 75% it was always great as long you have the right team
good,I loved the work - beauty supplies and customer service/retail but I had a co-worker that harassed me daily and nothing was done about it - so I left:(
good,Sallys is a pretty fast paced place to work and also kinda down just depends on the timing. Awesome people to work with and great management . they care alot about their employees and they offer insurance.
good,"Great, relaxing work environment "
good,"I didn't mind working here, did for about an hour 1/2.  My only complaint really was that I was the one always having to work the holidays or mother's day because I didn't have kids and the other employees did."
good,"it was okay, the people were all older women i was the youngest so i got singled out for some of the jobs that they felt they shouldn't need to do because they were there longer"
good,"At one time a very good company to work for. Ok pay, good benefits. Good environment and good products. Very heavy workload for managers and upper management. Hard to keep employees with low pay. Company is not making sales goals and this caused a restructuring and company wide layoffs."
good,"assisted customers with selections; organized,priced,and put out new stock;prepared store for nightly closing; management is different with each store; the workplace itself is a laidback, fashionist, and/or stylist dream"
good,"They make you work the hours they want. You are at the company's beak and call. The good thing is you get out at around 8-9pm. Have to have knowledge about hair color, cosmetology etc."
good,I like my job but doesn't pay enough for all the stuff I have to do. it's an easy job if u aren't a manager. The company keeps on changing and is getting more stressful
good,Employees have time to get to know each other and help other in trouble. The store manager is wonderful in sales and guides employees through the process.
good,It was a good place to work at for as long as I did. I was part time but had moved to where I was almost full time and I enjoyed it. The hardest part would be the complicated customers that we all get.
good,I didn't mind working there. While i worked there they went through 2 managers so it was kind of rocky to start but it did get better with time. I loved the discounts and such though.
good,I worked here for years help people find the things that they needed in the stores .. To me it take you to work at places like this to opening up more in life meaning not all people are bad..
good,Loved working here while in college for cosmetology. Had my daughter and didn't come back as I didn't have a sitter for her. Very good management and pay for students.
good,"Very laid back place to work. My manager was great and her job and very helpful. The upper management set goals for the employees that weren't realistic, other than this one problem I enjoyed my time working at Sally's. The employees were given free samples when a new product came out so we could try it ourselves and have first hand experience when making recommendations to customers. This was very helpful and made it that much easier to be good at my job."
good,"I have worked at two store locations in the 2 years I've been with the company and my co-workers in both locations are wonderful and the store managers and assistant managers are easy to work with. I love the beauty industry so the job is (or was) perfect at first. But the company as a whole has MAJOR flaws. The biggest being in the IT department. For months the  (point-of-sale registers) have been malfunctioning an intolerable amount and the billion dollar company is too cheap to fix the issue. Software is from the 90s and in this day and age, the computers should be automatic and not require employees to memorize 100+ coupon codes for every sale that change every month. 65% of the time the codes don't even work and we are stuck manually adjusting transactions and going back and fixing messed up transactions. The registers freeze up super bad on a daily basis. It often can take 5 min for a sale of less than 10 items. NO EXAGGERATION THAT IS HOW SLOW THESE COMPUTERS ARE. There is no sign of future change. If they were to fix that it would be a much more enjoyable job. There is also barely any room for advancement. Basically you would have to be the managers favorite and get promoted to assistant manager and wait years and years for the store manager to retired and take over for her. Then MAYBE become selected to move up to district manager. Not impossible but pretty freaking hard. Also the company is realigning and making big changes. One of them was firing a large number of district and territory managers who have worked their way up from the bottom (which like I said was hard"
good,"The management works hard to have flexibility with employees schedule needs. There are monthly incentives staff can win for sales goals, and each employee gets several free products every month to try."
good,"my manager liked to bring personal life in to work. always gossiping, nepotism. training wasnt bad. always busy, endless tasks, teamwork oriented. usually coworkers dont mind helping you if you have questions."
good,The company itself isnt a bad company. Its just unorganized and they make promises they cannot keep when it comes to pay. I left because they shorted my salary paychecks twice and would not respond to me when i asked for back pay. When they finally did they ended up only giving me a portion.
good,i was fairly new not even a month after i was hired manager was away for 2 weeks. and our employee called out and i was left to open and close store on my own.
good,"It was ok , I just needing something better suited for a someone with a family. I thought the pay was bad, and the raises. It's an ok job for Retail. That is what I have to say."
good,Sally's was a great place for me to transition into management. I had a wonderful store manager who intrusted assistant manager position to me. Thanks
good,"Loved learning about all the products and helping customers. All the side projects were fun and kept you busy. I did not appreciate how management worked. It was not very consistent, and there is a lot of drama with co-workers considering everyone that works there are usually younger girls. The pay is kinda low in my opinion for the amount of work and expectation there is, and for meeting certain sales goals. The 20% discount is wonderful"
good,Its was an okay job while in undergraduate  trying to better my life . Not much to say about the company . Its okay .. only worked full time for a few months
good,I enjoyed working here! I loved helping guest with hair and nail products. There is some many different supplies to choose from. I and loved my discount!!
good,"My team is great. My immediate supervisor is great to work for. Working in Denton is nice because it is a college town, so there are plenty of things to do after work in the area."
good,"Customer service is the main goal here, you must meet sales goals for target items. You do however earn points that you can later spend. Setting up new displays every week."
good,"Fue un trabajo muy bueno donde adquirí muchísima experiencia laboral, aprendí como relacionarme con el personal, pero lamentablemente es una empresa con muy poco crecimiento laboral."
good,Working at Sally Beauty Company was rewarding in the sense of learning about inventory and supply and demand.  The atmosphere was nice ans easy going.  The management was fair.
good,I was a key holder which meant that I had the responsibility of opening and closing the store and making sure that shipment had been placed and received. Co-workers tended to be lazy and untrustworthy and we would always have a high turn over. Management was very supportive and only wanted the best for the team. The company needs some work.
good,"Enjoy working here, love the discount, love my boss and her boss. Always something to do and new things to learn! Lots of positive change in progress/coming in the near future."
good,"A typical day consisted of cashing out customers, processing orders and keeping the store in stock. The breaks are standard and there is plenty of overtime."
good,This was a decent place. I liked all the products they sold. The ion color was my favorite. Some of the customers were not so nice while others would sit and talk all day if they could.
good,"I enjoyed my job, I learned a lot about the products I had to sale and I became a better sales person because of it. However, the opportunity to move and and get a raise was not an incentive with this company. And I was given a lot of manager responsibilities and was acknowledged or appreciate by the District manager for it. She made sure I wasn't transferred to another store once I moved. And I took that personally because I felt they were mad that I was leaving. And I say that, because I was really doing succeeding at doing a lot of the work that needed to get done to help the store succeed. I really wanted to continue a career and hopefully move up in the company. But once I left my manager was fired months later. I'm not sure if it was just that district, but I feel like they should replace the district manager. She pretty much threw the managers under the bus anytime things didn't go right."
good,"retail job included stocking and moving product, cleaning and trash duties, register training and money handling duties. store was often slow but would pick up at times."
good,"There was always productive work to do; putting truck away, working on end caps, displays or organizing to fit new products in. The pay wasn't great and there was no opportunity to move up."
good,It is a good place to work overall. The manager is understanding and works well with what is going on in your personal life. The employees all work as a team.
good,It was an ok company to work for. the management wasnt so great neither was customer care other than that it was a fun not so strict workplace just needs better management.
good,"Very enjoyable job. Helping people  by changing their looks and educating customers of how to achieve the look they desired. Satisfying and would return for your next opinion. Upper management was in my opinion , hypocritical and insincere."
good,"At Sally Beauty Company, the position I am currently working as is a Sales Associate. In this position, I helped out customers and also worked the cash register. The hardest part of the job is making sure no one steals. The most enjoyable part was bonding with my coworkers and manager."
good,"The pay , management, and customers were great. Good hours and benefits. Nice place to work. great incentives. The customers are very nice and friendly,"
good,Selling beauty supplies to both professionals and non-professionals. I would help pick out hair color and teach them how to apply them and what to not do.
good,i had fun working here learned alot more about  hair and beauty period had a great manager and great customers most of them hardest part about the job was keeping up with all the changes
good,It's nice place to work and very informative place to work when it comes to learning about the different hair products. And hair coloring.
good,I really don't have any back things to say about Sally's. It's been a good company to work for since I've been there. I can't say it will be the same for someone else.
good,"Sallys is a Fun safe workplace. Our boss bends over backwards for each employee. Each coworker has their own way of certain things, but its all a big learning experience. The dos and don'ts of hair color and makeup. I will say the hardest part of being a Sallys employee is remembering that the customer is Always Right."
good,I worked here while finishing up college and it was a lot of fun. I had learned a lot about hair and make-up. I had to quit because I had to finish up my internship and they were not willing to work with my school schedule
good,"Come in greet customers, clean store, be a cashier, help customers with picking out the right product and at the end of the day count up register and clean up the store for the next day. My time at Sallys Beauty Supply was very educational to me. I learned tips and skills from other stylist. My customer service was sharpen a lot. I knew how to use most of the products and I had to tech people how to use them on their own then a few days later I got feed back if my help worked. The hardest part of my job was having to handle an satisfied customer but with the help of a manager or other employee I was able to handle it and I learn a lot from it. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers and feeling happy that I helped them do something, that my tips worked to make their image look better."
good,Teamwork is the key to building any organization and without that you will fail. Need to have open communication vertical as well as cross the board within the unit.
good,coworkers were awesome to work with but administration was a bit weak with implementing rules. this was my first job and was a great start to my career.
good,"Working at Sally Beauty was a mess. I liked the job itself, but they did not adequately train their employees to do things correctly."
good,"Management was always supportive.  Challenges were dealing with internal and external customers, Team was knowledgeable and hard working"
good,"It was a decent job, just needed better management and better working conditions for their employers. It would have been a great job if the management wouldn't take advantage of their employers."
good,"You clock in, put on your smock read the daily duty sheets, then you start your day make sure you read the quota which how much we have to sale such as ioms beauty club cards etc."
good,"Fun place to work. I enjoyed working here, upper management needs work and help with their skills. I was management at the local store but district manager was incompetent."
good,"This was a good start to my employment experience, through which I gained a strong sense of work ethic, responsibility and customer-oriented service in working with the public."
good,the co worker are so nice and helpful but I wont go back there the manager is unprofessional. Rude and like to make employees feel bad.
good,could have been better they did not know how to talk to you and sometime look down on you but some day was ok it was a job that pays the bills
good,Sally's was very educational for me. I enjoyed meeting and educating the customers on hair products as a licensed Cosmetologist. It was a big help.
good,"It would be opening the store doing paper work and balancing the cash drawer, then checking emails as well as acknowledging them, rotating back stock, shipments on specific days,  price checks, labels, front face, take out garbage, and throughout the day helping customers and then closing the store along with maintenance, "
good,"i learned a lot of things there about product ,hair color,daily paper work and the most important part how to deal with different type of customers,the management is good and the co-workers are very friendly,the most enjoyable part is on shipment day which is every Wednesday."
good,"minnimum responsibilities , basic store cleaning, servicing, and stocking products. depending on what location you go to the customers your get determine the location."
good,"Typical day at work consist of helping customers with a welcoming smile, keeping store clean and organized, be a cashier and always be informed of what you are selling. Nobody feels secure when they buy things from someone that has no clue of what they are selling, managers usually make sure to teach you verbally and with videos product information and general directions you should share to someone that for example wants to ombre their hair."
good,One of the worst/best jobs ive ever had. My co workers were so wonderful and it felt like family. The higher ups were a bunch of jerks who treated the sales associates like garbage.
good,"Working at sally's expanded my career knowledge. I worked part time, and I felt like I was going to beauty school all over again. they provided free products to test out. I worked with hair color, wax, I was also a sales representative and I stocked products on shelves every day"
good,Enjoy working with the public and helping them make decisions.  I also think that it important to maintain a clean and attractive store.
good,"A typical day at work was helping customers find beauty supplies that was best for them. I learned a great amount about hair color and different beauty products. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping customers find what they needed and seeing them leave with a smile,"
good,"it was a fun, interesting place to work. Could have used better management but the over all job was great. Working with such diverse customers and really educating people on products for the future was great."
good,"Fun work environment for those interested in the beauty industry. Supportive & helpful co-workers. Easy to request schedule changes for appointments, or swap shifts in case of emergencies."
good,"Sell beauty products (hair, makeup,etc.) and educate customers about pros, cons and usage. I also stock shelves and keep the store clean and neat."
good,"I handled customer service and sales throughout the store. Helped to stock the shelves, Cash handling, bank deposits, and overall cleanliness of the store. Inventory, staffing, paperwork, filing, and all day to day activities needed to run the store."
good,"I loved working at Sally BeautySupply because there was always something to do. A typical day at sally beauty was, what we called nine hundred dollar day. Customers would consistantly come in and out of the beauty store all day. Male and female, from open till close. What I learned is that even though you deal with the same problem over and over agian. Every person that walked through the door I was their new experiace, because of my knowledge I was at their disposal. I have learned to manage a team.And get through shipment days that just seem impossible because that store was so small. The hardest part of the job was the loss prevention. I was intrested so much I have exstensive training in loss prevention now. Best part  of the job was every customer remembering the last experiance we had together for the two years I was there and asking about me after I left."
good,The manager in this setting liked to keep up drama and tried to play the co-workers against each other. Didn't enjoy the pettiness or the cattiness.
good,Started as sales associate and promoted to store manager.  Hired and fired staff.  Ordered and stocked inventory.  Job required long hours.  Learned how to manage people and build the team.  Served professional stylists in selecting products for their clients.
good,"The job itself is very enjoyable, but I was constantly discriminated and disrepected. The manager is very forgetful and blames everything on the sales associates."
good,"I have never worked with a district manager who could not care less about her employees if she tried. Despite that the work environment was fast paced, I got to know all of my customers and learned quite a bit about cosmetology. A great place to network. The best part was the benefits at full time!"
good,"Nothing to complain about here. I enjoyed my coworkers, the management, the customers and my job titled."
good,"Wasn't there long enough to make an assessment about the company,"
good,"Pretty boring.Boss was very unorganized and so was our entire store because of it, Nice people, otherwise not too great."
good,fun place to work with friendly and helpful beauticians that have very good product knowledge.
good,"great opportunities working for company, love the store, the people in the store. the things they offer to employees"
good,"I mainly drive a cherry picker, I've learned alot using the scan gun."
good,I had a problem with management but it was all over an okay job.
good,"Helping the customers is the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job due to different preferences in hairstyle, color, etc."
good,"Everyday I would come in and work the register.  We would also have to put the truck orders away when they came in. I only had one manager, and she was pleasant.  I had few co-workers, but we all got along well. The hardest part of the job was having to put a large amount of inventory away in a short amount of time."
good,"I learned excellent customer service skills from this job. A typical day there was very busy. I was constantly on the go working on projects given to me by management as well as helping customers while still being a cashier."
good,customer focused work area. A typical day includes store promotion planning and assisting customers/
good,"A typical day at work consists of mainly writing reports of daily occurrences,  searching employees and using CCTV. Working at Sally's Distribution Center has taught me to be more vigilant and be more multitasking. the fact that we work very closely with the management team has helped all parties create a professional and enjoyable working environment where mutual respect is paramount."
good,"Out of my 15 years of working face to face with customers, I have found that working at Sallys was the best work experience so far. Every customer who came in I would greet and make them feel welcome. Going around to each individual customer asking if they need help or have any questions or concerns about a certain product.  Its very rewarding seeing the customers leaving the store happy and satisfied with the purchase they made and gives me a great feeling knowing I was the person that helped them."
good,"For me it was a good ""in between jobs job"".  I did enjoy my co-workers and the location was good.  I did gain some knowledge that I still use today."
good,All aspects of the cosmetology field are taught. Great environment if you like meeting new people.
good,Learnes how to work with customers in different situations
good,It is nice to have the opportunity to be rewarded for making sales.
good,Competitive environment which is great for a salesperson.
good,I am a cosmetologist so I love working with hair and makeup products.   I enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"I did enjoy working for Sally's but there were also many downfalls to it as well. I was a key holder, so I typically would open or close the store. I enjoyed the many tasks I was able to preform and I learned a lot about beauty products and selling. "
good,This company is a good starting place for people that are in cosmetology school or just into hair and beauty.
good,It was a ok experience. I learned to handle alot of cust at once.
good,"My typical day at work was to ensure that all staff members have fulfilled their specific duties, for example delivery acceptance, etc. Other duties also include handling store operations on how to ensure all daily store actions are completed and checked off by myself. Building good customer rapport by delivering excellent customer service and ensuring store standards are well maintained.

good,a great place to get your supplies and the management is extremely friendly and helpful no matter what
good,It is a safe work enviorment for every deparment with a managment staff that really cares.
good,"Helping customers find the right hair color, help customers find the right nail polish, or hair products, shampoos, conditioner or hair spray. Work well with my employees.  hardest part is when we get a shipment of 100 boxes or more. most enjoy is seeing a customer leave happy."
good,not very good management. employees bringing their personal problems to work
good,"On a typical day at work we helped customers find beauty products to fit their needs and explained how to use them if necessary,  I tagged and put up shipments every Monday.  I helped train new coworkers, I helped the DM and manager reset the store, get ready for inventory, and price changes. My favorite part of the job was working with our customers."
good,"Working at Sally is like being in a salon, answering question from almost every customer, on their hair problems. In the location of my store made it hard to make my sales for the month,(year). The employees I worked with was a hard bunch at first, they was use to a manager who did not work along side of them . Now they have my back. I do enjoy helping the customer fix their hair problems but at times it gets to be to much . I can not fix everything"
good,"pick and pack customer orders"
good,Love the retail field! Only because i'm a people person. I really hate working the weekend. I hate working weekend because i'm a family oriented person.
good,"very fun place to work for"

good,Helping those in the beauty industry can be a challenge but rewarding.
good,fun and easy mostly sales and customer service with learning about new products people are young and upbeat.
good,Loved trying out all the new items. Changing the sales ad was very tedious.
good,"Everybody pitches in with every job. Your not assigned just one task, you learn to multi-task quickly but accurately. Very diverse blend of customers that I've learned to make feel comfortable naturally in both good and bad situations."
good,"Everyday the store needs to be clean and front faced, put any back-stock that my need to be put out. Always have 100% customer service and make sure you're always busy. The job is not that difficult unless the manager leaves the store for to go to another store or on vacation and expects you to take care of the store like a manager, but you do not get paid like one. I love working with everyone and help the customers find what they need."
good,"Assist customers, and redesign product display layout to maximize exposure and sales for the store. Also prepared office paperwork and managed four employees including: hiring, training, and terminating."
good,"I worked monday through friday 9am to 10 pm. my job consist of counting the register, depositing the cash out into the bank,organizing the item also being a sales person."
good,I had to open and close the store for the mgr sometimes. Helped the customers find the right product. Had to order supplies for salons. Take orders over the phone. I had to call salons when their products were ready. Unload the truck with the merchandise on it. Maintain the maintenance of the store. And also run the cash registers. At night count the registers and get the money ready for the morning so mgr. can take to the bank.
good,"Great experience to learn customer service skills,also you leave with knowledge of hair care as well as product knowledge."
good,"Easygoing, productive work.Cooperative atmosphere and good Company training"
good,I was part-time when I started. I worked hard to make it to managment. I learned alot with this position. The most enjoyable part of my job was repeat customers and helping others find what they were looking for. The hours where the only thing I didnt enjoy about my position.
good,pays low hours are too long management doesnt like to work....
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people everyday. The hardest part of the job was the standing around with nothing to do while waiting on the customers to come in.
good,"For Sally Beauty being Retail - the perks are good. Every month, employees get one or two products free to try - and we earn points for selling certain things, and we can then redeem our points for items in our employee rewards catalog."
good,Sallys was a long hard working job since I was manager I was working any where from 50 to 70 hrs a week and this was salary.
good,Loved learning all the beauty products and getting incentives for upselling. Pay was ok a lot of theft. Liked getting to know the stylists and customers built relationships with customers. Getting to learn how to dye hair was fun .
good,"its retail, just with a more laid back attitude towards piercings hair and aesthetic expression. ringing people up, stocking hair products, suggesting things to customers. pretty easy can be stressful with customers."
good,"Hmmmmm good luck. The store managers are great it’s their managers  that don’t talk to you right . Its not the best but it could be worse but for all you do , you don’t get paid enough ."
good,Put a lot on us managers for the money they pay. Policies change often. Planograms are constantly changing. Not really enough time to get them all done especially when customers are in the store and you don’t have enough people to help you.  For the amount of work we do we should be getting paid more.  Good help is hard to find and the turn over of employees is not good. They do not stay long.
good,with new changes in company it becoming stressful they want you to all these changes we doing our work (mangers) and district mangers work they don't want to paid more but asking for us to do extra duties on top of our regular work load and if not done threaten your job
good,To get to know and understand everyone you work with.  Follow up Follow up Follow up.  Make sure you research and investigate as much as you can upfront before asking questions about a product or project.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, but it was a weird overall experience between constant changing co-workers and management and the customers. I worked at two locations, one being very slow paced and the other being the opposite. It is mundane work, stocking, ringing out customers, helping them find products, and some cleaning. I would recommend for students or people not looking for a career."
good,"Management changes frequently since I left, but overall not a bad experience. The customers were often a pain and wanted everything for free. They were annoying but taught me how to do customer service."
good,"Manager was pretty awesome"
good,"I knew very little about working in Beauty Supply when i started, and only got the job in interim to pay bills.  I discovered that learning about the products was pretty easy, and becoming well versed in them to provide customers with a good experience made the job a lot more enjoyable.  Being able to give reliable advice let me build up a base of customers that would listen to my advice and would frequently agree to any add-ons i suggested."
good,I loved helping customers and building a relationship so they will always come back . I also loved that i worked in million dollar stores and was always busy.  I also loved the co workers i worked with.
good,"Has been an OK place to work. I would not be looking to leave if they were not cutting hrs. I have been working here for 22 yrs. and have liked my job the entire time, but retail has become a very tricky place to work with all of the online options as well as other stores competing for customers business..."
good,"Great place to work time goes by very fast. Great team work "
good,Management is poorly trained to do their jobs. I think the managers should at least be trained on how to do the work of employees being managed by them in order to be able to help with problem solving or technical difficulties.
good,"I worked with a great team of girls, running the cash register, tending to customers needs and questions, maintaining the store, meeting daily sales goals for the company."
good,I enjoyed working for Sally's and learned a lot about the retail business. I felt that it was easy to advance. Coworkers were amazing people to get to know. I truly felt like the overall experience was a good one. However more than 200 people were laid off without warning and given just 45 minutes to get things and leave the building. That was hurtful when I've given 8 years of my life to this company.
good,Too much travel & low per diem.  They wanted you to find hotels coast to coast for about $100. The food allowance only allowed you fast food if eating 3 meals while traveling.
good,"Sally beauty is a nice environment to work at, and it is also good for part time. I  got a good experience working there and I would to recommend sally to people who want to work there."
good,"The store was always short staff because the pay scale was to low, a lot of responsibilities for little pay, schedule not flexible at all, district manager at the time not helpful."
good,it was stressful sometimes but it was a good experience i appreciate everything all that i learn from sallys the work culture was great i learned how to stock how to do bank deposit
good,I was still quite new to my move to Steamboat when Sally's had opened in town. I jumped on the opportunity to work in an environment that allowed me to use my knowledge as a Hair Stylist. I received inventory products and organized display units and used my knowledge to promote sales to customers. I was able to learn and expand on what I had learned while getting my license. The store manager and I worked great together but saw lack of higher management due to distance of transportation. After awhile the slow pace due to Steamboat environment became hard. We didn't have a high volume of customers and finding tasks became difficult. I really enjoyed being around all the different products and helping the customers to figure out the best buys for them.
good,"easygoing, laid back environment"
good,Sally's Beauty Supply is a good store to work at if you are only looking for a part-time job while going to school or looking for a second job managers work very well with you and are willing to work with you if you require days off or having family emergency to me the pay wasn't fair because sometimes I would work full time but didn't get the amount of money I thought I deserve but overall was a fair job to work at
good,Customers were the best thing about working for this company. I thoroughly enjoyed my co-workers. The job could be hard on the body at times but the work was pretty easy.
good,For  the amount of work they want you to accomplish they do not pay accordingly therefore there is a high turnover rate.  The usually on hire for part time hours with most people getting no more than 20 hours a week.
good,"Customer service is first and foremost. opening and closing of cash register, setting alarm and locking up for the night."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company & the only reason I had to leave was to seek a better opportunity. You can help manage a full size store and get paid minimum wage. I took the experiences and gathered as much retail experience from it as long as I can. I would return if they have competitive or even a more reasonable pay for their staff. There former sister company which is Cosmoprof. Only open for the license professionals. They are the same. If you don't work as a Store Manager. The pay isn't reasonable at all.
good,Learned a lot about products and how to stock. It was a challenge to get employees to come to work. The hardest part about the job was making sure the blue notes were complete and the enjoyable part of the job was accomplishing
good,"working with customers and team members is always fun. "
good,great for part time but has no consistency day to day schedule. Manager is amazing and very accommodating Enjoy working but ethics and waste of company need to be reviewed.
good,Easy advancements if you apply yourself. Fun environment. Great benefits and perks. Monthly training to keep your product knowledge updated. Sales driven.
good,You have to be really into the products sold there. You have to be into doing your hair and make up every day. It's cool though because they actually take the timeto teach you about the types of products and how to use them very well. You even take short little quizzes and earn points to order yourself stuff. And when I worked there you got free samples of the months featured products. It's a pretty fun job when you have a good team who gets along well. I moved up from sales associate to let holder pretty quickly. And the best part is you don't have to have cosmetic or beautician experience. Because they do teach you about everything needed to know that the customer will ask about. It's a really good job for someone thinking about that kind of career also.
good,The job was a very nice place to work. I enjoyed learning new things. The job offers us free product so we are able to try and sell to the customers. Overall nice place to work.
good,"The company should be more aware of what their employees go through at THE ACTUAL SALLY BEAUTY STORE. As a employee for sally's, you are required to do store plan-o-guides, painting, moving gondolas, setting up new computer updates, and going above and beyond what is asked of you. I've learned that sally's is a very easy job when you tune out upper management, the question is always ""WHY DID YOU ONLY MAKE $$$ TODAY?"" and the answer is always the same, ""we've only had so many customers today and there is a 'love or return it' guarantee."" The co-workers can vary, I've had the pleasure of having great co-workers so far and of course some that don't know how to wok, but they leave soon enough. The hardest part of the job is knowing when you can and cannot say anything to a employee. Upper management always has different views on different situations, always call HR if any questions but then again that could be ""going over your district manager's head""."
good,"Management is horrible, extremely catty. Say they are there to help but never are. Loved what I was ding and the people I worked with. They also have a huge turnover rate, you do not make what your worth and it is extremely hard to move up to another position."
good,"Very quiet job, but it was enjoyable. Some days would go by slow if there wasn't many customers or much to do. Have to unload shipment every week, but its generally really easy. They're closed on major holidays."
good,El trabajo en sí es sencillo y más si te gusta lo malo que ami me toco una gerente super mala onda y solo hacía el ambiente muy pesado de ahi en fuera todo estaba bien.
good,"Sally beauty was a pretty productive warehouse, however the leadership could have been better. Supervisors didn't communicate well with employees which caused a lot of unnecessary stress and confusion. Also the employees were underpaid for what they did which led to multiple complaints and union talk. I did enjoy my job but the way employees were treated by leadership was unacceptable."
good,"Fun place to work if management team is good. Working and talking with the public was enjoyable, as well as talking to professionals about their tips and tricks. The company provides samples of new products as well as detailed information, which helps on the selling floor."
good,It was a good job but it was not a team spirit job. It was more who is better at doing there job then helping one another. But other then that I helped  customers with finding the right hair color for there right texture of hair and cleaned the floors when it was time to close the store.
good,"In general, very smart people work here and it's a great place to gain your first few years of work experience. However, the company is becoming very hierarchical which stifles innovation and restricts creativity."
good,I would have to help customers out everyday. I had to open and close the store sometimes.I would have to do manager duties and all other duties. I learned to smile everyday no matter what.
good,Enjoyed working with customers assisting them in finding the products they needed. Flexible work schedule and learned a lot about the retail business.
good,"Everyone worked as a team, helping customers is the main job, making their purchases easy, and making sure that they get home with the correct supplies. Maintaining a clean environment and a friendly place to shop."
good,"sally es una empresa muy buena, aprendí muchas cosas para mi crecimiento personal."
good,"I loved working at Sallys, I had a great time and learned a lot about product knowledge. The atmosphere was relaxed as well as fun. Great place to work if you are interested in the beauty industry."
good,"I have a lot of responsibilities. I open and close the store. Count all of the store money. I learned how to use their system. A typical day is great. Im just seeking better opportunities for my future"
good,"Sally Beauty was a wonderful part time job for a college student. The hours were some what flexible, and the environment is very friendly. Working at Sallys helped motivate me to stay in school for my degree."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is gaining easy fast knowledge of the products, getting a chance to try it out,  being able to take the knowledge learned and help customers find what they are looking for or new things to try for their hair,skin, or nails."
good,Sally's has it's moments but I believe that goes for every retail job out there. It isn't that hard to work there but sometimes can be difficult because of hair color specially on how to fix someone's hair when they themselves damaged it. The people I've worked with are some of the most funniest bunch of females I have ever had the pleasure of meeting and I think that's what makes me want to work there for a year.
good,Sally's was a productive place to work because we were consistently busy and it was informative because of the product knowledge that was learned to inform the clients and with my background as a stylist it was convenient for my skill set.
good,Loved being the store manager for this company but the pay was not accurate for all the amount of work that went with managing this store.
good,I enjoyed my short time at Sally's Beauty Supply. My Manager was awesome as were my coworkers. The only draw back was the low pay and how far it was away from my home.
good,"A typical work day I would do the daily paperwork, do the opening or closing of the store, manage the employees and what they were doing, assist customers with their questions, purchases or returns. Reach out to the professional clients to see if they needed any supplies and either deliver or ship their order to them. I would also check the inventory of the store to see what we needed, place the order to get it restocked. Then when it arrived verify that we got everything that was on the order form and put the supplies back on the shelves. "
good,"The work environment/atmosphere is a mix of optimistic progress and ""old-school"" restrictions.  This is in part attributed to the long-time employees in upper management who still enforce now antiquated and overly stringent rules regarding I.T. and the employee resources populating them."
good,"Retailed based job, serving customers, cash and till handing, answering telephone enquiries, aiming towards weekly targets and keeping up to standards of the mystery shop system. You were required to regularly maintain stock levels whilst greeting and serving customers."
good,"I loved managing here at Sally's but the pay i feel was not up to where i was working, And how many hours i did have to work to get everything done they required."
good,"A typical day at work contains doing paperwork, price changes, resolving customer issues with refunds and exchanges. Making sure that all employees complete there daily task before their shift ends."
good,I enjoyed working at the Columbus Sally's.  At that time it was a new store and I also enjoyed my upbeat and positive manager.
good,"Trained new employees"
good,You deal with typical retail customers so patience is needed. The co workers are great. Open most holidays. Product knowledge and great customer service is key
good,"I feel that Sally's could of been in a different location. Almost every day someone was trying to shop lift, and I felt very unsafe at night. I learned a lot about hair color, and what different products do for your hair. All my coworkers were nice expect when they would bring their personal business to work. The hardest part of the job was merchandising at the end of the month and holidays."
good,"profile new items, fix mix bins, pull transfers, i learn everything there is to know about a warehouse working here. I did pretty much every position here besides management. The co workers are nice and most of them work hard."
good,A typical day at  work here would start off with pricing items in the store. At the beginning of the month we were required to set up new displays and that would usually take one complete day to finish the entire store. And once a week we got a shipment of products that we had to unpack and stock and this would usually take two days. While working here I learned how to work with several people at once to get the job done in a correct and efficient manner. While working here I worked with all females and for the most part everyone got a long. The hardest part of the job was becoming easily exhausted on shipment days. We were required to be on our feet our entire shift and we had to do a lot of running around because our store was bigger than most other Sallys and we were only allowed a 15 minute break to rest each day. The most enjoyable part was working with so many different types of people and getting know them. I also enjoyed learning things about the products we sold.
good,"The most pleasurable part of my job was the customer interaction. I enjoy helping them find what they need and maybe more. Co-workers were always friendly, generous with help. The hardest part of the job was always going home. I learned a lot about different people, hair products used by different people."
good,I enjoyed working for Sallys and meeting new people. I would not mind to work there again.
good,"Overall, the job is a lot of fun and always has a ""family feel"". Upper management is wonderful, all the way up to your VP. You work hard, but it's certainly not difficult, just time consuming. You meet all types of people which is both rewarding and challenging. Sally's is a great place to work if you don't have to worry too much about providing for a family, because you don't get compensated very well. If you're a student, or even just a single person, it's a great job and very unlike any typical retail environment."
good,Chance to meet new people and form bonds with returning customers who respect your knowledge and opinions.
good,"My day at Sally's Beauty Supply was interesting to say the least. I loved some of my co workers they were like family. I would come in every day to something new. New products, new customers. I also loved working there beacuse of the interaction with people, I liked helping them find the right products for them. It was hard sometimes unloading the shippments every week, and you did have drama queens that worked there. But really it was a fun place to work just not for the rest of your life."
good,"i liked working there, the ladies that worked there made me feel comfortable, i liked all the different people that came in, i learn about all the different products which helped me help the customers, the customers always came first."
good,"Not much opportunity for advancement. Bi-weekly payroll was processed Monday through Wednesday (every week), no time off was allowed, even emergencies were frowned upon. Several areas in the Employee services group - not a lot of comunication, even though we all effected the payroll."
good,"Exigen mucho para el sueldo que ofrecen."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, aprendes bastante y aprendes a trabajar en equipo"
good,"It was an ok job, it could’ve been a lot better. I worked their for almost three years, and although the free products where great, it could’ve provided us with more benefits z"
good,I thought Sally's was great to work for besides the lack of training and lack of leadership in our district. I did love working there and my regular customers
good,"I had a great time and a great manager during my time at Sally Beauty, I unfortunately had to step down from my position because of personal demands/travel time based on where I was living when I worked there."
good,"Es una buena empresa porque te permite un crecimiento , el ambiente laboral es bueno en tienda. Los supervisores no son del todo buenos ya que no te exigen un rendimiento real al de las ventas, te hacen amenazas administrativas (suspensión de labores) por no cumplir metas de venta."
good,"Had alot of fun working here and learned alot about beauty. They train you on the job and you become certified in hair color and beauty. I worked under two managers and both were extremely nice and flexible with my college schedule. Small staff so plan far ahead for vacations. Even as a part-timer you get paid vacation time after working there for a year. All my co-workers were awesome and always lent an ear and you can talk to them about anything. Customers can be difficult and hard to deal with but that is the name of the job; especially working with beauty. It also depends on the area that you work in and what kind of people there are. Overall recommend working here if you are looking for a job that is relaxed, get paid time off and is flexible with your schedule. You also have alot of opportunities for job advancement if you wish as well. You also get pais reasonably (10.00/hr) as well."
good,"The restructuring of this company will be it's ultimate downfall. Employee hours are drastically cut. I've been a full time employee for 28 years. Now sadly, I can't make ends meet. This is how they reward my dedication. No choice but to look for another job, and I doubt that they will even care. I guess that once you accrue 5 weeks+ vacation time a year, you're not ""valuable"""
good,Good place to work in the Beauty industry you get to interact with people one on one you give advice from knowledge and personal experiences it’s important to know what you are talking about when discussing different products to customers.
good,"Just young looking to make more then $26,000 a year I had been there for 5 years and I was maxed out and no where to advance until"
good,"Sally used to be a good company to work for, however, the upper management has since changed and they no longer respect their employees, also, new company policies have been introduced that aren't even beneficial, nor do they make sense, it prohibits the workers from doing their jobs efficiently There is also a major problem with the distribution center, they never send promotional products on time and they never replenish stock when needed. the boxes are also usually damaged which renders the product useless. another thing is that upper management does not listen to the store managers about what they need. we have a thief in our store and instead of getting rid of her and increasing the hours of the high achieving employees, they have kept her on because on paper she looks good. I learned a lot from working here, but i do not suggest entering the company now."
good,"A typical day at work involved a lot of stocking, customer questions and store clean up. There were weird pressures to sell the club cards and have a high average sale which put some stress on employees. Customers could get really angry, but there was really nothing you could do about that. Employees got free testers on products every month. The inventory process was long and tedious, a lot of things about Sally's could be updated. The technology was something out of an 80's movie. The actual software/OS you worked on was horrible. Overall, it was a good job with a lot of great perks but the store work itself could use a major update."
good,"At Sally’s it was a great atomosphere and a great place to work; therefore they could not work with my college schedule. I need Tuesday’s and Thursday’s off to get in my college. While at Sally’s, I had to work those days so I went from college, to work, and then back to college those days which got to be too much for me."
good,"If you are looking for full-time work with full benefits and OK pay (starting at $12/hour), this is the job for you. You will most likely start in Customer Service working 10:30-7:00 (not ideal if you have kids). You will usually be required to take on more workload than you can handle without being too stressed, as the company just laid off half of it's people and they are making the remaining employees compensate for it. Be ready to deal with very angry customers on a regular basis, as well as very unusual financial business practices with regards to customer accounts."
good,Alot of work! Customer service no I'm with the items are for the Shelf hair coloring makeup shampoos conditioners shavers just multitasking is what we had to do
good,"I absolutely loved the job.  It was fairly easy, the pay was good, but my manager kept saying I needed to confront people stealing things, despite that being against company policy.  It was frustrating, but what really pushed me to quit was when we had a couple enter the store, both of whom had just recently been released from prison, and the man had been rumored to be armed with a gun.  I obviously kept my eye on them, but that didn't seem to bother either of them as the woman had grabbed a packet of hair extensions off the shelf and put it in her bag, all the while making eye contact with me.  As soon as they left, I got the license plate number and called the police to report what had happened, but none the less, my manager yelled at me once again the next morning for not confronting the couple.  I just didn't feel safe working there after that."
good,"I can't really say this place taught me all that much, because I already had a lot of retail experience going in. Overall I'd say it was a pretty ok work experience."
good,"I learned a lot from this company, loved the job and helping people. But the overtime and the management made it hard to have any life outside of work."
good,"Sallys is a great company, fun place to work. Reasonable pay. Great benefits. Closed Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas. As a District manager I enjoyed my position."
good,"The job itself is not difficult, but management needs improvement. Mangers are not trained properly and then it is up to the other employees to pick up the slack, which is unfair considering the difference in pay. What is nice is the flexible schedule. If you need a day off during the week it could easily be given and worked around. Overall it is okay, but it would depend on who you work with"
good,"pay wasn't the best but it was great for part time students. Management could be better, they rely heavily on inexperienced employees to do upper management tasks."
good,Typical day at Sally can be whatever you make of it. There are some very nice people working there at this company. There are some chances of advancement depending on your work ethics.
good,"Liked to meet and aide customers, enjoyed talking to them. Liked working with fellow employees and store manager. All were helpful when needed and supportive."
good,"The first week of your training flies by and if you have a great store manager they will make you feel welcomed and make sure you're learning on the floor as well. after a few months you should be a pro at all the products and day-to-day tasks however, behind the scenes there is a lot of other information and numbers to make sure you're up on. You have to have a certain number of sales and if you don't meet them the district manager comes in to play sometimes and my district manager wasn't the best team leader and sometimes I felt like it was more personal than anything. She was also not professional at times. Overall this job did have room for growth but there was a lot of stress that came with a part time minimum wage job and if you're not serious about this in the long run, it's really not worth it."
good,loved working for sallys. the pay could be better but the environment was enjoyable and so were the customers. Very easy going place to work with great peopl
good,I run the control desk at Sally Beauty Warehouse.  I am in charge of about 40 pullers and responsible for shifting them around in order to get orders out quickly and efficiently.  Responsible for keeping zeros at a minimum and communicating with different departments to keep the flow in operations running smoothly.  I problem solve on a daily basis and as chaotic as someday's may get it is my favorite part of my job.  I've learned how to deal with many different personalities and how to accommodate to all needs while staying professional.  I find it hard to move up from the position I am in and would love to advance and possibly make a career of this.  I enjoy the department I am in and the people I work around and it definitely has a great environment for the most part.
good,"A typical day at sally beauty supply consisted on stocking shelves to capacity, setting floor sets for new sales, educating customers on products, while also suggesting products to customers for their specific needs. ranging from skin care, hair care, and nails."
good,"More salary needed, fun work place, excellent customer service, friendly customers and employees. Overall Sallys was a nice work environment. Moved to Pennsylvania and decided not to relocate."
good,I loved working here there were great perks and you got to meet new people I had regulars that would come in and work with me. The company had great perks for the employees!
good,"They do ask a lot of you for not so much money. However, it's a lot simpler than most retail stores. Id say as a part time job it's a good pick, but definitely not worth full time."
good,forming a great team is important to keep the long hours of the day moving and to accomplish in store tasks. there is always something to get done or be updated. i have a great team always willing to learn and do more. the hardest part in management is managing my own life outside of managing the store. i enjoy helping people with their needs and working with my staff to make there job enjoyable.
good,"My days with Sally's were very rewarding.  It was very satisfying helping the customers fulfill their needs. The job isn't very mentally taxing, but my days were very busy.  There was always something new to learn about as product is constantly changing.  The benefits and incentives that the company gives are very nice and conducive for employees to succeed. The hardest part about this job was the balance between customers and corporate. I built up a repertoire with the customers that continues to this day."
good,"Puedes desarrollarte profesionalmente,el horario es un poco exrendido."
good,Every day at Sally Beauty i would be in charge of either closing or opening the store. This would include counting all of the money in each register. I have learned wonderful customer service skills and people skills. They provide benefits for full time employees.
good,i like a lot of this work is the only thing the pay is a little low but i love working with costumer is good pir also encourage their employees to sales and give awards to employees
good,"great company to work for great management  as well as great benefits for employees, the down side of the workplace is a lot of theft and you cant do anything about it."
good,Customers were slightly rude to employees. The job is very layed back and relaxed. The only pressure is with money and sales. GM was too quick to want to write employees up or fire them for not making sales.
good,"A typical day at work for me was getting all my paperwork initialed and signed, and either jumping right to the sales floor for customer service, or helping put out new products.i enjoyed my job very muvh, simply because i knew what i was talking about when assisting customers."
good,There really isn't anything hard about the job. I worked at Sally's while going to college full time. The only downfall were the managers I've encountered.
good,"Managment is okay, you just have to know how to take a joke. co- workers are ....i do not know how to explain them. The hardest part of the job is doing everything that you are required to do with little pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to get to know some of your customers. This job would best fit a high school student looking for an after school job."
good,"Had a great manager at the time and enjoyed helping people, flexible job, with a few perks..."
good,"a typical day at work is doing a great job and getting your work done on time. what i learned was inventory and great customer service exp. the management was excellent because they help me on anything i don't understand with no problem. my coworkers love me to come to work because i work hard and make them smile, the hardest part is when one of your coworkers don't do there job right. but the most enjoyable thing on this job is having to try new thing in the store before they put it on the shelf"
good,"A typical day would be stocking up the store, helping customers find the best products, checking out customers in a timely manner. I learned great things at sally's like how to open and close the store. Management was a great group of people that I loved to work with. The hardest part of the job was to open the store in morning and being there by yourself for a couple of hours, it was like a mad house trying to please everyone. I really enjoyed spending time with the customers getting to know them and being able to sell the right products to them."
good,"Managed very busy store with customers, stocking, register, pricing and tagging, opening and closing store, etc."
good,A typical day at work will be to greet the customers and helping to satisfy their needs. I have no issues with management they do their job. The co-worker have different personalities but it doesn't bother me because I work well with others. I enjoy meeting the people that come into the work place. The customers are of different ethnnicity and are very diverse.
good,"The company is very large but the culture has a very ""small company ""feel to it. Trying to make things better is a challenge as there are many tenured individuals who want to keep things the same. The ""hero"" is valued over the team player. The people are nice enough on a personal basis."
good,Typical day at work is helping customers out with the product they are looking for. Stocking shelves and keeping store clean and neat. Love working with all my coworkers get to work as a team to help out your customers the hardest part of the job is stocking shelves. The most enjoyable part is when you have returning customers and they are very satisfied with what you helped them with.
good,"On most days work was high impact,which I enjoyed, there was always something to do. As a manager, and a multi-taskter I started the day, opening my store, decideing which task needed to be done first, deligating the least important to my staff. Most of the staff ,were good workers and the customers where very nice. There was not really a hard part to the job.The most uncomfortable part was"
good,Had to deal with many customer services with different hair problems. Had to make appointments. Had to deal with all different ages.
good,"great work place, multitasking, communication with customers daily, team building, coaching, stocking, keeping a clean place of business, resolving customer complaints"
good,the store I worked in was a good store. we had good managers and positive attitudes. education for learning products and selling is available. great district manager.
good,"Its a fun job and easy. You get an amazing discount. But they are NOT happy if you call in sick. I got written up for calling in sick the 3rd time, I have been working there for months."
good,"There was always something to learn at Sallys, and customer service was always something to strive for. Getting to know the people on a one to one basis helped not only the customer but me as well, I was able to recommend the right product for the right thing. They do provide training which helps to better meet quota as well as improve customer service."
good,"There's room to grow if you create your own opportunity, however the company overall seems to be really unorganized. They take very little interest in employee satisfaction and rarely acknowledge input"
good,I loved working for Sally's than they made  A few changes some were good and some were very bad . Not allowing full time hours for regular associates. Not allowing promoting within the company started outsourcing jobs.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo a la hora ee comida t dan 2horas
good,The work environment gives you the opportunity to work within deadlines without close observation. The amount of hours given depends on the amount of business the store gets with good management though the store can run smoothly.
good,"In the short time in working for Sallys I’ve been pleasantly surprised, as much as the demand to be self sufficient and pretty much run a store within your first couple of weeks was daunting I’m glad I took the plunge.  I ignored the the reviews and just went for it. "
good,Sallys is good if you’re a college student and need a part time job or if you’re a beauty student. You get few hours a night. Normally 4pm-8 pm. Good part time job
good,I worked here part time and it was a great experience. A typical day on the job consisted of helping customers select beauty products that best fit their personal needs. Providing exceptional customer service throughout the entire shopping and purchasing experience is key to drive revenue into the store. The workplace culture was relaxed. Management was flexible with scheduling  and did a great job in providing the skills and training needed to be successful. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet for the entire shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction obtained from providing an excellent shopping experience for customers.
good,"Es un buen lugar para aprender y tener mayor experiencia laboral,se aprende sobre atención a clientes, manejo de caja, almacén, se capacita constantemente, la gerencia es buena y te apoyan constantemente, la parte más difícil de este trabajo fue la carga de trabajo a veces ya que tenía que desempeñar el puesto de cajera, asesora de belleza, acomodar mercancía al mismo tiempo ya que no había suficiente personal, lo que más me gustó fue aprender y ayudar a la gente."
good,"I love working for Sallys beauty, however l they can improve on the way they treat employees who don't hold a manager position."
good,"Sally beauty is a great company to work for with some really great benefits if you put in the effort, but there are some management figures who prefer to be bosses and not leaders. The pay rate for the work load is almost somewhat low."
good,"I feel as if you have to do too much for the pay you receive. I like that I have learned so much but I also feel like things i do, are management job title & I am not being paid for that. I love the fact I am getting experience but the company is too cheap to me. Personal opinion"
good,"A typical day at work was usually very busy either with customers, stocking shelves, or setting up displays."
good,At sallys you learn alot and they always make sure you know your stuff. There also always changing there ways of learning. But there a small company so you either working by your self alot and not enough coverage. There also not very flexable with you life.
good,My job is fun and exciting. My typical day is answering customer questions and helping them with everyday beauty issues. I love my manager she is always making sure we have what we need telling us the knowledge we need to perform our job and I know I can ask her anything. I can say she has become a friend. the hardest part of the job would be the competitiveness but if you know what your doing its not so bad.
good,"This was a customer service position. Very much enjoyed coworkers and my manager. Dealt with public, cashiered, open and closed business. The hardest part of this job was knowing all the products. I felt too much emphasis was spent on moving things around instead of training employees on all the products. More products should have been given to the employees to try or for a much cheaper discount, so we could give personal experience advice to clients. I was really surprised that wasn't a large part of the training. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I did know about products or merchandise and could give reliable advice for purchases to clients."
good,"This company was a learning experience,I would work thier again."
good,Billion Dollar Company that is very stable offers long term development and growth.
good,"Overall Sally's is a good place to work for someone who loves beauty.  Good atmosphere, competitive wages, benefits, etc. "
good,A typical day at work is customer service and cashiering. The most important part of the job is meeting new customers and serving their needs. I am happy when I see returning customers to the store.
good,A typical day at work is fast-pasted. I learned self-control and that the customer is always right. I learned how to up-sell to customers. Management is great. The hardest part of the job is when you have to do a bunch of things at once and still take care of customers. I enjoy my co-worker and helping customers but I feel like the pay is too low.
good,I enjoyed working there. I loved everything about that place. The people the employees. It fun to learn about people. I loved getting employee samples that helped us answer customers questions. It was a good place to learn about makeup; styling tools; hair colour; hair products.
good,"Deberian de cuidar a sus empleados ya que a veces el trato que dan, no te dan ni ganas de seguir."
good,It helps to have some knoledge on hair color and hair products. Depending on the store it can be extrealy fast pase and you dont have a second to sit.
good,"The team is very small so the job is a bit  more complicated to get done. Management has changed so its getting better. "
good,This is a great workplace if you love to help people and have basic housekeeping skills.  It's a friendly environment and the information is very easy to learn while training.
good,i learned about hair color. restocking the store. it was a fun place to work. a lot of young people working. manager took preference but she was okay. it was easy job
good,nice place to work at like the environment and the ppl are so nice to work with . love how we get free itemas everytime something new comes out in the store
good,"Received incentives to keep employees motivated, provides employees with sick and vacation time after 1 year, start as an associate and room to grow as an assistant manager and then to a store manager. Working at sally beauty supply is very typical with receiving shipments, cash register, customer service, cleaning, and motivating your employees to keep moving."
good,"We start by counting the registers for the days opening. Then make sure all products are restocked on the self. We greet quest and assist them with products that meets their needs. I learned how to take in inventory, and beauty products. Management is great. My teammates are very encouraging , and motivated. The hardest part not being able  to stay open longer for guest. The most enjoyable is t interact with guest love it"
good,"I really enjoy my time spent at Sally's. I feel like they've given me a lot of opportunities to prove myself and move up, and I feel like as long as you do everything you're supposed to do, it'll be pretty rewarding (provided you have a decent manager who respects you). Upper management can get a little annoying sometimes, but the real annoyance is usually the customers. You get a lot of super suepr entitled professionals that probably just wake up with the desire to yell at a retail worker. It can get pretty rough and most of the people I've worked with have cried at work because of customers being so brutal. But other than that, I really love the normal day to day customers and being able to help them and give them the information they need to undergo any beauty project they want. It's super rewarding to know that they'll be satisfied. Also, I feel like I've really grown having taken this job, because the previous retail job I had just treated me like a nobody and it was always such a routine and no one cared at all if I was there. At Sally's, I feel needed and I feel like I'm actually taking on a responsibilty that is meaningful, and to me that's super important."
good,"During a typical day at Sally's Beauty Supply i would greet customers, restock the store with supplies, and worked the cash register. I learned a great deal about customer service skills and how to handle cash properly and use the cash register. My manager was great, she was very understanding with school and was lenient. My co-workers were very friendly, over all it was a very friendly atmosphere and i enjoyed working there. The hardest part of the job would have to closing the store. It is very complicated at first, but once you get use to closing it becomes very easy and you get the hang of it. The most enjoyable part would have to be organizing the store, because i love everything neat and organized."
good,"-long hours but a lot of reward. "
good,"There were not very many employees at my store, but I feel I got a lot of training at Sally. When I was hired, I went through a book and videos to learn product knowledge and afterwards the manager really helped me and answered all of my questions. I learned a lot that I did not know, mostly about different hair coloring equipment and product. The hardest part of the job is hand labeling every piece of inventory. The most enjoyable part was having access to and seeing all the new stuff that came in (also dangerous because I wanted to try everything.)."
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers with their beauty needs, stocking shelves and ringing out customers. Management always gave great incentives and were very friendly and accommodating. Co-workers were relatively laid back and also easy to get along with, I liked helping people achieve what they were looking for when it came to their hair. Helping others being able to achieve what they're looking for always made me feel like my job meant more than selling supplies at the end of the day."
good,I loved it at Sally's beauty but I had some health issues going on and I asked them how to get help and Everytime they told me something it wasn't right ..so by the time I had went on my own they had fired me
good,"-easy computer system"
good,I was lucky enough to have an excellent team that I worked with. I learned tons about hair care and beauty supplies and am able to continue with that knowledge and apply it to my everyday life.
good,"I was the store manager for 3 yrs. I dealt with employees that stoled, lazy, call in sick at a drop of a hat. I worked at least 50-60 hrs a week. Maybe it was just the job pool. But redeeming thing is i had a remarkable amazing district manager. Made everything worthwhile to have him at ur back."
good,"Una empresa muy buena, con muy buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"When I first started working for Sallys it had a very friendly feeling and it was like my second home.  This was pretty rare for jobs at the time but that's why I stayed so long.  They have good benefits and I've loved all my managers.  Recently I moved to a new state and the district has a completely different feel, very cut throat and divided so it's hard to say that Sallys as a whole is a bad job, because its not,  I would say it's just the district I'm in at the moment.  I feel like I can no longer stay here so as a warning to others looking to join please check in detail the personality of the staff of the district you wanna join, before you apply.  They aren't all like this some are very team oriented and respectful."
good,"cahier,scheduling.sold beauty products,reruitment,interviewing,hiring, firing,training,evaluation,discipline,greeted and assisted customers,responsed to customers questions,and complaints"
good,"process payments, provided customer service, cleaned, assisted with customers needs. Counted drawers at closing, cleaned windows , stocking."
good,"Having a Cosmotologist license will increase your chances of hire."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, hay prestaciones de ley, también cuentan con sueldo base mas las comisiones"
good,"If you love the beauty world and are seeking something part time, this would be great for you. However, it usually take time to gain more hours. But if you work hard and express a desire to learn and get promoted it can usually happen for you. Be prepared to never call out as it is very hard to get a shift covered with a very small staff. I recommend negotiating pay if you have previous experience in retail/sales/cosmetology, if not you will most likely just get minimum wage. I have loved every manager I've had while working there for years which definitely makes you want to stay as well as a discount on products. Must be able to multitask and be very aware of your surroundings as there tends to be quite a bit of theft. Overall fun job."
good,"My position was very high demand, Loved what I did Company had great incentives for employees. Salary was fair, Growth opportunity was available! Long hours sometimes. Company is a great place to work."
good,"Loved job-coworkers and immediate management"
good,"I loved my job at Sally’s Beauty, but corporate made our jobs very hard. We had a maximum of 2 staff allowed per shift at a time. In this time we had to do several jobs at once that were unrealistically expected to be completed in a day. We are told customers always come first, but when we aren’t able to complete our other tasks because of busy days and an understaffed store we get in trouble. Not to mention they recently cut their hours budget completely, meaning instead of 2 people normally on a closing shift we now had 1. The area is a college town and the store is directly next to a liquor store, where fights have happened and dangerous people hang out. It made all of us being a complete female staff mostly under the ages of 30 unsafe. Plus their whole technology programs and P.O.S always have us problems and added on to the stress. However my coworkers and manager were amazing and we all became family. I loved working with the customers and helping them."
good,"Very amazing management, great employees and friendly customers."
good,It’s better to have no job then to work here period the management team sucks and they are lazy amazed at how ignorant se people can be when it comes to this
good,It was productive and fun and we got a lot of incentives. I was able to meet and educate a lot of people about the hair products and help them to understand the need of the products
good,"Meeting the people was good. Learning from some customers was great. But the manager was not a good person. I liked my job but my hours was cut, and I always worked at night  after loaning her some money so she made it hard for me to work there so she didn't have to pay me back."
good,"Overall my experience working at Sally's Beauty Supply was okay. It could have been much better if they didn't have a lot of drama, feeling there was no room for advancement because of clicks already made. Discounts did make working there delightful."
good,"I workes there for 6 months while in school. I typically had 3 or 4 hour shifts and worked almost all the time. I covered for everyone but no one not even the manager would cover for me if I had to do school work. She did schedule me after school hours which was nice. But I rarley saw her and all she did was leave sticky notes on everything I did wrong, and I never had full training. She did play favorites which kind of sucked. But it was a great experience to work there and I enjoyed it even when people were constantly leaving."
good,"People were rude, judgemental, scoffed at me for every little thing."
good,"Sally Beauty Supply is a decent place to work if you're looking for a part time job. They do train you in hair color (their biggest seller) so you can help customers find the best color for them without turning their hair green. "
good,"Es muy buena empresa, hay oportunidad de crecer laboralmente, adquieres bastante experiencia, lamentablemente tiene un horario pésimo que consume todo el día y no puedes hacer alguna otra actividad."
good,A day at Sally was an awesome day of stacking shelves and making sure every customer was well taken care off.  Great environment it will teach you ways how to solve peoples problems help people feel beautiful again. The bad thing about working for their company is that you don't  get paid a lot but its a learning process and it will teach you so many beauty products that you never even heard before.
good,"Depending on the store, business is usually booming or boring, and there doesn't seem to be an in-between. Work involves setting plan-o-guides, price tag changes, and general stocking. "
good,"A typical day at Sally Beauty Brands include a lot of customer service, getting to know customers and hopefully finding your regulars. I learned so many things about hair, skin, nails, there are so many things that I learned there. Loved my store manager, as for the district manager, when my manager quit, I got no help and the hardest part of the job was working almost 60 hours a week, running the store and not getting paid enough."
good,"There were two aspects I liked...customers and benefits. Like any job retail, it's success is based upon location. Location also drives the type employees you try to manage. Because the store's location was located in an economically depressed neighborhood, management never took its performance seriously. There come the classic problems of theft, angry consumers and those who lack an ability to spend, and a staff with lack of integrity and work ethic. For sales, management is willing to say anything just to get more work to drive sales. Where sales are an indication of store performance, it's hard and sometimes impossible during such circumstances."
good,Must like people and not Afraid to approach customers must know about hair or learn quickly must work well when customers are not happy must be able to close drawer and work in small spaces depending on the store
good,typical day was working from 10am-9pm counting money for tills and making them even. help customers with any questions. back stock products and use a cashier to ring customers up.
good,Great place to work get to help great people gained a lot of knowledge about hair and hair products good place for college students to work part time or after school for high school students
good,"I would make daily duties, make schedules. I learned a lot, management was okay. co-workers were fun, the hardest part was keeping a full steady staff. most enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,"Loved the Beauty Industry, Had fun coworkers and we all worked well. I learned alot in this job when it comes to beauty products. I had knowledge but it expanded alot more in this company. The hardest part I believe it was when we had to handle shop lifters. The most enjoyable part of this job was just the great experience."
good,"Sally Beauty was one of my favorite companies to work for. Unfortunately, the turnover rate of new employees made it impossible to get needed time off."
good,Good first job if you know a lot about hair and makeup. A bit hard on their employees to make unrealistic goals. You do get vacation time and a yearly raise.
good,I love working here but the hours aren’t good closing alone most of the time but very great costumers everyone is so nice. Employees get free samples and employee discounts
good,Would not work Sally Beauty company. They do not appreciate their employees. Work to many hours for the pay. They constantly watch over supervisors as if they are not doing there jobs
good,"District manager was never available, was very hard to get into contact with manager. coworkers made it a fun place to work. need to work on benefits and better pay."
good,"enjoyable job, pay is not good compared to certifications ... You get free products almost every month which is a plus, they can do better with the hours and the pay"
good,Sally's is a pretty cool place to work at especially if you are into the cosmetology field. Its fun helping people decide on  hair color and hair styles
good,"a day at work was restocking shelves, running cash register, credit card machine. take deposit to the bank. setting new plan o grams. cleaning. assist with customers. my coworkers were great. they were all young girls in beauty school. we had fun working together. they taught me alot about hair and nails and such. i enjoyed working with the customers."
good,"Working at Sallys beauty was a great experience, being that it was my first real job the  customers were great and the vibe of the work area was also amazing I meant some great people but it had its up and downs."
good,"I worked here after I got out of school for hair. It was a good place to work, the only down fall was that not many people worked there so it was really had to take off if needed because you didn't have anyone to cover for you."
good,Loving employees with wonderful customer service ensuring that ALL customers get their questions or inquiries answered in an appropriate timely manner. As well as exclusive help with any problems customers may be having.
good,Working at Sally beauty was one of the most exciting times of my  Young life. Each year that has gone by working for Sally beauty has been an adventure of its own. The regional director is amazing the company itself is amazing. Most of my coworkers are support of and  Hard working. I just don't see myself advancing in the company any further.
good,"Great environment to work. Fast paced, busy, ability to multitask. When you have a great team, your sales and numbers will reflect. Disliked corporate cutting hours and then not giving us enough to schedule people to work."
good,"Working here is OKAY at this specific store, the management is back and fourth. The region as a whole loses most of its good managers due to the inorganization of the company. There isn’t much room for advancement at all, the scheduling is pretty inflexible. No teamwork."
good,"Working at Sally’s is definitely fun. I learned a lot about hair care, color, and skin care! Now that I have more knowledge, my family runs to me for suggestions! The only thing I would like for them to improve is their hourly pay."
good,It’s okay just needed better management . Overall it’s a good company you learn a lot if your into hair because you learn all pros and cons with hair.
good,"La verdad no era mal empleo, bien pagado y la hora de comida estaba perfecta. "
good,"Sally Beauty is a fun and educational job, and has in-depth training for employees. Part of this training is the companies ""hair care 101"" which is 9 units and incredibly informative despite being so short! Working for this company was very rewarding, helping people find what products work best for them and make them feel their best was more motivation than the pay. One of the best parts of working their is that you are encouraged to express yourself through your hair, makeup, and (as long as its in dress code!) fashion! Unfortunately my one complaint would be that the company doesn't have an effective system for dealing with being bullied by coworkers (including managers!) making a report to HR does nothing, and employees will retaliate without being reprimanded. This only seems to be a problem in our state though, and I would absolutely work for this company again."
good,"They pay decently for people with experience, but it's minimum wage for those who don't. The work atmosphere is fun and relaxed, very tight knit. Good place for people in the field for supplemental income. They are very knowledgeable and willing to train those who are unfamiliar with the products. The hardest part of the job is the constant standing and the slow times. The perks I enjoyed were: decent discount in the store, free monthly products and you earn points for selling products on special that month. With those points you can earn gift cards, etc."
good,To tell you more about my experience at Sally’s beauty supply I would have to start off by stating the most enjoyable which was the great experience of learning about all of the products we carried throughout the store.
good,I liked the enviornment and my coworkers. this was a part time job and it fit my needs well. I noticed there wasnt much room for promotions and cross training.
good,"Sales, managed store, slow paced, laid back, stocked inventory, cleaned, sold items, greeted and assisted customers,responded to customers questions,and complaints"
good,"It’s ok but when you loose people so fast it gets tiring and frustrating because you have to fill in for them and you get no time to do anything for yourself, they over work you and don’t given you the pay for it"
good,"Sallys is a great job for those interested in all things beauty. Whether you are a freshly graduated from Cosmetoloy school or you just love anything skin, hair, nails its a wonderful place to start. While working there i gained knowledge on color and other skills because of their extensive training procedures which encourages growth in product knowledge and the company its self."
good,Basically this is a pretty fun job when you enjoy hair products and things of that nature. The pay is terrible and you go through to many managers with different rules
good,Great company to work for. Always room for advancement. Store managers have a lot to do so it isn't a job I would recommend if you have a lot of outside interests or a family as there is high workload and a lot expected of managers. Upper management (District Managers and above) are there for support when and if available.
good,working at sally's was a fun experience because i loved the environment and customers. I enjoyed being around the things i love that being make up and hair products.
good,"As a sales associate I check out customers, put out new stock every week. Answer any questions that the customers had. I got along with my Co-workers well, we pratice team work."
good,"when i started working there 2 years ago it was great. Learning about all the products and what they're used for was fun and helping customers achieve salon quality results at was the best part. when management changed everything basically went down hill. i still enjoy my ""job"" and what i am there to do but the environment had become very unprofessional."
good,i have been working on Sally for five years and it is a easy job plus you learn a lot. They have amazing  products for your hair and skin care. The issue is not having a team work and having a lazy manager that aspect that her assistant manager do everything for her and loves to humiliated her workers in front of customers. I love my store and my customers because i learn from them and they also learn from me. Love to hear their experience they have had on hair color but they learn from their mistakes. 
good,"Typical day at work was ordering product, price changes, restocing shelves. I enjoyed helping the customers with hair color, make-up, shampoo and conditioners. Enjoyed working with co-worker and manager was very nice and was available if needed. The hardest part of the job was no advancement and little pay."
good,I enjoyed working here being able to help the customers with different products. Helping customers find the best products for their hair. This was a great learning experience for me because certain products I didn't no the advantage or disadvantage of the product.
good,It is a very rewarding job full of customers who need help with product knowledge. Inventory on products can be a little frustrating due to the lack of organization in the company.
good,"There was consistently more work than could be completed each day and the culture expected completion regardless of time required to complete. Work/life balance was a low priority issue."
good,You must have an interest in Beauty and be able to learn products and about coloring hair. Must enjoy talking to people and listening to what each customer is looking for.
good,great job to start out in and process the about of time and difficulty to do cosmetology.Alos great with hands on experiences with customers first hand
good,Sally Beauty is overall a delightful place for customers to shop. They provide many options for any of your beauty needs. The associates are always welcoming.
good,Overall great to get experience there and was fun/productive. I got to learn about new items as much as I got to learn how to connect with my customers.
good,A typical work day is quite laid back with a slow pace environment. Helping customers with their hair adventures is a fulfilling opportunity. Just wish there were more options to help customers with their nail care.
good,sally's was a great place to work. was a very fun environment but we also got the job done and made sure customers were very well taken care of. management wasn't the best but the employees made the best of it
good,"If you have a great manager it is a great place to work. You become very knowledgeable in a lot of the product they carry and used in salons. "
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I was familiar with the store and the products offered. My cosmetology license gave me a great bonus to the company. I was able to make recommendations to customers with professional knowledge.
good,"It may be a beauty store, but you DO have to work. Shipment days are rough, and you don't have much time to get inventory put away. With that being said, the pay is pretty fair for a retail job, plus you get free stuff every month."
good,Sally's was an ok place to work.  Very easy for the most part.  Just depends on weather or not you have a family.  If you are willing to put the job before your family then they are willing to give you hours.
good,If you love hair and beauty this is a great job for you. Its pretty relaxing job. You get a decent discount on items in the store plus you get to try new products every month for free. You learn what products work best and what not to do when you are doing your own hair.
good,"It is a really easy job. I did enjoy the most part of my time working there. I love my manager currently but when something wrong is being done, there is no consequences to certain employees. I did not enjoy having to work holidays and no extra pay for working those holidays either."
good,"I loved working here. Would apply again if given another chance to work there. We received discounts and it was a great place to work, especially if you are female. You learn a lot about all kinds of products, too."
good,"Work sourseful space and underrated very busy stocking , the skill is a weekly needed service . Customer care was associated within the job title as well"
good,Having a background in cosmetology helps you help your customers. Most people come in needing emergency hair care or color corrections. Seeing all the new hair products and makeup was really fun.
good,"Came into work supervised the unloading of trucks, sorting of merchandise, stocking shelves, and ticketing merchandise. I learned how to handle large amounts of cash, made weekly schedules handled Payroll and Provided training and evaluation feedback to direct reports. Management was fair. The workplace culture was clean and fair. The hardest part of the job was making sure the schedules were made fair for all employees. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was having the same employees called in constantly stating they could not make it in to work and of course myself not getting my correct pay when I made Assistant Manager. Overall it was a good company to work for."
good,The job is fast paced and never dull. The people I work with are fantasic. The salary is not great at all. The benefits are ok.
good,"My overall review of this Sally's is ok. One thing I like, was getting the free products every month. Management was not the best at all! The store manager talks to you like you crazy. Don't mind calling you names in front of the customers. She will yell at you in front of them. You learn a lot about your own hair and nails which is a A+ for me."
good,"customers are awesome store managers are awesome, monthly you get free product you can build relation ships with your co worker and customers and you learn a lot of product knowledge"
good,"I have been working with this company since June of 2014, and I have had a lot of ups ans downs. Management depends on who your manager actually is, I have been blessed with 2 amazing managers, but the district manager is the one who has always been so rude from the beginning. A typical day consists of stocking, customer service, selling products, inventory, and cleaning up the store for the next day. I learned a lot from this job, as far as how to do payroll, open/close the store, order products we need, bank deposits, daily paperwork, etc. It is crucial to get along with your co-workers, there is nothing worse than working with someone you do not get along with, so make sure to make friends with them. I made so many friends at Sally's. The hardest part of the job is when you are extremely busy, and still have all your other daily duties to get done, you feel rushed, and the rude customer do not make our job any easier. The most enjoyable part would have to be working with my amazing co-workers."
good,"I am a licensed professional in the cosmetology industry for 16 years now. Sally is an awesome place to send your clients for their haircare and beauty needs after leaving a salon/spa.  We receive shipment on a weekly basis that is consistently stocked with new up and coming products monthly. Management is firm with their daily routine and expect workers to stick to the company's store operations.  The task of answering questions on how to fix box color gone bad may be the most difficult task for me.  I say this because as a professional i want to offer them a seat in my chair and ask how much time they have for a color correction service knowing that its not easy to do a color correction on your own head. Taking the time to be sincere and understanding to the customers needs only helps me better evaluate the situation and provide the best professional advice and directions. The best part is giving out freebies, laughing, always seeing smiles on both customers and co-workers faces."
good,Depends on which location you work. Management will tell you to take some product that is going to be destroyed and then you accused of stealing. They DO NOT like you to miss one day. I had food poisoning and missed one day out of the whole 2 1/2 yrs I was there. They were mad for over a week.
good,Loved all the tips they taught me on how to approach people and sell them items!
good,Employees had to much control over manager number changed people hours without notice or explanation during working hours.   Corporate handled it well but the manager level of respect and concern lacked professionalism
good,"This was a everyday job for me, i would say if your looking for a job with high hours this is prefect. And for me this was great i needed the hours they work with your schedule."
good,"Sally Beauty was great at the start, but as time went by management got worse. Employees were stealing products and hours were cut significantly. Even now when I go in I can see nothing has changed since I quit."
good,"Sally Beauty is about what you would expect for workload and expectations from a part-time job. There is an extremely high turnover rate here, but if you do stay they give decent raises as long as you consistently do your job without being nagged."
good,Sally beauty was a good company to work for but overall management as well as coworkers were not treating one another fairly. There was lots of favoritism in the workplace that was noticeable within management. Sally’s gave me the opportunity to meet great people in the beauty industry but as a worker I felt under appreciated. As a worker you would be going over and beyond for not even a pat on the back or being recognized for your hard work.
good,"El trabajo paga bien, pero es tiempo completo, te da 2 días de descanso lo cual esta bien, pero mi gerente nunca nos motivaba lo suficiente para llegar a nuestras metas o vender los combos, es lo mas difícil del trabajo, que aveces no vas a conectar bien con los demás pero lo mas bonito es la interacción con el cliente, los descuentos de empleado, me encantaba llevarme cosas probarlas y enamorarme del producto y poder recomendarlo con toda la confianza, de verdad que es un trabajo muy bonito y tu sólita te creas el ambiente de trabajo perfecto, amo sally."
good,"Stock shelves, cash out customers, count cash drawers, key holder, open/close weekly, put money in safe, make deposits, balance cash drawer, order supplies"
good,"Really good job if you like beauty products, they give you training on all the new products and every month get a free product to review for customers. you also have Items Of the Month (IOM) and when you sell those items you get points that you can redeem on the employee website they have a numerous amount of items you can redeem them for but we always redeemed our points for gift cards. You also have to be really good with problem solving and teaching. You get numerous of customers that come in upset either because they messed up their hair or someone else did or first timers coming in for their haircolor so you have to instruct them"
good,"I love working for the company, but management could definitely use a rennovation though. The customers are pleasant and always eager to be helped and there are a plethora of skills and knowledge to gain at the company."
good,"There was a time when one girl was out sick and I found out the other girl was stealing from the store. She was fired, obviously, and I was pretty much left in the store by myself from open to close."
good,Decent job if you are okay with traveling heavily for internal audit. weekends are very busy as well. Job itself is very straight forward and you get to travel to many places.
good,Sally Beauty is a good job for people who only need a part-time job. They offer employee discounts and employee incentives. Dress code isn't very strict.
good,"Always on my feet moving and communicating with many people"
good,Busy Day
good,"Tiempo completo, atención al cliente 100% "
good,I enjoy working there yet do not see much area for advancement. I would rather have employment in which I can advance myself into a career and is more challenging.
good,"Prior to the current overtime laws, you'd spend 50 plus hours in the store as manager.  The store typically operates with a VERY lean staff. Often if some called in as manager you'd either work to find a replacement or cover the shift.  Finding a reliable staff is key to reducing the number of hours worked."
good,I really enjoy Sally’s & the girls I work with. It’s fun being around hair products & helping people feel & look their best. I’ve had a great time working there & meeting new people!
good,"Very easy work place, fun, easy going. Manager is easy going and kind as well as the Sally Beauty girls. They fun and easy to work with. Overall enjoyable"
good,"Fun, free samples, laid back, stressful hit quota. Upper managment supportive.  Enjoy customers , atmosphere. Great hours, great company. Gre at co woekers"
good,"allot of customers."
good,"It was a good place to work and got really busy. There was always something to do and my manager was fair and professional. Customers could be very hard to deal with sometimes, but other than that, it's a great place to work at."
good,"company is going thru a restructuring process, If new programs are rolled out and there is a refocus on customer loss I feel the company will make a comeback."
good,"Working at Sally Beauty, I learned a lot more than I had known first starting out, you would get hands on experience which I prefer."
good,"I love working at Sally Beauty, however there isn't enough room for the growth I require in a career. I wish to move up and secure a position in a job I have pride in, and a future in."
good,"As a stotre i loved working for Sallys beauty supply, under the management i had i would not like to work for them. Although i had made it work for the best. I am in love with the industry, because its something i also want to stick around to."
good,"I worked with the best people at this job and customers were so kind."
good,love meeting new customers. loved meeting new stylist. shipment was fun. inventory was not. management was horrible at times (dm). floor sets was fun as well
good,"Okay job to have while in school. Best bet is to go in, do your job and go home."
good,it was my first job in which I was advanced into management. unfortunately it wasn't the best job to have when your a full time student.
good,"I really enjoyed Sally's. The gals I worked with were so sweet and fun. The job had its ups and downs, but I appreciated the hard work and dedication everyone of us put forth to keep the store up and running. I learned a lot about hair products, make up and nail polish; things I never thought I'd deal with. It was a great experience for me."
good,"This was a good job. I really can not complain. The only downside was on Tuesdays it got busy and a lot of responsibility was put on me even though there were 2 other people working with me. I asked about advancement multiple times, but never got an answer."
good,customer service is great
good,"Very clean work place, fun coworkers, store was neat. Never really had customer that were not satisfied."
good,Nice place to work  wish they paid more  and appreciated they employees more  they do have a very flexible schedule for their employees. But do not offer any health insurance for fragile employees.
good,"Personas anti éticas jugando a ser jefes, ambiente laboral con chismes y favoritismos"
good,"There is a lot of work to be done on certain days other days are rather slow. Pay is definitely not enough, but it is just a starting out job for kids. Management is good and managers are very nice to employees."
good,"Los tiempos son realmente pesados, y los pies son los que más sufren durante tu jornada. Los descuentos son agradables como vendedora, y las amistades que crearas en la empresa serán las mejores. Mi gerente siempre vio por nuestro beneficio, y por cumplir nuestra meta designada."
good,A typical day at work would be organizing and face fronting. As well as helping customers out mainly with hair color. Also answering all the phone calls the store gets and answering peoples questions. Making sure everyone left satisfied and found everything they came to get.
good,"outdated system, jose is kin of an arrogant territory manager, pay isnt great,great discounts get to see new beauty products first i really enjoyed the store manager"
good,on a typical day i would come in check our message board for any change in sales and new information. I enjoyed my job but the only negative part is when they choose a new assistant manager they chose one that had not been there very long and still did not know the job duties fully. They overlooked the employee that had worked the longest.
good,I loved working there. The team was very helpful and we all got along. I loved learning about new products and talking to customers. It was very satisfying to help a customer find what they needed.
good,"Enjoyed supplying everyday customers with help selecting products best fit for their needs. Upkeep of store was relatively easy, chemical spills were the most difficult to handle especially with customers in store. Shipments were moslty difficult, especially with larger shipments. Starting out, expectations for shipment were unrealistic. Higher-ups later were more relaxed and flexible when it came to bringing out shipments. "
good,"The job is just socking and checking people out, which is decent. I don't know if she is still a manager but my manager only thought of herself and not her workers. Hardest part was dealing with rude customers. Most enjoyable part was stocking."
good,"The Sally Beauty location I worked at had an amazing manager, she was personable, she worked along side you and knew how to organize her team. I know not every store is so lucky. My overall experience was positive. However one big downfall is that the job does not pay well enough for what it demands of you. Customer consultations were a majority of the work day, which are not easy to do. But the type of customer coming in was to no fault of the company, but they should be understanding the challenges, and how much mental and emotional labor the job involves."
good,"loved the customers and helping them figure out what they needed for their hair, nails, etc. District Manager was not the nicest or most understanding person to work for. Being pregnant i couldnt work 45hrs which is mandatory and he forced me to resign. Other then that and the pay for the work performed, everything else is smooth."
good,"A typical day at work would be to work on plan-o-guides, help our customers find what they need and meet their needs. We also had shipment days and those days and holidays were usually the busiest."
good,"I was really able to learn and grow in the customer service here at Sallys. I learned how to deal with many different situations that came up. At first the cashier system was confusing but once you get the hang of it, it was really simple."
good,Sally’s was an awesome store. Like any other there was drama but the drama level depended on you. Great place to work but you’ve got to be ready for long shifts.
good,I feel working at Sally's is a great place to begin your job marketing if you love working with hair products and customers.Te management was nice and caring.
good,Listen and understand helps when in customer service reading and overlooking products aswell. I think getting to know your customers helps when helping with certian products
good,"Can be a fun working environment, constantly busy, benefits are decent, vacation & sick days are good when allowed to use them. The hardest part was no regular schedule, times and days change week to week."
good,its a job where your going to hair school and get the credits and then leave. I'm not doing that personally but I highly suggest it if you are.
good,"Working at Sally's was a great place for me because I love the products and environment. You have to expect the customers who think they are right about hair care, in which most aren't, but you need to know your stuff! My manager was terrible. She accused my co-workers and I of stealing, when in fact, she was the one stealing and selling the products online. She didn't want an assistant manager, so the prospect of moving up in the company was nonexistent. We were also underpaid. "
good,The Beauty Industry is fast pace and always changing. The company offers competitive pay and many benefits. The most important goal is making sales. We are able to have flexibility in creating and implementing our own Management plan to achieve these goals.
good,"After four long years there, employees barely received decent raises and compensation for hard work and often 10hr days. After 4 years you only get up to 11 something, unless you're with the company 30+ years."
good,Its a fun store to work in very small but good environment to work in. Good incentives to work harder and achieve goals. Friendly staff and good managers.
good,"Es una buena empresa, con buenas prestaciones y buen salario, lo malo es de estar todo el día, sin rolar días de descanso."
good,"During a single work day you check back stock, maintain store cleanliness, front/face store, greet customers, and handle cash (ringing customers up). I have learned to work at a fast paced environment. The girls I worked with were the best!"
good,Was a great fast pace job good with schedule. Enjoyed the comradeship of the employees. Had great managers. Always had something to do. Many different things to do.
good,Good working environment. Steady and fast pace at times. Meet new peoples. Lots of customer service opportunities. Lots of standing required during shift.
good,"hardest part of the job was being organized, a lot of the times there was poor management, it was difficult to be effective when your superiors were not inclined to listen to you"
good,"meh i didnt really care for selling beauty products, its sales and the point of sales is to drive revenue into the company. not much else to say just eating up charectors to finish the requirements ."
good,Very fast pace. Keeps u on your toes. Customer service.  Learning new things about new products. Merchandising. Learing leadership skills.  Thats about all i have to say. The experience was great.
good,"Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
good,"First job as a sales associate, I was able to grow new skills. Enjoyed the products we sold and lovely staffing. Sale goals were attainable and met with great incentives."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time with Sally it's hard work but fun. We always received promotional items from vendors which made it easier to recommend to customer. I would definitely recommend this job to a somone who is a hard worker but has a second job.
good,A typical day at work is just waiting around for a customer to come in and ask for help or ring them up. Most of the time we are there its mostly doing daily household chores to keep the work environment clean and safe.
good,"Assistant manager, customer service all day long, put away stock  when truck arrives, not a hard job.  Fun place to work.  Enjoy coworkers."
good,"fun environment with great customers, poor management "
good,"the job was fun and interesting, always meeting new people and getting discounts at salons for giving references to other customers, they would use me as walking advertisement"
good,"I've learned a little about hair while working here, such as bleaching & caring for hair, customers make the job fun, it's fairly slow paced except on truck days and for the most part, laid back and easy going."
good,"i had to help customers."
good,"Provide customer service, cashier, stocking shelves, pricing merchandise, some banking and light housekeeping.  The co-workers were dependable and good workers.  The location was clean and well maintained."
good,It was a great place to work just not enough hours and the pay wasn't enough
good,"Most days are beyond easy, I deal with customers on a daily basis. I have learned a lot more about the beauty world and added to my knowledge. My co-workers are absolutely amazing and I always look forward to working with them! The management has its good days and bad days."
good,"I re-learned how to pick merchandise by pick-to-light and send off to each individual store. The management team was very helpful and understanding. My co-workers were always there when you had a question or needed some help. The hardest part of the job were the hours that I could work, but that was a personal thing and nothing against the employer. My favorite pare of the job was my co-workers. They made the hours that I had to work enjoyable."
good,This was my first job ever. I felt like I was very welcomed and learned so much.
good,"It was my first customer service job, and it served ts purpose. I learned how to deal with all types of customers. How to handle difficult situations , avoiding conflict or bad reviews. On a typical work day I would deal with customers and personal hair care problems, teaching me the differences and pros and cons between certain products. Truly stepping up my knowledge for haircare rather personal or professional. The management was not the best, I think a lot of situations were handled unprofessionally. Overall all the job gave me a lot customer service and sales experience, thus preparing me for better, future opportunities."
good,"Fast paced retail store. Job duties are great customer service, customer assistance with beauty products, and inventory."
good,"This job was not a cakewalk but it wasn't a rough job.  The moment that made it all worth it is when you have that one customer come thru and they are so thankful and appreciative of your help. As for my co-workers, I always enjoyed seeing them, I never really had any problems with anyone I worked with."
good,Provide excellent customer service while being fully responsible for cash register sales and balancing. Responsible for providing store products and continuous monitoring of product stock while responding to customer needs on a regular basis.
good,Get to work get the bank deposit ready run to the bank and make deposit and get change if needed. Come back to work and star helping customers find their needs or if work was a bit slow that day star any project that needed to be done by the end of the week.
good,Benefits are probably the best along with great awards to look forward to if you work hard. Upper management needs improvement.
good,"Open or close the store count the registers,greet customers and help them find what they were looking for.Stock the store,do store displays when needed,price changes.I worked with the best people.The best part would be helping the customers."
good,"Love my co-workers and manager. Work long hours on feet and can be fast paced which isn't a bad thing at all. Nothing too hard yet, fairly straight forward."
good,"A typical day at Sally's, We do price changes, help and ring up customers, clean, and put out products. Ive learned a lot about hair, skin, and nail products. I believe at times the hardest and most enjoyable part of my job are interacting with customers. Everyone has their good and bad days."
good,Sally Beauty was so behind the times with their software. The shipment process was a pain. We were always understaffed so you seemed over worked. The pay was nice and you got regualr pay raises.
good,no job security with them.s. did not say goodome of the people that you work for were very hard . did not say good job. just work harder
good,"There is a lot to learn about the products, but can be fun if youre interested in beauty."
good,"Shipment and restocking shelves can be fun and therapeutic. Cleaning is easy, answering phones is not great during busy times but higher ups do encourage you to make the effort to always answer the phone. Point of Sales system has been updated to touch screens so it is more modern. It is important to effectively communicate with coworkers and manager about any situations that may arise between you and your customers such as questionable returns or exchanges. All in all, a decent part time job."
good,It was a great job. The management in the company was very questionable. But over all it was a good job to work. It was a easy job. And I was so excited to learn about the products we had.
good,"Cashier: Sally Beauty (July 2014-March 2015 Part Time) "
good,Sally beauty is a good start for those interested in retail or the beauty industry; I would recommended it to students or anyone who would like to try out a easy retail job for their first job
good,Me gustó trabajar ahí muy buen ambiente laboral......
good,"I loved working at Sally's beauty but i took off for a sick leave and then when i went back it was very disappointing there was to much throat cutting ppl going crazy for sales and if sommeone came in they would just ignore the because it would affect there sales theres alot more i worked In oshawa"
good,A good place to work and close to home. The pay could have been better though. They treated there employees well but could have given a little more training.
good,can get really hot during the summer better fans maybe a cooler for the crew water bottles just to make the employees fell good about working for the company
good,working for sally's has been a good experience for me i have learned a lot from working there. they have a lot of perks that give you the courage to strive for moving up in company.
good,"Wonderful place to work, especially if you're interested in furthering your knowledge in beauty products and cosmetics. Working for Sally's is great start to a career in the beauty industry."
good,"Good place to work.  Flexible hours.  Reasonable benefits.  insurance, dental, vision, retirement.  Good employees and management.   Good working conditions"
good,"the job is very laid back and no one really cares what all you do there as long as customers are satisified, it is a low volume store so most of the time there isnt much to do"
good,Would have been nice if upfront when hiring about job status and upper management listened to and payed attention to employees about ANYTHING and acted like they at least payed attention to employees
good,Good company to work for just have to be willing to work with a manager with an attitude . I enjoy working there been there for 20 years but just need somewhere else .
good,I got really bored doing the same tedious task everyday at work. There wasn't much to do other then put all of the items we received from the weekly shipment out onto the floor.
good,Fast pace but enjoyable work in our own area go help other when in need work by ourself but as a team to complete a day task walk a lot which i really like it
good,"Sally has a “Can Do” culture and back to basic’s mentality in servicing customers. Being female and working in an environment where “Beauty For All” is your goal, was amazing!"
good,A typical day included helping out customers with any questions they had. Pushing sales to make company goals and signing up customers for a Sally Beauty rewards membership. If you are not making company goals you will be getting a write up. The work environment is good it is very team oriented. Job could be stressful at times if customer comes in with messed up hair color and wanting help to fix it when a hair dresser did this or when they mess up their own hair and blame it on the employee.
good,I got this job while enrolled in beauty school and I loved it. I actually had always wanted to work here as a young girl and I enjoyed it for the most part. The pay is not good but there are a few perks in trying out new product.
good,You can get a great edge ahead on the beauty industry working with Sally Beauty. They educate and share trends with their own group of bloggers and industry influencers. Most employees and management have licenses for the industry's and are very open to sharing the wealth of education. Store/day to day life is fun and fast paced with customer traffic and the relationships with them building into great rapport for any future career with Sally's or using the Sally foundation as a launching point for your own beauty career.
good,I loved working for the company but I wasn't satisfied enough to make it a career. There are opportunities for advancement. I am thankful for what I learned there. It helped me get another job when I needed something part-time.
good,"Fun job and you learn how to work efficiently, but not enough pay for a living. Definitely a decent first job for 18 year olds and you're able to develop group skills to use in the future anywhere."
good,"The environtment at Sally's depends on your location. I was head employee at most of the stores I worked at. I did paperwork, banking, and sales. Hardest part of all of the stores was probably watching the entire store."
good,"Sally Beauty is a nice place to work. I have now worked here twice (two different locations, 13 years apart). To be successful here you must have a lot of product knowledge and the ability to clearly share that knowledge with many types of customers whom may be at any experience level."
good,Very friendly environment. Assistant Manager and then became Manager. Quickly learned what needed to be done even if it wasn’t my job. Ordered supplies and did  inventory.
good,"They are a great company to work for, each store is different honestly based on the management there. Your build a personal bond with the customers that come in because you will learn who your regulars are, in which makes working there great and people will come back just for your service."
good,"Sally was an okay place to work. You are told to help customers, have product knowledge, reslove conflict if any and do truck take-In and stocking. Would work their again."
good,If you love working with the public this is a great place. The company gives free products to try each month. Staffing hours have been cut but more work as been added. The organization between departments is lacking causing a larger workload on the store level.
good,"Buena empresa; sin embargo es un trabajo pesado debido a los horarios extensos."
good,"This job really isn't as bad as you would think. I get along with a majority of my co-workers and actually grew a bond with them. Only issue really is the pay, which draws a huge red flag. with part time hours, and low pay, my rate of pay at this point, isn't enough to pay the bills"
good,Overall Sally’s is a great company to work for. They give you room to grow and advance within the company. It’s a very friendly and clean atmosphere to work in.
good,"Loved working there, but was unorganized and store culture was competitive between the employees- to for sales but towards each other in a personal way. situations were not handled to the satisfaction of the employees during these issues. problem-solving for these issues were not dealt with well."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of making sure there is product being put out when there's none left. As well with assisting customers with hair dye. Working at Sally's would give you the knowledge of hair dye and what is the best thing to do when trying to get rid of hair color to get another color. The hardest part of the job would probably be knowing the product very well. there is lots of products around the store that most of us aren't very familiar with, but if you begin to shadow other coworkers, you start to get the hang of what each product is used for."
good,"although i didn't work with this company very long, i did enjoy my time with them. the staff got along, the store was always upbeat, i had a really great time there."
good,"It's an okay job very nice to get to know the products management tho there are so many problems, the employees that they hire to always ended up being really rude and sloppy."
good,"The hours are very flexible. This is a good job to have if you are going to school. Work with customers daily, training is easy. One of the things that sucks about working at Sally's is we are only closed on Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Every other holiday (Memorial Day, 4th of July, etc.) you have to work 8+ hours ALONE, no breaks at all."
good,"La jornada es de mas de 8 horas"
good,"Great place to work, pay is ok. Everyone is nice and they greet you with open arms. Very flexible, understanding if you need time off. Work environment is cool"
good,I learned alot about customer service at Sally Beauty.  I was able to take this skill with me and use it in the medical field.  Great job for entry level positions
good,This place was fun. I learned so much about hair and makeup. The manager was great always worked with my schedule and gave me the opportunity to move up to assistant manager.
good,Good place to learn sales and learn about the beauty industry not alot of advancement opportunities and pay is below market for entry level sales jobs
good,Work hard and stay in productive being a team player also keeping your area clean as you work work to a fast pace to make your own productive a lot of work and stand
good,"i believe i answered each and every question very clear, their was alot of small concerns, inwhich became problems for what ever reason, i would try and work for their company again."
good,Good job. Corporate was difficult to work with. Manager was kind and helpful. Manager took care of problems in work place well. The job provided opportunities to move up in the business if you wanted to.
good,It was a great place to work if you love customer service and beauty products. Hard work paid off with awards and prizes. The pay and schedule were the biggest downfall about the job.
good,"this job helped me grew a lot as a person, it helped me to interect more with people it thought me how to take responsibility of my actions and be punctual."
good,"The employees who work there are Friendly&profestionsl. Teamwork is the key to running a Awesome store.The store is mostly professional,but is open to the public also."
good,It was a relaxed retail job. No stressful environment. Customer service based job. Assisted customers in selling beauty products for their salon or personal use.
good,there is a different manager at the location I worked at. from what I've heard its a much better place to work now. very fast pace. friendly customers.
good,That was a job that wasnt giving me much to learn. i learned how to stock and greet. There is not much to say because i barely worked there. i stayed busy to keep my energy up and foccused on what was important.
good,She was awesome to work for. She made accommodations for you when life happened. They only paid minimum wage at that time. I hope they give better pay to keep their employees.
good,"the manager was kind and understanding and worked with everyone equally. My co workers were like family, we all worked and laughed together at all times. Never a dull moment"
good,Working at Sally's wasn't too bad. The only thing i didn't like was closing every night and the low pay because i did have a cosmetology license. Beside that it was a pretty good working environment.
good,"Sally had great opportunities for job advancement and industry knowledge education. Very family oriented and team minded, collaborative work environment."
good,Excellent Accounting / SOX compliance. Strong Accounting team and able to handle system conversions.  Many departments with various opportunities for individuals.
good,"Hardest part of job is when you have nothing to do, stanfing around is so boring, truck put up, items stocked and store is cleaned.  Didn't really care for all the questions everyday, but I answered them all with smiles"
good,Nice place to work.  nice and challenging.  Associates and customers are great.  The company has a great rewards program and fun contest.  The job is very rewarding.
good,"I worked at Sallys for six years, I did make it to assistant manager. The company is great, my first two managers were fabulous. They brought in another manager we did not mesh well so I decided to go a different way with my career. I did love working for the company while I was there. It can be very busy and a bit stressful at times. I always had great sales and so much fun getting to know my customers. The pay was not what you would expect but I made it work."
good,My typical day at Sally's is enjoyable. I like helping people find what they are looking for.  Some of my customers would talk me about thier day or week they had.
good,"When you're scheduled to working an opening shift, most of the times it'll be just you opening the store. Which was quite challenging, being that you are given several task that must be completed before the store even opens. Then once the store opens some of the customers are so demanding and rude. I did learn a lot about handling money while working there though. As far as the management, Sally's was very inconsistent with whom would be managing the store. throughout my time there (almost 3 years) I have had 4 different managers to run the store. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the rude and nasty customers. Some of them were so quick to get an attitude with you about the products, deals and promotions that it was scary! the most enjoyable part of the job was getting the opportunity to come across individuals I now call friends. Relationships I will have beyond Sally Beauty."
good,Excelente empresa salvó algunas excepciones con el personal a cargo en las fechas que laboré.
good,Some days are slow on weekends its busy. The Hardest part of this job is having to learn and memorize all the products in the store. The most enjoyable part of this job is depending on who you work with you can enjoy it.
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers and seeing my regulars on daily basis, it was fun to learn new things from customers and the employees. Everybody got along with everybody."
good,"Adaptable scheduling, free samples every month, PTO after 1 year."
good,"The Manager is a wonderful person and a good manager to work for."
good,It's a fun place to work overall. I do with we had a more productive manager but the girls are wonderful at what they do and supply great customer service and experience for our customers
good,"I love working for this company, however, raises and recognition are very rare and very little. In two years of work with amazingly high reviews, I only gained $1.27 in pay per hour."
good,I worked here while in cosmetology school and it was great learning how to handle and deal with customers and learning how to help them with their hair wants and needs.
good,Point Of Sales system is always down and you have to wait forever to get the problem resolved. Costumers get upset when their credit and debit cards will not work.That hinders sales and customer service. Continually on the phone with support techs and for lengthy periods of time.
good,working here at Sally's was ok. Most times it is completely dead. you do learn alot about hair products and freebies every month. Management is good except when the TM and DM go by to visit. They're noses up in the air like they know it all and won't acknowledge you.
good,Good place to work but the pay isn't worth the work and tasks needed to. Very poor communication from higher authority. I enjoyed working for this company when I was first started. very good place to start but not many higher advantage
good,Liked the manager. Had fun there with other employees. We were pretty much free to run things how we saw fit. Although left to our own devices sometimes we handled it pretty well.
good,Great place to work. This company was willing to work with my school schedule at the time. Also open to moving up and growing with the company. At the time i worked for the company i was able to work as many hours as i could handle.
good,"Working with Sallys was the most enjoyable job I've ever had. It was a lot of fun, yet challenging at times. I loved learning all of the products and getting to know my customers on a first name basis."
good,"incentives could be better, management needs to treat their staff like they care. everything about the company was okay, but they doupt their employees too much ! my manager was awesome though !"
good,"Working for sally's was great I loved my job there took a lot of pride in the store because I was able to learn everything proficiently, the only thing I had a problem with was it was really hard to get a raise regardless the hard work put in. Management wasn't appreciative of the hard work the employees I worked with put in. The manager I worked for at the time took credit from us the lesser individuals and portrayed jobs as if she had done them her self. I learned a lot about hair not only that I learned how to handle money correctly, how to avoid robberies working with sally did teach me a lot that I was able to carry with me to my other jobs but a very unappreciative company, or management I should say."
good,A typical day at work was usually fairly busy. Management could have handled more professionally. The culture was a very laid back environment. The hardest part of my job was working by myself while very busy. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my fellow coworkers.
good,It depends on the sale month you will have a busy work day but if theirs no good sale month it will be a slow day the management is ok needs to be more involved with there workers and not sitting down all the time the only hardest part is sometimes you are left alone to handle everything the good part is the free stuff every month.
good,"The job was relaxed and fun, I got to talk to a lot of different people and not just about beauty products. Everyone that works there is great."
good,Buen trabajo pero para una persona que paga casa y recibos y con un hijo no es apto porqque no hay prestaciones de ley ni fondos de ahorro y es tardado para subir otra categoria o sueldo raro ala vez que suban
good,"Learned different point of sale system"
good,"All in all it's a great place to work if you're into beauty. It wasn't hard, the people were nice, and the GM was great. I liked it."
good,"Fun place. Fast paced. Lots of product knowledge. The hardest part is on shipment day, other than that breezy day at sallys."
good,"Love working in the beauty industry, just the perfect fit for me. I loved this store and all of the coworkers I had. The management is amazing with everything they do!"
good,"Sally Beauty is a smaller distribution center in comparison to other retailers.  Sally services over 3,000 stores and is a stable company."
good,My family needs a more steady pay check than no weekly pay. The store manager was very good at using her passive aggressive attitude to her own advantage.
good,This is a good job but I am looking for full time work with benefits.  I am a hard worker and like to stay busy. This job keeps you busy and I work well with all types of personality's.  I have learned about the beauty industry with this job and how to help customers in finding what is right for them.
good,"Good job but should get paid more for the work you do. Still employed because of the benefits. Flexible work hours. A typical day involves checking emails, ringing on register, helping customer's including addressing their needs including giving them advice."
good,"Upon opening, registers are prepared with daily cash. Brought out back-stock to fill shelves. Assist walk in customers with product purchase. Answered phone calls to assist with information or order placement. When closing store, registers are to be counted, money prepared and Z-Report filled out for next days bank deposit."
good,I like working for Sally Beauty company I put in a lot of man hours. my job consist of laying out the work each day for 50 associates making sure work is completed by end of shift. My employees work 9.5 hours daily and I work 10.5 hours dailey and some Saturdays.
good,"It's a very good company to work for, I couldn't ask for better co-workers as well. I did everything around the store from opening-closing, handling paperwork, cleaning and maintaining the stores appearance helping customers and giving advice as well as excellent customer service, among other things."
good,Co-workers were wonderful. The job gave me great sales experience and knowledge in the beauty industry. I learned how to supervise other employees and delegate tasks well as well as help the store run efficiently.
good,its fun workplace love being able to learn my management skills and also be able to show my outgoing personality.  loved being able to see new and repetive faces. the customer grow on you and it also feels good to make someone smile.
good,This company is constantly working to keep up with the every changing beauty lifestyles of the customers; new products are introduced monthly in order to do this. Employees work closely together in order to maintain a productive store with happy customers.
good,"Nothing really to complain about. I worked convenient hours, liked the job, learned a lot about the beauty industry,etc. I learned about ethnic hair care and about the products we sold, what ingredients did what, you know. My coworkers were great and my manager was a lovely person. Too bad they were all incredibly lazy and I had to pull the weight of the whole store. That was the hardest part of the job (besides dealing with the district manager) and ultimately the reason I left. Other than that, it was all rather enjoyable."
good,it was a very fast pace environment we were a very busy location but this job helped me to discover my talents as a leader and help sharpen my multitasking skills also taught  me how to become more resourceful
good,"I have been with the company for quite some time now,and still enjoy being here. I am looking for better opportunities and advancement in management."
good,"I enjoy the fact that Sally Beauty, supplies free samples so we can better learn the products.  They offer education every month on a variety of subjects.  This ensures that we can give the very best Customer Service possible. "
good,"I would  always greet the customer when they came in, and ask if they needed some help with finding a product or with choosing a product. I wold then help them out and also inform them about the sales of the month. I would tell them how would the sales benefit them and introduce them the new products. I would check them at the register and offer them some of the products that gave us points for selling them. I would also ask them if they had a membership card with the store, and they did not would offer it to them and tell them how it benefit them. I would do the same process with each customer. Everyday I would try to meet the daily goals.At them end of the day my co-worker and I would do the cleaning duties and close down each drawer. Hardest part of the job was trying help the customers who wanted a type of change of color, but asking us which one would be best color for them. Store did not allow us to choose a certain color for the customer. Enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people. I learn that we can not all ways have every one happy all the time."
good,Sally's is a great first job to have. It teaches you responsibility and how to work with people. You learn how to handle money and how to work as a team.
good,Nice place to work. You don't receive that many hours depending on the store and manager. Overall friendly co-workers and slow paced job.
good,Management is really good the co-workers were great. I loved being able to get free products and telling the customers about new products and results. A typical day would be to get the store open and make sure the products are stocked and front faced while helping customers with their purchases.
good,"Established company that is undergoing a corporate culture shift. Recent focus on work life balance. There are a few executives still not on board, but most of the company is moving in a direction of a much more progressive environment."
good,"I was a outgoing, organized and a quick learner. "
good,A typical day consist of opening the store making sure all daily paperwork and deposits are done. Plan out the daily duties for employees' and myself such as shipment day or the daily plan-o-guides for the store to run monthly ads.I learned a lot in Sally's one of those is being on time it is important because if you can't get to work on time the store doesn't function well. I can't recall the hardest part of the job but plan-o-guides were challenging at times.The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers and especially the ones you see come in the most. You get to gain a better relationship with them.
good,"very fun and exciting industry to work in, you learn new things everyday, it never boring. just wish everyone was on the same page"

good,I enjoy helping my customers with any questions they may have about anything. My job tasks were pretty easy the hours were incredible but i feel like they took advantage of there employees
good,I had a great time and was very honor to work for Sally Beauty Supply. I gained a lot of skills and training. I enjoyed working with beauty products. So I was also a stocker and cashier. So I got to use my math skills too.
good,"People working here. Very helpful and fun to work with. Downside, Customers think that you are a licensed cosmetologist and any thing that goes wrong you will be notified and yelled at within that day or the next. Even if they skipped a step."
good,"•	Maintained store appearance and created monthly marketing displays."
good,"A typical day at work was mainly selling things to people, fixing the  new ads, and putting up and organizing new displays. I learned new things about hair care and hair color. New nail and makeup techniques. Management was fun and flexible. My co-workers soon became my friends. The hardest part of the job was getting 'truck' every thursday and having to put all the merchandise away before Saturday morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was having fun with my coworkers and being able to try new products."
good,"I learned customer service, great communcation skills between myself and coworkers as well as customers, also working on stocking up on any products for the store taking inventory and making sure products were placed in correct spot"
good,All duties in OMaha  including  cycle counts and Pan-o-grams.  If you worked hard at selling the correct items of the month you could get what you needed from the benifit bookvia Alberto Culver employees were great no higher praise than wanting to work for a boss that likes you you like her and together we got her many awards
good,"As management perform all duties of a regular associate and then some. Fun to interact with different customers every day, and help them find the correct product for their needs"
good,"A typical day at work would be very energetic. I have learned hands on skills such as customer service and management skills. The management and co-workers are amazing, very equal and fair environment. There wasn't anything hard about the job at all. The most enjoyable thing about the job was giving customers that sense of being, such as making them feel at ease and good about themselves."
good,a typical day would be to count the register make sure all customers were waited on .i am very comfortable talking to customers and helping them make a decision about a product that's right for them.
good,"I would start my day by filing the morning paperwork and opening the store front. I would make sure products were placed correctly, make sure counters floors and working areas were clean. I also helped in customer service, doing returns and answering questions via phone. I worked in retail, promoting items to new customers. I learned a new perspective of the business world, My manager was great, always friendly but would give constructive criticism as needed. My co workers and I all tended to get along. We enjoyed each others company. The hardest thing about this job where the hours giving to me. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the smile it put on my face helping someone find something new to help them in a daily routine."
good,I only worked part time and the hours varied.  I learned a lot that the feild that i went to school for.  Management was good they did their job.  I loved my co-workers they were amazing and i became really good friends with them.  They only part that was hard was getting the hours that i needed and me and management just had different views.  THe best part was the employees.
good,"I loved working here, the schedule just isn't great for people with young kids since there weren't many shifts available at my location due to small store size."
good,I learned that team work gets the job done. The hardest part about the job was the shipment havint to put it away every week but it was always done on time.
good,"If you like helping customers then Sally's is the place to work, I feel good everyday knowing that I have helped a customer with their hair issues and have informed them with the correct knowledge about the right products for their hair. It also feels good when a customer leaves out the store satisfied and thank you for making their day when they've had a bad hair day or issues with their hair and turned to you for help and you were able to help them fix the problem."
good,I have been with Sally's and I love working for them...the pay is not the greatest but my peace of mind is worth more..
good,"A typical day at this job is educating customers on the company products and answering any questions or concerns they have about the products. Ringing the customers at the cash register, stocking products, weekly shipments and making sure the store was clean and tidy for the customers. I learned a lot about beauty products, how to approach customers and make sure that I provided the best service for them and helped to meet their needs. The hardest part of this job was probably when a customer would mess up their hair and we had to fix the problem and provide the best solution for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers would come back showing their results and thanking you for helping them."
good,Fun place to work. I learned a lot about all the different types of hair and nail products. I had a great supervisor and great co workers. It is an awesome place to work. There is really nothing hard about this job.
good,"I have worked for Sally Beauty Supply for almost 9 years now, and it has definitely helped me develop my Customer Service skills. I have learned that there are many different types of customers who have different wants and needs. You have to really listen to the customer in order to please them and make them feel happy when they leave your store. Customer Service is the number one priority in the retail field. I have gained so much knowledge about beauty products over the years by working at Sally, and it has been a joy being able to share that knowledge to help customers and give them the service they need.  The hardest part of the job would be pleasing everyone. Sometimes, you can't make a customer satisfied. You can certainly try your best, and if you couldn't make them happy, at least you knew you did the most you could to help the customer. That is what's most important."
good,"My typical day at work is helping customers to the best of my ability as well as satisfying them with my service. To me that is the most important part of my job, it makes people feel comfortable and to come back more frequently, it is also the most enjoyable part of my job. I also do shipment and restock products on shelves. I also do price changes when they need to be done. Management is very unprofessional as well as my coworker, it makes me uncomfortable even going to work but you have to do what you have to do. I transferred to this location but my experience at the Sally Beauty on the other coast which I worked for since last July, was rewarding and I loved going to work. Unfortunately I have to leave because i was having my daughter."
good,The most enjoyable aspect of this position was boing able to make a difference in the lives of customers.
good,learned a lot about the beauty industry and enjoyed the coworkers

good,"Greeting customers, handling and counting money, inventory of cashier drawer, restock, maintaining supplies, receptionist work, bank deposits, closed store, and provided excellent customer service.

good,"this job was based on performance and I was the #1 salesmen their. "
good,"Clock in ,get right on the sales floor, helping with re-stocking shelves while helping customers and giving them my full attention. Nightly deposit made and nightly cleaning.

good,The main focus from day to day is customer service. It is our responsibility to assist them with all needs in a friendly manner. During my time with this job i have learned how to lead a team effectively. The management and co-workers helped me with this learning experience. They were always there for me when needed. I enjoyed the relationships i have created with the many customers. They made the job more enjoyable.
good,"Great place to work if you love beauty products. I enjoy helping the customers find what they need. My manager and coworkers are wonderful people to work with. Anytime you need an answer to a question and your not sure, there is always someone there to assist you. Customer satisfaction is the most important goal."
good,"The production was high, but liked the stability. Hardest part was the heat."
good,My experience with Sally's Beauty Holdings Inc. was great I did a 10 week internship in the nail category. Everyone I interacted with was very helpful and willing to help me succeed.
good,"Without product knowledge, it is easy to get lost in the beauty industry/ field. Products are always improving and reinventing so it is definitely important to keep yourself up to date on the latest ingredients and help customers understand them. I was an assistant manager and loved working side-by-side with my manager and district managers."
good,"worked in the lake charles office on ryan street, good manager and co workers"
good,Sally Beauty was a good partime job for me. I was a cashier/customer service associate. I also stocked shelves.

Reviewing cashiering analysis of all employees. Keeping track of all stores refunds, exchanges and sales. Keeping track of store quota, store ratios and sales. Ordering product for the store weekly. Making schedules for team members weekly. Maintaining the stores cleanliness, making sure product is completely faced daily. Customer service is what this job is made of. Helping customers with problems, finding the product that is right for them, giving advice, showing how to use our products.  Using add on sales to help boost sale average, up selling certain products as an incentive. All of the employees get along and work hard as a team. The hardest part of the job is the financial stress, and there being not much room for advancement after being promoted to store manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving excellent customer service at my store, making great numbers for the store and having incentives to help motivate all team players."
good,"I was a sales/ customer service person.  I would help customers with finding what they needed and ring them out. Along with stocking new and existing products.  I learned alot about specific items we sold and what they did to better inform the customers and help them find exactly what they were looking for.  The management was very nice and althought there was alot of turn over at my store, I liked all of the co-workers I got to know.  Occasionally it was difficult dealing with irate customers, but overall the job was enjoyable.       "
good,"Typical day of work was the usual customer service. Wait on customer, handle their concerns and complaints. I loved the coworkers. We got along fine and we worked on a lot of different assignments together. It was a cool job to have while I was attending college to become a licensed professional."
good,help customers find what they need. tell them about different products. help them get what is best for them and their needs. i learn that not every body is the same and everything doesn't work the same on every body. i would have to open and close the store by myself. i lave stock shelves and unload products.
good,"Sally's was a great place to work since I went to school for Cosmetology. I could talk about hair, skin, and nails all day. The managers were wonderful even the district managers."

good,The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with the customers. Along with the opportunity to assist them in choosing products beneficial to them and save them money.
good,"Very fast pace position, boss is very wonderful. I have learned to deal with any situation and customer."
good,"Sallys was my faovrite job! It is just not practical for me to go back! I loved working there, what girl wouldn't want to play with hair and makeup stuff all day and help someone else feel beautiful?! Shipment days are awesome, keeps you busy for hours and before you know it the day is over. The only thing i did not like was that i worked with ALL girls, things got a little rough at times especially around the second week of every month if you know what i mean! but if you can learn to find a happy medium with the girls you work with i assure you that you will love your job!"
good,"Everyday the store needs to be clean and front faced, put any back-stock that my need to be put out. Always have 100% customer service and make sure you're always busy. The job is not that difficult unless the manager leaves the store for to go to another store or on vacation and expects you to take care of the store like a manager, but you do not get paid like one. I love working with everyone and help the customers find what they need. We do get free new products every month, which is cool because then we can try it before we want to buy more or it makes it easier to help a customer find something that suites them. Sometimes its hard to get time off when you only have a certain amount of girls that work there and they cant hire too many people because then the full time workers don't get the hours they should be getting and the part timers get their hours cut even more."
good,Greets customers with enthusiasm and friendliness while providing customers with knowledge in personal grooming techniques and products
good,They overworked me... but would definetly return if asked.
good,"I was responsible for handling all of the Salons in Aiken County, Therefore at times it could be stressful, and required long hours. I enjoyed the challenge and was recognized for setting record sales. Very rewarding."
good,"In charge of supply inventory, ordered supplies. Cash Handling, which included bank deposits, open and close register. Open the store and Close the store when needed. Most of this job was customer service."
good,"When I worked there I loved my co-workers and learning about new products! Every month you get free full size products so you can test them and recommend them to clients. However the Sally's that I worked at we had a lot of issues with the manager bullying the employees. We constantly reported it to our regional manager but she would never listen to us because the said,""we were going over our managers head."""
good,Can be really busy then super dead..theres alot of nice regular customers you’ll meet. Some times get overwhelming with all the visual merchandising changes.. management is good most of the time.
good,My only discrepancies were I had emergency surgery and had to fight to keep my job then the way the treated me when I came back wasn't so professional as well as unfair
good,Sally beauty is a great company to work for. They provide you with product knowledge so you know how to correctly assist customers. There are many incentives within the company and opportunities for advancement or traveling work.
good,Come in get registers counted and deposit ready to go to bank. Make sure store is all put together and all sale signs are put up. May have to do a merchandise reset for a section orr throw truck. Have conference call once a week. And Makita schedules for my store. Other than that just making sure the customers are taken care of.
good,"Sally's is a fun place to work and you get to meet new people everyday and help with their needs. I have learned about different hair types and the best product to use on the hair. I not only help people but I also open the store and do the morning paperwork and count the money for the bank deposit. I go to the bank deposit the money for the store, get change for the store. I sweep the store and front face everything on the shelves. I also close the store and count down all the registers to make sure the money is right for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer comes to you frantic about their hair and they leave smiling because not only did you solve their problems but you showed them you cared and you made sure their experience in the store was one they will never forget."
good,"I was hired on as a key holder/assistant manager. Before I was even hired I told not only my store manager, but the district sales manger and the region manger that my son was currently in the NICU due to being born 3 months early and I had no idea when he would come home but I would get a weeks notice and I would have to have two-three weeks off. All three said it would be no big deal and my job would be okay. Well 2 1/2 months later I get the call and all of a sudden it’s job abandonment and I had to pick."
good,"I have learned a lot and it is a good company. I really need a job with benefits and more hour. I love customer service and helping people to learn. Putting up stock, waiting on customers, I-pad uses and training."
good,It’s a good part time job if you’re young or just want a part time job. Youre on your feet  all day and always have something to do. Personally believe sale goals are unrealistic.
good,There is always work to do and always a customer to help. Very little free time and the shift goes by fast. Always enjoyed helping customers and managing staff.
good,A clean and friendly place to go for all your supplies and needs. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Location is prime and accessible. Products are a variety.
good,At times a great place to work management and sales associates need closer review by corporate great company overall the culture of you can only get promoted if your buddy buddy with the dm or manager
good,Sally's was a great store. We were required to maintain brand standards at all times. The customers were always our main focus. Management got a little loose.
good,"Enjoyed working for this Company, but Recent changes in Management at There Cave Spring Location, Needs improving.The New Manager isn't very friendly and comes across as kind of A Snobby Know it All."
good,Era muy bueno el trabajo tanto en descanso como el salario era semanal hasta que entro en crisis la empresa y nos líquido
good,I liked this job very much.  The only thing is that they don’t value their workers. Long days and non competitive pay. Assistant managers do the same thing as Store managers and make way less money
good,"I have worked at Sally’s for over 2 years , it was a nice place to work at . All the girls treated each other like sisters. Management was great and understandable . Only bad thing is they start you off at $8 no commission ."
good,"A great place to work if you love all things having to with hair, makeup, beauty, etc. Customer service is very important so this is a wonderful place if you are a people person."
good,"The workplace is a great environment when you have the right people to work there.  The most enjoyable part of the day is when everyone was working together, motivated in making sales and meeting requirements. What I have learned from working at Sallys Beauty Supply is that if you don't ask questions or ask for help, it will not be provided for you. This was one of the best jobs ive ever had and i would definitely recommend this job."
good,"Fun place to work along with free samples monthly, the only con to this job is it’s policy for family leaves they are unheard of and hard to obtain they will not hold a position for you to return too."
good,"It’s a great place to work but due to small store and team sizes, it can be very tight knit and hard to feel welcome unless you know the people you will be working with outside of work. Beauty experience is suggested as a lot of professionals do shop here and expect you to have a decent amount of knowledge of the products."
good,It was a pretty easy and enjoyable job. I loved helping the customers with their questions. My favorite part was when we would get shipment in and having to put it out because we got to see some of the new products. I only left because it got to the point where it was only 2 of us working the store by ourselves and our district manager at the time didn't want to hire anyone so me and my coworker were the only two working like dogs trying to keep the store running.
good,Employees get free samples of new products once a month. Flexible schedules are available. Most stores are not allowed to have any full time people. Anyone working over 30 hours is considered full time. Anyone who works 40+ hours a week gets an extra paid day off for working any of the 7 holidays as designated by the company.
good,I liked working at Sally's Beauty Supply and Equipment. I mainly worked behind the cash register. If I wasn't doing that I was helping customers learn more about products or front and facing the store. There was one opener in the morning for the store and two closer's at night for the store. My manager was flexible and helpful with her employee's schedules. The hardest part of the job was modifying the store when new products came in. Especially when you had to modify almost the whole store. For the time I was there I liked it and I'm still a shopper there.
good,Hours were reasonable and team was friendly. No real culture to speak of. Location and commute is hard unless you live near   I-35 or north of Denton.
good,Best job i ever had! I worked at a smaller store so you really got to know your co-workers. We were like a little family. I loved learning about hair color and the process. The job was super laid back. The only thing is I was promised to get into the assistant manager program and that didn't happen. There was no room for career advancement.
good,"this is an excellent place for a cosmo student or nail tech student to work. as far as a job that provides for complete living, NO. it supplied my gas and spending monies while i was studying at university. the company does offer alot of on the job training and monthly training videos. they take pride in product knowledge and it shows, i was knowledgeable of all store products and felt comfortable giving client advise."
good,"Loved to get my hands on some extra over time,  I also like to help do different assignments to become more aware of what goes on in the facility as well as the workers behind each job."
good,"I learned a lot about the field I planned to be in from this job. Hours varied, but can be flexible when needed. Direct management was great. It was usually a fast paced work environment but could also be relaxed sometimes."
good,"Increase sales"
good,"Es bueno en cuanto a crecimiento laboral, te ayuda a desenvolverte en diferentes áreas."
good,"At first I enjoyed working there, but my manager could not handle her job. She was often late or called out. She rarely ever did anything on the sales floor or in the backroom. It was a fun place to work but your experience is 90% the manager you have."
good,There is always something to do. It is a very fast paced work environment and is a great place to learn. The benefits and pay are pretty good. When I started I knew nothing about hair and I learned so much through their hands on training program.
good,my experience with the company proved to be a learning experience of how to be a responsible store assistant manager and retail sales associate the short amount of time taught me to respect my store and customers
good,"workimg at sallys beauty was a great adventure, I learned so much about the company and its benefits. my coworkers were pleasantly nice to work with but I think they should work more on their pay that's my only compliant no one should work for under $10 an hour."
good,If you have a team you get along with it’s a great job. The benefits for FT are good with insurance. As an employee you receive monthly sample products. Sometimes full-size. Very creative interaction with customers.
good,hours great for my social life. managers worked with my schedule.  learned a lot about hair products. we got to try products out.  some days fast paced and busy.
good,I loved working there until they changed owners 3 times and they started treating you like a number and not a person. When I started there it was like a big family that cared about your well being but it quickly turned all corporate and was like they didn't care about praising you on a good job. or want to give you raises. They didn't want you being friends with employees but how are you going to work side by side with someone for years and not become friends.
good,"The company is good to work for. Being a manager is hard with children. The district manager in my area is awesome. It's very competitive, but fun place to work. Great incentives."
good,Working at Sally Beauty was a wonderful job for the most part it had its challenges but was wonderful at the same time. I will miss this company and the few good employees I had but sometimes change is needed in life and that is the point I am at.
good,"I liked some parts of the job, but sometimes it was a little challenging dealing with people that didn't want to be held accountable for their actions."
good,"I think this is a great first job, you learn the basics of retail, from restocking the floor to inventory. A typical day at work is receiving the cash register and making sure its even, then doing customer service, stocking the floor, front and face and at the end of the day close cash register and clean. the management is very straight forward, if you ever have a problem or concern you talk to your manager and work things out. the workplace culture is all about customer service and making sure the customer leaves happy and satisfied. The hardest part of the job are the plan-o-guides, which is having to change the displays around the store every month. the most enjoyable is working with my coworkers."
good,This company is great place to work in your spare time and when you are going to school. I enjoyed working here and meeting new people. I will recommend anyone to this company.
good,"Love the enviroment and the customers and my co-workers."
good,"Awesome company as far as benefits goes, the pay could be a lot better considering the work you have to do, a lot of work for minimum pay. but over all great company."
good,"I loved the job itself, being able to be passionate about everything that is Sally was great..however my manager was awful and I ended quitting due to quite a bit of harassment and bullying from her. Quite awful when the job is perfect but the boss just doesn't fit. "
good,"Muy buena empresa, muy buena relación laboral, y  con una forma de trabajo muy estructurada."
good,Sally's's is a really fun place to work and learn. I was with the company for eight years and would be a great job for someone starting out in the workforce.
good,"Nothing wrong with working at Sallys Beauty but I was barely getting any hours, The kind of person I am, I am very productive and sometimes there was not enough things to do in the store. I answered phone calls and kept the environment clean, but I was rarely interacting with customers because there was barely any. Overall I like it, the workers are nice and my boss is a good advisor."
good,"I worked there for just less than 2 years, and there were times when I loved it, and times when I hated it.  My boss was excellent - she was basically family.  Shipment days were the worst - you never had a chance to sit down except on your scheduled break, and a lot of times, we were understaffed.  Other than that, however, it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere.  We just had to make sure we asked customers if they needed any help, tidy up the store, etc.  The biggest thing I hated about working there was that your coworkers would be all friendly to you, but then talk about you when you're not there and try to stab you in the back.  For example, I asked for a weekend off one time, and two of my coworkers went to the manager and complained about how I was always getting time off and they never did - despite the fact that I had picked up a lot of extra shifts for them when they needed a day off or something.  My boss had my back though, and showed them that they also got a lot of time off."
good,this was a great job until they closed down the sales was not up to par and the prices was high and that's why people didn't shop in there like that but it was laid back
good,"The company it's self was pretty good, and the job was good. But the management at the store I was at was poor. Other than that it is not a bad company to work for. Hours aren't the best but work well if you're attending college."
good,Just started this job while I was in high school it is a very good job to do while you are trying to obtain a high school diploma also great hours great. Great people
good,"La tienda te enseña mucho pero tienes poco tiempo socialmente, te consume mucho el trabajo y no te da tiempo para estudiar o hacer otras cosas productivas, aprendes mucho pero si te hace falta mas tiempo..."
good,"Fun Place to work. Great people, Willing to work with any scheduled. free products every month and extra present off on holidays."
good,Its not a hard place to work if your team is one and honestly really fun. You learn how about hair color/care and cosmetics. There doesn't seem to really be a hard part if you know how to talk to people and work with others that don't drag the team down.
good,The business itself is great. I loved working there. The products are amazing and most of the employees are really friendly. The only thing that should change Is corporate.
good,"Very nice establishment to work for, I learned a lot about all the different hair products. My co-workers was very great team members, had awesome manager."
good,"Sally's was a very nice place to work.  They worked with my schedule as a part time employee, and brought me on as a full time employee between jobs."
good,"At this job I had a great time learning new products such as skin, hair and nails. I had really good coworkers where we always worked as a team. The job was not hard for me. I loved it! My manager just didn't want to give me more hours so I had no choice but to put in a two week notice."
good,"Performing all my duties helping out the customers learning the products and making sure me and other employee worked as a team managed the store and making are sales quota are hardest was making sure we sell to every advantage customer. My enjoyable part was making new friends getting along with the customers being friendly, courteous and helping them in their need."
good,"opened/closed the store, made and checked petty cash,checked the store deposit, checked corporate daily e-mails, set the associates daily duties, checked out customers, worked back stock, set weekly price changes,followed plan-a-guides, did correction counts,set lunch times. I took associates out to dinner to show my appreciation for their hard work,"
good,all and all working at Sally Beauty Supply was pretty good. The only downside of working there would be management and the pay. The manger took too much advantage of her title.
good,It was a great place to work if you wanted to be in cosmetology. You could learn things you didn't learn in school. You could teach others as well. We worked great together as a team.
good,"Easy job, not much to do other than learn about products and help customers. You meet a lot of interesting people in this field! Free samples each month from companies. The only downside to this job is the customers that get upset if you don't have enough knowledge about certain products. Management could be better, there was a lot of gossip and immature behavior which caused a lot of tension. Co-workers were fun to work with and dedicated to getting people out the door with everything they needed. I've learned a lot from this company and the people I've met! I can recommend great products, and I can tell what a customer/person needs just by looking at their hair and asking a few questions!"
good,"Sally's is a pretty good entry level retail job if you are interested in working in the beauty industry. It's like any other retail job, you have your good days an then your bad. They are sales that are ""required"" of the associates. The pay is definitely not worth the work but that is with any retail posit."
good,"A typical day at Sally Beauty involves customer service, organization, and good time management.  There are many different tasks that need accomplished each day and we need to get them finished quickly and efficiently, all while keeping an eye out for customers and assisting them in any way. I have learned an abundance of knowledge involving the cosmetology field working here, as well as better communication skills, and better tactics in customer service. My manager was very accommodating with my work schedule and very understanding about times I could not work.  She was very helpful when needed and made things easier to understand.  I had very little issues with coworkers. We all worked together to get things done, and if any of us needed help with a task or were unsure of what a customer needed, we would help to our best abilities. The hardest part of the job was retaining all the information needed to make sure the customer was getting the best product for them.  We had to watch videos each month and take quizzes to keep up with the information. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers and remembering their regular orders and making them feel important."
good,"i was store manager, small staff so i did everything from janitor to manager. in store hr, scheduling, inventory control, high shrink store"
good,"I would stock shelves and advise customer on certain products the company sold. I learned how to sell not only a product but a service such as the beauty salons in the area we would recommend. my co-workers were just like me and were in school for an education. each person would help out when others had a stressful day and handled customers. balancing work, school and free was a challenge with thus job since I did not want to work little hours."
good,typical day consist of opening the store balancing paperwork and serving customer.I have excellent co workers. They are hard working and fun to be around. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I am able to assist the customer to find the best products that give them self confidence.
good,Was a great place to work.Learned alot. Employees were great. Had a great time meeting all types of different people. learned alot from the managing staff.
good,"When i open the store i would count all the money that goes in the registers. Make sure the deposit money is accounted for. I would pull all email. I would do all daily paperwork. I have learned from customers, coworkers, videoes, about the different products. I have been through 5 managers in 7 years and they all were different. We all work together as a team with a positive atmosphere among the coworkers. The hardest part of the job is when we are short staff on truch day. The customers comes first even on truck day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we can help an customer find what he/she needs."
good,"Its a nice place to work for but it will be better if they had security to prevent for customers to steal.What I learn working there is that sometimes you have to be patience with the customers that comes with a bad attitude,love working with the co-workers we use to get along very well,the hardest part of the job was trying to help others while you are trying to set the store with the monthly sale or when your doing a planoguide,the most enjoyable part is that that I get to work with others"
good,"What was a typical day at Sally's was different depending on which day of the week it was. Tuesdays the freight would come in and we'd spend the rest of the day stocking it. Wednesdays and Thursdays we'd spend our time checking shelf labels, price changes and pulling items from the back to stock the shelves. Fridays and Saturdays we focused on customer service and we would mop the floors at the end of the day. Sundays we changed labels and ensured that the store was orderly and clean. Mondays we ordered product for the next week."
good,My manager was great to work with & she appreciated me & my efforts!
good,"A typical day would be immediately hopping on the cash register upon arrival or assisting customers to find their desired items. That was the primary focus as a sales associate; making sure every customer found what they were looking for or maybe something even better. Some days we would have to reset price tags. We received a shipment one day a week, which we would all pitch in to get stocked on the shelves. The rest of the time, we were dusting products and making sure the store was in prime condition. I enjoyed my co-workers company often. We would often become a team when selling products. The management was friendly and made sure we were all properly trained. I learned a lot about beauty products and how to sell to customers, as well as how to be personable with customers. The hardest part of the job was definitely when a rude customer gave us a visit, but I learned to take it with a grain of salt and to not let it bother me. Everyone has bad days. The best part was when someone came in for some retail therapy because they were having a bad day and they would leave happy. I did my best to make sure they left smiling if I could tell they were blue, which made me feel great because I just brightened someone's day by simply being helpful, knowledgeable, and kind."
good,"Forward face all items in the store, maintain floor stock and ring customers up for the items they purchase. I learned about beauty products. My coworkers were enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping women with there beauty disaster days,"
good,"Always a weekly schedule of expectations to follow.  Little or no help when staffing was low. It all fell on the store manager.  The job was expected to come before family.  There was specific guidelines and policies written but expectations and enforcement was not a priority.  Some followed rules some did not and no one seemed to care. Loved the products, love the beauty industry, loved the free samples and the employee discount.  Enjoyed helping customers cared for them greatly.  Loved seeing and getting results, meeting goals."
good,great place to work. meet alot of new and interesting people
good,"I really enjoyed working at Sally's, because I got along with my team members very well. The hours were decent and the pay was okay. There was always something to do and I like how the manager laid out what are assignments were for our schedule so we knew what to do for the day. I enjoyed helping the customers with the merchandise and introducing new products we were selling. In addition to helping customers, we were always busy with something such as delivery and putting the new products on the shelves so it was never a boring job."
good,"open store, help customers with their selections, cashier, front and face store. My co- workers were so much fun lots of new products to learn about. The hardest part was being helpful to unhappy customers. Loved the enviroment, customers, and products."
good,Sallys Beauty Supply is a good company to work for. The employee benefits are very good and they also have flexible scheduling.
good,Job has regular testing to keep you updated on both products and store procedures.
good,50-60% Travel for store compliance group.
good,"Work usually consist of stocking, helping and greeting customers. At sallys i've learned about the products that sallys carrys, what the different products mean and do. Management and Co-workers are great, everyone is professional."
good,"Working at Sally beauty has its ups and downs. Like every other job you have tasks that you have to complete on a daily from your manager or head office. We have days when its really busy and days when its not so busy. The hardest part of this job i would say is trying to please an angry customer. Majority of the time customers are angry because we do not have a product in stock or because a product didn't work on them like they thought it would. But when it comes to customers like that you just have to take a deep breath in and a deep breath out and calmly listen what the customer is trying to say. Overall, my experience working at Sally Beauty is awesome and I wouldn't change it."
good,"I enjoyed working there , co-workers were fun to work with. The customers were okay except for the ones that would give you a hard time for no reason. Not a lot of hours to go around but overall a fun and great experience."
good,Wonderful environment and great opportunities for growth and learning. I met many different people and were a able to help  the store could use more diversity
good,It's a nice place to work. Fast paced most times. People are easy to get along with. Nice environment. Need to be a self starter though. Always something to do.
good,"Trabajar en Sally es adictivo pues hay una gran variedad de articulos para dama que comienzas a incluir en tu vida 😍 sin embargo es muy absorbente sobretodo en este puesto ya que haces de todo, el sueldo es bajo considerando el tiempo y tipo de trabajo,  aún así se disfruta mucho."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for Sally Beauty because I have an interest, if not love, for all their products. I enjoyed helping customers explore the products and tell about my experiences with them. I received little to no training on professional grade products but still learned a lot. I am no longer there because I needed a full time job to better support my family."
good,"I have been working with the company for a little over 3 years. The pay is decent, but no room to advance or get a pay raise. I have found they hire people with no experience as assistant managers/managers instead of moving those who are dedicated employees up. New hires will make a little bit more than those who have been there longer. Some duties I feel like are for managers/assistant managers, but get put on normal beauty advisors' tasks which, considering being paid minimum wage, I feel to be a bit unfair. That is probably my only complaint. other than that, I love working here and really enjoy my coworkers and the atmosphere. My customers feel more like old friends than anything and I love that!"
good,I really like working there. I enjoyed helping customers and the more I learn about the products the more comfortable I feel. My coworkers are great. What I don’t like is that I don’t work enough hours to make a living. It depends on how much you sell and you’re basically at the mercy of the customers there. There are also no benefits. For those reasons I’m looking for something else so I can help provide for my family. I recommend it though if you don’t have to worry about making much money.
good,I enjoyed working at Sally's  Beauty.  It was a real learning experience in regards to hair products.  It was some days a challenge dealing with customers.
good,"you have multiple tasks in a work day all though your still providing customer service, there's way more tasks that involve restocking, taking product orders/rain checks and calling those customers back when their item is back in stock. help with shipment that is also part of the restocking, resets to certain sections of the store that can be a little challenging."
good,Sally Beauty is a great first job. Teaches a number of different skills and customer service experience. Work/life balance isn't the greatest. If you are looking for a first job and interested in beauty this is a great place to work.
good,"Chill job, unrealistic goals sometimes, but it wasn't hard at all. Pay was around 8.75 but for part-time it was perfect. Hours were flexible depending of staff but all in all, it was a chill job."
good,"Working here is a great opportunity and dream of any girly girl. You learn so much about hair, nails and beauty. You really connect with your customers and are able to really get one on one with each and every customer 90% of the time. Its super fun working here if you enjoy hair and beauty"
good,"The store I worked for at Sally’s was the biggest in the East Valley and upon my start of employment, there was a switch in management. Our new manager completely overhauled the store and as a team we worked together to get it neat, organized and updated. My managers were very positive and easy to work with and pushed us to be our best."
good,"a typical day consists of stocking shelves. cleaning the floors and windows, ringing as well as assisting customers. The only difficult part of the job is the lack of a set schedule. The schedule is based around how busy the store is expected to be and when it will be busiest at what time. The best part is the knowledge you will get working at the store and a satisfying feeling of helping customers"
good,In all the company and management could be better but the job it self is do able and not as stressful as other jobs. Just do what is needed of you. Try to use products yourself so it’s easier to recommend and just listen to the customers. 7/10 times they know what they want.
good,"La empresa y el trabajo es bueno al igual que el trabajo en equipo , pero esta siendo mal administrada por algunos jefes inmediatos , que no respetan los derechos del trabajador sobre-explotación laboral, y en ocaciones pago a des-tiempo metas mal hechas en ocaciones inalcanzables, mal manejo de personal en los últimos meses , en ocaciones tambien se le obliga al personal a trabajar horas extras, aunque no puedan pagartelas con dinero sino con horas y ellos deciden cuando se te dan ."
good,This business is fun and productive. It always provides training on new products. The work hours are flexible. It gives you opportunities to travel to other stores in your district to earn some extra money.
good,"very educational. They are flexible with your schedule and are willing to train and teach you about most to all hair products and cosmetics. Very kind and loving team. However there is constant chance, every month things change."
good,"A decent company. Very good to their customers, lots of great sales and coupons for regulars. They expect a lot from their employees without many benefits. The hours are flexible and if you are a cosmotologist it's a pretty easy job."
good,"Sally's was a nice company to work for. No high pressure sales or quotas. They offer employee incentives and flexible hours."
good,"I was always excited knowing I was going into work every morning. And really didn't mind the overtime, because I know that there was always something new I was going to learn from one day to the next."
good,"Good company to work for if you are in school or have children. Management was good they worked with you if you needed specific hours or days off. Pay is okay, if you  like helping people look and feel better about their beauty choices then this is the place for you."
good,it was a good work experience enjoyed helping out customers in the store had some great employees ok work environment I learned a lot work at Sally's like coloring hair different types to color hair for different hair types
good,"I live what Sally Beauty is about, I also love that they don't do background checks. There are 2 store managers in my area that have a criminal backgrounds and have COMPLETELY turned their lives around and they are by far 2 of the best managers i have ever encountered! They are all about Sally Beauty! The Upper management is very understanding and they feel like people, not names or faces you've never seen. The pay is not good, and neither are the benefits."
good,It was a very fun job. helping clients pick what best suits them. We got discounts on merchandise. You did not have opportunities in advancements. You were able to get a week vacation working part time.
good,"fun job, great people , lovable management "
good,"The manager is a really awesome person!!!!!!!! This woman teally knows her stuff and could be a vital part of any team, anywhere. I love her personality and direct approach to the handling of customers."
good,"Buen ambiente pero con un poco de estres, mucha rotacion de personal"
good,"I loved working at Sally's and helping people with questions about hair dye, make up and hair products, however the manager at my location was very late with putting up schedules and not very friendly to the staff."
good,"Typical day, the Kinston store is super slow. Always things changing within the store. Fun and sweet employees. Wednesdays are for unloading truck for products."
good,"Most of the time you are cleaning/stocking the shelves and helping customers. Usually, there is a lot of down time to get other tasks done. Loved the discount."
good,"Greet customers, assist them with their hair, skin, and nail care products. I learned to really listen to what the client was looking for and what they wanted to achieve. Management was excellent. Workplace environment was competitive. The hardest part of my job was when I would catch customers stealing from our store. The best part of my job was happy customers and happy coworkers."
good,"This job is great for people who are in the beauty business! management is great, And the in store discounts are nice as well. Free products every month are great too."
good,The connections I made working there were the best part. Also learning about all of the products that the company offers. They have great items to help customers get the results desired. Having a good manager is key in surviving the work you do. If you do not have knowledge in hair color this job will not be easy for you.
good,i started as a part time cashier and worked my way up to at store manager in the same store i was to do order stock the store clean all on doing as everyone did
good,Awesome job learn so much about hair color! Pay should be more only think you should work here if u just want a little extra money in your pockets....
good,Good Company to work for. Many tenured associates who slow down progress. Fair environment to get work done and grow your skill sets. Pretty satisfied with the company.
good,Enjoyed helping customers with product knowledge and showing them what works best. Enjoyed the competition between stores for the most sales. Enjoyed the customers positive feedback.
good,I was there for 2 years and I only left due to getting a higher education in a different field. I love the customers and staff all but the district manager but she is no longer with the company. It can get busy at times but it’s a store and it can be slow but I still enjoyed every minute of it.
good,the work at this place was different day to day. #1 you had to be customer focus - remember the customer is always right.  You had to go above and beyond so that you would offend an customer.  The hardest part was keeping your calms when a customer was taking very ugly or derrogatory to you.   The rewards I found from working there was when I help a customer find the right product for them and they came back to Thank me.  The company was very good in providing employees with free products to use so they can provide more insight to the customer about the product.   The culture was wonderful you deal with all type of people.
good,"I enjoyed working here, however the hours are not set and depending on the number of girls on staff your hours will be cut/added often whether you're full or part-time. You're always busy which is nice, this isn't a job where you can just sit around waiting for customers, there is always something to do. You will most likely have to travel to a sister store for coverage at one point in time, but you get paid for mileage and you can pick up extra hours. It is a good place to work, but don't expect to move up in this job, it is a very rare occurrence that you have promotions here."
good,I like working for this company. You get lots of the products to try. It's easy work. You can move up in the company if you want to I was just going to college to do something else. They give you PTO time and that's nice.
good,"A typical work day is fast paced and constantly on your feet. I learned   a lot about hair-color and hair care products. It is a lot of hands on learning and you deal with a lot of different people on a daily basis. The hardest part about the job is only in the beginning, when you have to learn about hair-color and to properly help each customer  as best as you can because all hair is different. The most enjoyable part about the job is successfully helping the customer achieve the look they want for their hair and them coming back and thanking you for helping them."
good,"I loved Sally Beauty when I first started. I got along with all of the girls. They were super helpful if I needed it. As time went on, some girls started leaving and management would bring in new girls, and there was a couple girls that shouldn't have gotten a promotion when they did. I feel like management chose favorites."
good,"I took this job as a temporary one and in the beginning it became quite stressful with the first manager that we had during my duration. I ended up loving most of my co-workers. The work can be tedious at times and I wish the pay would have been more for someone who had experience with the products. But, overall it's a pretty decent company to work for and would go back if need be."
good,"A typical work day was very easy going and organized. The task at hand were to be completed including customer service. The environment was very easy going although some managers made it the atmosphere tense, the job would still get done."
good,"Worked there for almost a year. Honestly, I left because I didn't really like the girls that I worked with (Store Manager included). Loved the discount though!"
good,I enjoyed my time and passed all my requirements and assrssment tests. There were room for growth but i was not satisfied with the amount of hours or pay.
good,"Sally Beauty is a great work environment, benifits are offered to full time staff. This job can be challenging and very competitive.  There is always something to ne down never a slow pace. Great oppurtunity for cosmologists retail management and those. With excellent customer service."
good,Sally's is a very welcoming environment. The customers are the best because they all have different ideas and requests that make it really fun! My co workers are great to work with and are awesome individuals!
good,I have been with the company for seven years and they have treated me well and have helped me develop the job skills i needed. I have had many great experiences with the company and feel they provide great incentives.
good,I was at Sally Beauty for quite a few years. It was a great job and helped me to open up my eyes into the beauty world. Sally's was what inspired me to go to school for Esthetics. They are always coming out with the newest products and appliances and are always concerned about their customers experience.
good,"Sally beauty is a good company to work for, my time there has been a valuable learning experience. there are many different skills needed for this position, a new training program was recently instituted and appears to be a great increase in sales technique."
good,Not much room for advancement opportunities. I've been with them for over 10 years. I've been promised advancement by three different management teams.
good,"Always something different to do. "
good,"Had to work too many hours, didn't have help with district manager ,and didn't feel appreciated as many hours as I worked.I also had to close store by myself and open alone dangerous in this day and age and ,also stayed late so employee didn't have to be alone."
good,"Days usually started slow in the morning which allowed you to get things done while still able to help customers. Working at this job taught me how to interact with customers and how to handle difficult situations. Our management needed improvement, it got very hectic at one time because we didn't have a full time manager so the 3 employees ran the store as well as we could considering the circumstances. however we all managed to work together to make sure everything got done in a timely manor. The hardest part about this job was having to work quickly around sale days to make sure all signs and ads are up and displays were set up correctly. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help somebody find exactly what they were looking for and providing them with the correct knowledge about the products."
good,"Team work, customer service, main Focus is Sales, willing to multitask with customers and work task. Always greeting customers with a smile and a friendly welcome."
good,A fun job to have. I enjoyed it. I liked that we had videos to watch every month with information about products we needed to know. I would work for them again.
good,"Really enjoyed working for Sally Beauty Supply. Great discount, lots of good products. It was a great learning experience working for the company. Room for advancement."
good,"Company grew from 200 to over 1500 during my tenure. Tended to hire upper level from outside, not much internal advancement at that time."
good,Fast paced job that taught everything that you would need to know for answering customer questions. The hardest part of the job is learning the beauty products for every different situation.
good,"Working at Sally Beauty Supply was a fun & sometimes challenging experience. On the daily basis, I worked the cash register and helped customers find what they were looking for. I completed updates throughout the store & at closing everyday, I was expected to front face the entire store and make sure the dusting and cleaning was completed. If I opened, I completed bank deposits and dropped them at the bank by a certain time. The hardest part of working at Sally Beauty, was sometimes the customers & finding exactly what they need; Other times it was an update that you just couldn't get completed right."
good,"A typical work day at sally's would be signing any papers that need to be verify working on your daily duties and helping customers as well as keep up the store and learning  our promotions and new store lay out that would happen once a month. when its near closing time we have to close our drawers and count the money that's in the drawer and make sure to do any deposits , we clean the store and make sure all products and displays are turned the right way for the next day."
good,"Good company to work, very labor intensive. Compensation could be better. Benefits where ok. Employees safety needs to be better looked after especially in the Riverside location"
good,"I really enjoy working at Sally Beauty. It is a great part time job to work at while I finish my degree at Bloomsburg University. My coworkers are all down to earth and I get along with all of them. There is no hard part about working here. Sometimes it gets a little crazy when replacing the old month deals with the new ones, but it all gets done in a day."
good,Sallys is a great place to work if you young just getting out of school. Great place for young people to grow and learn a lot about retail.  Pay not all that great hours are very long.
good,"I've been working for sally's for two years and its really not a bad job. We don't necessarily have to deal with rude customers but we do have some customers that are hard to get to when trying to explain what is needed to complete a process. A typical day consists of putting out stock when needed, making sure items are front faced, working on ""plan-o-guides""/ price changes if we have any, and just helping out customers. some days there isn't even much to do, we just focus on customer service. At our location, everyone gets along very well which makes the work day very pleasant. They try their best to be flexible with your schedule, but for the most part you do work most weekends."
good,I like working for Sally Beauty. Great co workers and a great boss. The company is finally moving forward but not a lot of room to move up unless someone leaves. I enjoy helping customers find what the need and some items they didn't. I enjoy teaching and mentoring new managers
good,"A typical day at work was making sure customers had good service. Explaining benefits of the products and what they do, how to achieve their looks in-between salon visits. Answering the phone, cleanliness, keeping an eye on customers at all times. What did I learn at Sally's learning about new products and latest trends. I think the management needs to work on communication and having security cameras. I got along with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers or having technical issues with the point of sale system. Everybody working as team to help customers with their needs and doing projects together."
good,"Great company. shifts can very anywhere from 5 hours to 12 hours with sufficient rest breaks. compensation is not as competitive as most would like but potential for growth with the company is excellent. Is a busy work environment, must have patience and work well with customers, must do well multi tasking and be open to creativity and resourcefulness. Company provides a wealth of knowledge and training pertaining to the cosmetology industry and the products available to its customers."
good,"i would get there we would have a little meeting on what needs to me shipped , then we would get on to the floor make boxes for 15 min then i would log on to the system and start to pull my orders"
good,"Sally Beauty continues to grow in the beauty industry.  Sally is a company that cares about the employees and actively pursues ways to be a more people oriented company.  Sally continues to work with Carter Blood, Susan G Komen events and several holiday charities."
good,Love doing inside/outside sales. Job was very exciting. Learned a lot of product knowledge. Love meeting new people & seeing new faces on a daily basis.
good,Sally's is a great place to work if you are still in cosmetology school because it gives you a head start on learning to up-sale to your clients and they also give you opportunities to learn about new products. you will probably be on shift with only one other co worker. you get a discount on products and free samples every month. If you are working at a location that has no current management positions there won't be opportunity for advancement.
good,Enjoy greeting clients and assisting them with product selection and information. Cashier duties include club card sales and items of the month sales quotas. Work with great people and have a great manager. I enjoy the sales aspect of the job and interacting with clients. I strive to provide southern hospitality to each person I encounter.
good,"Customer service was our main priority, we made sure they came and left our store happy.  We learned about our new products every week, our management team helped us stay focused and motivated.  Co-workers helped one another and worked as a team.  Hardest part of the job was, when some our business hours were very slow, most enjoyable part of job was getting new merchandise, where we can learn about them and than be able to show our customers, also to give a great service and have the customer leave with a big smile and when they returned to shop again."
good,"Good managements, keeping up with latest related info. Very fair to the employees. Some studying of products and passing quiz were required.  Enjoyed all the workers.  Everybody got along well."
good,"Customer Service and working with Beauty Salons. "
good,"Good company with a passion for what they do.  Management is up  to speed for the most part. They have a very good training department and their follow up is good."
good,This job has given me the opportunity to learn a lot of skills i will be able to apply for future jobs. would not consider long term unless you get to a high level of management.
good,"Typical day at work would be me coming in checking the store making sure all inventory is put out or put up. Also to greet and assist customers with their purchases. I learned how to do inventory counts, make orders, receive shipment, mark downs. I loved my co-workers I feel we worked very well together and would work with that team again if I had the chance. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with people who are having a bad day and come in your place of business and try to take it out on you. The thing I enjoyed the most at this job would be the awesome people I met and had the pleasure of talking to."
good,"You don't overly get a lot of hours, but it's really fun to work there. You get a lot of social interaction. You also really get to know your customers. The co-workers were the best! I loved the girls there and still keep in touch with them. Overall great experience!"
good,a typical day at Sally's is usually very busy. we usually have 100 or more customers a day. The most enjoyably part of the job is meeting different people. The hardest part is trying to find something for a customer that would fit them perfectly.
good,"Working at Sally Beauty supply had many good things going for it, but they did not pay me what my almost 30 years experience should have.  I did get to educate customers and fellow employees on numerous products and procedures."
good,"Loved helping my customers. Lots of them followed my from store to store, because they knew I was there to help the when they needed me. Lots of my of my customers liked to come to my store because it was neat-clean and friendly people."
good,Often promote from within.  Relaxed environment. You are forced to sign an arbitration agreement to work there.  Pay is below market value.
good,"ringing up sales, customer service all day organizing. I learned a lot about pricing and products. Management was very controlling and made things more difficult then they had to be. my coworkers were all very nice. the hardest part of the job was Thursdays inventory. the most enjoyable part was helping someone find the right product for them and seeing them happy and coming back."
good,"Overall, CosmoProf is a great place to work. I absolutely love my job; learning new things and interacting with the customers. The incentive program is another added bonus to working for Sally Beauty Co. I simply wish they would raise the pay rate for the employees, especially non-management positions."
good,Its a very high pace environment where you have to be educated on the products and how to effectively use them. Co-workers were very nice and easy to get along with. I honestly enjoy working for the corporation.
good,"This is a great place to work u can learn alot about different hair care products and supplies,you also meet the most amazing people from many different walks of life.This company gives you knowledge about every product they carry it's a great place to work and shop."
good,"While working at Sally I typically cleaned, restocked shelves, and helped customers out. Being a part-time employee I only received 10 hours of week which was simply not do-able. I loved the job as a whole though."
good,"Typical day at work included front facing products, plan-o-grams, up-sales, and customer service. I learned a lot about the products carried in the store. Management could use some improvement but I really enjoyed working with my co-workers. There were no hard parts about this job but I really enjoyed learning about the products and doing the plan-o-grams."
good,Management was not stable would like to have been trained for management but did'nt want to train new persons. co workers were easy to work with. Hardest part of job was theft .
good,"Pretty busy for the most part. Extremely busy around the holidays. I learned a lot about the products we sold. We were required to take quizzes monthly on featured products so we would know what we are selling our customers. My co-workers were always nice and I enjoyed working with each of them. The hardest part of the job was working the evening shift. Wasn't hard, but was difficult for me because I have children who needed me home after school. But other than that I would say I enjoyed working there."
good,Offered opportunity to acquire direct experience with day to day operations of a specialty retailer.
good,Sally's was quite an experience
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting customers, replenishing shelfs, assisting customers, and operating the cash register. I learned how to operate a cash register, how to make bank deposits for the store, and how to prepare for inventory. The co-workers were very friendly and always worked well as a team. Keeping up with inventory was the hardest part of the job because of the shoplifters. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers."
good,the job was nice but hours were being cut and management was not that great.
good,I haven’t had many problems with the company and was able to advance pretty far in a short time. however I did see other associates have a hard time and issues with corporate. The most difficult part was a lack of training. They say they support you while you are learning but I felt I had very little support. When I finally did have my training I learned soooo much! Not a terrible company to work for but not the best.
good,"A typical day at work is to complete different tasks the store provides for employees. I learned about hair color, hair types, treatments, etc. Management is fair. The store manager works with the work schedule and is willing to help the employee strive. The district manager sometimes appreciates the store's work but is always there to find a mistake. The hardest part of the job trying to achieve individual sales and overall sales. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting discounts, free sample products, and paid vacations."
good,Great place to work with flexible hours.  Great for someone that needs a second job.  Friendly atmosphere and good bonuses every few months for their associates.
good,"I absolutely loved working for sallys. You were free to be yourself,  help customers with amazing products,  and work on a great team. The hours are very flexible and it's a very easy to do job."
good,"I liked working at Sally Beauty supply because you learn a lot about hair products and hair coloring."
good,"I’m still employed at Sally’s and I love the job .  The atmosphere is  eccentric  and everyone I work with is outgoing , fun, and just over all amazing!!!!! I highly suggest applying if you like working with the public and hair care/dyes !!!"
good,"I enjoyed my experience with Sally’s as though we didn’t need better management . It teaches you a lot about nails , hair , color and different products ."
good,"Sally's is a great company to work for, I've had wonderful managers, and it didn't take me long at all to advance to becoming a manager myself. My DM is wonderful about answering questions and helping out wherever she can."
good,"It was a great experience and I am happy that I was able to learn and work side by side with other diligent and hardworking people. I enjoyed my time, and learned a great deal about the company."
good,Working at Sally Beauty really helped me learn more about the beauty industry and helped drive my motivation to go to hair school. I was very heartbroken to leave the company because it was such a fun place to work I loved my job dearly. The other employees are so fun to work with and so easy to get along with. Overall GREAT place to be employed.
good,"After working for a big box store, working here was very relaxed. A fun atmosphere to work in and I learned a lot from the manager I had at the time there. My coworkers were very sweet and as long as you did your job and took care of the customers you were good."
good,"Very clean workplace, and organized. Very nice staff, and teachers. Learned how to audit and organize team members kits. Very good Safty  protocol. Very cool workable work place."
good,"I worked in Sally’s for over 3 years. It was a nice part time job to have. Sally’s works really well with you’re schedule, especially while I was in cosmetology school."
good,"I worked at a relatively new store location so the job was very easy going and relaxed. We met sales goals but we not a very high volume store. My co-workers were very nice and helpful. I learned a lot about hair care and coloring while working there. "
good,Working here I gained a lot of experience in retail sales and customer service. The store I worked for was pretty structured overall. Goals were in a fair position to be reached. Hours were fair and breaks.
good,"it was always a great day at work, positive energy. mostly stay to myself so i wont get involve in something that not work related. i learn alot about hair color, makeup and differnt other products. there was nothing  hard about the job, some days i was there by myself. i learn alot on my own, the enviroment, culture, and people are great"
good,Learn a lot of techniques that will help in a long  run  to success and continue to be productive hard worker and have ability to be better than it is
good,A typical day of work is a breeze. Possibly one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. The hardest part of the job is corrective color (everyone thinks they can do their own color) and dealing with snooty stylists. I learned a lot about color and products. The most enjoyable part of the job is the overall atmosphere. It's super laid back.
good,Tienes opcion de crecimiento en el ambito laboral a largo plazo
good,"I worked there part time and it was fine. I don't think it was very demanding, you don't have to have more than a highschool education to work there. the management was fine"
good,"Some higher up management definitely needs reviewing, I think the company could give more opportunities for growth or advancement. Getting a raise is not an option so don't bother. But if you are looking for something with minimal hours that isn't exhausting or strenuous, Sally Beauty is not a bad place to work. Other than the occasional conflict with coworkers, you'll be just fine. I love my job there, it's super easy. It does get a bit repetitive."
good,"Muy buena paciencia de parte de las administradoras, excelente ambiente por que son puras chicas."
good,"My job here is great if you're willing to constantly change and stay up with corporate standards with selling ability."
good,"Sally Beauty Supply had good incentives. I learned to keep the store running, and being a manager, I could help others move up in the company. I was responsible for opening and closing of the store. Scheduling, banking, paperwork, train employees. The hardest part was to be working twelve hours more than three days in a row. The customers and employees were the most enjoyable."
good,I loved the management at my store and my coworkers.  It was a fun place to go into work everyday.  It was also a lot of fun to be able to connect with customers on more than just a business basis by helping them w/ their personal care and beauty needs.
good,I love cosmetology and helping others feel good about their self also loved the customer service experience and continuously learning about new products and meeting new people as well as salon owners.
good,"It could of been better if manager was more professional, she displayed a lot of favoritism and CURSED at employees. Situations were dealt in a very petty and unprofessional manner. Everything else about the company was fine. Just have to be willing to do inventory."
good,"As far as retail jobs go, this one is an extremely friendly, exciting, and overall wonderful experience. They genuinely value the importance of equal team work, so much so that it's in the training. You are quizzed and get to learn professional grade knowledge without going to school, and get to talk to professionals who genuinely love what they do and what we provide for them. They have amazing customers, customer service policies, and employee benefits. A typical day is helping your customers find their perfect product whether it be a curl cream, wax kit, or new hair color. The hardest part is of course trying to stay on top of customer service while unloading the weekly shipment. Luckily that only happens once a week. The most enjoyable part, though, is having a customer come back to the store just to show you how happy they are with whatever you helped them with."
good,"I enjoyed working at Sally's, every day was a new story, never knowing exactly what was going to happen. Daily chores were standard and always assigned before the shift began. You knew several weeks in advance when your shifts would be and had ample opportunities to exchange. The reward/incentive programs in place were nice although I never got the chance to cash my points in. "
good,"Sally's is a great place to work for if your looking to advance your knowledge and career in the hair and beauty industry, or if your just looking for a part-time place to work."
good,"Es buena empresa para trabajar, pagan bien pero a veces se hace muy pesado el trabajo."
good,Good company with loyal client base. Strong cash flow. Tends to overreact to market conditions rather than making decisions based on longer term thinking.
good,"Sallys is filed with alot of small tasks, not just being on the register which was challenging and made it interesting. The management was kind, they know how to give constructive critism to make you grow but are not afraid to push you."
good,I loved all the customers that I encountered. Having the knowledge about the products made my job easier to assist others. The work environment was fun and interesting.
good,"Days consist of 7-9 hour days, which you are required to be on your feet. We offer customer service to those in need of beauty advise. Having someone come in with NO IDEA what they need or even how to begin leaving happy & satisfied is the best part of my job. Listening and providing empathy & sympathy to the people we come in contact with.The daily duties also include stocking. Shipment arrives in the store biweekly on Fridays. There are resets to be done per email to meet the company layout. Price changes are emailed weekly as well. Correction counts are done to help with the replenishment of stock. We maintain the appearance of the store by dusting, window cleaning, sweeping, & mopping. The knowledge that I has received has been very helpful even though I am not licensed"
good,"It helps to have a basic understanding of the beauty industry when coming into this job, or else one might be overwhelmed with foreign terminology and phrases used by beauticians."
good,A typical day at work would include opening the store and preparing for the customers to arrive. I really enjoyed helping the customers find the right products they needed to make themselves look and feel their best! The smiles of the customers after trying products that i recommended is probably the best part of my day. The smiles happened everyday.
good,i loved my job at sallys but there were no room for growth. and the pay was minimum wage. i was a cosmetology student when i worked here and tried keeping my job while moving into a new career once i received my license. the people i worked with and the manager were awesome !!! i couldnt of ask for a better team of people to work with. i was sad to go and sometimes even wish i still had my job here.
good,"A typical day at work starts out with great customer service.What i have learned is to try to walk in the customers shoes and help them with their needs.I learned that you cant fix everybody but you can nly do your best to help them.The hardest part of the job is really nothing unless you have unhappy customers ,the most enjoyable part is to send them leaving with a smile on their face."
good,I enjoyed helping the customers decide on the product of need. You also recieved points if you sold items of the week and you were able to sample alot of the product to where you could share you experience with the product.
good,This company give discount free trail for most new products and if show drive pretty quick promotions. within a year I was offered assistant manager. Never needed to buy styling products had enough free samples. As a manager can work toward company trip.  
good,Simple retail job. It was fine working at Sally's. Customers were always very nice and the work was pretty much easy as could be. New product sampling too!
good,Needs to be more organized. Lack of compassion for employees. Too much over time. Don’t appreciate overtime worked. Needs more supervisors. People quit left and right.
good,It was a fun place to work at. I loved learning about all the new products and all the hair color. I also loved the fact that you can have tattoos and crazy color hair and it was OK.
good,"A typical day at Sally Beauty Supply; Open the store, count the drawers, count bank deposit, help customers find what they need, answer any questions they might have, usually got a 30 minute break, cleaned the store, close the store at the end of the night, counted the drawers for closing."
good,I worked for this company 2 times each time that I worked here I was satisfied to an extent. I loved the work but the pay was not enough for someone that has a family unless you are up in management.
good,"I enjoyed working at Sally Beauty Supply. I learned quite a bit about different beauty products. I had a few good colleagues, and some were not so great. The hardest part was trying to help a customer with something that I wasn't sure about. The best part was interacting and helping customers and getting to be surrounded by beauty products all day."
good,I've learned a lot about the products we have. Another thing that I learned was how to do correction counts and price changes. the hardest part of my job is doing the plan-o-guides which is when we have to switch up a whole section.
good,"Sally Beatty is a fun exciting place. Compensation could be better. Employees always helpful. Great place to shop for salonn quality products for hair, skin or nails."
good,"The job in general is good. Customer service, and training skills acquired. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy and getting compliments from them of how much they really liked their hair after the advice that I gave them.  A typical day would start by going in and stock my sections, later cash register, sometimes office and paperwork duties. Opening the store and closing it depending on the shifts worked. The hardest part of the job is getting rid of shoplifters and hope that you don't get into an armed robbery. Being that you are not armed yourself.  Corporate will go out of their way to make any employee that was hired years ago as full time into a part time employee, any way they can."
good,Great to work for. Friendly environment. Great leadership. Lots of little bonuses if you work hard. Very well organized company. Lots of training involved
good,Sally Beauty is a great job to work at i been here three years and still present i am ready to further my career. you can learn alot from working at Sally Beauty.
good,"I worked for Sally Beauty for 2 years and advanced from a Store Associate to an Assistant Store Manager to a Store Manager. They provide many opportunities to grow within the company. Unfortunately, the Sally district I worked for had a great turnover rate; they were ALWAYS hiring due to a lack of employees. Customer's expect the employee's to be thoroughly educated on hair color, waxing, hair and nail care (as they should) but the training program(s) provided limited education on such topics. If you are a full-time employee, the company offers benefits such as health care and vacation pay. If your shift was 6+ hours, you were guaranteed a 30 minute, off the clock lunch. Higher management could be superficial and ungrateful towards their employees. I stepped down as Store Manager due to how critical, unappreciative and stress endearing they were towards their inferiors."
good,"Very laid back place to work, awesome coworkers, slow store so we pretty much cleaned a lot and tidied up the store, manager is really nice and  great discount."
good,A typical day at Sally Beauty Supply is pretty simple. We greet our customers. Assistant them with their needs and show them the newest products that arrived fir the month.
good,"I like helping people with their beauty needs. My co workers and I get along well, and it is an overall fun place to work. We get to try new products and tell our customers about them as well."
good,"Good starting job, decent pay."
good,"I've had a great experience with sallys however I've been transfered to a bad area and my store has been robbed, I've been assaulted by a customer, and I feel as though I am underpaid for the work I do/ crazy things I deal with that are out of the company's control."
good,The location I worked at was a family environment. The staff worked together well as a team with a manager who was part of the team helping where and when she could.
good,Pretty easy. We do a lot of merchandising guides and setting sales each month. Manager is pretty awesome. Let's me request days off that I need off without any hassle. Wish they paid more.
good,A typical day at work consist of being on the register helping customers find what there looking for and also finishing task that your manager will leave you.
good,"very friendly environment. all the female co-workers automatically clicked, and became good friends. manager was very leanient with college schedule and understanding,"
good,"I worked here throughout my college years and it served as great supplemental income while I was in school. I learned quite a bit about cosmetology, working with the public, customer service, and handling/managing funds. The most challenging aspect of this job would be customer service. However, this was often the most rewarding aspect as well!"
good,I learned how to handle and take care of customers in any situation. How to price different items and stock them. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck every Tuesday and it really wasn't that hard.
good,Me encanta su ambiente laboral.  Tuve que salirme por cambiar de residencia a un lugar en el cual no podia pedir un cambio en el trabajo.
good,"waiting on customers helping them"
good,"Es un excelente trabajo para poder desenvolverte personal y laboralmente. Lo recomiendo mucho aparte, de no parecer trabajo porque es divertido poder interactuar con los clientes."
good,"Easy to work with, you learn a lot of new stuff. I like that they teach you as you go, so no need to feel pressured for not having or knowing little knowledge of the fashion/hair industry. As long as you're willing to learn and Maintain a positive work place, you will enjoy this job."
good,"Friendly people to work with. I got free products every month. I got a discount, plus I received points for certain products I sold. Closing duties where an issue because there was not enough keys. After I would close I would have to drop them off to another employee. Gas was not included. I also never got any weekends off."
good,"Greet and assist customers with hair and color choices."
good,"Sally's is a very rewarding job, you get to feel good knowing you made a customer happy. It is very easy work, not much hours or pay but you get by. It is a fun work place, very laid back"
good,I worked for Sally Beauty Supply for over 14 years. I started as an associate and was promoted to store management within 2 years. Working for such a large company comes with many benefits and great incentives to reach goals. What I enjoyed most about being a store manager for this company was the freedom I received to run my location as if it were my own.
good,"A typical day at Sally Beauty Supply as a manager would be, coming in and starting with the morning paperwork, checking to make sure all totals from the previous day have no errors. Next would be making sure all the duties from the previous day have been completed by the staff members successfully to company standards, if they have not been completed, the staff member would be completing set task with help from their manager to make sure the employee has fully understood what has been requested and expected. Next would be assigning new tasks for the day making sure it's following the guidelines of the weekly routine as well as maintaining customer service. "
good,"enjoyable to work at, we do a lot of plan-o-guides and rearranging, weekly price changes, enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,"Very fast past job, with people eager to help one another.  Enjoyable to work with such wonderful people, and upper managment."
good,I learned most in this job how vital communication really is in a retail environment. I realized that communicating even those things that may be uncomfortable to confront someone with can be huge impacts on the environment you are working in. Management was very helpful! I had a difficult situation arise with an employee and was able to go to my manager and she patiently spent time on the phone with me going over my concerns and helping me to best address the problem. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers we had.
good,"You get to sell hair and beauty products. They send samples for employees to try so they can recommend the product. The atmosphere is great to work in. The every day duties are to help costumers, recommend products, and run the cash register."
good,I would open the store most of the time as well as close it. A typical day would begin with me counting the draws and getting the bank deposit ready before opening the doors to our customers. Our goal is to make sure we put out back stock and any extra shipment that may have been left over from previous day. Checking store emails and printing out any price changes within the store was a must and generally kept me busy throughout the day. Showing great customer service as well as multitasking was one of the main things we wanted to keep in mind while working for the company. At the end of the day making sure all product is pulled forward and all sale items were priced correctly before leaving every night.
good,"Sally Beauty Supply is a great place to work. I loved all of my staff and all of our customers. Our job was to provide the utmost customer service to everyone that came in. Sales, quotas, product launches were all a part of it too. "
good,"A typiacal day was making sure the store was front faces and easy to shop. Greeting customers and helping them with thier needs."
good,taking care of the customers making sure there finding what they came in there for and making sure there buying the right hair color for them.
good,"Usually just focus on customer Service and product knowledge."
good,"aprendi a trabajar en equipo, respetar a tus jefes la responsabilidad que habia en el trabajo, nunca podias parar 1 minuto a platicar por que el gerente ya te habia regañado lo que me gustaba en ese trabajo eran los descansos y la comunicacion con mi jefe directo"
good,Nice atmosphere wonderful employees part time job while in college and it allowed for flexibility and was not stressful.
good,"Great place to start and grow your career, though pay is not close to industry standards."
good,"My co-workers were great. My particular manager was very stubborn and had a bad attitude most times. The constant bickering between our manager and the other employees was a little annoying until it led to a harrassment case, in which caused me to want to leave that store location and no other locations were hiring at the time."
good,"We didn't speak directly to customers but to clerks at the retail locations. They were usually very frustrated and impatient due to customers who were in a hurry. We walked them through swapping out equipment, troubleshooting printers, monitors, remotely logged into the computers at the location to update software, and any other computer equipment issues they incurred. Patience was a huge requirement, trying to explain installing a new printer to someone who has no clue what they are doing was a daily occurrence. I was able to learn a variety of skills useful for troubleshooting P.O.S. equipment."
good,Great company to work for. Not great benefits. room for advancement
good,"As the store manager my biggest thing to do on a day to day bases is customer service. I also did what was required for me to run a successful retail store. I opened/closed store as well as hired and trained new employees. "
good,"The work environment was great until management. She was very unorganized, rude, and had no respect for the employees."
good,"A typical day at work is going in just work on overstock, 100% customer service walking around when customers are present watching out and asking for help. The days we get shipment, just work on shipment until all is out. I learned a lot about hair dye, what you need, the difference between the developers. Perms, nail polishes etc "
good,"Working at Sally's was a very pleasant work experience. They teach their employees so much and offer free products monthly to all employees to further their knowledge about the products they sell. They also have awesome rewards and incentive programs! I loved going to work here not only because I loved my job, but I loved my co-workers, Superiors and my customers. The only part of this job I found to be less than perfect was the amount of hours I worked on average, I often worked 50 plus hours a week but was not allowed to work under 47, but what are Salary employees for!? All in all, I enjoyed working for the company and would return!"
good,"Sally is a pretty fun place to work, with retail its fun because it's always something new."
good,"Sally Beauty Supply is a organized work place, it prepared me for the retail environment."
good,"We came in, got our work done, had some smiles and laughs, and went home! Managment wasnt the best just for the fact that we never had a permanant manager, they would always switch, so that was hard. Other then that it was great!"
good,"Establishing great rapport with my fellow co-workers as well as our valued customers.Daily opening and closing of the store.Managing daily deposits.Managing inventory process of weekly store shipment,supplies and restocking products to shelves."
good,The days was long. Management sucks. The Manager was in more mess than the employee's. Loved the customers. I like helping them. Co-workers was as bad as the Manager. They need a police officer there at all times. I never worked for a company that the customer stole so much and got robbed. 
good,"A typical day at Sally's is very hectic and rewarding. You learn an extensive amount about the beauty industry, customer service, and how to manage time wisely. They have an excellent benefits package for anyone wishing to work 35+ hours a week. If you dislike standing for long periods of time, working varying hours, lots of quick thinking, and multi-tasking, this job is not for you. But if you enjoy becoming part of a team, thriving under pressure, have superior customer service skills, and like to excel at whatever you do, you will love this company."
good,"Fun place to work when you are surrounded by what you love. It can be fast paced on certain days but it always really fun to teach people what you have learned on the job, as far as the specifics of how to dye you hair and care for it properly. You learn something new everyday here!"
good,enjoyable part of the job is the customers
good,"Having great customer service and selling skills. Taking care of backstocking, cleaning and receptionist work. The hardest part of the job is keeping your sale goal to where it needs to be. The enjoyable part is working with customers, co-workers are great and easy to work with, meeting new people and the friendly environment"
good,My typical day at work included organizing beauty supplies and helping costumers with hair products and questons. Magagment was very understanding with my schedule. Co-works were not always helpful when store would get busy.
good,-servicing customers with products
good,"Creces súper rápido, el ambiente laboral es muy bueno, aprendes mucho, en general es un muy buen lugar para trabajar."
good,The workplace was easy to work in. Most workers are professional and keep themselves on task. Everything is fairly well organized. I had alot of freedom to complete my tasks when it convenienced me.
good,I loved my job and the two other woman i worked with became very close and we are still very close till this day. I would of stayed working there but the manager was not a manager. She literally did whatever she wanted. She was never in the front trying to help us. She was always in the back of the store on her phone.
good,I love the culture in this store and how the employees work together. There are a few problems but what workplace doesn't.  I love it there everyone gets along.
good,"Manager willing to help with work  schdule around school schdule. Pay was decent, Recieved raises. Busy fast paced store made shift go by quickly.always something different to do day to day at work."
good,Like most retail jobs if you are not a key holder or manager you do not get many hours. Also district/regional managers encourage store managers to hire Multiple employees so that no employee is for time which is 30 hours or more. The starting wage is $10 the job does require a lot of work and going out of your way to do a little bit more. It sometimes seems like a lot but if you love the beauty industry and try new products then you would definitely love this job because the work atmosphere is great
good,"I learned a lot when I worked there. I had two wonderful people who worked with me that took the time to train me properly. They were very patient and it made my  time there fun,"
good,"A typical day at work is really simple and calm. Sally's is not much of a fast-pace working place, but it has its days. Its a fun place to work at if you know the products very well. Not the best nor the worst."
good,"Un  dia Tipico.. muy agradable atencion y servicio a clientes."
good,"It’s a good place to work. Assistant Managers and Managers don’t get paid nearly enough. You have your regular customers, which I love. I’ve always had pretty awesome coworkers."
good,"Small team. Basic sales job: hit sales goals, help customers, and have product knowledge. Provides product training and samples of new products. Fairly flexible scheduling. Is almost always part-time."
good,"Es una muy buena empresa para cuestión de crecimiento."
good,Managers and coworkers were great to work with. They worked well with my schedule. Great training. Great customer service. Well organized with management.
good,"From my time at Sally Beauty supply i learned a great deal about how customer service is everything when it comes to enjoying a job in this particular field. The downside to this company, is they will care more about pushing the customer to making a purchase then caring about the customers needs."
good,You get great product knowledge from each employee as well as one on one interactions. The employees are great at helping you find exactly what you're looking for & at suggesting new products for you to try.
good,I learned a lot about hair products I had a really awesome manager and fellow employee. If you wanna be a hair dresser that would be the best place to get started.
good,"fun place to work and if you are interested in beauty products, this is the place for you! You can sell them and try them for free before you sale them."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sally Beauty. The job was so basic and easy to learn. There was always something to do so your day never went by slowly. The angry and nasty customers were easily the worst part of this job, other than that job advancement was rarely an option. I also do not think compensation was up to standard. I felt that Sally required a lot out of an individual and did not pay them what their work was worth. Fun job you just will never get anywhere, and if you do, you will not make enough money."
good,My location that I ran was very family oriented. As the manager I was able to be flexible and take ownership of my team and had excellent retention and an incredible group of associates.
good,Amazing opportunities and advancements perfect payroll system and benefits many changes for the better happen frequently an understanding and caring company
good,I thought that working at Sally’s was a great opportunity for myself. My previous manager was great and the hours were available. I had to leave to focus on school but I am thinking about reapplying.
good,"If you like hair, skin, and nails you will love this place I did. Lots of hard work but good work. Compation towards sales always a good challenge, item of the month, IOM, pushing sales inside of store always fun. Knowing your merchandise is a plus getting to know your merchandise always a challenge"
good,I love my job st Sally’s and really torn between staying or leaving since the new structure and my hours got cut in half and it’s hard to leave if off 20-25 hrs a week
good,"I love it and the free employee sampling is great. "
good,The pay could be better considering how much they give off for products and coupons they have every month they could put more of that money into the employees pockets. The atmosphere is great. The place becomes like family even with the regulars.
good,Sally Beauty was a great place to work.  Great advancement opportunities. Ability to make manager in a year and district manager within 5 years. Customer service was awesome.
good,I was a seasonal worker working through the 2015-2016 holiday. I really enjoyed my time at Sally. the management was nice and welcoming. I did many things from boxing to picking and packing.  Overall I don't have many
good,I worked there all through high school and they were very flexible with my schedule. Not good for long term employment unless you are promoted to manager of some sort. Pay an hour was not enough for amount of work.
good,My mission their was to make others happy with our products and to see how my knowledge helped them succeed with beauty. The reason i worked was for my customers.
good,"Good place to work.  Great people.  Has some instability due to the changing retail consumers. "
good,Was a great learning experience going into the beauty industry and finishing school still have a guaranteed paycheck to work with opening a new salonWorks well with my schedule
good,"I would restock shelves, work with the local salons for product delivery.  The public was welcome and I would help answer their beauty questions.  "
good,A typical day at work does not really exist.  Every day is different.  It makes in interesting.  The culture is good.  the most enjoyable part of the job is working with so many different people.  The biggest challenges relate to the competition in the market place and industry for beauty products and retail.
good,its a great place to work. however it just doesn't pay enough and very long hours if you are in management. you also dont have the ability to discipline your staff on your own and have to prove things so you can do a wright up.
good,Been with company 7 years.. really enjoy the people i work with and great customers. Only down side is holidays In  the retail world. Pretty normal stuff.
good,Thankfully I have a great manager! She's very understanding and stern at the same time. All you have to do is keep the store up-kept and organized. Its fun because of the customers. You learn so much by just talking to do them.
good,"This was probably my favorite job I have ever had, my co-workers were the best ( besides management ) we always found ways to have fun, not a lot of annoying customers good work life balance. Management needed major improvements when I was still there but it seems they've cleaned out some bad apples would recommend to any one!"
good,"Almost every day I learned something new, and the manager knew how to pick people to work with which made it enjoyable. Also satisfying customers wen they came in and showed me their new hair after I've helped them."
good,"Fun place to work. Lots of perks. Lots of changes in the company, so lots of issues within the store. Hopefully will get better in time. Lots of availability to move up in the company."
good,I loved working at Sally's. The environment and culture are very positive and friendly. You can even grow to management positions. It is goal oriented since it is sales but it is very fun and the incentives are great as well.
good,"Supervised employees, handled all administrative duties, Inventory Management, Marketing, attended beauty contests and conventions."
good,"The overall culture is of professionalism and straightforward accomplishment of all routine projects and tasks. However, within that steady flow, the individuals who made up the team with whom I worked provided kinship and support for the pressures of the monthly deadlines. The leadership during my time at Sally was either creative themselves or valued and understood creative's role. The hardest part was the projects' lack of variety. But that also provided opportunity for faster growth in excellence."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is helping customers make decisions regarding their beauty routines and recommending products from a large selection that we carry.
good,I like greeting and assisting others in general on an everyday basis to find their essential needs. To see a smile on a customer's  face just makes my day!! I enjoyed my job!!
good,This would be a good job if you are in college and needing part-time. Fun environment and employee discounts. But not enough pay or hours to go around.
good,It’s great company to work for. But the pay for the hours and all the responsibilities that are given to not match. Workplace is relaxed and fun to be in. Management is great and helpful always pushing you forward. I recommend as a starter job.
good,"I loved working at sallys it was a great job. So sad to leave but its time, they have a great manegment with great job working standers. You truly work as a team in sallys"
good,"A typical day at Sally Beauty Supply for me was non-stop, always having something to do whether its taking care of freight, assisting customers, plan-o-guides, or monthly ad resets. I loved working here but difficult as far as advancement goes. The employee incentives/discounts were a great benefit."
good,"My job is different many days which is one of the reasons I have loved it for so many years.  I am either on the road scouting new locations or relocations, in an airport or in the office preparing for committee meetings to present new sites to committee."
good,I love working for Sally beauty. I had great opportunities there.  They have an intimate shopping experience which enables you to know your customers and know their needs. It's a great option and working in big box stores you get to learn great customer service because of that Internet shopping experience. And the hours are very compatible if you have children or if you need a second part time job. Sally also  offers a lot of great incentives for employees.
good,Sally Beauty was a fun and balanced employer to work for. The company has great benefits and discounts. I only wished Sally was closer to the Dallas area.
good,"Sally's was a decent business to work for, their pay rate is not as competitive as it could be. Otherwise, it is a good environment to work in with good employee discounts, and benefits available to full-time employees."
good,"great management , great working environment, great customers. when in sally's the workers educate and guide the customers on different products. positive energy."
good,"easy place to work especially if your into the beauty field."
good,I was the rsa archer and risk expert and helped out on sdlc and ssdlc.  it was a good environment as there were approximately 11 areas / tools sally beauty was interested in being reviewed and thoroughly documented.
good,"Assist customers with product selection"
good,I worked here during beauty school. Always up to date on education here and the management is wonderful. Lots of awesome perks. You get the hours you want too usually.
good,Fun place to work. Good environment. You get to meet lots of different people. You get to teach others about new products and products you've used before.
good,"I love working at Sallys as far as the culture, products, etc but management is so-so and they do not pay you according to skill, seniority or actions and only whether or not you have a cosmo license so that is unfortunate because they lose a lot of good people."
good,"I worked, developed and promoted employees warrant of moving up in the company. This was the most rewarding benefit of the position. A typical day could be flying to any of a number of states visiting our stores and ensuring all policies and procedures were followed.  New management (president) arrived and made moves that, as seen in our stock prices, directed poor management moves that cause lost of sales and talented employees."
good,"Management is exceptional in providing flexible work hours and creating a fun and exciting work environment. I have learned many things in my time including gaining more experience with customer service, doing daily paperwork and even banking duties as assigned by the company. The culture of the workplace is very relaxed and fun. The main objective with this company is to engage authentically with all of our customers and ensure they are satisfied with the products we recommend to them. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to connect with people of various backgrounds on such an intimate level that they gain trust and respect for you and your coworkers."
good,"Great people to work with. Fast paced but sometimes slow, either way there is always something to do to keep everyone busy. Learned how to up-sale product and really work with people."
good,Sales de la empresa sabiendo un poco más sobre productos te enseña a ser ordenada responsable y aprendes a maquillarte y a enseñar a maquillar al cliente ó recomendar algún producto
good,"Most days were incredibly chill but of course there are days where it gets crazy busy with customers or a lot of things need to be done. If management does their job well, it should never be too overwhelming. Overall, it's a pretty enjoyable job."
good,"Good place , nice people but doesn't pay very much and every two weeks. Benefits are not that great either. Love the job and people but need better pay."
good,Sally beauty is a well established company to work for . They had a variety of open opportunities for every employee and respected there needs. In this company you expand your knowledge and learn different strategies that are reasonable and helpful for you. Overall Sally beauty gave me the ability to learn new skills and build a relationship.
good,"It was a nice calm environment to work and the training was on going. If new products came in, there were videos to watch. Also there training videos weren't thrown all at once, you would watch one every month for 8 months."
good,You really need to be a good sales person to work at Sally's and push add-ons. Really fun company to work for and free employee samples every month.
good,"I handled cash and credit transaction. I received shipments, and shocked the store. Assisted guest with purchases, both professionals and non-professionals"
good,"Great place to work.. Easy advancement in management. Overall, a very pleasant working environment. Great customers"
good,this job was great. I loved it. but I was hired as a part-time employ and as time went by I needed to work a 40 hr. week and could only receive 30 hrs. so I had to get a 40 hr. job. I learned about beauty products and self service hair dressing products. management was fine. co-workers were all happy and worked well in busy times. in my mind there was nothing that hard about this job being that I am a hairdresser. the most enjoyable part of this job was helping the customers working with them giving them professional advice on what they wanted and needed.
good,I worked for this company for many years and found it to be a very satisfiying job to work.  I was a manager for this company as well and was treated well until I hurt myself at work and then that is when all had changed.
good,A typical day at Sally's Beauty Supply was always full of surprises. You never knew what the day would hold. Between your regulars and new customers there was never a dull moment. When the store was empty you had your coworkers who openly talk about life and whats going on. We cared about each other. We made the best out of the day. It made things better when someone was having a rough day. The most enjoyable part of the day would have to be around six o'clock. Thats usual a rush time and it helped time go by faster after lunchs.
good,checked out costumers and help them on the floor. great mamagement and great co-workers.
good,"love helping people with items they need to color their hair, wax eye brows or etc."
good,"I enjoy helping customers find thier beauty needs for hair or face, alot of people cannot afford going to a professional cosmetologist so they have to do their own hair, nails or skincare."
good,"It is a very interesting and fun job.  I have learned so much about hair, makeup and other things I did not know previously.  My co-workers are all great to work with, the hardest part of the job is standing on your feet during your work shift, I did learn that we need comfortable shoes.  I like the work ethic at Sally's."
good,"A typical day at work began with stocking sales items and helping customers, operating cash register and making change when necessary. At the close of the day, duties included presenting the store and balancing cash register. After balancing, days receipts and sales were joined with money for deposit and deposited in the safe until morning. I learned how to sale items at this job. The management was excellent with their communication skills and very accurate on instructions. Co-workers were professional and well mannered. The hardest part of this job was delivering items to various areas and directions to the locations were not correct. The most enjoyable part of this job was setting up displays and customer service."
good,"It was a typical at work but each day was different. I would have to restock shelves once every few days, organize the shelves throughout the day, clean before closing, once a week we would receive a new delivery of products, price changes, change sale posters for each season, etc."
good,I have worked at Sally Beauty for four years and can say it was a great starting point for my career.
good,"I enjoyed the team I worked with when I was first hired on. At the end, the new management and the new crew were there and they cut my hours and ruined the job for me."
good,"customer service"
good,"Sally Beauty Supply offers part time or full time positions. Insurance, vacation available for part time, holiday's and sick time for full time employee's."
good,"My typical day at work was very rewarding got a chance to serve the public with a sincere smile on my face, I was told by customers how welcome they felt when they walked in the store. I learned product knowledge and was able to help make better sales. I had nice co-workers, The hardest part about that job was when I was the only clerk in the store. Customer service was the most enjoyable to me."
good,"Customer service was our first priority, we always reviewed, studied, and personally tested new products in order to properly assist our clients. Meeting new people and gaining professional relationship was always up building and exciting. Inventory was taking and reported weekly. All the coworkers were like family."
good,A typical day at work is going in and attending to the customers and selling merchandise. I have learned to operate the systems. Learn different aspects of the company. You learn how to work as a team. Management is very reasonable and dedicated to their job. My co-workers are very friendly and knowledgeable. The hardest part is seeing a customer not finding something they need and they walk out empty handed. I really like seeing the customer satisfied and the store looking presentable at all times.
good,Dickerson job was a wonderful job and Sally's is and ok job its not the worst job nor its the greastest its a job. my feelings is netural against sally's
good,"It's a company you could work for as a career, if that's what you chose to do. I, however, did not."
good,"Inbound calls made once weekly.Take orders and deliever to companys.Do weekly paperwork required for all orders.Keep records of all dates,products sold,and cash spent.Keeping track of money and checks making sure it is all dropped in safe properly.Once a week inventory and price tagging.Monthly test and quiz on safety,product knowedgle.Front and face through out day.Excellent customer service.Taking phone calls and checking out customers.Daily clean up duties.Open and closeing store along with counting drawers down and filing paper work."
good,"Typical day at work ,I learned about the products and about hair, I got along with the manager, and co workers. the hardest part of the job was to remodel the store and move the shelves every month we did a plan o guide and that was moving the shelves because they were heavy. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting along with the customers and my co-workers we laughed and told stories."
good,"U learn alot on hair coloring, stlyes, treatments. days work is customer service, freight, replenish sales floor very easy. Day by day training. I like the experience of hair coloring"
good,if your into hair and hair care this is the place for you good hours lots of over time and good pay and you meet a lot of people. And don't be afraid to apply there's good training if your new to the hair care business.
good,"Pues me presente a entrevista me hicieron un pequeño roll play para vender y establecieron el salario,horario y vestimenta es buena empresa"
good,Good places to work make sure you get your hours good people  to work with will help you  move up in a position teach you alot to help you advance in the work  place
good,"Easy to do day to day tasks most days it’s the same routines, check costumers out at the register help them find items. Stock items when shipment comes in and some occasionally house cleaning"
good,I liked the fact that I could go to work daily and have confidence that my managers trusted my ability to get things done without constantly looking over my shoulder.
good,being a former cosmetologist I enjoyed helping guests with their haircare needs and ringing them up. I also would do displays on endcaps and make my own designs which was fun.
good,"My time working at sally was great. A typical day was organizing and maintaining clean the store, helping customers to find what they needed. The environment there was very multicultural and very understanding. I enjoyed the most building a relationship with the customer in a way the customer trusted and came back to the store to buy the products you recommended."
good,The culture is fabolous and the tools you are given are improving to be first class. It is a mandatory overtime situation but the work is satisfying and continuously offers advantages and challenges
good,"Great company for those with a passion for Hair, Nails and Cosmetics. If you love creativity or DIY looks this is the place to work. Got everything from tools to supplies!"
good,"I loved my job there. With new products coming out, there was always something to learn.  The training was very thorough and continued monthly. The benefits were great. When I was employed there the managers had a chance to win a trip each year. I won trips to Punta Cana and Cancun. My District Manager was wonderful, always available and very supportive."
good,Many different things to learn and maintain knowledge about. Lots of people are depending on and seeking advise from you. Must love learning and being open minded. Have a creative perspective and be very personable. Sally Beauty is a great place to work if you can think outside the box and work as a team.
good,"En lo personal una muy buena opcion para trabajar,  hay buen crecimiento,  buen sueldo trabajo en ocasiones pesado pero la mayor parte es relax."
good,"Excellente job thanks you for the opportunity and I learn about beauty brands,I consulted the customers,I loved it when I came back whith the results and work whit customers."
good,Alot of customer communications. Majority of the customers are Spanish speaking so a bit hard to communicate with them. Very busy and have to be on your toes to being very polite and patience is important.
good,I loved working for Sally's I would go back in a minute.i love the fast paced work and lived staying busy. Learning new product.the people are down to earth and we helped each other out.im a fast learner and bet good at what I do..would love to work in an atmosphere like that again.
good,I enjoyed my employment Sally's and would encourage anyone in the beauty and retail services to join the Sally's team. They have a supportive and positive business culture that encourages friendly competition.
good,"Second job, manager is super awesome and is always very grateful for extra help when employees call in and even though you're off, you'll get the extra hours for coming in on a day you're not scheduled."
good,"Very fun place and you learn a lot, lots of good training. Compensation needs to be looked at by corporate. I love the way they allow you to express your beauty there."
good,existia en esos años muy buena coordinacion con las personas de oficina
good,"I've been with the company for over 3 years now.  I can honestly say that new management has completely turned this place around in the best ways.  When I first started management was awful and had no idea what they were doing.  Now their main focus is customer experience.  They train you very well on how to be the ""Girlfriend in the know"" and reward good sales.  Since management has changed, we've yet to be yelled at over anything, instead they teach us how to improve it and we do.  In turn our store started doing WAY better than it used to, we have met every single goal for a a year now.  I've never met someone who doesn't love working at Sally's.  The team logo is ""One team one goal"" and they really stick true to that. The only downside is you are not allowed fulltime, so you can't have more than 29 hours a week.  However, they try to make up for that.  Minimum wage here is 8.25 and Sally's starts you off at 10 an hour with yearly raises."
good,This is a very busy work environment. I will recommend this saloon to any worker that enjoys working in a busy work setting. During my years with this company we barely have time for lunch which was very challenging to lots of people. But for I always have snacks therefore had never encountered problems like other staff.
good,I absolutely for the first time in my life love my job here at Sally Beauty. I've learned and grown a lot over the past couple of years and have a strong bond with everyone I work with. Overall my job is fun and rewarding the only issue I have is pay. If pay wasn't so low I'd plan to stay with the company longer. It's just too low to support a family on.
good,My Work Day was Controlling Work Area and Directing Employees to their Job assignment and work areas. There wasnt anything hard about the Job. I enjoyable the Friendly Work Place.
good,I would recommend apply for Sally Beauty they offer a lot of wonderful benefits and there’s always room to grow. Sally’s is very flexible with your schedules for students and pet time parents.
good,Organization lacked infrastructure but was very strongly assumed towards its mission. Very easy to get along with coworkers and great knowledge that ward learned on the job.
good,Es una muy buena empresa con salario competitivo y buenos  incentivos
good,"vales de despensa , descaso , seguro, descanso orio de comida"
good,"I think it is a wonderful company to work for, but for someone who is not going to school it is not a job on its own something to live off of. "
good,It's a great place to have a part time job as minimum hours are available. In the other hand this is not a place that provides enough hours to have a better living.
good,I am 15 and my mom used to work at the hair experience so I really enjoy hair. I go to Twin Falls High School which is also known as Bruins and I find that school very interesting and fun school to go to. My mom worked in cosmetology for about 2 years and she's taught me a lot about cosmetology and how it works and I find it very interesting and I would like to pursue my dream to be a cosmetologist and start out at Sally's.
good,I was the store Manager for Sally's. It was my favorite retailer to work for I enjoyed the customer base as well as my employees. The training program offered advancement to elevate both skills and positions. Good opportunities.
good,Great company to work with. Fun working with our community. The best team members to work with have good flexible schedule help you In financially with beauty industry
good,"Buen ambiente, agradable trabajar en belleza y aprender cosas nuevas capacitaciones constantes."
good,"Nice laid back environment "
good,Sally's is a good place to work. They work with your schedule. The pay is ok if you are a licensed cosmetologist. You get benefits. The store is mostly busy depending the location.
good,"Not the best career advancement choice, but none the less a amazing company. The managers are great and work with you as long as you are a good worker and are productive. Amazing atmosphere."
good,"Working at Sally Beauty Holding has taught me how to trust and believe in myself. I've grown so much from holding this position, being, that I'm always having to adjust to daily and weekly changes. Since working here, I've learned more about being a team player and trusting those that are around me."
good,"Worked on putting away shipment quickly and effectively "
good,"Como empleados tenemos la responsabilidad de cumplir totalmente con el plan diario de trabajo establecido tanto de ventas como de orden, organización  física. Realizar trabajo clerical manejo y archivo de documentos. Mantenimiento y ordenes de inventario. Gestionar pedidos de clientes."
good,This company offers a very flexible schedule. Full time hours are rare to come by and some locations are slow paced. So if your in school or a mom with kids then this company is best for you. Would not see it a career advancement move as they do pay under the cost of living.
good,At Sally's they train you on every aspect of everything that they sell so that you are able to assist the customers with most of any questions they may possibly have with knowledge and the tools needed for the best customer service.
good,"It was fun getting to learn more about the products I would have been working with after I let there to become a full time stylist, and the people I worked with were amazing."
good,You must be willing to work. Back stocking and cleaning are a portion of the position. Customer service is a must as well as front end experience. I loved working for this company. There is room for advancement if you have a passion for it.
good,the team is good and paid training gives you time to learn how to sale products works well with your scheduled. rewards you for saleing more item of the month
good,Supervised employees. Daily cash handling. Night deposits. Weekly employee scheduling. Training new employees. Shipped and received supplies. Monthly inventory of products.
good,Small stores but  a much more personal work environment. My manager is great and I am able to really communicate with my peers. The only downside is managing with a small crew in the event of an emergency.
good,Hindsight is everything... i thought I was going to advance my career elsewhere but didn't happen. should have stayed..people make mistakes... i am one of them
good,HUGE variety of customers. From seasoned pros to schoolgirls trying to get beauty. Also lots of theft and vandalism here. Often alone in facility and expected to assume GM role.
good,I interacted with the public and gained more practical knowledge of the Cosmetology field. I felt I was a key contributor to the organization and I enjoyed feeling like I assisted the customers with their personal beauty needs and pursuit of their goals.
good,"Love working with the team...we come together as one to get the job done. Perks...free samples, points to redeem for things we want, great upper management. Been with the company 5 years. Still finding balance with home life...it's a challenge."
good,"Fun fast paced work atmosphere, great employees.  The managers were great.  Great benefits.  The only thing wrong the pay was not enough for me.  Work was interesting."
good,I enjoyed working at Sally's It was a fun and very Educational place to work. It is fast pace sometimes. A lot of Stocking and cleaning involved. You will learn a lot about the products you sell and also find out the best sellers. Have to have very good customer services skills and patience.
good,"But it's a relatively great place. 20% discount, free products monthly, points and rewards for earning them, and even an incentive trip. But you do have to know a lot of stuff, and sell a few items that may sometimes feel forced."
good,Es un trabajo tranquilo ya q no es una tienda muy grande el chiste es tener gusto por las ventas y la atención a clientes que es en lo q más se enfoca la empresa
good,Working here has definitely become a wonderful experience as I love to work with cosmetics. It's a good for the person who is going to college and would like a part time job within the same field.
good,"Era conocedor de ventas y promociones existentes, así como de los productos totales de la tienda."
good,"I loved the job itself and everyone I worked with. The only downfall is one week you may get a full 40 but if you don't make your weekly quota, hours get cut horrible and you may only work 20-30. Also, I had to work until 8 at night which is a hard thing for me to do because I am a single mom."
good,"My favorite part about working for Sally's Beauty Supply was the mandatory training each month; I was able to learn and work simultaneously. I learned more about hair, nails, and entrepreneurship in a few months than what I anticipated."

good,Sally's gave me the opportunity to advance in my career. I grew to be the star regional manager and trained new managers. I increase revenue at 3 different stores that were on a serious decline. I retired from Sally's.
good,This was another one of my favorite jobs because the store was really small and there was only about 4-5 employees employed there.

good,"New president is changing the culture to a better work environment. "

good,"good job, amazing staff, learned a lot"
good,"I've learned a lot about Cosmetology."
good,"A typical day at Sally Beauty Supply consists of giving consistent exceptional customer service. Meeting company goals daily is a must. You are rewarded with company given scratch offs and reward point for selling certain products during a single given month to be redeemed if you like after each month. After being with this company for 6 years, I have to say that like any retail job you have your ups and downs. The down part is the retention of managers and or employees. I have been through 5 managers since I have been there. However, my current manager has been by far the best one. She gets that all of the employees have lives outside work. The manager schedules us to work every other weekend which is amazing because most retail jobs you have to work every weekend."
good,"Sally's Beauty Supply is a nice business, we strive to help customers enhance their own beauty by using our products."
good,Work at Sally's beauty supply's was very enjoyable. you have your regular customers that knew what they needed but always wants your opinion

It was a very fulfilling time while my store advanced in sales and customer counts. I enjoyed the education I received through work, learning managerial skills such as: training, hiring, coaching, disciplinary actions, ordering and monitoring the area."
good,"It was a great job we get a lot of benefits, I loved working with majority of the customers that come in, sometimes we get some really rude people but you'll find that every where. The down side is that we do not get commission but we are rewarded every month with different products and depending on how much points you accumulate being there you can get things off the rewards web site."
good,"Fast Pace Job. "
good,"~Retail Sales.  "
good,"My day at work is very enjoyable, I like working as a team and at sally's we have to work as a team. Whenever there is a problem the management is always there ready to resolve the issue, the staff are all friendly and we all get on really well."
good,"Working for Sally's enables someone who has never worked with hair or nails and such to learn a thing or two. Most of the people who work for Sally Beauty Supply (that I was able to meet) had some form of background with hair or nails. The company gives everyone a chance at employment, going to beauty school only gives a person an advantage over the rest knowledge-wise."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, especially on the weekends. There's usually only 1-2 people working and we are assigned multiple tasks. Those tasks include cleaning, plan-o-grams, organization, and customer service. The hardest part is making sure everything is done properly and all tasks are completed. The most enjoyable part is the people. They fun and creative, that's why they come to Sally's!"
good,I loved working here because it was a fun atmosphere. They made 'selling' fun. You had numbers you needed to meet but it was easy to make if you followed your management and trusted yourself. 
good,This job requires you to handle cash register and answer basic hair care questions....they provide excellent training so that you are informed and that you provide accurate information to customers

I learned how to restock shelves and unpack shipments. I learned how to do bank deposits and I learned a lot about beauty products. The managment was great and my co-workers were also great to be around. The hardest part about my job was learning about the hair dyes. The most enjoyable part was the interaction with the customers."
good,"waited on the customers "
good,"The manager was really nice and really down to earth, the workers were easy to get a long with. I loved to work there because i loved to talk about hair stuff everyday and helping people decide on what to do or get, Even just give my option."

good,Assisting the manger with her duties and stocking shelves.

I did my best to get the store caught up and running correctly. I enjoyed the customers and training new employees.
good,"Working here was an great experience, Manager taught me to run the store."

good,It was a good place to work.I learn how to take better care of my own hair. I got to know some good people and enjoyed it.
good,I liked it but Manager had a horrible attitude and tried to hard to have authority and be perfect. Coworkers were nice some lazy then you have hardworking coworkers too. The most enjoyable part was the customers and learning about the many products.
good,"The training I received for management was excellent. Every day was different. There was always something to do. I learned so many different ways to deal with consumers. I grew as a person while working for this company. My co-workers were very compliant and we completed duties as a team. For me, there was never a hard part to my job. I enjoyed my position, setting goals and going over and beyond them. I feel the most enjoyable part of my job is that I had a wonderful team and we all worked together to inhance each other."
good,"I loved the public and getting to know my customers on a one by one basis. The work was hard and sometimes stressful, but at the end of the day it was worth it by seeing my customers happy and satisfied."
good,"It was a while since I worked at sally's but enjoyed it. They gave me great management training. Enjoyable. The least enjoyable part of the job was reprimending employees and set goals they had for you.A typical day at work you did a variety of jobs. Paperwork, merchandising sales inside and out,customer service.Would love to work for this company again. Only reason why I had to quit was due to a sick baby."
good,"Love the job, wish it were an hourly position as there is"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty easy. I face front all of the products hourly. I walk around asking costumers if their finding everything alright, customer service. Im on register everyday, which I always balance out. I learn something new almost everyday, being that we carry all types of products for different ethnecity its good to know what your talking about when customers ask you a question. My co-workers are awesome! Im 22 and even my manager is in her 20's so we all can relate to each other. The hardest part about my job is learning the products. We take test once a month on our newest product because we get new items every month. The most enjoyable part about my job is talking with customers. We get all different types of people from different walks of life, its pretty cool to talk to people and building a relationship with that person."
good,Beauty Supply Store needed more personnel to handle business.
good,"sallys was also a good experience not only did I get to interact with customers on a on a personal level, I also learned all about the world of hair care, management was great always very understanding and flexible with hours. It was a very small setting, only four co-workers."

good,I really enjoyed working at Sally's and the other workers and helping customers with nail and beauty decisions. I like to stock and doing store resets (planaguide)  I don't mind working 25 to 30 hours a week including weekends. I use this job to suppliment my income. Thank you for your time

My new manager is ready to make sure this store is in good hands. I enjoy my job and enjoy the customers that come back looking forward to get help from me! Retail isn’t for everyone, I thought it wasn’t for me but this job in my opinion is!"

I learned a lot about their products. I also learned about inventory, sales, time management and the ordering process. Sally prides itself on great customer service and an excellent assortment of products. The most challenging times came during the holidays and when customers had complaints. But its nothing different from any other sales position."

good,It was a good company to work for and i wish i had stayed  but a better offer came up and i had to take it. It is a good company to work for and the clients is what made it worth coming in.
good,"Always something to do,  or someone to help, "
good,"My job is an accounting position and a support position for our store personnel."
good,Positive place to work. Great incentives. Clean. Customers are enjoyable. Training sessions at the store are very helpful. Job isn't too stressful. Learned many beauty skills.
good,"This is a very, very well managed company.  They reward quality work, and are generous and kind to their employees.  This is a company that truly lives a team-oriented culture.  The focus is always forward thinking, and the results can be easily seen."
good,Easy job with great benefits but no chance for growth. Management is poor and there is presently no director there. Supervisors promote friends instead of from within

good,"Work as an Inside Sales Associate is not necessarily difficult but time consuming. The work environment is a lot of fun, my home store is full of great people that I love calling my coworkers. Management completely understands the life and work balance and keeping their employees safe. Like any retail job, the most difficult part of the job are the angry customers that come in."
good,"I only left because it was hard to balance two jobs from opposite sides of the cities. The manager is very kind, good work ethic, and flexible. The coworkers are also very good people."
good,Me gustaba mucho ese trabajo  por que aprendía mucho sobre  belleza  y cuidado personal
good,This was one of my first jobs when becoming a new mother. It was challenging but at the same  time was very fun especially when your number 1 priority is to help customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was working as a team and helping customers in need.
good,A typical day at work included: Greeting customers at the door and helping them find specific products for their unique beauty needs. I learned about the chemistry and specific uses of different beauty items for different types of hair or skin-related customers. Management was very helpful and patient and took care of my needs and concerns. The difficult part of the job was dealing with shoplifters and helping everyone with only 1 more coworker to help and having to work overtime because people would constantly not show. The most enjoyable part was getting free beauty products and meeting professional hairdressers who shared their beauty secrets.
good,"Los horarios son los mas pesados, más si tienes que doblar pero en realidad es un día muy divertidos, el acomodar y ver productos nuevos para identificarte hay que probarlos, se nos regalaban muestras constantes, hacíamos demostraciones con la gente o con nosotras mismas sobre productos eléctricos en pelo o uñas. Generalmente era un hobby y no un empleo."
good,was there for 11 years  a great experience if you enjoy customers and beauty products there is room for advancement if you are willing to work and show interest  long periods of standing; lifting

good,"I highly enjoy my co workers, i was very pleased with how fast i moved up in the company and how much i have learned. I love being able to work with people in a field  i have much knowledge in. I have a lot of fun setting up new displays and the merchandising aspect of the job, it keeps you busy and is usually a great learning experience. The managers above me are very good about answering questions and further training me, they go above and beyond. I would have to say the hardest part is my hours i work, it isn't a set or regular schedule. I would like to have a little more structure in the hours i work day to day.  "
good,"If you enjoy helping people then you'll like this job. Everyday I assist customers find what they need. I watch videos, and read flyers on different subjects to better assist customers find the right hair color or appliance for them. occasionally there will be a difficult customer or two but for the most part it's fun."
good,"Everyday I learn something new. From professional hair stylists coming in and out, customers, and free samples I get at work. There's always something to do at work. We work as a team when we take our shift and make sure we take care of each other. We stock, do cashier, organize, orders, do projects, rearrange things, take care of customers, and more. I love my coworkers and my manger! The girls are awesome and there to help when we aren't sure how to help a customer. The hardest is to keep learning new things and explain to customers. Sometimes there are some customers that won't take no for an answer and wanted everything their way. I enjoy that I'm able to switch my hours to fit with my school schedule. They're flexible and we get great discounts!"
good,"A typical day at work was relaxing and not stressful. I knew what my task where when I got there. I learned a lot about technology, such as imaging pc's and repairing modems, keyboards, pc's and printers. The management was great, My boss was fair and approachable. There was nothing really hard about the job at all, but the most enjoyable part was being able to learn more about technology and how to interact better with others."
good,the company was a really good and fun job to work for. the company does have high expecation standards and goals which are sometimes stressful
good,"I enjoyed working at Sally Beauty Supply greatly. When at work i like to keep busy and with this job i was always able to find something to do.

The thing that i enjoyed the most about this job was working as a team."
good,"I worked in the Reno-Midtown Sally's and Kathy was my manager, She is amazing! Excellent place to work and if you pay attention, they will teach you anything!"
good,"The management are caring and there for you when you need it! Immediately felt welcomed and at home! Only downside is that there's some girls that will try to start drama but that's typical. You do you and there will be no problems! Pay wise it's ok, not really a way to go up from part time unless they have a dire need and you have the right time/skill set."
good,"A great place to work with super idea's to keep employees working hard, such as the samples employees get almost every month. Upper management is only a phone call away. Every manager I dealt with was very helpful with all issues I called with. True teamwork environment...My favorite job ever."
good,"Overall it was a very knowledgeable experience, eduction is expanded on products, detailed training, flexible hours, career advancement is minor management is good"
good,"Sally’s was a very good job for 11 years , I feel they don’t put employees with experience first but are about pushing to make the numbers and cut hours on long term employees with experience and hire others instead"
good,"Sally Beauty is a great opportunity for a fun work experience surrounded by beauty products. It is very team oriented and sales driven. Full time employees receive great benefits, part time is very flexible."
good,"I enjoy working at sally beauty it’s a family friendly environment, I am knowledgeable about all our products and enjoy selling them ,my customers are great as well. A very good place to work but for the labor they would like you to learn and abide by I would like them to pay according to your experience and knowledge,"

good,"I loved to find my customers what they needed "
good,I liked working at Sally's it was a challenge when I took the store it was in the red a lot of theft I brought up sales and lowered the theft.  I liked the people I worked with and I loved my Manger. A typical day was doing paperwork and stock and waiting on customers. I learned a lot more then I knew about hair.  The hardest part about the job was not enough help.  the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public.
good,It was a very hands on job. There was a lot to learn and a lot to teach. The customers were usually very pleasant and understanding. There were times I even learned from the customers. You earn points that are redeemable in free merch/gift cards. You got free products monthly to help you get a better understanding of the things you were selling to people. Also you get a raise after your first 6 months then every year after that (at least)
good,"A very Productive workplace with plenty of learning opportunities, fun,competitive and great management.Normal day of work includes lots of helping with customers in need of help with a change of look at an affordable and easy way.Restocking, refilling and help check customers out with a smile to welcome them to return."
good,"Aprendí mucho en la empresa, había buen trabajo en equipo."
good,"Sally's was a fun and creative environment. the management team was great to work for. Only con is that they run like a small mom and pop store, so if some calls out the have to find some on to cover the shift."
good,"Working in a Sally store can be a great experience. You learn so much about beauty and hair care needs, while also getting to meet our great customers, old and new, and making sure they have a wonderful shopping experience when they are here."
good,"Sallys is a very great place to work, I honestly love it. The only thing I'd change is who I work with. Some of the employees don't take the job seriously and act too childish but I still love the job. It's not too hard but it keeps you going and there's never nothing to do."
good,"Sally Beauty Supply is a great retail company, very competitive in their field. There is always advancement opportunities within the company. The more you put into your job the more they give to reward your production. Exceptional Customer Service is always expected."
good,"- A typical day at work is made up of a few core factors, positive attitude, good customer service, and motivation."
good,"I would help customers seek the products they wanted and needed. I would clean up and front face the products on the shelf and put away inventory. I would see customers through with their purchases and try to up-sale them the products that Sally Beauty suggest for the month. The best part about this job has to be the fact that you learn so much from customers and the required monthly test, and the free products almost every month."
good,Sally's is a great company to work for they treat they're staff very well with incentive and trips I've been on two. The thing I enjoy about working at sally beauty is the amazing customers I serve on a daily basis. I've learned how to become a more balanced leader at sally's with the least turn over with staff

good,Working for Sally Beauty was a big step for me right out of Cosmetology school. It allowed me to further my education on working with the public. It also allowed me to learn from a retail side of the hair industry.

good,"The best part of working for Sally Beauty is the opportunity for advancement. I advanced from sales associate to Store Manager in the course of a year. I enjoyed  my co-workers, and the most rewarding part is when you've helped a customer and they return to show you how much they love the results."
good,"stocking shelves, counting registers, filing paper work, doing returns and exchanges, providing customer service, and learning about new product"
good,A typical day is helping customers with beauty needs. Its a fast pace job you are constantly doing something. management is OK but could improve.
good,Such an interesting place to work. It has great benefits and you do monthly training lessons to help you learn about the products. There are some great perks with the job and the atmosphere is so fun.
good,I made a lot of friends during my 23 years working there.this company has great benefits.however I decided to move where my spouse is living and working.the hardest part of this job was the commute of 70 miles per day to and from work.i learned how to oversee the running a business and how to train employees to gain the same goals I wanted.
good,"Salesperson on the floor,how to do sales. Management was ok co-workers were good.Hardest part of my job was dealing with the public. Communicated with the public and having good people skills"

good,The only problem was certain people I had worked with but we mostly got along. I also had to leave due to ride situations but now I have transportation.
good,They are focused on making everyone feel included and informed. You also get to learn many skills while working. Management also works with you on scheduling flexibility.
good,"Sally Beauty is a nice place to work. They work with you it’s an easy job and you’ll learn to love it. A quick place to advance in as well, I was there 5 months and became a supervisor."
good,45 hours for management is mandatory. And weekends too. But one off a month. Had to schedule 2 vacation weeks at beginning of year. Small staff. But close knit. Not any training for the things you sell unless the manager you start under was up on all trends. Freedom on mechandizing. And 40$ worth freeproduct a month.
good,I loved working at Sally’s and helping everyone with their beauty needs I wish I could go back because I still have all the knowledge from when I worked there it was honestly the best job I’ve had by far
good,"great job for when I was attending school, manager was friendly and helpful. co-workers were fun and kept wok environment upbeat. great discounts....."
good,"I enjoy working here, being a manger you work a lot of hours and have to stay busy but I've learned to keep on task and love my job every much! I love helping the customers."
good,They pay well and hours fly by quickly.  It does get very hot and humid inside during work so light clothing would be perfect. This job is about focusing and fast pace.
good,"Great place to start off, I learned how to communicate with customers. There was inventory every Thursday and put all shipment away. It was also very slow paced."
good,Great place to work.  Company restructured and eliminated several positions with mine being one of them.  I took my retirement and am currently looking for a position I can continue use to utilize my knowledge and skills.
good,"It is a great job, I've been there for over a year I love it & get along well with my coworkers. I am soon to be training to be assistant manager which I am excited for. My boss and me get along pretty well. The only thing is sometimes you have too much time on your hands. It is a slow business. Pay is not great as well."
good,I liked working for sallys but the current manger isnt the best person to work for sadly . I would go back if i worked for someone else . My coworkers were awesome and fun to work with and grow with.
good,"If you are looking for a position with a company who offers advancement , here it is. The only one holding you back would be you.This is a fast track to success company who offers excellent benefits as well as 401K. The stores are open to only industry professional. The customers are like family as well as the co-workers."
good,"New products promotions, new things and strategies for sales, my co-workers was nice and a I learned a lot about sales. It was a great experience of work."
good,"It was a good place to work it was a job."
good,I really like this job. My co-workers and management are great people. This job has taught me many different things. I have learned patience for people when I am training them. The hardest part of this job is dealing with all of the theft. It is really horriblel. The most enjoyable part of this job is helping the customers and working with the other employees.
good,"If you like learning about beauty products while you're working, this is the place for you! They have a comprehensive training process and instructional videos to learn about new products each week. The benefits package and management at my place of work left a little to be desired but that's not saying that all stores are the same."
good,Helping customer make the right choice on hair prodcts and managing the store. The hardest part of the job was unpacking all the supplies and stocking the shelves.
good,"I recently started working for sallys and I can already tell you I am excited to wake up and go to work. My manager is sweet along with all my other co-worker. The company itself is great and offers promotions each month with certain items you can sell, along with once every month you get 40% off discount with anything in the store but sometimes sales already applied cant be combined with the discount but most of the time that isnt the case  the training is great, they show you all the basics of sales and even product knowledge  included free products to try each month to help gain knowledge and resources for the products they sell  i can see myself becoming a manager here and being completely satisfied and secure  the hours can be tricky if you are living alone or paying rent but that still doesnt beat the fact that you have a sense of happiness and love for the place you work at"
good,"Coworkers were all about the same age as me so it was really easy to get along with everyone. Mon-Fridays are not all that busy while school is in session, weekends depend.Extremely flexible with schedules."
good,"excellent benefits, flexible schedule and tons of company sponsored events.  Christmas Parties and family get togethers were lots of fun."
good,Sally's was a great place to work for everyone works as a team there is plenty of room for advancement and growth . great discounts all of the higher end management was wonderful
good,"i liked it, it was a fun place to work at, very relaxed and fun associate, everyone was nice to work with ab easy job for me not to complicated with flexible hours"
good,"Counting down the register at the beginning of the day, how to work a cash register. My manager was great, probably one of the best managers I ever had. There was something new at the beginning of the month, such as specials. There was no hard part, at least not in my mind. I loved that job way too much. I loved going to work there because the atmosphere was always pleasant."
good,"Work with costumers to ensure they have the best products that will fit their personal needs. I took many courses on products sold at the store. Thoroughly enjoyed with both my co-workers and manager. There was no hard part of the job, I loved working there."
good,"I learned a lot of customer services skills. "
good,"I try and find a place with a good environment, and that's exactly what Sally's has. I feel like I can be myself there and open up out of my shell. The customers are great and I love helping them find what they need."

good,this job was very easy and i like it a lot. they gave you all of the tools that you needed to learn about the products to better assist the customers.
good,Sally's is great place to start in new management. It's small enough to get your feet wet and experience you need to grow for the future.
good,"wonderful environment, great manager, no opportunity for advancement because I was focused on medical field rather than beauty supply but it was an interesting experience."
good,"Customers are the number one priority."
good,Was a great job to get me through school. As well as gaining knowledge about hair care and beauty products. Small store with about 6 other girls working.
good,I enjoyed working there it was a fun work place. We got full size samples to try out at home. Every one is nice and helpful. There's always new things to see. It is corporate-owned so if you have a big problem come up you can always call them. The register takes awhile to learn. Its kinda complicated. It usese al the f buttons.
good,"I enjoyed working for Sally. Free products every month, helping customers decide a product that fit their needs was very fun. It's always a good feeling when customers come back looking for your help again. Scratch offs offered when meeting a quota kept you motivated. Management wasn't the greatest not very professional which made it hard to want to come to work and they pay is terrible for all the work tou have to do. But overall a great place."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, dos horas de comida y dos descansos que se iban rotando."
good,For the most part I absolutely loved working for Sally's Beauty Supply. I loved the products we sold and felt very confident selling them. I learned the in and outs of hair dye and was able to give quality advice to our customers. I was the go-to for makeup advice since I'm self taught most techniques and continued to learn and grow in this particular field of work. I would have loved to stay at this job but lack of management caused it to be impossible for me to continue to work there and keep my job at radio shack. Our manager at Sally's up and quit leaving me working 40hr weeks and still trying to make time for my second job. The lack of coordination with schedules and being short handed on staff made it impossible for me to stay working at that store. It was a real loss because I truly loved the work I did there.
good,Really enjoyed working at sally's. Friendly customers and co workers.
good,"I loved the job, a lot of stealing. Bad management, did a good schedule and worked good around basic life problems, the customers were so sweet and always full of life"
good,it was good at the start with my old manager but when she left that when the store started to suck working there. the head office doesn't care about anyone who works there just the store. when we got a new assistant manager. that when things weren't in order and everything felt like it was falling apart
good,I enjoyed working with the public helping them find products they were interested in. I loved my pay just wished that it was more of a full-time position.
good,"La empresa es buena, el trabajo no es pesado,  puedes llegar a ser promocionado de inmediato si te lo propones y cumples con los requisitos "
good,"This is the place to work if you are looking for a part time opportunity, I would suggest applying if you have knowledge of cosmetics and hair color. It is an over all good environment ."
good,Al trabajar tantas mujeres es algo pesado el ambiente
good,retail. cashier duties. stocked and organized products/items. management was decent. co-workers were good people overall.
good,"This is my first retail job. It's a great place to start out at, but not much for advancement. This is only a p/t position and I am need of something full-time and with stability. My hours are all over the place and that's a huge negative for me."
good,"Like working there, just need better management. Helping alot of customers especially Spanish speaking. Be prepared to be on your feet all day and keep active."
good,working at sallys beauty supply was one of my favorite jobs to have I found my inner girlly self and became all into nail hair and makeup. the management was okay she was a new manager so I understood certain things the hardest part of the job was catching people stealing and having to stop them and report it even sometimes having to call the cops . but the most enjoyable moment for me was everything besides that I got to learn about hair and nails and what helps your skin I learned about being my inner girly .
good,"No tienes vida propia,  Al principio te tratan muy bien pero despues... Te muetsran la otra parte terminan acusando hasta de ladronas  sin razon justa. Puedes dales lo mejor de ti pero para ellas nunca es suficiente. Te presionana hasta que te artas y te vas por ti misma por que ellos jamas te corren. Cada llamada es para hacer llorar a las encargadas de tienda los maltratos son de gente poco preparada y que no sabe reconocer sus errores. La empresa es buena pero las distritales no. No saben alejar lo laboral de lo personal y aun asi se ensañan no por tu trabajo buneo o malo si no  en si me caes bien o no... Tu trabajo no cuenta en esta empresa solo si eres bonita, delgada y sin cerebro."
good,"This is a very good company.to work for . They give you nice benefits. The store was kept very. I didn't encounter any problems working there with the staff or management, The pay was adequate for the type of job. They had scratch off card where you could win free lunches and other prizes."
good,"Sally beauty is a great place to work ! I loved dealing with the customers one on one and helping them with there problems. Also I took responsibility such as counting cashes,doing bank runs and setting up displays which kept me busy all the time. There was always something to do , very fast past environment."
good,In my time working at Sallys I spent time stocking and ordering supplies as well as helping Customers find products to best fit there needs.
good,Help customers with products
good,I have had a great 20 years at Sally Beauty. They are an awesome company to work for and has taught me a lot over the years. Even tho they've been around for many years they are still growing changing the way things are done.
good,"Working here was pretty interesting but I loved it. You meet all sorts of different people and it starts to feel like the world isn't that big. You learn a lot on how to talk to people, handle situations and work under pressure (e.g Black Friday, Christmas). Its a really good start if you want to learn retail skills and especially if you're in cosmetology school. Would definitely go back and hopefully manage my own store."
good,"Siempre han sido muy buenos, trabajan mucho en equipo, me han permitido mucho crecimiento y siempre respetan mis descansos"
good,"There is all sorts of different types of duties to do everyday, which made it very fun and you were never bored. Always something to do, that was the best part. Monthly tests were very educational, you always learn something new about the beauty industry and bonus was getting free products to try each month was also very cool. Manager was very nice and knowledgable which was very helpful at times when it was most appreciated/needed. Helping people become more knowledgable about the products they are using and how to use them properly was the funnest part of the job."
good,"es un ambiente laboral agradable, te capacitan y aprendes de manera rápida, cuentan con buenas prestaciones laborales."
good,This was an awesome place to work at . I would go back here if I had the opportunity . The people were awesome and the hours were great . I did think the pay was a little unreasonable for what we were doing but I stayed because I like helping people. To see I helped them makes my day.
good,The job itself was super easy. Mostly consisted of helping match products to people's needs and teaching them steps to lightening. Pretty much the same thing every day! But it's fun/
good,"I learned how to communicate better, manage multiple task all at once. I also learned sell techniques and cashier experience. I learned that patience is very important when working with a lot of different types of customers."
good,"It was great I loved my coworkers. I loved learning about beauty products,."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be helping our customers find the right product for them while also giving tips and tricks to them so they know how to use the products correctly. Another favorite part of my job is when we get truck once a week we have to unload everything into carts and put all the products on the shelf and to me it's relaxes me by organizing.
good,"Es buen trabajo, es muy productivo pero tienen mala administración"
good,"Outstanding environment, amazing employees, spontaneous customers and it's a very well organized! you learn so much not just from your job but from the customers themselves."
good,"Great place to work, friendly coworkers, flexible schedule, great company policies, drama free, easy assessments, allows for professional career up work"
good,This was the best job I ever had. I wish I still worked with them. Excellent place to work. Many incentives and very rewarding. Training and education to perform job duties was the best of all companies i have ever worked.
good,Love sally Beauty they are a great company very caring of their customers and making sure all products are well stocked for customers also also have a lot of deals and offers on products
good,"La supervisora es una persona pedante, despota y muy grosera"
good,Learned  a lot working with beauty products and the general public. improved sales skills and communication skills. Learned inventory control and organization
good,"This is such a wonderful company to work for."
good,"I love working at Sallys. It was a great job especially for someone whose in hair school. I learned a lot about hair products plus more. Management was ok not awesome. The only problem that i had was went i quit i was put on the no rehire list, which it didnt make any sense because i was a good worker i just had family issues prior to quitting"
good,Great place to work. The environment is a pretty quick pace and makes for not very much downtime. The lunch breaks are only 30 minutes so you don't have much time to get food and eat. But other than that is an amazing company to work for.
good,"Many wouldn't think a beauty supply could be fun but honestly the customers make it for me. I've developed so many amazing bonds with customers, we talk like girlfriends while shopping. There are a few bad apples from time to time but it doesn't spoil it for the bunch. The training that employees are given makes you feel confident in your position to teach about products. I haven't stopped learning since I started working here. Sometimes I feel like corporate doesn't have our backs on certain issues, which is hard because we're the ones that deal with the public and I want them to value our input more. But there have been some good improvements company wide so we may be moving in the right direction. Overall, I've had a great experience working for this company and I believe that it depends on the mindset you have. Work doesn't always have to feel like work."
good,Overall being at Sallys was like being in my own little element. I'm all about beauty enhancement and making women feel beautiful. My experience working there was off and on it was things that I liked and also disliked. The overall company is ok. But the individual management wasn't pleasant.
good,I loved my job here. I quit due to needing a full time job. Awesome management and was always a great time at work. Work doesn't have to be miserable. If you like to have fun and work.. this is it.
good,Very fun place to work. You are encouraged to buy and try store product so you can show and recommend to customers. Learned a lot about hair and beauty products.
good,This was a great job.  I had the pleasure of working outside sales as well as being assistant manager. I loved the outside sales. The company was great to work for.  At that time they provided a product of the month to employees.  It was nice to be able to recommend products that you have personally tried and can give an honest opinion about.  They also had a company sales incentive program.  You earned points for selling certain items and could redeem those points for various prizes from a catalog.  It was nice to feel like you were accomplishing something for pushing the add on sales.
good,It was a great company and great environment to work in. They also had good food in their cafeteria. The building is decorated nicely and there is holiday spirit
good,"Depending on the employees who were at work. The customers for the most part were nice. I learned a lot while working there. My management was a nightmare. The hardest part of the job was stocking. The most enjoyable, to me, was the customer service portion."
good,"Sally beauty is a great place to work, unfortunately m manager didn't care that other employees weren't doing their jobs and I had to pick up the slack. When "
good,"stocking cashier, customer service, loss prevention."
good,Sally Beauty Supply was a great job for me. It provided me with retail experience and education on beauty products. The environment was fairly laid back. You had tasks to complete and you would get rushes of customers but over all it wasn't extremely stressful like some retail jobs.
good,"Show up around 12:15 and get straight to helping customers or putting products away."
good,Customer service and knowledge of the products is very important at this job. It can be difficult when the store is busy and you are there by yourself temporarily but everyone usually covers each other so that doesn't happen often.
good,Everyone i worked with was nice and it's a good company. My manager was kind. The hardest thing to deal with is the customers who range from nice and reasonable to absolutely unagreeable.
good,great company to work for they are very flexible with your home life schedule and compensate employees well. Management is easy to work with and will help a hand when needed.
good,"I liked working here because schedule was very flexible and also I got to learn new product, especially since I was going to beauty school, Sally helped me a lot."
good,I loved this job! This was one of my first jobs in the industry that I am in. One of my friends was the manager of Sally's and she is the one who helped me get the job. I learned how to inventory all of the products as well as I learned product knowledge.
good,"Under the right management, Sally Beauty can be an amazing place to work! If you love customer service and everything in the beauty industry! The personal employee goals and store goals are easy to reach (IOM's) and each month you get to test new products!"
good,When working for Sallys it's important to constantly be reviewing products so you're aware of what you're selling to your customers and know for yourself if it also works.
good,"Gets really busy at time little short bursts lots of fun. weekend were full. I learned a lot, not just about the products, I learned how to help customers when they needed it, became more comfortable asking them if they needed help. I am in cosmetology so it was wonderful helping customers understand more about the products, and what I am passionate about and love doing. management changed 3 times while I worked there, I had some privacy issues, management didnt want to take care of."
good,"Great team"
good,"Opened new store, which gave me the opportunity to learn my product as we sit up the store. Received support from upper management at all times. Loved going in to work everyday."

good,"best place to start working at, i gained a lot of customer service working here. I also learned how to work with other individuals."
good,This company's work environment has greatly improved since the new CEO started in 2015. The campus is nice and is very convenient for those not wanting to have to drive to Dallas for a well paying job.
good,"Starting at Sally's I didn't know much about hair colour or any of the product. Going throughout the training I began to learn a lot, in order to give me knowledge so I could then give great customer service. There is no sitting around at Sally's. There is always something to do, and when theres nothing major to be done, I will always find little things to do here and there to help out. My coworkers are very helpful and friendly. I love working here because my coworkers and the customers make it enjoyable."
good,Sally's Beauty Supply has taught me how to audit money and do bank runs. Its also taught me how to comfortably interact with the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was having a great team along side me and the bubbly customers that we'd have come in. It was a very friendly environment.

good,I loved working at this store. The manager was very helpful/supportive and fun. My c-workers were so nice and helpful. We worked as a team and bonded at the same time.
good,A typical day at work would be running the register and restocking products. I learned how to work with numbers. Co workers were awesome & very helpful. Hardest part of the job was to deal with upset customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning more about the beauty industry and getting to know new faces in the store.
good,Enjoy helping customers and working with people. I have advanced with this company from a part-time weekend person to manager.
good,"Stock the shelves, helped management order stock, answer customer questions, promote new products, learned a little about the Beauty industry, management was a great person to work with, my co-workers were awesome, the hardest part about the job was working with different attitudes your customers may have had the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work and get along with your co-workers."

good,"A typical day would consist of scheduling appointments, returning the calls of potential clients, organizing paperwork. Since it is a home business, I was working for my father which was for the most part, very easygoing. The job was not very hard, though since I was always in the home, I did start to go a bit stir crazy. The most enjoyable part was the fact that I was never nervous about asking my employer a dumb question or for help since it was my father who employed me. And even though I did mention wanting to leave the home, it was also very nice to be able to have to worry about running late or other various concerns that may have arisen had I had a different job."

The best part of the job was my co workers and the ability to bring a smile to someones face when they were in need. The hardest part of the job would be hair color, not my knowledge about but explaining to the consumer on how to properly mix and apply dyes without damaging can be tedious."
good,This company offers several different incentives to keep a person motivated.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers with products and using the register. Doing price changes and plan-o-guides, and restocking products."
good,Upbeat. Opportunities to grow with company. Co workers well helping and easy to get along with. Small environment. Spent most of my time as a cashier and stock.
good,Fun place to work sometimes. It's very fast paced and you have to multitask sometimes. Some of my co-workers were really awesome and some were just co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customers and when you see them with a smile on their faces.
good,"A typical day at work would be putting over stock away, helping customers, working the register, counting the inventory selling beauty club cards, renewing beauty club cards. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the customers. Laughing with them and learning about their dislikes and likes about different hair products and makeup products."
good,"I Start by putting inventory away. Check for any clients orders that needed to be delivered. As Director of Outside Sales I prepared delivery orders, filed them in delivery reports, delivered company bank deposits. I was also closing Key Holder I closed the at night, balanced cash drawers, filed sales reports, prepared bank deposits. assist with audits and outside event promotions"

good,"Cashier, Sales Associate, Interacting with customers, Showing customers where certain products are and what may be best for them and what they are looking for. We have goals we have to meet such as selling a certain amount of Beauty Club Cards and Items of the Month. I learned great cashier skills and great customer service skills.The co-workers are positive, happy, and fun-loving people that I enjoy being around. We all work great as a team. The hardest part of the job is making sure some products are exactly the right product that they need, such as hair color and developer and the measurements but I do learn from other co-workers and even the customers themselves such as professionals. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you gave good customer service to the customer and knowing you gave them good advice. Nothing beats having a happy customer who enjoyed their experience at Sally's and them wanting to come back again."
good,"Typical day at Sallys was restocking and helping out customers in need of fixing hair color etc by doing it on there own without the salon prices. I learned on a monthly basis new and upcoming hair,nail and skin products and equipment that were coming out."
good,I absolutely love working at Sally's . I am a part time employee and usually the store is crazy busy from the time I arrive until closing. I have learned alot about the beauty industry and my manager is great-I love going to work every day. The hardest part is trying to explain to people about haircolor and how to achieve the desired color they want.
good,help you with education they want you to succede and better yourself.
good,I loved working for this company but also would have liked more of a chance to move up with Sally's Beauty Supplies.
good,Loved the fact that there was on-going continued training every month. Change is always a good thing and the product knowledge training made up-selling/closing sales second nature!
good,"i got to deal with product i love, an people that love the same thing. i learne about about hair and skin while i was working there. my manager was great working around my fulltime job. my co-workers were so enjoyable to work with. we had to take a weekly inventory of the products in the store aswell mas stock the weekly inventory. i was able to interact with all the customers. we did daily banking, and had to use a pc system for the registers."
good,• Served as cashier and closer
good,I really enjoyed working for Sally's. I was always busy with either customers or inventory.
good,I likied working here even though management was not their highest quality. It really helped with product knowledge while in school for cosmetology.

good,My time there was great. I worked with awesome women. The customers were easy going.
good,"At Sallys I was a clerk but that did not just include being a cashier and taking care of customers. I, along with another worker, took care of everything at the store. I answered phone calls, handled customer service, did inventory, stocked products, went to the bank, and cleaned. It felt like home. I learned a lot about people skills in that job. Management was rarely there. After I was trained I didnt see the office manager so much any more, but I guess that was just how the schedule was. My co-workers were very nice and always helping me out. The hardest part of the job was to handle customer service to Spanish speaking customer. However that is were I began to pick up the language. My favorite part of the job was trying out new products so that we would be able to give the customers a personal opinion versus something we just read about."
good,"Majority of customers were polite, store policies were reasonable, i learned to manage employees, store schedules, I handled bank deposits, store inventory and re-organizing to changes. Management was chaotic, but overall good."
good,It is a hard job to work at     if    you are  not familiar with working with hair products.    It was a really cool slow paced     job for the   most part.
good,"The employees at sally beauty value their customers and everything that is done is to serve the people who enter the store. Fast pace job with lots of face to face interaction, sales and customer service."
good,"Great company, good benefits and great pay.  Flexible schedule, fun environment. Not a good work life balance. Work about 65-75 hours a week.  Always on call."
good,"Honestly, everything about this job was pointless. Each week you get shipment, you unload shipment, and put shipment away. Then all you do is sell the products."
good,Working at Sally Beauty helped me learn a lot of new things and become a better employee. The training was very thorough and efficient.Just make sure to focus on your work and not get to into the social aspects.
good,"It was a nice work environment, great teamwork, awesome work events, fun events. Manager was super flexible on personal issues. Employees always received free monthly products."

good,Interacting with customers to help them have a good experience. I learned how to run a store. Fast paced beauty supply store. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers.
good,"I really enjoyed the job in the beginning. I had a true drive to be the best and to teach others how to do a great job. Eventually I realized I was pushing myself too hard for no real return. the future wasn't promised to me. The levels of advancement are so few and far in between. Eventually I realized I was being fed an unrealistic expectation in order for the company to continue to reap the benefits of my selling, but not for me to reap any kind of benefit for my capability."
good,Very fun job perfect for me with a cosmetology background it's great place to work the former district manager wasn't the friendliest of people. My co-workers were amazing and a blast have very much experience also in the cosmetology business I think it's very important to love wherel you work .It's even better when you enjoy the company of your co-workers. We had a great team
good,"Sometimes I felt as though the management higher up didn't care about the employees. But overall, it was a wonderful experience for me. I would love to work there again."

Learning what different types of hair and how to maintain it. I had an awesome team here as well. people were willing to help you.
good,great place too work if you love working with beauty supplies and learning about all the things they can do. must be willing to work ALOT of night shifts.
good,"Fun job, easy work! theres never a dull moment at work. my co-workers are easy to get along with. I enjoy the free products we receive every month, its always exciting to see what new products we get."
good,"The company was amazing to work for, until changes occurred with upper management.  It became less about people and more about money.  As a result many of us that had dedicated out career to the company were let go."
good,"To star my shift, I had to count my cash register, helping our customers find the products they were looking for. We had to have knowledge about every product that way we can help the customer to take the perfect product for them. Every Monday morning we receive all new products and my job includes to accommodate in the right place."
good,"Working at sallys has been a true experience, There is nothing like knowing you as the associate can make someone smile by picking out the right colors ,makeup, etc, Being friendly caring and honest about customers feelings is amazing, there is no other feeling in the world better than to know your honesty goes a long way"

good,Duties included:
good,Overall it was a fun job and company to work for. I learned a lot working there from other experiences workers. They weren't the best with working with you on schedulea if you have a family.
good,There’s plenty of growth opportunities within the company. The management wants to see you succeed and be at your best they provide the encouragement needed to get you there. Work life and family life balance is great you have the opportunity to schedule days you need to spend with the family.
good,"My daily duties were to make sure the customers were satisfied and were looking for the right items. Made sure all the items were fully restocked and pulled up to the front so people could see the itmes. One of the hardest part of the job is trying to help all the customers! if we were out of an item, trying to remain calm and trying to solve a solution to the problem. loved seeing the regular customers come in and people just happy with their purchase"
good,Cool environment you get to meet so many great and creative people. You can grow with the company and get a lot of benefits with the company. Overall great first job!
good,I learned all about management and team building skills as well as coaching and merchandising techniques while working in a fast paced location. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and talking with new customers and building a bond with them and helping them with their business needs
good,Fun enviroment to work in.Can learn a lot about hair and beauty. Not much of a future to look forward to. Can work almost full time but you still wouldn't have benifits.

good,"A typical day at work involves customer service, cashier, and keep the store clean. I've learned how to count money quick and open and close the store. I would say that the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. I enjoy working with my coworkers they make the place a welcoming environment."
good,"If your passion is hair, this would be a great place for you! I worked at two separate stores at the same time and lived the customer base. It was a job that didn't feel like work."
good,"Pretty cool atmosphere. Management is kind of wonky. Lots of training to prepare you. Does not transfer very well, if at all. Hours can be long. Great advancement"
good,It never felt like I was working with my boss it was a calm and soothing place to work at. There was always laughing and just a really good environment to be around.
good,Amazing experience being able to greet the customers as they walk in the door and knowing that they feel at home. Being able to answer to questioons they may have over any beauty products in the store.
good,Such a amazing experience being able to greet customers as they walk in. Answer to any questions they may have over any products carried in the store. You really get to learn about the customer and have that one on one time with them. and learning to face and restock shelves makes me look at all the shelves in any store

good,it has been forever since i have worked here. my days were stocking shelves cleaning the store and helping costumers. i spent most of my time there doing a lot of work and not getting any higher positions. i was doing all the work of the manager without having or even being offered the position.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Sally Beauty. It was a great learning experience for me. I would recommend working for this company to anyone who has a passion for hair and or beauty. Even if someone wants to learn a little bit more about hair and didnt want to go to school for it, this is the job!"
good,Love my job just wish it paid more and the hours of my store allowed me to come in earlier so that i didnt have to work 6 days a week . I beleive i wouldnt be looking for other employement if i were able to go in at 730am like when i started 3 years ago . Going in earlier gave me a great jump start on the daily tasks to get completed before engageing with customers . makeing it easier to help customers when the time came to open the store other than do tasks.

good,nice to meet customers and keeps you busy.very clean and great discount on products.
good,"This is a great place to work if you enjoy beauty. It's more than just a sales clerk or cashier. It can be challenging dealing with some of the people who frequent the store. The most challenging part when the truck arrives on Mondays, and the stock all has to be priced correctly and put on the shelves while maintaining your other responsibilities."
good,Great job if you can stand the smell of salon chemicals creativity at its best here. You can and will move up quickly if you are creative organized.
good,Typical work day is very busy. I learned to work with all types of clients and co-workers and how to sell products to customers. The work place was very fun and fast paced. The hardest part of the job was to tell a customer that a certain part would not work for them. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a customer happy when you suggessted a product to them an they loved it
good,I personally loved working for Sally's. It was fun to help out the customers and fulfill their needs. The pay was awful though. I didn't get paid what I felt was fair being an assistant manager and being an acting store manager in two other stores. I worked over 55 hours a week sometimes and the pay just wasn't worth it. I don't know of any assistant manager earning $8.30 per hour to help manage a corporate store.
good,Opened and closed store I did resets of whole store I delivered products to schools and businesses I transmitted orders and helped write out schedule.
good,"Always show up in a good mood, and you’ll never feel like it’s just work. Connect with customers, it’ll truly help create a loyalty and bond that’ll keep them coming back to you. Make friends with your coworkers, they’re who you spend all your time with when traffic gets slow."
good,Working at Sallys has taught me to be patient and to take my time with one on one consultations. I’ve learned various team bonding skills and to also work hard as an individual if needed.
good,La empresa como tal es muy buena solo que la administracion no es muy buena y no se preocupan mucho por su personal ni su rapido desarrollo
good,great management and staff. The manager does her best to make sure the each staff member is comfortable working: by giving excellent training and ensure you have product knowledge to answer any questions customers might have.
good,"Sally Beauty is a great company to work for."
good,"I love working at Sally Beauty Supply.  If I were able to become more in my current situation I'd want to retire from there. They offer amazing benefits and with the right management, would be the most ideal place to work!"
good,"Sally's pays minimum wage.  So, if you're just looking for something to get out of the house and have a little extra change, it's great.  But, it's not a liveable wage at all."
good,Very good  company  to work for..Learn  alot about beauty  products...It has  flexible hour's and you can come to work with  bright  colors  on your  hair..
good,"Coming in to Sally's was an awesome job my co-workers were all like family it was a small store with lots of amazing items in there. I learn so much from Sally's it was my first job in retail and I learned how to use registers, answered phone calls, and learn how to greet customers right as they walked in."
good,I really liked working at Sally beauty the coworkers are really nice only that the manager has favorites and it gets a little hard and boring working like that.
good,"A very eye opening job experience for me, but had a very good experience with the company. Management was very kind, while upper management could be overly harsh but was just trying her best. Co-workers were the best part of the job, were always there to support each other. Getting to help customers with their beauty supply needs opened me up into an industry I could see myself in."
good,Great experience and at the time great leadership. Definitely a great position for those not willing to make much but enjoy the industry.
good,"Never a dull day, always up-beat and pretty laid back until lunch time, then it got busy. Management and co-workers were great, very helpful when needed."
good,"Very fun and enjoyable place to work, not enough income"
good,"come in and do all side work to get ready for the day, ive had a couple good managers, and some of the upper gms, weren't very nice to work for, it is the beauty industry and you should be able to have fun while looking pretty, but the upper management wasn't very nice, and they made everything uncomfortable."
good,"I work as a cashier and assist customers in finding the right products for them, as well as, stock, face and maintain the sale’s floor."
good,"Many days I would open the store which consisted of counting the cash, doing paperwork and cleaning up the store. I would run the register and also help customers with products . I would count inventory, stock items and insert new orders for products. Every month we would have to set up new displays of the product of the months. I trained multiply employees and met very many people . My manager was the nicest lady and she had just became a manager. Our district manager was at our store a great deal of the time . The hardest part of my job was when we had numerous customers in the store when i was the only person running the store. I enjoyed sharing my interest of products  with customers."
good,"Open safe and count registers"

good,Had the opportunity to speak advise customers of what products would best if their needs

good,I enjoyed working her. Assisted customers find products. I learned a lot about beauty products. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was working alone on a busy day.
good,"great staff, loved my girls and my district manager. had a great following with customers and people in the area. But was time to move on out of retail with the hours ."
good,"On a typical day was given the opportunity to work with return clientele who were seeking their beauty products or had various questions concerning new product arrival.  Learned great customer service and relating to the customers.   Learned the nature of the beauty industry.  Management was always there for the employees and took a leadership position.  Often times management gave reviews on where improvement could be made and also focused on the strengths of each individual.  Co-workers were pleasant to work with.  Learning product knowledge and keeping up with new sales was difficult, always proving to be a challenge to be overcome and accomplished.  Most enjoyable part of the job was customer interaction and their acknowledgement and appreciation of an associate with accurate product knowledge and the desire to share and educate."
good,its fun to work at sallys. you learn things everyday. must be patient working with customers and listening is the key thing at sallys. grow a relationship with customers and they will be sure to come back. always get new products to try so you have incite on products and knowledge abut them.
good,"I've learned to have better sales skills. I'm excellent with the customers. My manager always recognizes the hard work I do. I have a great work environment. The most enjoyable part, is when I help a customer, whom is having an issue, solve what ever hair problem they have."
good,This a great company to work for. I open most days which consist of me doing the daily paper work and making up the deposits from the night before. I also make daily duty sheets for my employees that are coming in for the day. Being a maager has taugth me alot about knowing how to be a greart leader and having a great team standing behind me.
good,"Always learning something new, fast pace and a fun place to work. Customers can be challenging but the best part is customer service."
good,I learned a lot about hair and beauty.  Gave e knowledge i never thought id learn. Now i apply it to everyday life!  Different people have different hair...everyday was a learning experience

These clients you had to deal with in a careful manner in order to follow company policy but to also keep the customers coming back. I enjoyed getting to help a wide variety of customers every day and I loved how much I learned from my customers as well.
good,Probably one of my favorite jobs. My coworkers felt like family and the work load was steady but laid back. I learned a lot while working and meeting new people. Customers were good. I enjoyed this job.
good,"I enioyed the year I spent working for Sally beauty, the enviroment was relaxing yet competitive and I enjoyed selling and upselling as much as possible to prove my worth in my position. If you like beauty this is the place for you, the only thing you have to do is a course within the first 6 months to show how much you know, or have learned about Sally Beauty."
good,Great Place to work overall. You feel like part of a family when you start to work at Sallys. This makes you feel super comfortable and excited o go to work.
good,"We had a dress code, and hair and nails should look good. The upper management was constantly changing so it was hard to build a  work relationship.  The hardest thing to do was resets of products.  The best was my co-workers.  We all respected each other and worked as a team and aways, aways, had fun!"

good,I absolutely LOVED working at Sally's. I went to Cosmetology School so it was awesome to be able to be in a business dealing with my passion. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to develop relationships with my customers. The most difficult part of my job was ONLY a coworker did not like me and unfortunately it caused me to leave the place I loved the most.
good,Well it was a typical day at work with my sister and she taught me how to manage the store because she was the manager. I got to experience how to work at a retail store.

good,"I loved my job, I was just told many times I was getting raises and advancement and never happened. Also would not work with a work life base job. I hated leaving but I love my husband more."
good,"When I was employed this was a great company to work for.  Since leaving a few years ago, I have heard that things have changed.  You must work a minimum of 47 1/2 hours a week.  Bonuses are awesome if you can achieve the sales goals.  Trips are also awarded if you can meet the criteria set forth at the beginning of the fiscal year.  The discounts on products and free monthly products are awesome.  Expect to receive 3-5 free products a month or more."
good,"Great place to work!  I desired a direct hire position not thru a temp service. Culture is great! building is beautiful, people are great, work load is balanced.  It's all about BEAUTY!"

good,Need higher wages for experienced managers.  Love the environment and benefits are okay.  Management is excellent in helping with questions and being successful.
good,I loved working there for the 3 & a half years i worked there but wished i could have been full time i was only part time didn't understand why i couldn't have full time they wouldn't tell my why i couldn't and they had me give my two weeks weither i had another job or not due to the fact that i told my manager if i found another job that could give me full time i was gonna take it i still didn't see how that was a good reason to have me give two weeks considering they wereunable to give me full time and wouldn't say why they wouldn't...
good,"The day goes by pretty quick, you don't need to be a beauty expert, they teach you about hair color, the hours aren't bad, and it's easy to move up if you have the motivation."
good,Me encanto él ambiente los compañeros y la empresa buenos valores pero faltó apoyo de la empresa para promover a los empleados
good,"I worked for Sally Beauty Supply for four years and absolutely loved it. While it was work like most places we made the best of it. I learned many things about the hair color process and hair, skin, and nails products. I was the most fun filled job experience I have had."
good,"This job was the best one I have ever been apart of. Great employees and the boss is just amazing. They work with your schedule as well. The typical work day consisted of stocking the shelves, assisting customers when they came in, communicating, fronting and facing. On truck days we unloaded the truck and unpacked the boxes."

good,Everyday was different. There was a lot of fun and the opportunity to learn new thinks while delivering the best customer service. We were fully trained and able to answer the question of the guest in our store.There were not alot of off time and time to spend enjoying your family. the pay could be better and the quickness to respond or update emplyment raises and befits could be faster.
good,I loved working for this company. It was a very diverse group of people with an excellent management staff.I was very well compensated for my work.
good,Great company to work for. Advancement was available if you had the time to put into it. Was unable to fulfill my position any longer due to cost of childcare.
good,"A typical day at work includes a good overall atmosphere. We stay busy with our customers, and with keeping the store in tip top shape. This includes back stocking all product and front and facing product out on the floor. We are expected to keep up with our sales."
good,Had a lovely time working there staff were great pay not so good enjoyed learning about products and all the customers were great a fun place to work
good,it is an awesome experience working with this company considering i graduated from a hair school. so working and learning more about the field i graduated is going great for me
good,Working at Sally's is fun and fast paced. My manager is wonderful and works with me with the scheduling. Co workers are easy to work with and made good friends. Typical day consists of a lot of different tasks from recommending products to customers to price changes to  paperwork.
good,"My typical day at work on the weekdays are socializing with customers , helping them pick out a certain hair product, makeup, etc, ringing people out through the P.O.S System, making bank deposits, and then closing the store .The best thing about my job is that my day goes by really fast.

The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I was making a difference in a growing company.
good,Sally's is a great place to work. the manger and employees really believe in education which is a plus because not all companies are college friendly.
good,"handled cashier duties"
good,"Working at Sally Beauty Supply Store was such a fun and enjoyable job. I'm a big fan of hair and make up and all of those girly things. At times I wish I never left, unfortunately moving made that very hard to stay.I would have to say one of the hardest things about working at Sally Beauty Supply Store was not having a scanner for the P.O.S. It was the hardest part to memorize the key pad and the numbers on the products but in the end became second nature to me and I ended up loving it. Inventory happened every week on a Wednesday and even tho putting away wasn't always a joy but I loved seeing all the new products. Over all amazing place to work."
good,A day at sallys was very fun helping customers find products they needed.
good,"This was an awesome place to Manage and work. The benefits were great and there is always room for advancement and growth.

good,I love my coworkers they are amazing my DM is phenomenal my RD is amazing and we have a new LP RD and they are awesome!!!!!  It's so nice to work with such good people!!!
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers, helping them find the products they are looking for, and listening to their needs to you can best help them. Stocking is another large part of the job as shipments come in every Thursday; this gives everyone a greater opportunity to learn the store and where items are. The managers are down to Earth, hands on, and communicate excellently. You are also managed by the regional and district managers, who ensure you have all the knowledge and skills necessary to best do your job. The hardest part of the job would be trying to keep your average sale over $25 dollars as it takes a lot of interest, communication, and knowledge to keep customers shopping, spending money, and returning for more products. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing how happy customers get when you've really helped them find a product that will last and work very well for them as well as when they come back to the store to show off their results."
good,Felt incuded with the atmosphere. Helpes me lnow a lot about hair products and skin. Great employee discount for my makeup needs. Always neat and tidy.
good,"Typical day at work is good for the most part, I've learned to do good customer service, register. Management is alright,workplace is good. Difficult part is when other employees have attitude and rude behavior and the enjoyable part is when everyone is happy"
good,I enjoy working at Sally Beauty as it targets my interests and drives me to work outside of my comfort zone when I participate in sales. I am able to use my beauty tactics to help others who are in the same shoes I was once in.
good,I was at Sally for twelve years. I loved it. I also learned to have a thick skin. Not into drama didnt let my employees gossip. Loved my Leaders. Ultimately got hard with two little ones working sometimes till 9:30pm. There was theft and many police reports we made and caught people not paying. I miss my staff and i loved the discount. It started out pt for me and turned into a career in management.
good,"I loved my time at sally beauty, I learned a lot here and it really helped boost my experience with dealing with customers. I got to work with a lot of awesome beauty products for all ethnicities. we received excellent rewards for meeting our requirements and we were given free items and products. I loved it here"
good,"Sally Beauty is a fantastic company to work for. My manager and fellow coworkers are extremely supportive of each other and we truly use teamwork on a day to day basis. Not only have I learned far more about the beauty industry than I thought I would, but I've also been able to develop relationships with customers. The only complaint would be the hours and occasionally doing our shipment."
good,"I love helping others with beauty i enjoy making people feel good and help them find the perfect product. Sally help me to learn so much product knowledge like hair, make up, and hair color."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, pero era estar parada todo el día"
good,"Assisted store patrons in locating items "
good,"I loved working at Sally Beauty. If you took the time to get to know your products, especially from store to store because the products differ, and then took the time to get to know your customer and what they're looking for it made everyone's life easier."
good,working at sallys is a lot of fun you learn about differnet products and you can also buy products and test them out your self. we get a great discount. We are a family at Sally's.
good,A typical work making sales I learned how to connect with the customers and provide for the their needs. I am able to manage the store and work long hours alone. Managing and training staff take paitence and I am learning as I training. The hardest part of my job is having to find coverage when someone calls in. Hard because them I have fine care for my son. The most enjoyable part of my job is the associates and the customers.
good,I loved working at sallys as my first retail job the only problem I had was the management pushing me out bc of there mental issuses other then that it was a great place to work minus the drama
good,"Started at 7:00 am, check e-mail, prepare daily paperwork, brepare daily bank deposit.Then open registers. Then open store for business.I learned responsibility, leadership, setting an example and holding up the daily opperations of my store.Management was very goal driven, which kept  our profit making go thru the roof.It was Beauty business on the cat walk. It was the deffination of modeling and self maintaining your outword apperance from hair color and care to skin care nail care etc. The hardest part for me was keeping employees by means of pay. I felt proud of being apart of a exciting, company like Sally Beauty Supply. And I was apart of the growth of the company."
good,"A typical day of work in sally is very rewarding people who come to do their shopping is always looking for someone to help them to select the products for personal care which helped them to locate for which they were very grateful for my help. I learned to treat clients well with kindness and respect. In the administration I learned to computed sales prices, and processed cash or credit payment.   Maintain knowledge or current sales and promotions, policies regarding payment and exchanges. The people who work there like those who enter the store are from very diverse cultures. The hardest part of the job is not knowing about the store products and the most enjoyable is to talk to the people who came to the store."
good,The work environment that Sally's gives you is incredible. You really do feel like a family when you work here. When they started to take out and restructure the company is when it started to decline. They went about it the wrong way and left a lot of people who dedicated their lives to this company in the dust and it broke my heart. I understand it's all just business but i couldn't continue working for a company who began to treat us like mushrooms.
good,If you love hair color and products this is the job for you especially if your'e trying to excel in your cosmetology career . The pay for managers is the only disadvantage
good,The Best part about working at Sally was the team!!! Management was great  best I have ever encountered. Traveled for work so I enjoyed that part also. There was lots of flexibility but it also required you  to be self accountable.
good,Sally was a nice place to work and i had a whole lot of experience so i would recommend to all online.................................................
good,"Great place to work. I loved my job here, but location closed. It was a job full of fun and well learning. I loved how you could learn about new products, and sally keeps you up on your training as well"
good,I loved my manger and the other coworkers. It was a fun job. Not many hours for part time. Some days it was slow and other days it was fast paced. Lots of resets. Easy to learn.
good,"I enjoyed the customers and the atmosphere. did a lot of merchandising products, daily inventory , usually only 2 or 3 employees working a day very relaxing"
good,Excellent place to start your retail career! Depending on the area your store is located you could have it pretty easy being that it is so slow or it can be extremely busy! Great learning experience!

good,When working at sally beauty you have to know a lot about products. there is so many different things and the customers ask lots of questions. sometimes its difficult but it definitely is fun

The hardest part is finding time for lunch, but I enjoy opening the store."
good,"Everyday at Sally Beauty has something different to offer. You have a specific task each day, but nothing is as important as the customer when they're in the store."
good,The management is amazing at the Post Falls store. The days are well spent and the team is amazing. The hardest part of the job is handling customers who are upset with their products even after they didn't follow the instructions given by the employee. The store is very well run.

good,"Me encantaba mi trabajo "
good,"It was a really fun place to work, especially when I would have customers come in and specifically ask for me to help them out. I loved always doing hair and to help others know what stuff to use on their hair or makeup, was an awesome feeling."
good,"Always loved to work Sally.  Its a easy going, Customer service, cashiering, inventory, receiving, stocking, bank reconciliation, opening and closing duties are typical daily activities that I experienced while working at Sally's.  I most enjoyed the retail experience."
good,"El trabajo en sally era casi perfecto, las compañeras, las actividades, me encantaba ver mi tienda al 100% y saber que era por el trabajo de mi equipo!"
good,My store was usually slow because of its location so the majority of the time was pretty easy. My co-workers were great team players and made the job that much better. Management helped out when we were short and always made sure scheduling was fair and everyone's needs were met. I enjoyed the employee discount on merchandise the most.
good,In Sally you always have to have lots of patients with customers. and always do your best in selling and work hard. It is a good job if you know about hair

good,"Although employed there for a short time as I had tried to pursue my career with automotive, I did enjoy coming to work and learning about different products to use for my hair and helping others achieve their goals to healthier hair and skin as well. Was something fun to have an added education about and I still shop there frequently for all my supplies. My manager was a great lady and everyone was really nice to get along with. Hardest thing I handled occasionally was register issues and learning the new system, otherwise nothing was overly stressful."
good,A great place to work and learn about the ins and outs of the retail business. Very good on going training for all employees.  Also wonderful benefits and bonuses. A company one can grow with and advance into management positions.
good,"I usually stock and pack products on the store racks. "
good,This company is a great company to work for. They have a lot of incintives. Each month there are bonus games to achieve with upsales per store. It's easy and a fun place to work.
good,"I took this job 4 years ago because I needed one, not realizing the friendships I would make, or how it would feel more like a home than a job. I quickly was promoted from part time to a full time assistant manager. There is room for advancement for the right person who is willing to put the effort in. You get great training and products to try at home. The store manager worked with my busy nursing school schedule and never made me feel bad about it.There are a low number of employees per store, usually 4-5. So if you like to miss work a lot, this is not the place for you, but it makes for a tight bond between employees.  I am leaving this job because I am finally done with school, not because its a bad place to be."
good,"A typical work day for Sally's was a 8 hour shift, either I would open and or close the store and make sure that the cash registers were always on point with cash and nothing was missing. I learned a lot about hair, makeup and skin care while working there. My co workers were very friendly and some  I have stayed in contact with still to this day. I believe the hardest part of that job was when we would get shipment in and out store and back room were so small that we would have a tough time getting it all to fit and stock. The thing I liked the most about sallys was the people I worked with and the customers."
good,"I would Open the store in the morning, and get the money together and go to the Bank for the bank deposits and change we would need for that day, Cashier also sell our products. Trained new hires, inventory."
good,"Over all I enjoyed my time at this company."
good,Busy from open to close. Repeat customers gave it a family atmosphere. Products were good also affordable for customer base.
good,"es un excelente trabajo par las personas que ya no piensan seguir creciendo, como gerentes es un poco difícil por que absorbe todo el tiempo y no permite tener vida social y privada ya que se tiene que estar al pendiente de todo en cuestion del personal que labora en la empresa estar al pendiente de los mantenimientos de la tienda , de las necesidades del cliente, tiene un excelente ambiente laboral y te da la  oportunidad de crecer como persona por que te da la oportunidad de convivir con todo tipo de clientes."
good,"I loved my job there. Management was wonderful, and they always worked with me if i needed a day off to take care of personal situations."
good,overall awesome place to work just dont make enough money to live and not enough hours
good,"Loved working with the public, loved my employees, learned alot about difficult customers"
good,"A typical day at work would be counting the safe,issuing out the cash and checks, making collection calls and processing new loans. I learned to enhance my management, collections and cash handling skills. The co workers where some of the best group of people i have ever met. The hardest part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the regular customers"
good,"On my job as a sales associate at Sally Beauty Supply I have learned everything about the product that we sell as well as how it compares to other popular brands. I have learned most of the techniques that professionals in cosmetology field use to do their job. I have even been able to advise professional customers on how to use different products because of the education that Sally Beauty Supply has given me on everything from waxing supplies and techniques to use of hair clippers and every hair coloring technique. And the education about the field that I got from the company is not limited to those subjects. The management is amazing that is flexible with my school schedule and recognizes achievements made by the employees. The co-workers are really easy to get along with and we always find similar interests. People working here are always supportive of each other and we are always willing to take on another person's shift if they are not able to come in on the day they are scheduled. My typical day at work always involves customer service and using my product knowledge to help people with anything they need. At Sally's there are different duties that need to be done on different days of the week, so there is never a ""typical day"". What I would consider the hardest part of the job was mostly a concern when I first started, and that was calming down an irrate customer. Now I am a lot more comfortable with it and I know techniques to make them feel understood and that I am there to help. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing people come back happy with the results thay"
good,"customer service, talk to different people, gave advise about products, very friendly co works"
good,I would recommend Sally beauty to anyone. Whether it be for a job opportunity or to buy hair products/supplies. Sallys is where its at :)
good,I was pleased to work at Sally Beauty Supply. It gave me the confidence to work one on one with customers and opened up other doors for me where great customer service is required in my field.
good,"It's not always fair,they do not always give recognition to their employees, it's corporate so it's expected I guess,some management made more than others which didn't depend on longevity, I absolutely loved my job for the time I was there,I am responsible and dependable and give 100% at all timez"
good,"I learned more in the beauty field than anything, also more technology skills as well. the customers made the job the best part because I am a people person and I love to help people so being able to help people out with what ever they needed was the best part"
good,"Great place to work, I gained a lot of information and knowledge of the beauty industry and the products. There is room for growth as well and great employee incentives."
good,"Sally. is a fun, energetic, ever changing company to work for. The company puts a lot of effort into training and taking care of our guests is priority. The products and tools at your fingertips helps you to excel."

good,I enjoyed working at Sally Beauty Supply. I learned a lot about the various products available ~ neat tips & tricks. The store manager and my co-workers made the job even more enjoyable. Working with the customers was my favorite part and the store serves an eclectic mix. You won't get rich working here but you will have fun if you like working with the public and multi-tasking. The shifts fly by!
good,"You learn a lot of hair color, makeup and hair products. You get to meet awesome people. They will understand if you can’t come to work. They pay you sick hours and vacation hours."
good,"I loved working here its was by far my most favorite job i ever had, i learned a lot about beauty. makeup and hair is something im very interested in."
good,Worked at Sally's a little over 6 years. Thought me a lot of skills and made me realized how much I love customer service. My favorite part was all of the items we got to try and recommend The culture is great and management really cares about you!
good,"I loved working at Sally's. If I wasn't away at school, I would still be there. Working there was never a bad feeling. They worked with my schedule and trained me very well."
good,"Atención al cliente, aclaración de dudas, ubicación de productos, recomendaciones, y sobre todo colaboración en equipo."
good,"A very slow and simple retail job. Logging and keeping track on inventory was simple and easy, retail merchandising was simple and didnt require much thinking. Coworkers where all very nice."
good,"Good management, laid back atmosphere. Loved the customers and assisting them in finding beauty products they needed. We were given great samples for free monthly and the managers understood you have a life outside of work and were fun to work with."
good,Sally’s is a great place to work especially while you’re in cosmetology school. During the training they give you a booklet with videos and quizzes about chemicals in hair products and hair dye to ensure that you have a somewhat in depth understanding of how the products that are being sold work. The manager really cared about each and every one of her employees well-being and she works with you to make sure that you’re doing your job to the best of your ability.
good,"This was a very great environment to work at, even my team members where like another family & they all made me feel comfortable and at home, I loved the employee discount!"
good,"I worked at this location for a few months and loved it. I left because I had a disagreement with a staff member who was my friend. The store manger was really nice, and very understanding. I was in full time school and she worked around my schedule. The discounts are awesome., I really enjoyed learning about new products from management and staff members as they were always so patient. Great place to work"
good,"I really enjoyed working at this store, I was only working there for a few months, as I had a disagreement with a staff member, the manager was really kind, and understanding and fair with every staff member. The hours suited me as I was in full time school, and the manger was able to work around my schedule"
good,"While working at Sally Beauty, I created special bonds with all of my co-workers and we quickly became family to one another. I got to know my customers and cater to their needs. However, our management at the time was not the best."
good,"Sally's is a great place to work, there are not a lot of places to move up within the customer service area's but they take great care of their employee's."
good,Sally's was a great place to work. They gave us full size samples every month plus bonus games for chances to win prizes. It was not hard at all but the pay could have been better
good,"Loved my management team, and the employees within a short period of time become family, customers are loyal sweet, and personable and you easily develop relationships with them when assisting them with hair care needs."
good,My day at sally's was always good i lean the store management was great culture was goo also hardest part was stocking selves sometimes enjoyable part was customer and coworkers.
good,I’ve worked with Sally’s for a year it’s provides for me. I worked hourly and i love my shift. Sally’s Beauty is more focus on customers service and reaching their sales plan.

good,"I loved working at Sally's it's great. My co-workers were sweet and my manager was wonderful, however the company was going through reconstructing at the time and I was one of the individuals who were affected so I can't really blame them but I wasn't on the better end of it so I decided to persue something else."
good,"Being in customer service is a daily challenge, but being a manager in retail was even more difficult. But I rose to the occasion. Every day was a new day, always something different and a new challenge was presented to me. Once I became a general manager, I felt so accomplished. My customers were also my world. They loved coming to my store specifically because of how much attention I would pay to them, how well I would answer their questions, and how much time I would spend with them making sure they got exactly what they needed and wanted. I loved working with all women as well. They looked up to me for motivation, as anyone should to their leader. But I treated them equally, no little, no less."

good,"The District manager job at sally is a really great one that I did and really enjoyed for 15 years.  The company is also great to work for I have great respect for the company and its management at all levels."
good,It challenged me to learn about various products as well as help a customer find the best product to suit their needs.  I also became more confident with different aspects of sale
good,I loved my boss and the customers but the hours were horrible and the pay was not the greatest especially because I have a license for cosmatology.
good,"my job was never boring opening every morning doing paperwork from the day before and getting the bank deposit ready, scheduling chores for me and for my employees every week, making sure that the job was done when I  wasn't around, communicating  to my district  manager of any irregularities. Making sure every beginning of the month merchandiser was according to companies plan-o- guide, moving if it was necessary shelves,  product  and price labels. Schedules had to be made 3 weeks in advance and making sure not to go over my hours. what I enjoy the most about this job was helping people with their hair, skin, tools for hair and making them feel that I was doing my best to satisfied their needs and having them come back with a big "" wow!!! I love what you suggested"""
good,typical day at work was customer coming in asking for help with hair color or needing tips on beauty regiments .Was always busy and on my feet at all times.
good,I learned a lot about beauty and hair care. My coworkers were friendly and supportive and my manager worked hard to accommodate everyone. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with customers that would not listen to advice and get frustrated with the outcome. The most enjoyable part of the job was spending time with my coworkers and getting to know the customers.
good,"Lots of interaction with the public, between assisting customers and stocking shelves, the day can fly by. I learned about hair care products and the many different types of products that they carry. A great team effort makes for a great place to work. There is not anything truly hard about the job, and the customers, employees make the job fun."
good,"Run the register, maintain quota(s), stock, inventory, customer service, knowledge of beauty products, sales"
good,"Work with a team of 4 other Engineers who we all rely on each other to solve major issues.  A typical day would be to come in and look through the ticket system to see what tickets can be solved.  If there is none, then I log into Project Manager, and work on project that are assigned to me. Occasionally, I would get walk-up's which need to be addressed right then.  My directors, and managers are easy to work with and make the work environment relaxed. The hardest part of the job, is working with legacy equipment. My previous jobs, we had the latest technology, and stayed ahead of the business."
good,"Working at Sally's was educational. I went to cosmetology school and working here just hit everything I learned about everything. I did a lot of stocking shelves and customer service. My manager was the greatest in making sure everything was explained well and everyone had something to do on their day there. I worked about 30 hours a week here. Again, my co-workers were my best friends and we all got along so there were never any problems. The hardest part was learning where all products went and where to find them. The most enjoyable though was remembering all of the fun techniques you can do with each product and helping the customer find exactly what they needed,"
good,I love my job at Sally! It is great for someone with a license in cosmetology.

good,i learn a lot in this job about customer service. good communications between manager district manager and Employee i learn a lot of technique on how to stock and sale.
good,"My typical day at sallys was stocking the shelfs receiving products and ordering products, I was a assistant manager so I also made schedules and hired and fired employee's. I learned to be a leader at this job and how to maintain order. My co-worker's were all nice and hard working young adults i was happy to be the first to hire some of them for there first job. Hardest part of this job was having to fire employee's."
good,I've learn a lot about hair color and it works. I love my manager! She has to be the best manager I've ever had. She works around all of our schedules and makes sure that we have the days off that we did. My co- workers are awesome as well. We can all work together and get tasks done. I've gained so much knowledge working at Sally's. I just recently got promoted to assisant manager. The hardest part of the job would be having to deal with rude customers but I know how to act reasonable even when they're giving attitude. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be working with such a wonderful team.
good,Working at Sally's was a great experince.Management and co.workers were a big help with understanding of their products.I learned alot about beauty products and what they can do.The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing I gave the customers the right products.
good,"Helping customers, counting money, keeping the store organized."
good,"I helped customers with their hair care needs on a daily basis. I operated the cash register. Stocked shelves, done daily reports, opened and closed the store (sometimes alone), and done daily deposits. The manager was very flexible with me and my college schedule and was always task oriented. The hardest part of my job was when customers would get angry with you because you didn't have a certain product they needed and when we would have to watch for shoplifters. Many times we would have to confront the shoplifter and call the police. The most enjoyable part of my job was when a satisfied customer would return to the store just to thank you for your help and that they love the product that you sold them."
good,"Great job, only problem is only part time offered unless you want to manage and that they can’t keep a consistent manager in some stores, not quite sure why."
good,Sally Beauty is a great company to work for. The management team at my location is great and supportive as well as our district management. They have a very informative training program in place. Have weekly and monthly goals to meet. Sales goals to meet. They also offer incentives each month. I like the fact that my manager takes pride in our store and cares about employees and encourages us.
good,Sally's is a great company to work for. Thank courage you to be unique and yourself. The allow you to have an outlet to your creativity as well as help other people with their creativity and their happiness in style.
good,"The employees and my boss are the only thing that keeps me working here! We're all pretty much family now and will do anything for each other. I started working for Sally Beauty almost 5 years ago on and off and cooperate has changed a lot and they'll take hours away often and I've gotten one 20 cent raise in the past almost two years. All in all, if you like a fun job to keep you busy with some extra change in your pocket, this is perfect!"
good,"It was a great job, just where I'm from people tend to just up and leave their jobs. As a store manager it was a little hard to have time off when employees just quit or called out.Benefits and discounts are great."

good,Working here was probably the only time I actually wanted to go to work. I enjoyed my job very much. My boss and co-workers were very friendly and we all worked as a team. Sometimes our customers would be rude as they do with any costomer service job but overall wonderful and fun place to work.
good,I believe sally beauty was a great job oppotunity in my life. It took me places on incentive trips i never eould have gone. We received bonus if we exceeded our quarterly quotas.
good,I've only been here a few months but it's an amazing place to work i love all of my coworkers. I do wish though that corprate didn't roll out all these changes at the same time and try to micrmanage my manager.
good,"A great company to work for with good benefits. I enjoyed working there until I decided to move back home to Missouri. The most enjoyable part of the job was our weekly presentations to the CEO, President of Sally Beauty Company, Vice President of Sally Beauty Company and President of Sally Beauty Company. Getting your renewal terms approved was gratifying."
good,The management and employees are super friendly and take their time to make sure you know everything you need to know about the store. The working environment is very nice and stress free.
good,"en la empresa sally beauty encontre un buen ambiente laboral , donde aprendi muchas cosas para tener mejor experiencia laboral ."
good,"You won't be taught how to cut, color or style hair, but you'll have the opportunity to work with others in the field. Plenty of exposure to products of all types and styles. Name brands plus a few really good generics that work just as well. A typical day will have you standing on your feet for the whole shift without a chance to sit down. There are no stools allowed behind the register because it has very limited space. But you will learn the Sally's very unique way they keep an inventory, change prices and sell products. There is a points system that allows you to collect points for products that are on sale or in their flyer for that month. These points allow you to buy gift cards and other merchandise. The supply truck comes once a week (Thursdays for my store) and inventory must be put out that day. The bulk of the business is in the customer interaction. You don't have to know everything about what you sell, just listen to the other employees and learn and you will."
good,"Working for Sally Beauty, was an expierence. Loved the atmosphere and the workers. Always gave a helping hand when needed. you always learned something new while working there. You would also try new products when they hit the shelves. You can express yourself through you hair, makeup, and style."
good,?I loved working with Sally's being around things and people I knew was fun and easy going to want to come into work. Management was understanding and nice made sure everything was just right. hardest part was getting to know some of the products especially new products.
good,"inventarios diarios y servicio al cliente."
good,Great for anyone looking for a customer service job with not too many hours. My manager is wonderful and has done extremely well and providing the best experience she can for my coworkers and I. Stores are small so hours are limited so it may be worth having a second job in conjunction.
good,"they offer all the necessary training required for the job, they also believe in promoting within, so there is lots of room for growth. "
good,I Love working with skincare & Hair. This was a very fun/educational job for me. Loved the Customers & Staff. I loved being able to help someone when they came in with questions.
good,"Sally was an excellent workplace with skilled management who take an active interest in employee career development. The company promotes from within for skilled, hard working employees. Negative, unmotivated employees don’t last long, as departments really strive for excellence."
good,"very fun work environment, clean, easy going co-workers, easy work, easy tasks, easy pay, great customers, great bosses, good hours, great lunch breaks"
good,"I loved the job because I learned so much , loved trying new products out and getting discounts on what I love most . Hours where good, and schedule was very flexible"

good,Sally Beauty Supply is a great business to work at. Employees are always in a great mood and willing to help at all times. Very knowledgeable of the store's products.
good,"El sueldo es muy bueno. Si te gusta trabajar con contacto con clientes, es un excelente lugar para hacerlo."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Sally Beauty. It wasn't always easy but I learn so much from the company and my manager. The company also has amazing incentives that help motivate you to do your very best.
good,"Sallys is where i mastered most of my costumer skills. I love the monthly educational videos they send informing about new products, how they work and the product of the month We also had freebies to try for ourselfs, giving us the opportunity to try the product and being able to give our costumers the best review because we tried."
good,"Sallys so far has been the best store I have worked at out of the others. A typical day would always consist of you doing something , at times it would run slow with no traffic but, since the store is so little than it would get crowded fast. I met a lot of interesting and fun customers and I can say I ade a lot of new friends working at sallys. It is hands down the best store too work at if you love anything having too do with hair, nails, makeup, and skin."
good,Working at the Sally's Beauty is a good place to work at. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting my customers and creating a relationship with them.
good,"Working for Sally's was awesome. Every store is ten different, because every manager is trained different.. for the most part I never had any complaints in store. You get regular customers that end up coming just for you, and new customers that you get to help out find what's perfect for them. "
good,"Aprendi a trabajar en equipo, atencion a clientes; ya que satisfacer la necesidades de las clientas tiene sus complejos, me encanto la experiencia en Sally Beauty Supply."
good,I've been with sally beauty as a store manager for 7 years. It's a great company to work for. They care a lot about their employees. Everyone has sales goals that must be met but they offer great incentives for meeting these goals. I am not a stylist but have a long background in retail. I opened this store with no knowledge of the beauty industry. It's been tons of fun and a great learning experience working with and around so many in the beauty industry. There are many opportunities to advance if you work hard and wish to do so. They offer great benefits and pay. Most positions are part time and scheduling varies quite a bit but that is the nature of retail.
good,"Amazing education and training standards"
good,"I have been with the company over 7 years and it has become a great place to work.  Over the years we have been through a lot of changes, some good and some bad, but overall, it's a great place to work."
good,I learned a lot working at Sally beauty. I learned from working with hair to knowing which were the best clippers for barbers. I worked with customers to try and get the look they wanted. I learned how to work with money and communicating with customers it was a great learning environment .
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting customers, stocking, front-facing, cleaning, and working the cash register. It was an extremely difficult job but i learned so much from it. It taught me responsibility, how to work productively and fast, and how to really understand the customers more with what they truly wanted.  The hardest part of Sally beauty supply was the fast paced environment but i learned how to cope with it and get my work done faster than ever before while also being efficient. I really enjoyed the people i worked with and creating a bond with the customers. I loved helping them and making them feel confident in themselves. It was the best feeling in the world."
good,"I spent 10 years working part time and loved every moment."
good,"Typically i would start my shift by putting on my apron, and began assisting customers, or working on fronting and facing the store. If a customer has a question, i would do the best of my abilities to assist them. Then walking them to the front of the store where the registers where to cash them out."
good,"The staff and customers are great and I love the product knowledge I learn from the products and the people."
good,"Great place. Never want to leave. Great management, great concepts, great ideas, wonderful benifits, great 401k, They are updating different things which is needed and other things. Company going in right direction"
good,"Working at Sallys was a great experience. You get work with diverse customers and fellow co-workers. There is a lot to learn about hair dying and bleaching, products targeting certain hair types, makeup for all skin types, nail art and nail care, and so much more. Hardest part of the job is when you are stuck and cannot answer a difficult question a customer may have when you are alone in the morning shift. You have to work well under pressure, especially in the holiday seasons. If you are eager to learn and enjoy helping out customers with beauty related questions, you'll fit right in! You do not need to be a certified cosmetologist or nail technician, though its beneficial if you are."
good,I had an amazing time while being an assistant manager at sally's! It definitely gave me a confidence boost and i had awesome coworkers. I just wish it paid more.
good,Learned a lot would do again. You get tons of free stuff. You take quizzes that'll have you thinking you're an hair expert. Discounts are the best. Great job
good,I have worked for Sally's for nearly 3 years now. I will say that they take excellent care of their employees and customers alike. A very flexible company.
good,I love working at sallys. I tell people all the time that it's not even going to work when I work. I look forward to working each and every day. Not to mention you get to meet amazing people!
good,"If you love the retail setting with beauty this is the place for you. Sally's Beauty Holdings care about their employees and family. Each store has diffrent Staff and managment, so locations will vary on typical day activities and duties."
good,"A typical day at work, walked in everyone will be in a good mood. It was rare when someone had a negative attitude, I got along with all the girls really quick. I don't think there was anything hard about the job, it was pretty easy, as long as you listen and followed the rules. Most enjoyable part of the job would most likely be when a customer thanks you for helping them makes me feel good about doing my job."
good,"Sallys is a fun place to work, however the contract is up on the project I have been assigned to and must seek further work."
good,"You get to learn about knew products and how they work. You can be honest to customers about what works and what doesnt work. It is recommended you have a cosmetology background since 80% of the customers have questions about dye (and no you cant just google it!). Management can be good, it depends on who is your boss to judge whether you will have a great experience. The new product set ups can be a pain in the butt, and some rude customers here and there. Overall if you love beauty and are a responsible adult, this job is for you."
good,"A learning environment, especially for an up and coming cosmetologist. A great company to work for. There is always constructive criticism. Management is very supportive and helpful. My co-workers and I are team players. We are always striving to grow together."
good,"Sally Beauty is a fun place to work and they really take the time to teach you about products in the store. The ratios you need to achieve each month are not hard to get to and the management is always helpful and supportive. If you are a full time employee, they offer great help insurance and a 401K. There is always a great opportunity to move up in the company as well. It's a great place for someone who is just starting out in the sales world."
good,"The store was busy, and always had stuff to do."
good,Working for Sally Beauy Supply was such a neat expierence! I enojyed what I did along with the people I worked under and along side.
good,i scan different labels and begin picking orders in a timely fashion. i also operate the electric pallet jack towards the end of the night by dumping trash or getting boxes for the  next shift in the morning.
good,"I enjoyed all of my experiences in the Army and as a Federal employee! The benefits, job security and advancement possibilities were amazing! All of my agency transfers were seamless!"
good,"I love shopping at Sallys but when i was employeed wasnt the best the management wasnt professional, gossip always coming from the manager so i made sure to mind my business and get the job done"
good,Never had a dull moment. Very busy and fast pace environment. Manager and other co-workers got along very well. We all had a nice and professional relationship. Always kept our education up to date by watching videos and or reading up on the products that we had on stock and the new products coming in. Made sure to keep the store well organized and kept clean everyday before closing time. The hardest part of the job was not being able to eat your lunch comfortably. No enough space in the back office. Standing for long periods of time with out comfortable shoes. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help out the customers find what they are looking for. Educating them on the product just so they would know how exactly to use it. Making a customer feel comfortable once the come in. Simply just having customers come back to say thank you and that they appreciate my help.
good,i learned that working in a place where u meet new people every day is a good way to develop good customer service skills.
good,"Great company to work for, fun environment, customer service driven."

good,"I love working at Sallys. I started as an part-time employee, and move up to a full time employee. I learned about hair products. The store only had four employees. The hardest part of the job was if someone got sick or needed to be out of work we all had to cover their shift. But we didn't mind. The enjoyable part of the job was we become more than co workers we all were friends who help each other, and learn to work as a team."
good,Sallys was my first job I oved working at Sallys I loved my co workers my maneger everyone was great good comunications keeped a clean invrment depoit money to bank. I had alot of responsiblities but i loved them :)

Management was really good, because they made sure we did our jobs correctly without hassling us. My co-workers were very friendly and outgoing. I got along with all of them. The hardest part of the job was finding the items in the room and taking it to stock on the shelves. The stock room was always full of items. My most enjoyable part of the job was that I was only volunteering but the team made me feel like I worked with them for years. Sometimes, our supervisor would bring us food from a restaurant too."

good,"I got to enjoy learning about hair products "
good,"Flexible schedule, fun working with customers and you get great discounts on items."

good,"Typical day at Sally's included filling shelves, helping customers pick the perfect beauty products,"
good,"Typical day would be what I already described"
good,"I would say hands down, the best Job I have ever had. There's a lot of info to learn but the Job is easy. The clerks you talk to on the phone can be nice but are not smart at all. Most barely know how to turn a computer on. The job offers a lot in benefits and a great learning experience. However, the pay is lacking. A few more dollars in pay increase would go a long way in making a strong department. The equipment is greatly outdated and breaks down often. But overall a Great Job."
good,En lo personal me gustó mucho trabajar con Sally Betty por todo lo que te dejan desarrollarse como vendedora y los conocimientos que adquieres al trabajar con ellos y el buen trato a los empleados
good,"Slackers stay away.  Good workers are treated very well.  If you are lazy, you won't last.  Good career if you are honest and care about others.  Free product for staff every month.  Love it!"

good,"Growing with this company, you lean to unload trucks, organizing  the merchandising, stocking all the shelves, handling large amount of cash, making weekly schedules and also providing training. Only down fall was having employee calling out last minute and not getting a proper pay since i've been Assistant Manager. Overall this company is a great company to work for and grow."
good,"Although the pay was not that great, they do take care of you as an employee. They offered amazing incentives for good work. They gave us HUGE discounts and lots of free stuff monthly. I learned a lot from this job. Really good company."
good,"Help customer, ask them if they need your help. Clean put out color move around  the store . Always busy always working . Check what it is to be done at the back room.  Sell make a lot of sells offers products. Call other store if the customer is asking for a product that we might not have. Always move around and have something to do. There is really  no hard part at this job everything was real easy. most enjoy is when its busy always helping customers."
good,A typical day working at Sally beauty would be pretty simple. When we arrive we put our bags away then go and clock in. As soon as you walk into the door you are expected to be ready to work. As you are helping the customers all day you also make sure all the stock is away do the correction counts front all the merchandise. There is nothing hard about working at Sally beauty and it was always enjoyable the customers were wonderful and so were the coworkers and manager. The one thing i learnt working for this company was correction counts.
good,"Mostly I was opening the store so, I was there early in the morning until the afternoon. I really enjoyed how diverse the customers coming in were. You need to be great at problem solving and keeping cool during busy hours. I loved gaining knowledge about different products!"
good,Fun and positive work environment with room to grow and advance. Every day is different making the task at hand always exciting. With a small team you are able to make great relationships with customers and fellow employees.
good,I absolutely love my job and the people I work with. My manager is the best I have ever had. This is a fun upbeat place to work. There's nothing super hard you have to do. As long as your KPI's are in order you will be good. Every month you get monthly benefits. Sally's is a wonderful place to work.
good,"A great job for anyone who is currently in school and looking for a part-time job on the side. The staff are relaxed and fun to be around, the workload is easily managed and the General Manager (as well as the District Manager) are very welcoming and willing to work with personal schedules. An average work day includes helping customers, light cleaning of shelves, restocking products, and taking quizzes on the computer to stay up-to-date with current hair style and color trends.  You can expect to learn a lot about hair, nail, and skin treatments, coloring, and repair."
good,"Enjoyable workplace with great management. Quotas are easy to fill.  Colleagues are easy to work with, and they are knowledgeable of the workplace. Customers are genuine and caring; however not all customers are happy with their experience. Keeping everyone happy is the hardest part of the job."
good,Product knowledge is a must and they will train you well for that. You get monthly training videos filling you in on any new products they may have coming in. You also get to try new products almost every month which is great and helps you answer customer questions. Rewards program for meeting your monthly goals and selling the IOMS(items of the month) which allows you to use your points to get free items listed on employee website or get a gift card from Sally's to make your purchases. Great employee discount. You need to have lots of patience with the customers which is a must for all retail jobs
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. Every month they give away free products to the employees so they are able to try out. The work is very easy and they always educate you on the new items they are bringing in.
good,A typical day at work included helping customers with hair products or sometimes skin and nail products. Keeping the store clean and organized. Reading store emails and doing daily paperwork.
good,I truly enjoyed working here. Meeting new people everyday and learning about new products was great.
good,"en las mañana llego temprano porque odio lo retardos, me pongo a revisar el horario si me toca caja ingreso mi usuario en lo que mi gerente me da mi fondo, checo cada pasillo que tengo  asignado para verificar que todos lo productos estén es sus respectivo lugar, claro si entra un cliente dejo todo y me acerco a el  para atenderlo y ver en que le puedo ayudar y lograr darle un mejor servicio"
good,Helped customers to find what they needed. Listened to all customers' issues and gave appropriate feedback.
good,"greet customers and hand them our store flyer letting the customer know of our sales for the month, we stocked the sales floor as well as maintain the store presentable and clean at all times, we helped customers with any questions and helped them pick their products, i learned on how to depened on myself and many other skills that i feel will help me as will help other companies that hire me for it makes it easier for them to train me management was ok not the best and they didnt really keep it professianl at work some of my coworkers were great to get along with but the others just made it impossible to enjoy the work area the hardest part was keeping my cool when some of the customers were making my day hard and having to hold my tongue the best part was being able to expained my knowledge and work hands on on the job with the customers."
good,"My typical day at work would consist of helping the customers find products that they want or need. Front facing the entire store, and also making sure all the back stock was put onto the shelves. Answering the phones and using a cash register."
good,All the new things on the market for the hair and testing them all out was great.  Ups and downs but amazing to work with the cosmetology world.
good,I have been working for the company for 17 years. I am looking for a job because I am relocating. It is always fun to go to work every day because there is always something to do at work. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public and reaching sales goals.
good,"A typical work day for me is being a sales associate. What i have learned with this job is customer service jobs could be one of the most hardest job to work at , but if you have a dedicated attitude then it would be perfect for you. All my coworkers we were a team if one didn't know something and the other did we got helped in all work together and I think that's how a job is suppose to go. The hardest part of my job was stocking in a small stock room , it was very dangerous. The most enjoyable part of my job was coming in a environment that I love and loving what I do."
good,"At Sally Beauty Supply; we would do inventory counts, have excellent customer service, cashier skills, balancing out registers various times throughout the day and at night, make deposit, some household cleaning and resetting front end of store. This job taught me how to execute excellent customer service skills. Management was always willing to help and teach and be there when needed. Corrected when needed also. Co-workers were great at every location I was at. At times the hardest part of this job was at the end of the month when resetting entire store. But I loved interacting with the different stylist and helping customers."
good,"A typical day was very busy, stocking product, helping customers. My manager was awesome, she took a chance on me and made me a manager within the first three months of me working for Sally's.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my customers."
good,I worked there for 5 years and loved every minute of it - left to go to school and miss it dearly. The entire company was very fun and easy to work for and very understanding of everything
good,It's a nice place to work. I learn alot about the new technology they have rolled out in the last 3 or so years.  But I worked there for 10 years. I had great customer service and in them 10 years I was a Manager for 3 years.
good,The mangment there  was very poor. They seem to upper cut the people who could make the biggest difference. One of the only things that I really enjoyed was being one on one with the customers. Helping them feel that they got the correct items. The education great and was something that you could take with you if you worked in the beauty field.

Now also before recommending a product we have make sure it is something safe for them. It is always better to recommend something we have used before because we’ll have an idea in how it works.

good,Sally's Beauty is full of welcoming staff and customers. The benefits of working there are endless as you get employee discounts free samplings each month
good,"Sallys was one of my first jobs I loved working close with the cosmetology community. My manager quickly became a friend along with all of my other coworkers, there weren't many of us so it was very easy to become very close with everyone. Less than a year in i was offered to move up in my position in store. Its very fast pace, and like all retail it was not the greatest some days. They were always very flexible with my schedule."

good,"open up, greet clients."
good,"Every day when you walk in you know what your daily duties are. My store manager opened 6 days a week and always left us notes if she wanted anything specific done. Facing products, stocking shelves, cleaning etc. was a daily duty. If we were slow, we knew just to walk around to make sure everything was neat for the customers. Shipment days were easy, our manager wanted everything organized by letter and she assigned us all letters to break down, count, and put out on the shelves. Our entire store was well organized and she always communicated with us employees, even when we didn't all always work together."
good,"A typical day at work would be nice. I'd get there at the start of my shift and I'd learn something new everyday. Management was wonderful, fair and accepting.

good,Very laid back and enjoyable. Co-workers were wonderful. I just think they should offer the opportunity to return as an employee if you were in a position that caused you to have to quit at the time. You should be able to return instead of not being aloud to work for the company again.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Sally’s Beauty Supply co. It was a good pay. I enjoyed the hours they gave me. I had a good rate pay , I would be on time."
good,I have a great team supporting me. They are always supportive and uplifting. The management is motivational and you really feel like a team is behind you.

good,"They kept up with latest trends that the customers wanted. You would sell thing at the front counter and get points online for employee benefits. If you sold well within that month, they would give sally reward scratch offs. You watch a video for the new products in and got to test most of the yourself so you have the most knowledge for your customers."
good,"Best job I have had overall, the job overall is self explanatory and is an easy job. Management is great, employees have professionalism and customers love how we advise in beauty care products"

good,I liked being a manger at Sally's! I got to meet new people and work in a field that I had lots of knowledge in. My district manager at the time was aweasome.
good,I regret leaving Sally's. I should have stayed where I was but I needed a full-time job and more pay than what Sally's could offer me. The manager is very nice and kind and very understanding with personal life.

good,"I absolutely loved working for Sally Beauty! I learned various things about hair, nails, makeup, and other beauty products that expanded my knowledge vastly and helped me provide excellent service to our customers daily. Being able to have free samples of the monthly featured products helped us as sales associates to give our honest opinions, experience, and knowledge of the product to customers. The hardest part of the job had to be those ""freak accidents"" customers experienced at salons and or trying on their own and solving the problem for them as efficiently and stress free as possible without breaking the bank. The best part of the job was interacting with customers, expanding your knowledge in the beauty and cosmetology industry, and working with the amazing staff and managers. Very sad I had to quit due to personal issues and would gladly return with no hesitation!"
good,My manager is absolutely amazing! My coworkers are the best! It is such a great place to work especially when you have amazing coworkers.  Could not ask for a better team.

I increased my experience in the hair industry just by learning and selling the products from there. The hardest part for me was the day i had to leave. I cried and so did the manager at the time. The most enjoyable part was the experience i got from working there, and by far has been the best job i've had. I would recommend anybody that qualifies and would like to work with a close knit ""family"" to this job, at this particular location."
good,was a great learning experience that i would recommend anyone wanting to learn about the beauty and hair care
good,"a typical day at sallys beauty supply was very productive once you clocked in you were either on the register, shippment was every tuesday so if you were working that day you were putting out product threw day, helping customers when they asked or if we asked them if they needed help. pull customer orders if they called one in, we also offered in store fliers to every customer that walked in threw the door so they can see our daily sales, i learned how to do correction counts, mark downs, how to prepare paper work, set up and change displays, approve payroll, order products we were low on in the store. my coworkers were great to work with of course working with all girls they can be catty at times but everybody worked together regaurdless if they had a problem with another employee. the enjoyable part was helping customers find what they needed."
