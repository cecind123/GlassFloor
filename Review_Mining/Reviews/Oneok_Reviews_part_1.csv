bad,"Hired a contractor to work as a NOC tech at nights. I worked two levels underground in the Converse level in a secured room alone with another shift co-worker. What I found disturbing about my work environment was I worked with individual that would inform me he was suffering from depression  on several occasions and on other occasions would mention he was in the market for a AR-15 assault rifle. While on shift he would time my bathroom breaks, watch you tube while I carry most of the load at night, laugh hysterically and constantly slamming his desk while watching YouTube.  He did not have any hygiene skills either which made training very difficult not to mention the constant sarcasm. Regularly indicating he would resign  due to his depression. Since I was a new hire contractor and he was full time, management didn't seem to care. In fact when they questioned me about his behavior, he sat behind me during the discussion with management making comments, was very strange and un-nerving consider this guy's mental health status. Luckily my contract ended and was not renewed and left and never looked back. I have worked nights for over 25 years and that one year at OneOK was one of the most bizarre and dangerous. Doesn't seem to end there, co-workers have joked about a previous night shift employee performing a inappropriate act on a webcam in front of another shift worker, which leave me baffled even more about this company ethics. These are things future employees might want to take into consideration when applying here base on my experiences."
bad,"Slow and long hours, with long periods of boredom with a few moments of excitement.  Watch YouTube, TV, play video games, text on your phone waiting for your shift to end, look busy when management is around.  Paid to goof off is the plus side for some."
bad,"In my opinion, ONEOK is a poorly led company.  For example, most personnel/raise/promotion/hiring decisions seem to have to go all the way up in the organization.  Little authority is delegated to the VP level (demonstrating how little faith the CEO has in his leadership team).  There is an exception for the Legal Function... the lawyers seem to run the place."
bad,the people could not do anything if people from out of state didn't tell them how to do it.  Then when you get sick of their ways they through you under the bus every chance they get.  The southern hospitality is just a act so they can stab you in the back when you turn around.
bad,"Very poorly managed. There is a reason why they go through so many people and always hiring. "
bad,"The upper management (VPs) have no clue how the employees are honestly being treated. There are so many issues within the company...."
bad,Oneok as a plant operator was not a job for someone that likes to be active and doesn't like favortism from management. Unless something was going on in the plant it was the most boring of a job anybody would ever want.
bad,"ethics is thrown out the window.  If you're not related to a boss you will never go anywhere.  Everyone's brother in law, cousin, or son in law works there and every week ethics is sent to us in an email and in my department is ignored because there is no ethics"
bad,"a typiçal day comsisted of compute learning modules"
bad,"they do not practice what they expect.  Leaders tell subordinates to do performance reviews but they are not given one.  Pay is not market based or person based, they should just unionize the whole company."
bad,"Market based pay..... get used to that term with ONEOK. We usually seem to be not quite at the bottom of the market but no where near the middle. My dept doesn't get too many chances for advancement but with our upper managment I don't see why you would want to. "
bad,"If you know the right people, you can go far. The industry has hard and fast regulations and rules that you have to work within, so beyond that you have to know people to excel."
bad,Great place to start a career but not a good place to advance. No solid reasoning is given for timing or achievements needed to  move up in the company. Was told only lateral moves were encouraged and not to apply for positions higher than my own.
bad,"Company tends to get caught up with trainees and interns and forgets current employees, even those that they paid for the education.  They pay at the low end of the market as well."
bad,favoritism don’t stand out just fall in single file and don’t buck the system. Terrible upper management unless you’re a brother in-law or former shift partner.
bad,The people are great in the departments.. The upper management don't listen to anyone. No room for advancement. The pay is below average for all employees.
good,Very poor management. Current superviser is very disrespectful. Current management thinks they are in charge of your personal life. Expected to drop everything for the job.
good,"Manager told me I might not like him but you will do what i say or else, some good coworkers, work life balance good.  No disciplinary for unruly employees, manager would not care about what you were doing through as long as it did not affect him."
good,"Was told by a supervisor that they used marijuana, and after turning them in, was demoted. The company Human Resources said my demotion was due to my supervisors setting me up for failure, and not due to turning in that supervisor."
good,Great place good people for the most part poor upper management for sure and very poor up coming management location is everything when choosing to work for this company
good,"ONEOK has great benefits and they are great at recruiting new people but horrible at retaining.  Too many managers, even some that have no reports.  Management needs serious training.  They're not good at promoting within."
good,Start at daylight work until the job for the day is done. Learned how to del with all type of people to get the most out of them. Letting workers go. Seeing my workers happy and getting the job done.
good,"A typical day at work depends on which business unit and which department you are in, which also defines the type of workplace culture.  I learned various new software applications and business approaches."
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with extreme heat or cold and keeping productions at the best at all times. I've learned about different styles of natural gas compressors and how to operate a cryogenic skid
good,Good company but they do not like giving raises or promotions. Be sure to get everything in writing. Do not trust promises from management............
good,"It is a meeting heavy environment with a lot of deliberation and discussion points, but very little action.  I found it easier to be productive before or after hours as most time in the office was spent in meetings, making phone calls, sending/receiving emails, and tracking people down to collect information."
good,Managment didn't challenge employees and the copensation was weak compared to peers workplaces.
good,"The work for AP is fast paced, and every employee should mind the details."
good,"Plenty of work. Great benefits. Great co-workers. Too many ""chiefs"" and not enough indians. There is a VP for everything."
good,management is not the greatest.  good paying job.  Employees are helpful if you need assistance on anything.  A lot of training involved but overall good work environment
good,"This is a great company with good benefits. It is a secure work environment that rarely ever sees any downsizing. With this conservative fiscal policy comes lower incomes and reluctance to look for more talent until is is absolutely necessary. Job growth is heavily dependent on who you know and how long you have been around, not as much what you have done and are doing."
good,"poor management and no advancement available, schoolings are blocked if asked to go.  They do have free lunches for meetings and the coffee is always good"
good,The work here was fun. It offered a wide range of responsibilities. Doing something different everyday. There is very little area to advance to because these stations are all spread out across the country. Usually the only way to move up is to be the bosses best drinking buddy and then wait for him to retire.
good,This is an employee friendly work place.  The company values its employees and works hard to provide security.  The management seems to place a high value on finding the right employees to hire.
good,"The compensation and benefits were great."
good,"•	Worked with oil and gas producers to purchase and then market their commodities ensuring a reasonable margin."
good,We do the cleaning of the ballpark and suites. Ive learned learned some good leadership skills.
good,"answered phones, made copies, took care of invoices. ordered supplies."
good,"Too many young people trying to climb to the top! Older workers under appreciated, not valued. For the most part enjoyed working their. Management used fear to control workers."
good,"Very busy, it was a lot to learn but training was extremely beneficial, things were managed well, laid back, nothing hard about my job and i really enjoyed the people that I worked with."
good,I enjoyed my time here. There is room for advancement. If they can place themselves in the right areas they should be fine through the drought.
good,"Hydrostatic testing service to collect and distributed information during the hydrostatic Test. Information such as a pipe pressure, ambient temperature, pipe temperature, Ground temperature, and test technician comments are collected and displayed using custom engineered mobile data acquisitions system, and then stored in a database."
good,Oneok is a growing company that focuses on an ethical and safe culture. The workforce is constnatly growing and the Oneok hiring process keeps the correct people for it's culture.
good,"Oneok is a great company with multiple areas where a person can learn and advance. Management leaves a lot to be desired as it tends to be the ""good old boy"" type of management with managers' friends receiving preferential treatment and others considered to be outsiders."
good,"Talent should be put on the forefront when making decisions about employees growth. Management should be watched keenly on what they do. Otherwise, its a great company with great benefits."
good,It’s a challenging job mentally and physically.  We have a variety of different mechanical and operational equipment which contributes to making this job a challenge since we aren’t standardized.  We spend a lot of time working in harsh weather environments and through the overnight hours to keep equipment running and gas moving.
good,"Every day you don't know what to expect, an 8r day can become a 14 hr day due to work orders."
good,"It was a great work environment.  We were like family. We each had our own cubicle, which we were allowed to personalize it. A typical day at work was fast paced exhausting by the end of the work day but rewarding as to how many people I was able to satisfy.  I learned that treating people with honor and respect, saying their name, making sure they know yours and keeping them abreast of everything  your doing in their behalf to help solve the problem. Management was helpful, emphatic and Knowledgeable. They were very hard workers and had an open door policy which I appreciated immensely.  My Co-workers were the greatest, Like I said above we were like family oh we had some problems but we resolved them because we had to work together we resolved them quickly.  The hardest part of the Job was the overflow(more calls than our center could handle) that's when things got tight, Supervisors on alert and Upper management walking the floors everyone felt the tension.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when the Customer is so happy with what you did, they offer to give you a gift or talk to your supervisor.  Pleasing the Customers is worth more than any gift they offer...It is my Job my pleasure!"
good,"Extremely safety centered company, community and family friendly with help very good benefits for the worker as well as the whole family. Good with time off and pay."
good,I worked with this company for a year under a third party. I worked as Lead Environmental Inspector under the Nationwide 12 permit. This job lasted about a year.
good,"A typical day at work was a lot of time spent coordinating project information. "
good,"grass is always greener.....there are pros and cons to every company, but what I personally get out of working for ONEOK might differ than what someone else gets out of it. However, I love my job. There is never a time where I am not challenged or in the process of learning something new. My management and supervisory support is the best in the area, I have no doubt that I am where I am today because of them. Other area managers are absolutely terrible, but It takes a long time for anyone to get demoted or for someone to move up. That being said, this is an excellent place to work in my opinion, and you will get out of it what you put into it."

good,"Run board and outside operations everyday. Write permits, install lockouts. Collect data and enter the info everyday on different tasks. Start and stop pipeline movements."
good,ONEOK is a great company to work for.  Very high job security and benefits.  The only down side is the pay.  They tend to pay less then everyone else.  This was a typical 40 hr week job with great satisfaction in what you do.  
good,Every day seemed to be different - from talking to irate customers to scheduling appointments or booking airlines for often groups. I learned that there are always two sides to a story. The hardest part was talking to an irrate customer and not being able to help them due to their being dishonest about their circumstance. The best part was being able to really help them.
good,"The shifts were hard, but could be made enjoyable. The company and benefits were great, have not heard of any company who has better. A family oriented company."
good,Management is organized and helpful. Everyone has a positive attitude. Co-workers are great and fun to be around.

good,Woked at ONEOK for 4 years. I loved the culture and people I worked with. I was relocated for a couple years and ONEOK allowed me to travel home on the scheduled weekends with my son. I also feel ONEOK (within my group anyways) appreciated its employees. Hard work did not go unnoticed and I was monetarily rewarded every year. I would recommend working for ONEOK to anyone.
