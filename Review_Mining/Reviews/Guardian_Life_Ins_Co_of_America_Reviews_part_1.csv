rating,review
bad,A truly terrible place to work even by call center standards. Bathroom breaks are timed and discussed with you if you take too long. The systems are extremely antiquated.
bad,Hard to sustain a good life work balance when one of the cogs in the wheel are broken.   Manager expects too much of staff and expects everything to be done for them so they can ride on a superstar staff’s coat-tails.  Will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat when it comes to advancement.
bad,"Never work for this company! Absolutely little to no training, and the daily / weekly meetings were a joke. Very little follow up with the advisors. Management will push products on clients they absolutely did not need."
bad,Met some lifetime friends and I will cherish their friendships forever.  It's the people at work that makes your work life and enjoyment and these are
bad,"Management needs work. they put the wrong people in charge, making harder for you to do your job. not willing to hear new ideas. schedule wasnt bad, was actually a bit flexible."
bad,"archaic systems, poor management, favoritism of young male employees"
bad,culture changes are changing the work environment if people leave department jobs are not being replaced and work load gets picked up within the team members left
bad,"Would avoid at all cost no real focus, management did not set up any objectives on projects, unreasonable timelines that had no particular goal. However the people who worked there were nice"
bad,"That’s literally the best thing I can say. I get paid on the 15th and the 30th, which is annoying, however when it comes to accommodations or anything else, beware. If you’re looking for reasonable accommodation get ready to wait a month to hear back and then have the most unreasonable accommadation requested, bordering on a HIPAA violation. "
bad,"Setting goals and target, calling clients to obtain an appointment,try to obtain at least 5 appointments per day, this is done mostly through refferals, cold calling, friends and relatives. Review clients portfolio with a view to introduce new products and increase coverage. Management is always willing to assist where ever possible. The workplace cultutre is very conducive and friendly. The hardest part of my job is receiving rejection. the most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying my clients need."
bad,"Too much work load"
bad,No work to life ratio. Did not appreciate overtime everyone put in.  Was not a place to work to move up.  Everyone out for themselves.  Management very sneaky and did not care about employees.
bad,"Learned a lot at GLIC, most important lesson, don't get comfortable. If it doesn't benefit corporate america, it won't benefit you."
bad,"Selling the multi-life DI product to group producers was difficult.  I was the 4th rep in colorado and the major producers that I knew were already assigned to other reps in the office."
bad,"Production and quality, production and quality. If you cannot meet their unattainable goals you get fired and if you can meet them you don't get a merit increase on your annual. If you can by some chance meet and sometimes exceed you get a 2% increase... which is pennies because you make squat to begin with."
bad,dont love it  i have never been so exhausted in my life by a job only here 6 months and can't wait to find another job i wouldnt recommend working here
bad,"I worked for this company and there were several complaints with regards to explicit derogatory treatment toward employees from owner. Furthermore, it was a hostile work environment. Therefore, company was shut down by corporate after extensive investigation."
bad,Dont walk RUN from this place.  Mandatory overtime for most of my time employed there. Employees (many of them) hate it. Was a chore to wake up and have to work there each day. So glad to have left
bad,"Guardian WAS a great company to work for years ago. Dedicated employees and Management recognized there employees. The last 5 years I work there was nothing but getting rid of the long time employees. Trying to get them for little mistakes switching there job so they could fire them so they wouldn't have to give them severance packages. Humiliating them making them feel stupid and worthless so they could get rid of them without having to pay them. Back in the day the would just have to downsize and would offer people severance packages, now they like to humiliate you so they don't pay out any packages. I had friends who worked there for 30 or more years once Deanna Mulligan came in with those cross eyes she took everything away. Corporate greed! She believes in hiring the younger people to take over peoples jobs who have been there for more than 20 years. Only for the young people with degrees leave within a year. See it so many times. Guardian us to be a good place to work. It has people who have there own little groups and hire each other because they know one another. I would never recommend Guardian or go back to work for them. CORPORATE GREED!"
bad,great job if you're a quick learner and get along with management and supervisors. The co-workers are great. The company also offers a free gym membership.
bad,I would rather not comment on my experience and think its important for each person to judge their own experience.  My experience did not meet my expectations.
bad,"No appreciation, production environment where the only thing that matters is the numbers. Zero incentives or appreciation. We do not do anything fun, it is strictly work work work. Mandatory Overtime currently at 8+ hours per week. This ""career"" is a guaranteed way to get a headache everyday."
bad,"Used to be a great place to work, however is now very micro managed with unrealistic expectations set forth by management who in some cases have no idea how to do the job themselves."
bad,There is no job security at all; the management is horrible.
bad,not a good company to work for. Management micromanages. Quality Control seems like Internal Affairs. Expectations are unrealistic and cannot be met. Management continues to impose unrealistic procedures and production / quality measurements. Employees are often set up to fail. 
bad,"Management is very authoritarian.  This is a ""might makes right"" environment where the level you stand at on the ladder dictates who is right and who is wrong, rather than the merits of ideas. "
bad,"This is not a good place to work anymore. It used to be good 20 years ago but now it is a hot mess.  They outsource EVERYTHING and do not treat their onshore representatives very well.  in 2015 they laid off 50 employees due to outsourcing and then a couple months later they had a job fair and re filled all of those positions.  Many of the people let go had been at Guardian 20 years or more.   Their bottom line is CORPORATE GREED. As long as they make money and a lot of it off of sick and dying people, they don't care about anyone else.  You are lucky if you get a an increase during your annual review and if you do its maybe 1%.  They have a HIGH TURNOVER at Guardian."
bad,"Managers do not know how to communicate to their staff"
bad,Answer phones for either dental members or providers or disability members depending on the call volume to resolve or answer their questions regarding their benefits or claims.  What I learned is not to take it personally and to be empathic to their needs.  The hardest part is not to cry on every disability call. The most enjoyable part is learning new products and systems.  My fellow co-workers are great we all help each other.
bad,"I worked at Guardian as a CSR and they do not pay you enough for everything you have to do and memorize. They focus to much on call time and metrics, and not enough on really helping the customers. The Case Managers never really want to help you and also your Team leads are avoiding your calls when you have upset customers who have not received payment on their disability claims. The calls are always filled with upset/angry customers who are waiting on their disability claims being processed. There is no communication between employees and management, and this is why they have a high turnaround. They need to focus more on really helping the customers and not on call time, because employees who focus on call time are quick to give fast answers to customer's just to end the call and they're not really helping them with their exact problem."
bad,"Constant change. Giving more and more work to offshore.  Constant online monitoring of what employees are doing online.  While at the same time one TEAM LEADER on her phone 1/4 of the day and coaching other employees to spend more time in ""production"" and less time on ""non-production online like Skype. Grrr"
bad,"I worked for Guardian for years. After a while, to took a toll on my mental and physical health. Their mentality of ""do more with less"" is stressed often. Employees are highly undervalued, unless you're in upper management. "
bad,"I worked there in 2010-2011 and the management in the call center was not good. You had upper management who was let go for having an affair with employee's. Then other parts of the call center had managers who would choose their 'favorites' and never have issues with them, but then try to mentally destroy their ' not favorites' on a daily basis.  It was a chaotic mess. People who were there at this point were never ever happy. It was a VERY stressful environment to work in and I was so very glad to leave.  The money was amazing, and I actually left, to make less money, just to get out of the horrific environment!!"
bad,"I worked for Guardian for just shy of 15 years. Started in my early 20's and planned on staying until I retired. Well, Guardian liked to keep employees no more then 20 years, then they bring in temps, have you train them and then terminate you because you make too much and they can hire the temp that you trained for half of what they pay you. Also when it comes to disputes between employees they don't handle situations in a professional manner. Instead of addressing the employee that is the problem privately they send a mass e-mail to the entire department about proper work procedure, hoping that the problem employee will comply. Just a horrible company to waste your time with."
bad,"If you have a brain and can think, there legal team that runs procurement is not your place. Micro management by the managers boss. No independent thinking allowed. More like being in grade school then a professional office..legal group."
bad,to much double talk cant trust any management all out for them and none out for  the real workers
bad,Guardian did a great job recruiting me but sold me a job that wasn't true. May be a good way to make money if you are an experienced adviser but as an entry level job it is nearly impossible. They will not tell you this in the interview but the sole purpose of the role is to sell whole life policies.
bad,Guardian use to be a great place to work they cared about their employees and offered great pay.  Then they decided to go a different direction and started to move many jobs overseas and the environment that use to be good to their employees was now gone. It became a place of uncertainty and stress for the employees and the management no longer was it a fun place to work. Very sad as it use to be a great company and now they no longer cared about any of their employees.
bad,"A good environment to work in, work there for job experience. The management style was good and also the employees were very friendly. Its a very good insurance company, they deal with family such as health insurance for the family, they do investment in many businesses and retirement plan for elderly."
bad,"Ever changing expectations, processes full of blame in claims department.  Never know when you will be praised or criticized for the same thing.  Never speak up.  Silence is rewarded above all else"
bad,"The opportunity for success is great,... that is, if you have no problem with compromising your principals and playing ""the game."" Most of the management have scraped/clawed their way to the top by playing internal politics and weaseling their way into the best opportunities. Things witnessed include blatant sexism (right out of the 1960s), cronyism, back-stabbing and bullying. Buck the system (as its proponents have defined it), just a little, and you will be managed out."
bad,This workplace had quite a bit of potential if one worked with the right group and the right leaders. The location was great and one can feel the energy.
bad,Co-workers are for the most part great people.  Management takes advantage of employees.  Management has employees relaying incorrect information to clients.
bad,"All your breaks and lunch are timed. You have to clock in and out at those specific times or else you will get into trouble. The managers pretend to be nice, but they only care if you are moving fast through calls. People there are miserable."
bad,Twenty-five hours of OT every busy season; the management team is way to busy to get to now their team and will only talk to you when they have an issue. No advancement opportunities.
bad,"The company is a lot of smoke and mirrors. They promise you opportunities to advance and grow, but it's far from the truth. Management likes cheerleaders, and rebuffs any constructive criticism. Management seems to ok with manual, archaic processes which has put the company behind it's competition. However, now they realize they must do something because of this fact and feel a false sense of grandeur. Older employees hold knowledge close to the vest for their own self-preservation which disallows others to grow and learn. It's very hard to move to other business areas since the company prefers to hire those who will be cheaper with no industry experience. Lots of money is tied up among a largely ineffective hierarchical system of managers. It is a very siloed organization where each area lacks a minimum level of communication to work together to resolve issues. Much of this lack of communication comes down to the ineffectiveness of its leaders which is an underlying theme of the company in general."
bad,"Real talent not recognized. In-house Talent wasted, Management deeply into politics. Flexible working culture, Modern company, same old thought process."
bad,"Typical day at work is very quiet and laid back."
bad,"Lack of support and concern for employees.  Very political with the goals of individuals more important than goals/objectives of the company.  Lots of ""marketing"" on a great place to work and concern for the employees but its does not reflect reality."
bad,"I worked here for 20 months; among other things, I computed severance payments for 350 laid-off employees during that time.  IT infrastructure is back to the 80's (they just came off Lotus Notes!)  "
bad,"Mandatory overtime, good luck scheduling your vacation a year in advance. Very little attention to work/life balance."
bad,"Company was more concerned with getting a good grade for diversity in the workplace, than hiring good leaders. Leader was of no assistance answering questions regarding job and refused to take escalated supervisor calls.  "
bad,"Constantly changing, too many VPs fighting for power and control. Elimination of middle- management. The company wants to operate the cheapest way possible by moving all IT and process relates operations to India. Not enough career advancement opportunities."
bad,"While the salary is good, it does not make up for the lack of good management. There is little opportunity for advancement. The work in monotonous. Old systems make doing your job efficiently difficult."
bad,"the salary is very slow and there is no job security. mandatory overtime during most of the year. the job itself provides some kind of freedom, however they keep most employees as temps and they end their assignment suddenly without previous notice."
bad,"Lots of Politics and not much in the way of good decisons.  It started out well, but I angered the wrong boss and that was it."
bad,"In my last 21 years at the Guardian, I have learned many aspects of how each functional area operates. It has truly been fulfilling. "
bad,This job was more like a production mill. I was harassed and no-one did anything about it.  I did not get the support that I was promised. There was a lot of turn over that was not conveyed to the employees.
bad,"Management was CLUELESS! Local Management seemed to manage based on personal relationships, and favorites,  not employee abilities. Hostile work environment. Hopefully it has improved."
bad,"Leadership gives you absolutely NO GUIDANCE or DIRECTION. They just throw you in, give you a laptop, and leave you to figure it all out on your own. It felt very hostile."
bad,"a typical day at work. I will have to deal with all the client.  there was only 2 people working with me.  Majority of the time all client wants to come to me do their personal auto insurance because the manager take about 30 or more minute just to deal with one customer when you can deal with in customer in less than 10 min. What I have learned is to be very responsible  because when management goes in vacation, I was in charge of open and closing the office and doing deposit for the day.  My co-worker was fun working with one of them. But there is poor management in the office.  the hardest part of the job was dealing with a lot of verbal abuse from the client and the most enjoyable part of the job was receiving  token of appreciation from my clients."
bad,I make sure to be ready and out the door so that I can arrive at work at least 30 minutes before start time. Check to see what tasks/assignments needs to completed that day and the following day.
bad,This environment is very stressful. Every part of your day must be entered into a tracker if it is not been already been tracked in production. You are allotted a specific amount of time to do tasks and given goals that you must meet. By giving such unrealistic expectations the work suffers and it results in a very competitive atmosphere where people will put others down in order to make themselves look good better. Management will write they want you to be open and honest but when you do they are frustrated and it comes back to bite you.
bad,The company in general is fantastic. Beware if your mgr takes a personal dislike to you. You'll be out the door before you know it. I was asked to resign shortly after probation.
bad,No direction - No direction at this place.  There is no sense of direction in this work place.  Most of the information is kept behind doors and employees are advice as  a last minute updates.
bad,"Agent Licensing "
bad,A typical day is sitting in front of a computer a putting in data. This is a job for just someone who wants to do the same thing every day for 5 days straight. This is not a job for someone who needs to do different jobs at one time.
bad,"Stay away if you liked to be used like a work horse. Mandatory overtime that you find out about at the beginning or the next day of the work week. I can only talk about my team, but the team leader was constantly being walked over by lower level staff. No mentoring or advancement opportunities whatsoever."
bad,Company was a wonderful company about the first 15 years and then you were just a number and more worked got put on you with no positive thoughts towards you as a worker.
bad,Guardian does not value education well when it comes to compensation.
bad,"Company lacks moral because it's all work with little engagement or feedback. They sold the company as being a great company to work for because of employee engagement and constant learning. However, the learning come because they are constantly changing procedures and take time to trickle out to the employees."
bad,"learned billing and enrollment of coverage for group life, medical and dental. Managemetn and coworkers were friendly. Hardest part of the job was calling agents to cancel groups for non-payment. Most enjoyable part was working in my team of frieny coworkers."
bad,"The typical joke at the company is that you can ""die at your desk, and no one will notice for a week"". Pace can be slow, upper management constantly changes mind, high turnover"
bad,"Worked with company/employees life insurance,"
bad,Management needed to change that is for sure. Treat others as you want to e treated. Not like a 5 year old. Need to learn how to train and get things straight
bad,This company gets A list performance from C list employees. The culture is quick and hard charging. You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.
bad,Great company but depends on who runs the agency at the executive level. People have been known to leave for another Big Four firm.
bad,Selling of products to help others with their creditors.  billing of the sales of this product.  company is now out of business
bad,Day consisted of processing meeting and or exceeding your daily report goals
good,Management had their favorites.  We were there to work 15 hours of OT each week just so that they could outsource to India!! They cut so many jobs and then built a brand new building with a gym so the lucky favorites who got to stay.
good,Fast pace call center that allowed me to learn about medical insurance and needs of customers.
good,I started as a heart trainee - working there gives valuable work experience but there was little to no chance of advancement. The culture takes some getting used to...the salary was ok and benefits were also ok.
good,"A typical day involves taking requests for proposals from insurance brokers and building employee benefits proposals from the requests in terms of Guardian's  product lines. The hardest part of this job is trying to decipher what the request is for in terms of Guardian's products. The sales aspect of the position plays a part when you use the rating tools to build the proposal, which are based off sales rep preferences in order to help them make a sale. "
good,The work/life balance is not in the corporate standard. I heard several curse word during work time. I would say if you don't care about language then this is the perfect place.
good,This company at the time I was there was very cut throat and all about the numbers. They were very unfair on how they treated their employees.  Some of the managers were not easy to work with.
good,"While management was good and was working to foster the growth of their employees, gearing them to education; many of them resisted. Most of the employees are currently stagnant."
good,Terrible working environtment. I felt i was in high school all over again. People of color were treated differently.
good,"The compensation was negligible compared to how much it cost to get the degree for the job. They expected long hours of work during the fall months, but the work was relatively easy."
good,"The work I did was very lack luster and repetitive daily; therefore, I found it to be a boring job and had to find things to do to stay busy.  I have also never worked at any other job where upper management talked openly about subordinate employees and called them names.  VERY unprofessional."
good,"Not very honest and straightforward. Was told that this is a salaried job, but it's not. Was told that I will be reimbursed for the expenses that I paid upfront, but nothing."
good,"Hired through allied, Guardian was too concerned about their bottom line to be bothered with worrying about whether they retained quality workers. They'd rather hire in india. Mandatory overtime crept over 15 hours at some points."
good,"Not many positive role models. That is, there are examples of successful agents but none I would personally emulate. "
good,"Good work life balance, poor compensation/benefits, lack of career advancement opportunities, too many changes at the senior leadership levels but almost nonexistent at the mid management/staff levels."
good,"Handling inbound calls for the entire shift minus breaks and lunch. "
good,"I did enjoy the kind of work I did there. I did work as a consultant, not being a direct employee, so I can't tell to much about it."
good,"I would work here again if given a chance I liked the company."
good,Flexible work schedule. Company is in transition and many positions are being moved offshore. Corporate culture has changed for the worse.
good,"Learned a great deal during my years with the company and forged lasting relationships.  However, mobility and compensation were difficult issues at best."
good,"High work volume but not mentally simulating."
good,"Profile of company has changed since I worked there.  Good insurance company, but dealing with home office can be tough.  Local General Agent is a tyrant.  But if you are young and thick skinned it can be a solid place to work."
good,Initially when I started I was with the person Interviewed with and we had a great connection. Since I have been here the turnover has been quite high in my Dept and many others including Executive leadership level. I believe they are a company that has a great goal in mind but are still trying to figure out how to get there. A typical day is very energetic and many changes.
good,Very hard work and commission only. You got to be very good at prospecting and selling. I learned some things from making mistakes. I learned that it is wise to scan your prospects as you don't want to waste time.
good,There is no clear direction from PMO and the methods used for project management.  Lack of resources from functional team and ownership from functional teams.
good,"The Plano office hires the most unprofessional, loud mouthed employee's. You deal with mean spirited employees all day that will eventually drive you crazy. Team Leads/Management either care less or don't know how to deal with it. You have to sit and bear it because no one will listen or take your concerns seriously. Management is need of an upgrade."
good,"A typical day would be preparing new business enrollment material, review new business paperwork received, enrollment meetings and administrative meetings.  Resolve billing and claim issues."
good,Productive Company and learned all about Group Insurance. Enjoyed working with others.
good,"They pay you well to keep you, but they won't pay claims for anything! Everything Is pending or no medical necessity. I worked in the call center part for a while and heard all about it and had to tell people that their claim wasn't going to be paid, it was a game to them."
good,"Company needs better management and compensation that competes with the industry. The best thing they had to compete was their pension, but that has been discontinued. Other companies provide much higher salaries for the same work and benefits are now industry standard for the most part, except if you have a child. You get a lot of time off for that whether your male or female"
good,"This company handled  the  work/life  ratio great, I was able to maintain my work requirements while taking care of my sick mother. However it was poor management, that had a huge impact on the decline of my department"
good,"I was a top performer in my position. When the department started to grow, drama increased. Management never addressed the issues and it would continue to spread. A friend of mine had a similar issue in a completely different department."
good,Advancement and compensation were above average. Culture was poor. Work life balance was poor. Culture is improving with new leadership. A lot of advancement opportunities with acquisition activity
good,Guardian is a fine place to work. Flexible work from home policy. Good benefits. Supportive philanthropic area encourages volunteerism and community involvement.
good,"It was a great experience to work there as my first job after receiving my bachelors.  I do wish management provided better training when I first arrived, but being a quick learner I was able to pick things up in no time."
good,It's a 150+ years old company and pretty stable.  I enjoyed working with many bright and talent Managers and peers.  Most of the co-workers that I have with are great and have passion towards what's expected from them.  I have worked with many IT team heads and have contributed for success of many strategic projects.
good,"A typical day begins with multiple emails and calls from clients with immediate deliverable timelines in some cases. Whether it is trying to solve a problem or communicating with the customers, the learning curve never stops as I either learn something new about myself or how to solve a problem using a much quicker method. The hardest part of my job is communicating with rude clients however it brings me job to know that I can listen to their problems and solve it in quickest time possible."
good,I believe in the purpose of life insurance - to provide income replacement for families and businesses when a income provider passes.
good,"Typical day at work includes alot of interaction with co-workers and clients. Processing claims and lodging cheques. Everyday is different and situations pop up regulary which changes the work flow. The hardest part of my job is the overwhelming deadline, and deciding which to do first since everything is urgent. I enjoy my co-workers they are fun to be around and make the environment easier to work in.I am a team player and i do think team work is very important."
good,"*****  A reputable company.  Interesting and fun interactions with staff."
good,"The agencies of the Guardian network are all independent from one another so I can only speak to my experience with one of them in NJ. "
good,"The department manager was not knowledgeable of the depart. She would have 1 on 1 meetiings with us and tell us what we were dojng wrong  & asked if I had any questions. When I did ask her questions, she would not know the answers."
good,The company is decent but you are definitely working hard for your money. The ppl you work with are great. I was very fortunate to sit amongst very positive out going coworkers eager to assist with anything
good,"Guardian Life has a family oriented culture and it is fast paced. On a typical day, you are greeted by your colleagues and hot beverages are served in the morning. Throughout the day, you are communicating with internal and external clients to assist them with whatever concerns they have."
good,Job security dependent on market.  Considerate of employees.Nice to wok for a female CEO who has made enormous progres in changing th corporate culture.
good,"Opening all incoming mail, sort and deliver to proper department. Process incoming check payments. Replying to emails and sorting to proper departments. Printing, logging and forwarding incoming faxes to appropriate departments."
good,"Positive atmosphere where an individual can gain extensive knowledge related to the insurance industry. There are more opportunities for later movement versus advancement. "
good,Never a dull moment. Always very busy. Enjoyed building relationships with various parties including clients and financial advisors. Morale has been pretty bad for the last several years with promises that big changes were going to be coming and things would get better. My co-workers are still waiting for those changes....
good,Prospecting is the life line of the industry and business. Without that there is no business. The financial services industry is in a sense sink or swim. Without support and structure it is very difficult to survive.
good,"My 17 years with the company involved many changes.  The company was behind in technology when I first began working there.  So they worked hard in updating constantly.  Work   procedures changed as technology changed.  The first department I worked in was awesome.  The managers and supervisors were very flexible but also firm with job requirements and employee ethics. We worked hard and enjoyed working together as a team. However I needed a challenge so I bid on a job in another department with similar job requirements and was happy with my new assignment.  As time went on things became changing rapidly again and I adapted to the many changes. During my career at the Guardian I was able to take additional classes to help enhance my skills on the computer and also with system changes and new state and federal regulations in regards to life applications.   The company also provided team meetings to promote a better working relationship with our fellow teammates. Diversity training and Anti-Money Laundering training was mandatory.  We were also provided with the opportunity to take online training which would help us do our job better. The latter years became more stressful as our job description changed.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep several logs to keep track of specific problems while also multitasking answering the phones and required to meet high performance quotas in processing applications.  It almost seemed like we became robots. The typical day was come in, say ""Good Morning"" to the people around your cubical, turn on your computer, work quietly until"
good,Guardian is a excellent place to work. Very customer service focused.
good,Great place to start your career. Learned a lot during my tenure with Guadian. People were always willing to coach and train in areas you need assistance with.
good,It’s a data entry position which is ok but if you have serious illnesses they don’t care. It’s a Corp America job where you are replaced and they don’t care.
good,"As a manager, you are give a good level of flexibility and latitude to grow and learn.  There are some challenges with not having the right level information."
good,Stressful at times fast paced place to work as with any place its the position and your ability to make the position work for you. there are good and bad with any company.
good,Would have been better if the employee did not get 'dinged' for using the define as you go process. Perceived mandated networking was not to my liking either
good,Very customer focused company. Company culture needs improvement. Management at the senior level is too subjective. There is the potential to be a good company.
good,"Analyzed and tested the accuracy of reports created to ensure high quality information is provided "
good,"It's fine. It's a Life Insurance company. There is nothing new happening. Technology is old. Products are old. This is a ""come in, do some work, go home"" environment."
good,"As a company they are excellent, yet in many of their divisions or department, there is a divide. Many teams work or compete against each other. At times this can even be found between the department members themselves. Many have clicks between the departments' individuals. These individuals many times are not receptive to new ideas or new individuals. This issue of not inclusiveness is something that upper management should work on since they are missing from talented individuals that could increase the profits of the company."
good,"Old school insurance company that is trying to keep up with the times.  They are making advances in technology, but their systems don't work well together and there is a culture of each office doing its own thing.  They also tend to hire people for a short term and then lay them off after a couple of years."
good,"I prefer not to comment or review any aspects of my time at the Hudson Financial Group and office of Guardian Life at this time"
good,"I would recommend working there if the culture has changed and is more DIVERSE.  Also, if the salary for people of color matched that of their counterparts."
good,"Provided resources and incentive to work hard, produce and were compensated accordingly. Business unit promoted camaraderie and rewarded intellectual curiosity."
good,"Convenient location, nice office setting. Subsidized                cafeteria. Allowed to work from home at least once per week. Easily assessable by train or bus"
good,The company had good accounting system which every team obtained professional works and ensured accounting processes under corporate policy. Every accounting team members were very friendly.
good,"Work day included a busy agenda - meetings, working on proposals, calling brokers, meeting brokers. Management was not particularly strong in the NY marketplace."
good,"It has been 12 years since I worked at Guardian.  I am not sure what it is like there now.  When I worked there, there were very busy days and then times when things would be slow."
good,"Micromanagement"
good,I think the environment is very welcoming and open however the management team needs help to figure out goals and how to achieve those.
good,good company to work for overall had som e good experiences and some bad experiences but overall it was an ok company to work for. I wish them the best of luck
good,"The work is not hard, and my co-workers are pleasant.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with management, since they are constantly changing workflows and micromanaging, but if you stick it out usually things turn out fine."
good,"Handled insurance claims and filed accordingly in SureQuote system "
good,"Great as a starter job.  New employees do move on to other endeavors.  Great employees.  Great benefits, paid vacations, etc.  Good opportunities."
good,"Traditional corporate environment. Great social programs for staff, company gym, staff events etc."
good,"It was a great experience. The event was well organized and implemented. I enjoyed working apart of a team that was extremely efficient. Apart from all this, there is not much more to say, it was an event."
good,"Worked with amendments & commissions.  Work is very complex due to sending less complex off shore,  Stressful work.  Overtime due to staffing."
good,"Collaborated in the financial systems transition from FAS to Varicent. "
good,Great place to work in terms of rapport with employees. Difficult to be promoted on merits and qualification.
good,"Typical office environment, first shift schedules.  Very customer focused, and production driven.  The one bad thing about Guardian is good is never good enough.  I learned a great deal about account management and insurance in general while working here.  It was also very focused on data entry, accuracy and speed.  In my mind management was a little too pushy, posting the production and quality of each individual employee for all to see, for example.  Co-workers for most part were good to work with, although the amount of production one did in a day could be easily forged, so some employees are directly responsible for the incredibly high production standards.  The hardest part of the job was meeting production standards, and the most enjoyable part of the job was being an account manager and solving complex issues."
good,Strong work relations between long time employees. Plenty of opportunity to work with current technology.
good,First role in Miami after living in Connecticut my entire life.
good,The company is a great company to work for but unfortunately it's managed by all the unqualified managers and executives that make all the incorrect decisions.
good,"Typical day: Mountain of claims, and lots of phone calls to answer.. "
good,Great team atmosphere with senior agents willing to help and joint work opportunities
good,Did not provide opportunity for vertical and horizontal movement in the company. Difficult to network properly.
good,Fun place to work. I enjoyed going to work every day. I enjoyed my coworkers. Wonderful work hours.
good,My typical day was obtaining clients and making investment recommendations.
good,"Interfaced daily with insurance brokers, planholders, sales reps, benefit advisors and plan processors. "
good,"At Guardian the people were good to work for and we got along well.The job was not hard,it was easy going. we all had our own pace,and everything got done on time."
good,"There is a lot to learn at Guardian. Not just in one department but throughout the company as a whole. Human Resources department is always expanding and there opportunity to coross train, you just have to take the initiative to do so."
good,I am working in this company from Jan.2011.It is good growing Retail Pharmacy Chain.I learn a lot in this company.They have a good strategy to do work in this field.They have a big circle of customers.It is reliable pharmacy for customers.I have a good relationship with customers as a store incharge due to the good reputation of the company.I handle 5-6 persons in a pharmacy.I always teach them to give their best to achieve the target.
good,"Opportunity to get involved in a variety of projects, but not the most stimulating culture or environment. Financially stable, hasn't experienced mass layoffs like other financial and health insurance companies. Benefits package and vacation time not very competitive."
good,"Cooking, Managing, saftey, sanitation, was a challenge....but in the end it all worked out"
good,My co-workers are generally nice people. We all get along very well.
good,I along-with team members created environment where we all excelled to take challenges and deliver on our commitments
good,"Here I learned to be a clerical assistant, I did various duties from sorting mail, daily filing and phones. Here I learned the basics of office support."
good,"Good temp job, always lots of opportunity before holidays to get a position. Lots of phone or computer use depending on the job, great team members. A lot of poeple were sent to work from home after the office moved locations."
good,"Overall good company. Onboarding is a busy position bouncing between tasks, systems and cross organizational communication. Worked closely with assigned sales regions from across the country and brokerages that cases were sold through. Time management is key to successful implementation and good working relationships. Time tracking through the company site is a hassle and not always accurate leading to inaccurate scoring of production. This was a common complaint amongst the team as time tracking is part of monthly metrics."
good,Opportunity to learn about life insurance and advance career. Had chance to develop client base independently and had minimal reporting requirements and set own goals.
good,"The culture changed dramatically during my last 5 years - all in an effort to survive the impacts of healthcare reform."
good,The benefits are more than decent and the opportunity to work from home was welcome. It always seemed like priorities were frequently changing and you lived from re-org to re-org.
good,Fun work place when you make it fun. More production oriented rather than quality for the customer. Most enjoyable working with team members and sharing ideas for development. The office started to get thinned out when jobs were eliminated and outsourced which caused worry and stress to others. There was a lot of variety in my job each day which made it not so monotonous and challenging with new tasks and different scenarios daily.
good,"People intelligent and nice.  Might be a good place to work as an employee, but it is not a good place for consultants; contracts are limited to one year."
good,"I liked my co-workers but the job itself literally bored my to tears. And it was difficult to be motivated because almost everyone that was in a hire position was from the outside and they rarely promoted anyone. I wasn't there long so I did not expect one but when I got hired I asked people who were in my position for many years and they told me that there's nowhere to go. Good company if you already have upper management experience because they'll take you over promoting from within. But, you'll probably just stay at that position."
good,Long term employee that has witnessed many changes. Much was done to stay competitive with in health market/health care reform.
good,Creating cost quote proposals for employee benefit plans via RFPs as well as renewals for current clients. Lacked training continuity and continuity in management.
good,"Great office work environment.  flexible work schedules available, great benefits!"
good,Too many layers before getting approval on crucial items. Need to promote within
good,This company gets A list performance from C list employees. The culture is quick and hard charging. You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.
good,"Guardian has a very slow paced, relaxed work environment. Great work life balance but not much career advancement options. Most of the vertical career movement happens at senior and executive level positions. Mid-management and staff level positions do not have much of a growth."
good,"The people I met at Guardian were, without fail, some of the nicest people I have had the pleasure to work with.  While everyone was busy, they took the time to get to know co-workers.  There was an effort to be involved, as a corporation, with local charities and neighborhood events."
good,"A PLACE YOU CAN WORK AT. You learn on the job and experience different aspects of the work. The benefits could be much better and scope of promotion widened. time of work is good hours of work is good, holidays off is a plus"
good,"Every Monday is typical day at work.I have learnt a lot in terms of technologies,behavior,management etc."
good,"nice people to work with, balanced environment. The compensation and benefits are not top notch however the experience gained there will be worth the effort required to get the job done"
good,I have worked here since 2007. I have not had too many opportunities to advance.
good,"I was given a lot of responsibilty and autonomy to get the job done - which I liked. I had a great manager, although not so fun when stressed, but a good guy nonetheless."
good,"Pretty good place to work, excellent benefits (working for an insurance carrier, i would expect them to be). Archaic Corporate Structure, Still working on changes and updates, effort is being made but slow changes. For an industry that requires fast, think on your feet adjustments, they are extremely slow to make adjustments."
good,Was a fine company to work for - the call center environment just wasn't for me but is good if looking for stable hours and a routine everyday - also the cafe was pretty good and subsidized!
good,"Great firm. "
good,"Great work home flexibility.  "
good,"there are i serve  some problems from the company employee,"
good,I liked working for Guardian.I liked the job that I was doing.my job was a variety of responsibiliities and i liked that.it mixed up my day.The management was ok.I learned that I can do anything if I put my mind to it.my coworkers were good to work with.the most enjoyable part of my job was when I was learning something new.
good,This was a start up company which was very busy establishing a new client base.  The office went through its growing pains and everyone in the office were nice people.
good,"Job Culture was good, people were really nice, Management needs little improvement, Compensation/Benefits was ok, Job Work/Life Balance was alright"
good,"I worked here for almost a year.  I was one of the youngest workers there.  I mostly did inputing of customers life insurance applications, answering multi-phone lines, making copies, assisting agents in questions and concerns they had.  "
good,"Great company. I have worked at Guardian since I finished college in 2008.  It is a great company, and I find it is easy to advance job wise, however, pay wise, not so much."
good,"good company and would recommend to others , paid training and very flexible during the training period.  hardest part of the job managing a full case loan"
good,"Need growth in job profile but not got as such , they use employees and than not take them permanent and after 1 year they said , we don't have any vacancy"
good,The product is great but management is not in tune with it's workers.  Been here 11 years and never received a performance review or raise.  Management keeps adding work expecting more.
good,"The Bethlehem Office was a good place to work. Far removed from the corporate headquarters, so mostly a processing center."
good,"Guardian is a great company to work, the life insurance aspect was excellent.  My co-workers and executive are the brightest that I know ."
good,"For the elder and those who want a stable but not reward paying job, this is it for you."
good,"The work was stressful due to end of year processing. The team I worked with was helpful, collaborative, supportive and fun. However the management was sometimes unapproachable and not available to production issues."
good,ok.It is a normal company. Work is OK. you finish the tasks and the mangemnt is fine with it. you sometimes need to put in more efforts but that if fine.
good,Great place to work. Managers are very supportive and understanding. Company values highly influence the employees because you will work with a great group of people
good,"Team environment, Flexible work hours, ability to work remotely,ability to multi task and take on new and differing types of workloads and cases"
good,"very high intensity call center, dealing with upset often angry people. trouble shooting claim issues and resolving client issues"
good,"Good place to start a career. It allows you to meet people, plan in advance, allow you to be your own boss and effectively put proper time management to effective use."
good,"When I first joined I was grateful to have my job. It was a great organization to work for, though not really my speed because if was very formal. I left the company because I moved out of state and the commute became too much, but also I left my manager."
good,My experience was there was not a work/life balance. I worked remotely and was under daily deadlines. The work load routinely required 60-70 hrs per week.  The company is a good company overall. I found the people to be talented.
good,very busy and focus. fast paced environment. be prepared to use alot of math skils. growth environment. offers room for growth-can be a great place to refine your skills.
good,"The company is very flexible with scheduling, vacation time, sick time.  It has good benefits.  The managers have been fantastic to work with.  The option to work from home full time is very nice for selected positions."
good,"On a typical day I would come to work and process pre-implementation forms.  It was pretty straight forward and easy even though there were a lot.  I really enjoyed and respected my manager, Rachyl.  But at the end of the 4th quarter rush they no longer needed our team and let us go.  I was disappointed that I had forged positive relationships with my coworkers and leaders from multiple departments but could not continue with the company."
good,"Full commission.  Own your own business.  Great training.  Great company to work for.  Put a good deal of money back into the community.  Mentorship program was ok.  It is what you make of it."
good,Nice and professional environment. I've been working from 6 months as a contract. I really like the office culture and the people. I got a big exposure to improve my skills and network.
good,"My job was temporary for the summer but I loved it. I worked a lot of hours, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. My coworkers were so lovely and my manager was great at communication. I was able to go on vacation very easily. I just wish they didn't cut my department."
good,"OK place to work, given the opportunity to succeed and build on integrity and experience. Guardian provides a platform for growth and future growth. Support  educational growth and a fun place to work."
good,"Progressive disability products, one of the best whole life products with many options geared to professional clients. Good marketing plan, lots of support, training."
good,Enjoyed working for the company. I was taught about the industry on levels State Farm could not.  I acquired some really great clients and was very successful.
good,"Productive and fun work place. GLIC and its subsidiaries are committed to protecting individuals, business owners and their employees with life, disability income insurance, Dental, 401(k), annuities and other financial products protecting more than six million employees and their families at 115,000 companies. Worked as a BA and QA for a new producer and agency administration system called OTTO"
good,it is enjoyable to work at Guardian Life Limited. i have learnt alot while working there. i have grown tremendous as an individual and i am grateful for the opportunity to have worked there.
good,"Company values and culture were excellent. Along with benefits and wages.   "
good,"I worked for Guardian since May of 2010. Its a tremendous opportunity to work with such a client for long duration.   "
good,It's a growing company with great benefits.  The new building in Bethlehem is state of the art and has many perks for the employees.
good,Guardian provides an excellent work life balance.  The executive leadership team at Guardian is focused on moving the company into more up to date technology platforms and delivery.
good,Great company to work for.  I would refer a friend to work for them.  They are a very fair and ethical company to work for. I enjoy working for them.
good,Always learning and variety on the job makes it interesting . Ability to move to various parts of the company for different job positions.
good,"- great learning experience"
good,"Guardian is a good company to work for in terms of having a work/life balance. The company often offers ""extras"" like on-site blood donation, mammograms, and wellness seminars. The company is slow to embrace technology (still using Lotus Notes in 2015). Career advancement opportunities are often only available outside of your current department, which can be challenging, but the opportunities are there."
good,Guardian ensures that each employee's role is aligned with the corporate strategy.
good,Guardian was a great employer.  Always willing to go the extra mile for employees.  Great learning environment and great people.
good,"Pleasant enviorment"
good,"I learned coworkers can be jealous if you are in demand by clients, therefore you will be the first to be laid off!."
good,The people I worked with were always friendly and helpful. The company as a whole is good and gives back to its employees. I would recommend Guardian.
good,The project was intense - there was a lot of scrutiny and attention on the project; the company culture is one of collaboration and achievement; there is a driven focus and at times this is to the detriment of the employees and engaged team members - there are a lot of sacrifices that are made in the interest of completing projects.
good,"A day in the job would start at 8 :30 am. going through insurance case files and reorganising or editing information on our systems. Companies insured by guardian would send new workers files every week to be added to the system so they can get health benefits and protection if something were to happen to an employee. "
good,Great respect for my direct supervisor.  Although not many opportunities available for training or career advancement in the administrative role.  Culture clash with more tenured staff.
good,"I became part of quite a workplace community at Guardian.  We had a step-a-thon for which I was the captain of a team.  Our team did quite well.  I made some lasting friends there.  The work was difficult, but fair.  I felt as though I made an impact there."
good,"It varied by day, mostly call center. Locked to the phones daily. Gave claim information to patient on how it was paid and what they would owe. Gave benefit information to Dental offices."
good,"Good company, changing culture is leading to uncertainty. technology is undergoing massive changes. Otherwise, new senior management is introducing some progressive ideas."
good,Overall Guardian is a great company to work for. The work life balance is very flexible. The Work From Home opportunity is a huge plus. The workplace culture is average. It depends on who your manager is. If you have a great manager then the chances for you to grow is great.
good,"I think it was a great place to work; however,  if you can prove excellence in your knowledge and consistent client relationships you must be certain to consistently excel in all your stats and their values month over month. If you miss your goal you only have a month or two to recover leaving you with a stat of either mediocre or not meeting. It’s easy to overlook one while trying to keep what may seem like the heavier weighted stat looking amazing but both can be done."
good,"In my particular profession, there isn't a ""typical"" day at work - which is actually very good. You work as long as is needed ( into late evening if necessitated). It's a fast-paced, very competitive environment - - especially when you're competing against 12 -  14 other professionals on your Retirement Income Specialist team who are also charged with meeting sales goals & objectives. Perhaps one of the hardest parts of the job is staying on ""top of your game"" every day. Think of it as being on stage all day for a Broadway show performance. You must be very knowledgeable, have passion & conviction. You must also be resourceful and able to come up with creative ideas & strategies.  "
good,"Guardian Life no longer sells or processes medical claims. "
good,"I really respect Guardian as a company but the new management here in Denver has no idea what he's doing. Very disappointing, I would have stayed but he's running the business into the ground and frankly, is putting his attention on all the wrong things."
good,"When I worked here, I was a temp so I never got the full experience of being a true employee. But that being said it was still a nice place to work and the people were friendly."
good,Includes multiple skills of  communications and excel skills. you earn a well amount of knowledge about the insurance industry as well as multiple computer programs. The hardest part about the job was dealing with incomplete or change of guidelines on daily basis.
good,"Day to day work environment was good. In later years with the company in my position, project completion dates became unrealistic.  The unrealistic completion dates required a great deal of work outside office hours."
good,"Overall good boss but lots of hostility among top management. Good learning and advancement opportunities abound. OK with workload and deadlines, friendly coworkers."
good,"Not a great CEO"
good,Management was great! Geared towards improving their teams. Good benefits and employee cafeteria. Easy commute  and great looking offices.
good,Co-workers are teamplayers  to get the job completed on a timely basis.  A typical day can be busy with clients inquiries.
good,"Great team of people that support each other as we service brokers and clients."
good,Guardian is currently going through many changes on a corporate level.  The hardest part of a manager is instilling the new culture into the long tenured employees.
good,"Quick leadership change resulted in larger workload and more pressure from the start.  Great company overall, unfortunately my multiple leadership changes made it a hard environment to succeed."
good,Company has undergone a lot of changes over the years. It has embraced SAFE/AGILE wholesale and is seeking to leverage technology to get a business edge.
good,The work environment is laid back and professional. A typical day at work consisted of making calls to potential clients and setting up face to face meetings in order to present options to help them achieve their financial goals.
good,The general atmosphere was pleasant and I liked my job. I didn't see room for advancement. Of course there are many different positions so maybe there was room or advancement in their positions.
good,This is a good place to work and have a career.  I spent a large part of my career at Guardian and was promoted within through out my career. Great benefits
good,"I did a summer tech internship at guardian life. Through a series of mishaps I was the only intern in a department that I did not have the technical knowledge of, nor the one I applied for. This put me in an awkward position where the department seemed too busy to help me, and there were no other interns for me to speak with. Eventually I found some others working in software development, which is much more in line with my abilities and they seemed to enjoy the job a lot. So I guess it really depends on where you work in the company."
good,"A typical day at work starts about 8:00 am with making  approximately 20 calls to get at least 4 appointments per day.    Ideally I will meet with at least 3 prospective clients per day with a view of closing  at least one sale per day.  The day also entails client servicing, which includes policy delivery and account monitoring to prevent account lapses."
good,"This a good company to work for, they offer great benefits and good pay. However, there is a lack of job security within some of the departments. heir On-boarding department is consistently innovating and most of the data are automated, so withing the next 2 years, they may eliminate this department completely."
good,"There were always opportunities to apply your skills, learn new and interesting aspects of the business and advance over time. Day-to-day management allowed you freedom to perform your role effectively but was goal driven and planned to help you and the company succeed."
good,The office is very professional and it's a pleasure to come to work every day. There is always some one available to help with any issues that arise. It is a very friendly office.
good,"Guardian Life Insurance is fast paced and growing rapidly. It's a great place to begin a career. They offer work from home, and advancement in the company."
good,"Modern, state of the art work facility."
good,Review about the guardian pharmacy is as i have joined as a fresher in the guardian and gained good experience and knowledge got a promotion and i have become a store manager with a 20 members in a team.
good,Appreciated working with knowledgeable professionals and learning from peers. Company consists of various business units that all come together for the common goal of Guardian principles
good,"Call atleast 20-50 prospects daily. Go to 3-5 appointments where we discuss clients situation, 5 years goals. Do this to see if our products and services meets the need of future clients. Keep intouch with existing clients.Refresh our knowledge through training tools."
good,Typical large insurance company office.  The workload was very specialized with little flexibility - little room for growth or development.
good,"nice place to work.  lots of integrity, very customer oriented.  several daily functions, so its not a boring job.  good benefits."
good,"Each day was always busy. Reviewing applications, following up with issues, assisting co-workers. The best part was learning something new everyday."
good,Working with our partner insurance agencies was rewarding and demanding - they gave us their best and deserved nothing less when it came to their incentive programs.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Guardian. They treat their employees extremely well and support you the best they can. My only complaint is with the LTD case management job itself. The training program was 6 months of intense classroom style training. Keeping of with the work demand felt impossible and they couldn't train new case managers fast enough to lighten the workload. I stayed as long as I did because I adored the culture and the people I worked with, but ultimately it was not the job for me."
good,"Great company and culture, workload is stressful. Technology is severely lacking. Extensive training builds strong foundation for case management. Average caseload 100 per month."
good,"Be prepared to take back-to-back calls from dentists and clients. Your lunch is a short half hour. You will take anywhere from 40-60 calls per day. They evaluate your calls, and you will have weekly meetings."
good,Guardian Life Insurance Company is a company on the cutting edge of technology which is best used to serve their customer's needs. Through my 12 years at Guardian I have worked in 5 different roles and expanded my knowledge of the organization vastly.
good,"I liked working at guardian. It was a good working environment, and I met and worked with some very good people there. Would have liked a shot at management tho.."
good,"Fresh out of university, I was hired as a clerk in the Employee Benefits Division.  Within a year, I was considered and promoted to the Information Technology Division.  I learnt a lot about technology and teamwork, user support and administration here."
good,"I was a consultant there and I enjoyed working there."
good,"This is a good place to work.  They offer a full range of benefits ranging from Healthcare, vision, dental, vacation days, sick days, etc."
good,I left Guardian only because I felt that my job was at capacity and the department would soon be outsourced. I needed to learn more and transferred to a different side of the benefits platform by taking a job with a broker.
good,Guardian's ability to keep employees informed and aware of additions to the organization are amazing. Wonderful communication platforms and points of contact
good,This company is very supportive and has decent hours. My colleagues were very supportive and gave me opportunities to develop and grow. I also got a lot of autonomy and was able to do work that made a difference.
good,You must be adaptable to change and able to get multiple projects done very quickly. A quick learner and someone who is patient and solution driven would be perfect for this position.
good,Guardian life insurance company is very fast pace and lot of opportunity to learn and grow career wise. there is an opportunity to build network as well.
good,Focus on short term results rather than long term effectiveness for an underserved region of the country. In a geographic region of over 1.7 million residents and rapidly growing
good,"07:00 PM Start of 12 hr night shift. Check for special processing for the night. Check for outstanding work left from day shift. Monitor batch cycle for failures and take corrective action to resolve problems to allow cycles to process to meet morning deadline so system is available to daytime processing."
good,"The company develops various insurance products for the customers. Our team was involved in the automation of several modules such as claims system, broker system, finance system. Testing both the positive and negative flow testing and running the tests on jenkins for the build and release was our major task"
good,"I enjoyed the variety that the job offered. I was constantly busy, especially during 4th quarter.  I learned working with the sales representatives the importance of providing inside as well as outside customer service.  We really worked hard together to get the job done, and was awarded Office of the Year on more than one occasion."
good,"I worked for the Guardian for over 25 years. The employees and the company was wonderful to work for, until about 3 to 4 years ago when they decided to outsource our position. "
good,For 16 years of working at the company all the team I was working with had a very tight relationships. It really helped to achieve the highest quality level of system performance.
good,"In this position, I learned so very much.  There was an intense training time which taught various medical situations... dental, medical, life, short term and long term coverage's.  My position was to assist HR Departments, Sales Agents, and Brokers with enrollments, terminations, waiting periods, and all types of things associated with an individual's coverage."
good,"Well, a typical work day starts off with scanning of documents and that is continued throughout the entire day, doing this overtime one become more familiar with the industry and it operations , As it relates to management they look out for the overall well being of their employees and see to it that all the resources needed  for them to perform are provided efficiently. My co-worker are friendly and we try our best to maintain a spirit unity among one another by sharing among ourselves, the hardest part of the job is preparing the document and the most enjoyable part is scanning the document."
good,"is a friendly working environment, the co-workers are great"
good,"Learned a lot about financial  plan  under cooperation with co-workers."
good,"Great look into the day to day activities of the treasury environment."
good,Good place to work. Co workers and management where very nice I liked the training. You wont be thrown to the wolves without proper preparation.

The most enjoyable part of my job at Guardian was assisting in closing the sale with groups and providing them with excellent service."
good,"Guardian was a fun workplace. Even though the days were hectic and busy, we were like one big happy extended family. My co-workers are still a part of my family today."
good,"Guardian's training department has an incredibly awesome reputation throughout the company and I'm proud to be a part of it. I have learned so much about our products, our customers (America's employers) and the hard-working people (colleagues) who support our business. Management allows me to work independently, yet provides direction and guidance when I need or request it."
good,"Guardian is a fun place to work. Flexible work/life balance and lots of room to work remotely. Teams are small, but flexible. New New York Office is Modern and a great place to work."
good,I was lucky enough to work with some of the best sales people I have ever met.  Guardian was a company that let the entrepreneurial spirit grow and flourish.
good,The work/life balance is the best part about working for Guardian. The Sr. leadership has a great vision for the company but execution lower down in the chain needs more thought and strategic thinking.
good,"The work was stressful due to end of year processing. The team I worked with was helpful, collaborative, supportive and fun. They liked to try new things to eat such as various Oreo and M&Ms flavors."
good,"I recommend this company to anyone looking for a culture that nurtures its people, cares about them, and is also serious about delivering the goods."
good,"Excellent work place and benefits.Wonderful benefits package, competitive salary and generous exit package. Wish the management was more understanding in choosing who they eliminate, sometimes it's the team the suffers rather than the company, but overall great people and wonderful place for work/life balance."
good,Learned to collaborate with my peers on a daily basis. Most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and talking with co-workers. The hardest part of my job is when I have to explain to a customer why a claim was denied for their Dental or any other service because I know how frustrating that is being on the other side. Management is phenomenal.
good,A productive place to work where I learned much about the insurance industry. Management had considerable expertise which led to positive outcomes. there were numerous opportunities for learning as well as building relationships with field personnel. The main challenge was maintaining a heavy workload at times. The benefits were competitive as well as generous.
good,I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a stable career with room for growth.  The team leaders and management are very knowledgeable and there to help whenever needed.  The family like environment makes for great team moral and overall a positive attitude on a daily basis.
good,Most management was great to work with. It is a larger company who cared to much about the bottom line and not the customer at times.  co workers are supportive
good,"My manager was accessible, helpful and always striving to advance her team members. Hours were moderately flexible, and the company offered great benefits. Although I was in a temporary position, I would highly recommend a position like this to others. They're also expanding, so there's room to grow within your profession at Guardian."

good,"There is a lot of information to learn about the different products, services, and systems that Guardian uses. If you are looking for a job for the first time, this is not the place you'd want to be at. There is a lot of information to absorb, and not a whole lot of time to do it in. However, the training staff and management are wonderful to have on your side to help you with any questions you may have."
good,"Guardian is a great place to work. There are a few bad apples in the bunch including my manager at the time. She was unskilled and showed favoritism to the ones who kissed her behind. The ones that were outspoken about how unfair and unskilled she was were labeled as bad apples including myself.

Management was helpful, encouraging, and understanding. Any complaints were with the agency, not with Guardian itself. The only reason I left is because it was not a field I was particularly interested, and it didn't fit my long-term goals."
good,A typical day at work is a little hectic but doable.  I learned to be assertive and deal with conflicts with a win/win situation typically.  The management and my co-workers are very diversified and respectful of the differences of all of us.

good,"Working at a CSR at guardian life has its highs and lows. The company is great, its always pushing for its staff to advance or make lateral movements to see where they would best fit in. Starting as a CSR, you are lowest on the totem pole. You are the front line rep that has to handle requests and inquiries from customers who are clients and agents alike. This is where the job will make or break anyone.  Guardian does its best to train on products that is had and its procedure. They do a great job of that. What they dont do is get you ready for the complex questions that will arise when you deal with agents and clients.Many clients and agents already have a low amount of patience as is and you have to be their punching bag.  Its the life of a CSR. You will have to rely on your team mates and materials to answer even the most complex of questions. Policy holders and agents will be the main source of your stress and will help you decide if you want to stick with company or not. They expect you to pretty much self manage while taking calls. You need to be great at multi tasking and time management.  This means type type type away while you are on the phone so you dont have an over abundance of cases before you leave.  If you do stick with company, they offer great benefits and career advancement. They really do push this and push for development. This is the biggest plus to me while working here. Management wants to see you succeed in general. If you do decide to work here as a CSR rep, it will be challenging but you will be fulfilled at the end when you move out of the contact"
good,Company's position training is best in field. Very customer focus. Opportunity for unlimited overtime. Management dispositions vary within department's.
good,"Guardian provided me with the tools I needed to make my job successful, I have no bad comments to say about them. Opportunities are a dime a dozen and the culture is very relaxed."
good,"They have unreasonable quality goals. In the insurance industry, rules and regulations are ever-changing, so it is difficult to keep up with that. One small mistake could mean you receive a failing grade for that month and it is near impossible to get back to a passing quality score. "
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with at Guardian, but I found it hard to sell something that most people believe they have enough of.  I prefer selling tangible products, then trying to convince someone that they need more of something they already have, or don't think they need."
good,"Overall a great company to work for. However, on going mandatory OT which causes a little conflict with work / life balance"
good,"Great company to work for, I was just a little to old to start all over. I would recommend it to a young person out of college."

good,"Great opportunity, completed my internship with Guardian life and had a really enjoyable time. My manager was great and I was given a large amount of freedom to work on what I wanted."
good,"""We do the right thing"" is one of the companies guiding principles - and I feel they give it much more than lip service. Management is generally strong and competent - there are certainly exceptions but I would say Guardian stacks up well against any company in that regard. Technology is very good and there are many work-from-home opportunities."
good,Guardian Life of America is an excellent place to work at with cutting edge technology and great work ethics. Great people and great work environment.
good,"Over 17 years, I witnessed Guardian go through many transformations, but none faster than the last 3 years. Job security is at an all-time low because the Senior Management is truly evaluating and adjusting/cutting positions that they believe no longer add value. Definitely can't fault them for doing this, but it's uncomfortable when you are not the one calling the shots."
good,"Appreciate the flexibility employees had to manage appointments and work without utilizing vacation."
