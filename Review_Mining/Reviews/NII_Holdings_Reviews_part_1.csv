good,"I began to work for Nextel/NII back in 2000 in Brazil. I worked as a field technician and when I graduated  Engineer I was promoted to an Engineer position in São Paulo (one of the biggest city in the world). In 2010 I moved with my family to USA to work at NII, which is the Nextel  Headquarter. That was a great opportunity to work in a different culture. My co-workers were very friendly since the beginning and the management team were great. I learned about Operational Standards and Guidelines and  how to perform a Network Capacity planning for 5 different markets, including; Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Mexico. The hardest part of the job was get agreement between 5 markets, but I can personally say that I did a very nice job on it. The most enjoyable part was an experience to work with a large variety cultures among those markets and USA."
