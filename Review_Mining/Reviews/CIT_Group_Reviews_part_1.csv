rating,review
bad,Its not what experience you have its who you know and how you look. Management always changing.   I had 16 Team lead all within who knew Management.  Linfs hours did not care about family life.
bad,Terrible Company. Office Politics. Poor Pay for the work they ask of you. Complete garbage especially their Portsmouth NH business. They promote dumb ignorant managers who lie through their teeth. They typically give a 1% raise if you are lucky but to be honest they screw over A TON of people and they have A LOT of unhappy workers. There is very high turnover. DO NOT BUY IN OR DRINK THIS KOOL AID. BAD BAD BAD COMPANY. Don't waste your time with an application or interview even.
bad,"Given a choice, go elsewhere."
bad,"Die Firma CIT sucht eher günstige Handwerker und Bau Fachkräfte und sollte das bei ihrer Stellenausschreibung so vermerken. Die Tage laufen eher Chaotisch ab da man nur am hin und her springen ist und keine Arbeit wirklich beenden kann. Anweisungen kommen aus mehreren Richtungen, so das die Aufgabe des Ziels komplett verändert wird. Gelernt habe ich das man als Angestellter nichts wert ist.Das Management ist aggressiv, beleidigend und weiß nach 5 Minuten nicht mehr was es gesagt hat."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work, been through many transitions and moved under management that has no idea how certain segments of the company works. Expectations including unattainable goals and projects. Overstaffed in some areas and understaffed in others. No uniformity across the recently merged companies. Preferential treatment to those who do not have enough work for an 8 hour day and treat employees who go above and beyond working 10-15 hour work days horribly. Pay is inconsistent and pay those with less responsibility more than those with education and extensive work experience."
bad,"Do not go to CIT, the company is in flux, across the board downsizing. Benefits are not great, they cut the 401k Company match. The area I was in was poorly managed and very in efficient, it was not a great place to be."
bad,"unpleasant work experience, poor management and new hiring process; disrespectful co-workers; lack of leadership and support; lack of training and information sharing."
bad,Company overall there is no communication from management.
bad,"Catty and disrepectful employees, management keeps changing ideas and processes, they let employees run the show.  Managers don't fully support newer employees with advanced skill sets. Mundane work."
bad,Management has no idea what/who is doing the actual work within the various functions. I have seen multiple people get promoted into roles in which they were completely overwhelmed.
bad,Micro-managers; during your interview you are not informed that your position requires constant phone calls to numerous clients and vendors along with tremendous amount of emails you have to answer to.  Management only cares about meeting their own numbers and will blame you even if you meet your own quota.  There are a lot of wonderful teammates but horrible management.  Not enough pay for workload; great benefits though.
bad,The work culture is very dangerous there as everyone is out to blame others.  They do not value their employees especially when they gave everything to the company by traveling weekly to an out of state office.  Very stressful place to work.
bad,"Worked on contract for a year and 9 months..Never missed a day of work, was never late and never asked for any days off.  A job position came open and another person was selected even though she is not fluent in English and her emails have to proof read by another team member before being sent out because she can not put sentences together in English.  When calls are needed to make for repair on transport machines again another team member has to do the work and make the call because she doesnt understand alot of words spoken in English.  Management is AWFUL!! I can not stress this enough however the job is very flexible and again managment does not pay attention to anything that is going on.  Weekend work is great because you come in as you please and do as you please. Even though you are hired to work certain hours the people I work with come dragging in when they want.   You can go to break or lunch whenever and however long you choose because again management has no concerns.  Never have I seen  a company  like this.  It is almost too good to be true as long as you can deal with a manager that lies and covers things up.  When a higher up manager comes down from upstairs we are told before hand to make sure we put all contraband in an empty trash can under our desk before they get here.  HR is a complete joke and takes nothing serious for their employees.  So much stuff is hidden and covered up so the top dogs do not see. You will never have advancement unless you were here first.  The positions that open up are for temps that have been here the longest . IT HAS NOTHING TO"
bad,company has no loyalty to employees. management is very poor on development and direction
bad,Fast paced call center. Repetitive tasks. Major changes in job position on occasion w/o any monetary or other compensation. Decent pay and benefits still not enough to balance out the negatives.
bad,"This company rarely promotes from within. The management let go around 25% of people, gave the remaining people their work and a lot of new projects in addition to what it was before and basically does not care when and how the employees will do it. It is a sweatshop with terrible managers. Most of the managers are good specialists but have no social skills which makes it very difficult working with them."
bad,A typical day consists of reviewing other people's paperwork and then being called out in meetings for having missed an occasional detail.  Managers have no sense of the actual work being done by their reports and think they can cajole them into success.  It does not help that team members are happy to report on each other behind their backs.
bad,"CIT provides an opportunity to learn corporate finance of unique products. As the company is relatively small, the jobs can be quite varied which if you like variety in the work day, this would be for you. Management could be more decisive in both decisions and direction for their employees to be more efficient and effective."
bad,"The utter lack of professionalism and common decency at the Jacksonville branch of CIT makes me deter any possible candidate from taking a job there.  Unless you have an extremely high ranking role (Director or higher), stay away."
bad,"Management does not support needs of employees - pay rates below average - NO opportunities for advancement, because no one leaves until retirement - as there is no where else to go in town."
bad,"Good company for beginners entering into the work environment, such as high school or college graduates; however, very little advancement for seasoned employees looking for career growth."
bad,Management is more focused on growing the business than supporting staff. Turnover of highly qualified employees is high. No career growth opportunities or paths.
bad,I started as a regular team member and worked my way to this position in less than 3 years I was vey excited to see the options this company had for me to grow. After losing my mentor the position seemed stagnate and I reached for higher goals.
bad,"Struggling to find its way. Morale is very low. Management transition is generally an opportunity, but current management still needs to find its groove and convey a sense of purpose and excitement. Pay lip service to customer focus. Employees seem to be losing faith, and cultural reinvigoration is needed."
bad,Enjoyed problem solving and interacting with the customers.
bad,not at this time due to employment repercussion of my 11 years with this company. Have seen extremely talented employees be looked over and eventually left the company.
bad,"The company was undergoing dramatic change while I was there. Very bureaucratic. Budget process and ability to do projects severely limiting. Big on reporting but not on execution and achieving results. Compensation was fine. Culture seemed a bit disjointed. Not sure what they wanted to become (bank, online presence, lease/loan company)."
bad,"The busiest time at the job is August, September and October. The Federal and some state tax returns are due. "
bad,"Company is in disarray."
bad,"A typical day at work is pretty diversified, demanding and filled with many facets of administrative work for C-Level Leaders.  Extenstive internanational travel, calendar management, processing Visa/Passports, scheduling meeting/webcasts/videoconferencing, etc.  Screening telephone calls, greeting visitors, guests and business partners. Managing highly confidential and sensitive information, processing expense reports, invoices and purchase requisitions.  "
bad,"joined CIT bank to build out the franchise restaurant group. former GE capital colleagues hired me to come on board and execute senior debt transactions for multi-unit franchisees. CIT paid well and allowed me to work remotely. however, CIT had the worst culture and management that I've experienced to date. teams are not resourced adequately and management is incompetent."
bad,"A company with a very routine-based mentality with a lot of emphasis on how things have been done historically instead of thinking outside the box in order to get things done more efficiently and with better trackability for subsequent years. Learning and training is encouraged and even mandatory which is a plus, and benefits work-skill application.  Management needs to be more aware of work-load and deadlines for employees.  Most of the workload would be lessened from year to year if management allowed for process-improvements during the year, particularly through the use, enhancement, training, and importance placed on automated technology.  The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, stems from the workplace culture itself.  Too much secrecy and favoritism which leads to mistrust and working in fear.  There should be more emphasis on developing and encouraging employees.  Some of the more enjoyable aspects of working at CIT are the end of year party which CIT throws for employees where the effort for rewarding employees of the company as a whole is very evident. CIT also encourages employees to participate in many volunteer programs and in giving of charities to those who really need it and everyone gets an opportunity to give. "
bad,"Can't remember much about the place. The environment was always quiet and stressful. No one ever smile, nor left their desk even for lunch. A constant fear loomed.."
bad,old regime needs to admit defeat and retire. Company needs to find direction. Structure is too top/middle heavy with mediocre talent.
bad,It was a good experience. Work hours were flexible. Overall strategy is missing
good,"Very demanding, requires 10 hours a day, six days a week. Very little support from upper management. supervisors not trained for their role and not willing to."
good,"When I was there, there was no job work/life balance.  They worked you to the bone.  Environment can be hostile at times.  They slowly trimmed down on many benefits."
good,Employees are very dedicated to getting the job done but not working collaboratively.  High expectations but no training/mentorship programs available.
good,Not a good atmosphere to learn and grow. Management encourages to do new things but cant expect appraisals and benefits. No allowances and increments as well.
good,"This company has good pay and benefits, but I do not see much room for advancement and growth. There are probably more opportunities elsewhere just not at this location."
good,"It is good company but bad experience with termination process."
good,I spent most of my day prospecting new businesses who needed our software. I made sales calls and mostly transferred them to our salesmen in Seattle.
good,I've learned to work in a high stress environment.  The majority of the employees I've worked with over the years are professional and friendly.  Management is not supportive of growth opportunities
good,Moral is low across the company. Management needs to value its employees and work on obtaining top talent and retaining the good talent they have in the company.
good,"The Jacksonville office had a unique business atmosphere with a select group of people who"
good,"A common theme at CIT amongst those that have been there for more than a few years; if you made it past your first mental break, and you're still there you'll be able to last. "
good,"Poor management and few opportunities for advancement. However, the transactions available provided great well-rounded experience within my selected field."
good,"Great balance and flexibility of work/life. However, constant threat of being laid off, minimal advancement and raise/bonus has been flat for years.  Morale is low.  Management doesn't seem to care."
good,"Management at the Pasadena Office is very unreasonable when it comes to deadlines.  Management does not care about personal engagements, they just care that you are at work and on call 24/7.  Management has no respect for its employees."
good,"laid back fun environment co-workers were great money was great.Loved working here this job taught me so much about finance, auditing and laws of lending."
good,If you are looking for a company to develop and mentor you.  This is the wrong place for you.  There are no  training manuals you just have to figure it out.
good,Met many great people and provide opportunities to learn. The firm is going through constant management and headcount turnover. This added to the volatility of work culture since management direction and long term plans kept changing. I did received support to take on new projects and my team was one of the best to work with.
good,"The people that work at CIT are highly skilled, educated, and overall smart. You can expect to work large amounts of overtime, especially at the end of the month and the end of the year. Most of the managers are highly capable and a pleasure to work with."
good,Management seeking a direction for future. Changes occuring that still need to be determined
good,Prior to the company's backrupty CIT was better place to work. There was room for advancement and raises and bonuses were better. The management seems to be unconcerned with the fact that many of the best people are leaving to find better jobs for more money and less hours. A typical day can be from 9 - 12 hours. Managment seems to feel that this is standard and does not require compensation.
good,CIT use to be a non-bank financial company but has become a bank as of 2008 and acquired another bank in recent years. The company has become more bureaucratic in recent years because of the requlations around a bank. The company has sold off all foreign operations in recent years. There is high turnover in recent years do to lower than average pay and lack of career trajectory. Because of the mid size there are opportunities to learn more than if you were at a large bank.
good,"Old line finance company converting to Bank "
good,CIT is a nice company. Structure was not strong when employed with them
good,The company has been good to me over the years but they are selling my division and letting me go.
good,The days go by quickly because there was always work to be done. I learned how to listen to work related problems and work to find a permanent solution to the problem.
good,"Work/Life Balance was not as good for my team as it is for others."
good,I had a good manager who stretched my team and tried to develop us in good ways.  The company itself was constantly undergoing layoffs and everyone felt insecure. Few agreed with the direction it was headed.
good,"I was hired to complete a specific task for CIT, which was completed successfully.  While I was employed, there was a lack of direction and vision, however, senior leadership has turned over completely since then.  Hope all is well now!"
good,"Poor management, Staffing in certain areas are very thin which leads to long hours, projects not meeting deadlines and low morale among employees"
good,"It's a difficult enviornment because the company came out of bankruptcy and setting strategy was difficult.  The organization needs to build low cost funding but the direct strategy to do so is not always clear."
good,"CIT originally was very employee supportive with training and benetits."
good,Work environment is very unstable but co-workers is what makes the job OK.
good,"Management has done a phenomenal job in turning around the company since bankruptcy. Unfortunately, there are limited opportunities for advancement. Furthermore, the culture is very old school. There are many employees who are used to performing one function and working 9-5. Those that are more ambitious, end up taking the bulk of the work load at the same compensation."
good,"What is that saying or how does it go? If you don't have anything nice to say about someone, don't say anything. that about sums it up. I have nothing to say about the company"
good,Constant change and relatively chaotic - had multiple businesses but not many opportunities for mobility.  Very siloed and limiting for career advancement.
good,"Good Commute from home in NJ"
good,Worked in customer service. The pros with working with the company was getting a paycheck.  Received yearly bonuses if that is what you call it.  Managers micro managed each other.  Even had to watch your back with team workers. The was only I in TEAM.  Managers are great at bringing you down nothing ever positive.
good,The company filed for BK back in 2012 so there is still some lnigering turmoil. if you want to know more then you should apply and ask questions.  Otherwise good luck
good,"I would mainly work a the front desk as a receptionist along with computer work."
good,Had a great time working there but the company fell apart due to the collapse of the mortgage industry in 2006/2007.  The ended up closing down the subprime mortgage division.
good,"CIT Bank is a great company to gain experience. There is a lack of career growth, which can be discouraging. The atmosphere is relaxed, and they offer a work life balance."
good,"Was given the opportunity to become a Funder for CIT after"
good,Work hard but unfortunately you don't get compensated. The middle management is good but the company has no clear direction. Lots of sell offs and layoffs. Small bonus and raise.
good,"Did not stay at CIT long enough to really form an opinion.  The salary and bonus were very good compensation for the area.  However, the technology environment left a lot to be desired."
good,Good place to work. some opportunities to learn different positions at times. Always busy.  Flexible with hours and family friendly.
good,"pues como este trabajo era  en campo  disfrutaba el intercambiar  comunicacion con personas"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job at CIT is the team that I work with each day.  The group has seen many changes over the past few years, but continue to work together to be successful."
good,Company is currently experiencing a transitional period following a merger with a West Coast bank but has been one of the best work experiences of my career. Excellent co-workers who are always willing to pitch in when needed.
good,Management has done a poor job of communicating the long term strategy for the Company and as a result we have to constantly deal with uncertainty related to our current roles and responsibilities.
good,Es una empresa en forma general buena pero hace falta un liderazgo que le guste trabajar en equipo no solo viendo los defectos individuales como equipo de trabajo sino buscnado la forma de ver las fortalezas de cada equipo y ver las opciones de ganar-ganar.
good,Recent announcement of acquisition in California raises concern about employee layoffs once consolidation of both banks occurs.
good,CIT has changed a lot in the last few years.  it is not a rewarding workplace anymore
good,The people are great to work with. A typical day at work is handling in bound and out bound phone calls attempting to collect past due balance that are between 20-120 days past due.
good,"Cualquier dia en el CIT, siempre estas de cara al público tratando a todo tipo de personas de todas las edades. Proporcionando una enseñanza del tenis. "
good,been to long since working for this employer to rate.  company closed
good,Exciting customers and not difficult. Always award for great work.
good,"Flexible schedule, work is not to demanding. Job is degrading not the type of job you would want unless your a teenager who's new to the job market."
good,"Fast paced atmosphere, good team environment within the Recruitment group. I learned most from the experienced recruiters who know their stuff and are extremely professional. The company is very driven and is a hard working culture. The hardest part is no room for advancement. A great deal of organizational change is occurring in HR."
good,"Great learning experience, great management but poor salaries and advancement opportunities"
good,This was my first job out of school. I worked on two very interesting deals - an international equity raise for a start-up airline company in Australia and a bankruptcy sales of assets to a private equity firm.
good,"People are pleasant and dedicated, Senior Management is working exceptionally hard to reinvent the company within the Banking Industry."
good,At the time I was there a lot of uncertainty they were acquired by TYCO & no one knew if they would be there from one day to the next.
good,CIT can be an exciting place to work if they had a better upper management structure. Many Directors are reluctant to help build staff due to fear of losing their position. Could be rewarding but all based on who you report to.
good,CIT was formally brought to Jacksonville from its headquarters in New Jersey.  All upper management basically have work relentlessly to achieve inner circles with all departments.   It's an in crowd company and not what you know or how well you work its definitely who you know
good,I worked for CIT from 2007 to 2014. CIT is a great place to work depending on your roll. I was a technical analyst in the beginning and work as a messaging engineer at the end. I transferred into the department with the intent to learn the roll from members of the team which did not happen that left me vulnerable. Due to a merge with another bank I was laid off after transferring from NJ to NC and one year with the new dept. Overall working for CIT was good. I hope that once a person moves on to a new team the knowledge transfer is not like pulling teeth.
good,Most employees have been there 5++ years. Diversity is good. Associate to manager ratio is good. Great new hire training class. On the job training. Great location.
good,"too many upper management changes"
good,"This is a good company to start at and gain knowledge about the industry.  Work life balance is great with management allowing time for personal responsibilities.  "
good,It has been a great learning experience but at this time the company is going through massive transformation on lot of ends which poses some challenges for people working here.
good,Very competitive compensation; learned regulatory reporting.
good,CIT compensation and benefits is on par or better than the NYC banks with which it competes.
good,"answered phones, checked in customers,work with clients in a single ,an group sessions,what was hard, helping people that dont want it.spoke to them, an reason with them as much as possible with open mind,the enjoyable part, is knowing I helped some that were open to it,"
good,"Aprendí a tratar más con lo clientes."
good,"Habian dias con mas trabajos que otros..."
good,I was there during the summer as an Intern. I noticed that the environment was definitely more laid back than that of other bulge bracket investment banks. However it can be hectic at times.
good,Problem solving and collection of past due account.
good,Most people was nice. There was a lot of culture and diversity. The kids were fun to hang around with. Most of the kids were respectful. The hardest part was the disrespectful kids.
good,They are undergoing some financial restrictions which are causing them to do extreme cutbacks on both contract and full-time personnel.
good,"Relaxed environment, different departments to choose from to gain addition experience in different fields. Training is mostly on the job. I learned a lot about loans and leases and how to underwrite files, based on credit reviews and underwriting requirements. Feedback from employees unfortunately was not something that was widely accepted by some management. Made a lot of friends there and learned a lot to assist me in future careers."
good,"I initially was hired as a senior secretary. In less than three months, I was promoted to Office Manager. I reported to Senior Management. I worked three years to the day for this company and then moved back to Miami where I was hired to manage Adcraft Signs & Copy Center."
good,"A typical day would consist of answering call from customers and calling customers to assist them with the return of equipment or the purchase of equiptment.  I've learned that the job goes much easier as time goes by and you begin developing a relationship with your customer. The hardest part of the job was having to explaing to some of the customers, who did not contact us as the contract stated, that they would be responsible for keeping the equipment for another 90 days to a year. The most enjoyable part of the job was not having an upset customer who did not thoroughly read the contract."
good,"I worked from home at CIT.  The work-home environment was wonderful.  Sales quotas were a stretch.  Quarterly commissions paid.  Lack of sales support and marketing  for sales rep,"
good,IT management are an embarrassment. Dedicated staff keep the asylum in order. CIT does not deserve the workers that they have and they certainly do not appreciate the worker bees.
good,The business is changing to address current state needs of the business. Interesting working environment. Nice people who want to do the right thing and help.
good,The recent change in management created a downstream of adjustments. Most of the employees are great to work with. Location of NYC office is close to most trains.
good,Was given high profile responsibilities and critical projects though the work environment was very stressful. My managers were really supportive and could not have survived without them
good,I loved researching invoices and shipments to find out where the discrepancy were in the truck shipping it or in the warehouse. Fast paced environment which needs employees who can multitask
good,"CIT was the top SBA Lenders in the nation, processing all of Bank of Americas submissions unknown to the general public."
good,Need better work/life balance.  Compensation and benefit need to improve. Majority of managers are fair and great to work for.  Job security is like everywhere else.

good,CIT provides a very well balanced work life.  It gives you the structure needed to succeed.

good,"Key data onto system process, process remittance items. "
good,"Steady job, worked as a temp and needed benefits. meet alot of different people. was able to work overtime."
good,Typical day of work was very irregular. I learned that I would have to review as I go. The Management was from different cutures.My Co-Workers were 99% great to work with. The Hardest part of the job was making quick changes daily from Managers. Going to work every day was the most enjoyable.
good,Learn to pay extreme attention to detail and to produce outstanding work. Senior level employees are very approachable and helpful.
good,Dynamic work environment with good people. Hard working employees.
good,I have nothing of value to add to this section.  It is a great place to learn various IT applications and prepare for a career in IT.  I recommend it to anyone.
good,I loved the people that I worked with and enjoyed my job.  My division was sold to another company so my job was eliminated.  If it was not for this I would probably still work there.
good,Good. very good. Satisfactory. Nice work environment. Well balanced work life. Goals of my team wear always clear and we were encouraged to help and grow together.
good,Nice office settin and oppotunities to engage an interact with customers by phone
good,"Great company to work for, however, salaries were quite low. Policy and procedure manuals had no order to them and very difficult to follow. Working atmosphere and fellow employees were great!"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the good people I had worked with daily, and I would certainly recommend to anyone thinking about working at CIT, to do so."
good,"Great environment"
good,"CIT Group, Inc. was a very good employer who give me my first opportunity to serve as a manager of sales and use tax compliance gained a very diversified experience because of the fact that my responsibilities exposed me to state and local, B&O, property and sales and use taxes."
good,Challenging position includes trouble shooting calls and knowing where to direct them.  Position includes screening calls for solicitors and registering guests for building access.  The co-workers are very lovely people.
good,"Truth is, if they had an opportunity for me where I was relocating to, I would have stayed."
good,Overall my tenure with CIT was a good experience.  I spent 8 years with 5 as a Business Analyst and the last 3 as a Systems Analyst.  I was responsible for providing Support and documentation for the Web Application portal and coordinating system testing for the IT staff
good,There is a lot of opportunity for growth if you have strong work ethic. The management staff is well placed and provide a positive environment to work in.
good,"Great management team on the Actimize team, good team work efforts with gathering information and ticket review using ServiceNow and involved in weekly CAB and change management meetings on the approval process, Assist in tracking daily production issues and provide follow-up documentation to the business units and Actimize developers.

good,"Travail exclusif pour membres ue"
good,Great corporate culture but slow career advancement.  The new management has been cutting on benefits from tuition reimbursements to paid maternity leave.
good,"This is one of the leading corporate lending & leasing companies"
good,CIT has a good value of family and allowance of employees being able to present ideas and have a voice.There could be a good work life balance and room for growth in the right departments.
good,"CIT was a good place to work. head offices were in the states and supervision was minimal. Job security went down hill after the housing crisis, but they paid well."

good,"to troubleshoot a motor"
good,CIT was nice place to work. Generally nice people to work for and with.
good,"- bastante dinâmico, mas organizado"
good,"A good company, with a solid senior leadership that has a clear vision of the future for the company. Unfortunately, there is little or no possibility for advancement. This is due to no available training process, and even when an employee gets the required training on their own, they are bypassed for more experienced people."
good,I liked working at CIT. I would go back if they contacted me. They paid a great salary which I wish I was getting now. Flexible with hours and paid overtime.
good,"Very comfortable atmosphere with excellent job security. Job got repetitive and easily complacent. At times workload was slow but when heavy, the job was challenging."
good,There was always a lot of work but everyone pitched in to make sure the job was done. Some days it was long hours but at the end of the month we could look back and see what we accomplished.
good,"Prudential Healthcare was a great company to work for. They were sold to Aetna.  Still talk to people I used to work with. Great culture, great people."
good,"Prioritized trouble tickets through the Service Now ticketing system and assigned to techs accordingly.  Checked logs of all servers as a preventative maintenance measure and investigated issues.  "
good,CIT strives to make the best impression for the company and to ensure that all employees are number one. They are constantly looking for new ways to make the company stronger each and every day. I love working here and I have a wonderful team of people who throughouly support me.
good,"Addressed daily issues relating to the Infolease receivable system, worked with business partners and outside software vendor to correct and resolve day to day issues. Reported to management regarding new and ongoing system initiatives and upgrades."
good,CIT is typical of an established financial services firm with a strong benefits package and cumbersome administrative structure.
good,I enjoyed working there and if they had not folded the home lending division I believe I would still be working there. I had a great team of account executives working with me and I liked going to work everyday. I also had a great regional manager who was supportive and always there to help.
good,"Extremely high-volume invoice processing environment, effective time management is required, solving supplier queries should be efficient, correct and fast."
good,VIT is a results driven company that promotes from within.  the home equity division is no longer active so there are no opportunities to work in that division anymore
good,"Upon joining the CIT Group, I was given a supervisory position which I was trying to attain at previous employers. Management was fair and organized. It was a pleasure to work there."
good,"Was a nice place, started as a file clerk, worked my way to Supervisor to Credit analyst.  Learned to call for bank and credit reference and even became friends with some customers.  Hardest part was trying to answer all the calls on a very busy day."
good,"Great job, busy all day, lots of moving parts, need to be able to multi-task, need to be available to counsel / advise / direct others.  Rapid pace and had to be willing to do lots more than what was in your job description"

The co-workers are very team oriented and will help when asked to assist in a project."
good,"A good company that has an eye on costs.  The company needs to invest more in people as well as technology. "
good,I was in charge of processing all checks and correcting any mistakes within those checks.  The management and my co-workers were very professional.

good,I worked in tax department so from the days where it's tax season which is quarterly - it's a place where i find it very stressful because of deadlines. Management can be a bit challenging depending on the stress levels of their days.
