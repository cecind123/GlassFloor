bad,"Not fair practices."
good,"Daily routine is monitoring the calendar of a colonel and deputy, monitoring the front office and front entry door. Scheduling of meeting between the colonel and outside vendors"
good,"Decent company to work for. The corporation has a variety of offices catering to various federal contracts. So, it really depends on which contract you are working on."
good,"Place was okay, as a minority wasn't the most welcoming place to be at from my experience. During my time there was 24/7 fox news on the walls and nothing innovating occurred to inspire you while having hateful messages conveyed on the screen. I enjoyed completing the daily ticket queues and working independently providing leadership skills and assisting with projects. Keeping SLA's up and teammates informed about changes or documentation. Management and I had different views on how a team should operate and I departed voluntarily as no resolution within the organization was being heard. I wish all that take their organization serious good luck and become a ""yes man"" or you'll be shafted for asking questions. As the great Charles P. Steinmetz said, ""No man is a fool, until he stops asking questions."""
good,"I loved this job. I loved my team and the work. I can rearrange my schedule to suit my life. The pay and benefits were good for someone like me. My supervisor was also the first supervisor I ever had who I really enjoyed working under."
good,"Flexibility to work from home as government dictates, some potluck with the group to have simple get together during holidays, & weekly meetings in which each group mates has the chance to raise concerns or questions that could be answer by other group mates or immediate manager."
good,My experience with leadership within CACI was very positive.  My leadership was always available for mentoring and brainstorming on a multitude of situations.
good,"Overall, CACI is a decent company to work for. The local management is fairly easy and good to work with and looking our for their employees. There are some negatives to working for this company as there are with all companies."
good,"I have no issues with the company or management. They really care about their employees and really do focus on work life balance. My only concern is that my office is new and the opportunities to advance are low. I think with time this will change, but just like any other company, it will take time."
good,Overall CACI is a great company to work for. Good benefits and competitive salary. Work from home is a plus. Very large organization so management is remote.
good,"Happy working for CACI, like flexibility to work from home on days when office is closed due to weather. Also liked compressed work week, where you could work longer hours to be off earlier."
good,"Great company. Goal oriented without forgetting its people. Pay is good, advancement is possible. Responsive managers who are also for you. Flexibility and work-life balance encouraged"
