bad,"When you interview there they are going to promise you the world in the form of a bonus. This is how that works... the bonus goes over 3 years, they use that to keep you there. Your bonus however isn't going to happen. You see your manager gets a larger bonus for taking yours away."
bad,"Working for ICE is horrible. They constantly buy new companies and then consolidate, which ends up leading to a ton of layoffs. They offer no job advancement, just lateral movement within the company, which isn't very easy since most managers will try to stop you from leaving their team. Most managers and directors have no clue what they're doing and just have their employees do all the work for them and take all the credit. The company is poorly run and they don't compensate much, but expect you to work way more than youre paid to do. You also only start with 10 vacation days per year until youve veen with them for 5 years."
bad,"This position is ran by poor management, and there has been a considerably high turnover rate due to their lack of team development initiatives and inconsistent policies. "
bad,"You are simply a cog in a complex machine. If you go to work with the expectation that you are just a machine required to do the job at hand, you will love it there."
bad,"I do not have any pleasant things to say about ICE! I ended up working for them because they purchased my previous company."
bad,"As the company has matured, the cost-cutting has become more aggressive.  While one is unlikely to ever find an organization with a more talented workforce, it comes with many costs.  "
bad,"This is what I observed. Most of the Sr managers  and directors exhibit blatant favoritism and discrimination , so if you're not in the favored group, you will be fired. "
bad,The company I worked for was acquired by Intercontinental Exchange and 75% of us were let go.
bad,"Terrible work/life balance.  Last manager was a very very bad manager who was constant source of criticism.  Had a very good manager before was transferred, but still avery hard place to work. Know company was had a great deal of turn over"
bad,"No work-life environment. "
bad,"This company does not treat people well.  I know an employee who worked there six years and they overnighted her personal items to her house. "
bad,"I have worked in this company for more than 5 years. While the overall working environment is fairly relaxed and easygoing despite the busy nature of the job, there is very little career advancement or salary increases commensurate with experience. The culture of 'who you know' not 'what you know' is encouraged."
bad,Numbers driven with little room for process improvement. They tend to promote from within which is a good thing. Seems that the contractors are held more accountable  for the work than the full-time employees.
bad,International company with good prospects for a career advancement only if in the right team. I found the environment and the way of working unnecessarily complex and received little support by my seniors.
bad,"They hire employees for a specific purpose and most stay in that role for the length of their career at ICE. When management positions become available, they hire from the outside."
good,Bought by ICE in April last year.  ICE seem to be a good company and IDC need sufficient investment and removal of deadwood before it can complete with larger data vendors.
good,ICE is an emerging financial giant. With that said the work is very fast paced and stressful. This company has a high employee turnover and there is no work life balance.
good,Very hostile work culture.work life balance does not exist
good,Great company but not where I want to be. Very nice office. They cut employee stock options. Poor middle management. They are very cheap expect when it comes to manger titles or higher.
good,"The company has grown exponentially in a fraction of the time. Management skills do not meet requirements for the level of growth the company has sustained. Too much work floating around and the lack of cohesive management across groups leads to inefficient workflows.  Furthermore, the company lacks culture now since its turned into more of a hodgepodge of different companies brought together for the sake of profit."
good,It was a great place to work at. It had. flexible hours but poor management. I f you plan on starting your career there it would be a perfect place. I recommend it.
good,"A typical day is filled with meetings and big presentation to senior management. Very good upper mgmt. exposer. The culture is welcoming but, also encourages self management."
good,"Compensation and Benefits are good but work/life balance needs serious improvement.  "
good,"Extremely fast paced,tight deadlines,need to put in more than 10 hrs on a typical day,Fun place to work if you like stressful env,Weekend support needed.Good benefits."
good,"If you are deciding between this place and another employer, pick the other employer.  This is nothing unique here that separates this place from anyone except maybe the benefits.  The scepter of layoffs constantly looms and as a result, collaboration and knowledge sharing has long dried up."
good,ICE is a growing company with the recent acquistion of NYSE.
good,"The company was in transition and workers were laid off including me, so I was not there long enough after the development to assess the changes of the new company.  It is my opinion that management and the workplace culture changed which is expected with any company take over."
good,"Intercontinential Exchange as a whole company is a great place to work. The benefits are good. The particular department I worked in is not team oriented whatsoever and management tends to discuss the performance of others, to other employees, which I find is highly unprofessional. There is no goal for the department as a whole and the environment can to be a bit tense, due to the lack of communication."
good,People tend to drag themselves to work and are unwilling to sacrifice for others.  Seems like every man for themselves.  There is little to no promotion and the company seems to do the bare minimum for employees.  The products and business are interesting though.
good,This was a great company to work in the beginning. Once they acquired the NYSE the company in my opinion has been in a downward spiral when it comes to appreciating employees.
good,Overall good company. Growing company.  Fast paced environment. Vertical structure. Better training across products needed.  Good job work/life balance.  Decent salary.
good,I believe that the job culture was great as long as you stayed at your level of occupation. Communicating with higher level of occupations was informally avoided. No consistent interactions between management and the core labor force those that actually that executes the work on a daily basis. There were however pockets of management that would welcome the interaction and grow from its cohesion with the labor force.
good,"Minimum 9 hour workdays, overnight shifts, have to eat lunch at your desk every day.  I learned a lot about the futures trading industry and the inter-workings of the business itself.  The management staff was always helpful but often did not appreciate all that was done by the lower analysts."
good,6 month contract extended to the end of the year 2013. The internship has been a very enjoyable and learning experience
good,ICE is a successful powerful company but is severely lacking in its empowerment of its employees.  It needs to pay more attention to how it treats and values its employees to retain valuable talent.
good,A typical day at work was processing payroll into the Workday system as well as administrative tasks involving standard office equipment.  The office setting was quiet and respectful.
good,Ok place to work. Fast paced. Little Job Security and no room for advacement. Advancement in other areas of company and  only in Georiga corporate office.
good,the company got acquired many times. There is a lot of restructuring however it is overall a good place for entry level positions and it does provide a lot of oppoturnities.
good,"Intercontinental Exchange has the all the trappings and bluster for a fortune 500 company, but culturally the entity is still has tiny as its initial humble beginnings 16 years ago. Growth is and development in related business acquisitions makes the company viable, however work life balance and clear business acumen still feels like a locker room experience hosting the founding members and partners."
good,"most people are nice and good to work with. "
good,A typical day at work involved working with different teams to accomplish department goals. Management had an open door policy.
good,Nice people and diverse culture. Scarce resources and mediocre employee benefits.
good,"Operations Supervisor with 8 years of increasingly responsible positions in the financial services industry and expertise in managing a staff of up to 45 team members on the trading floor. Highly effective at maintaining a smooth market flow during openings, closings, post close and under variable market conditions. Known for ability to defuse and resolve conflicts in a professional manner while remaining calm, despite a change-intensive work environment. Strong leadership skills in training, motivating and overseeing a staff to assure efficiency, speed and accuracy in all trading markets. Successful track record for monitoring and providing proper functioning of a variety of market data services, including CQG, Reuters, and SDS Market Watch, as well as proprietary systems, bells, buzzers, time displays, microphones, wireless systems and handheld devices."
good,"A lot is expected, and there are constant challenges due to platform advances, so knowing the fundamentals of technology is crucial.  Certain business departments will have less work/like balance than others.  The potential for advancement is high."
good,"Great company.  Fast paced, exciting, challenging.  Work/life balance can be a challenge, but career growth is worth it for most people."
good,It is a good company and currently acquiring the NYSE. Lots of internal growth opportunities.
good,"Company promotes traditional work environment - no work from home, 8 to 5 work day, etc."
good,"I learned a lot about CDS trading and the clearing business while working at ICE. The atmosphere was a bit hurried as releases came every often and driven by reporting laws.The technology for regression and functional testing that was employed was FITNESSE. It was a bit cumbersome and not a great automation tool. The documentation describing the regulations governing the reporting of trades and collateral requirements was lacking in completeness.  "
good,Had good understanding of my daily functions. Make with little or no supervision. Had good rapport with vendors and worked well with internal and external contacts.
good,"I have been at Intercontinental Exchange for a long time and have seen numerous changes. A typical day at work is very busy and stressful.Lots of complex applications and interesting work"
good,"Great company benefits. Peer relationships between the departments is excellent."
good,"The facility and the people are great. Fun to work with and a generally fun atmosphere. Pay should be a bit higher and the turnover rate is high. Overall, it's a good place to work but just have to be mindful of some people."
good,"IT Environment is pleasant and friendly place to work. Sometimes the hours can get long, but usually slows back down after a while. No Remote work allowed."
good,"Opportunity to work with many talented individuals."
good,Learned a great deal about the markets even though I was on the technology side of the shop. Plenty of opportunities to progress my manage career and build long lasting relationships.
good,"Very rewarding and fast paced.  A typical day at work would include scrum session, meetings with management, product managers, project managers, QA, other development teams, design sessions, code reviews and coding."
good,"Lots of interesting work but comes with a lot of support. Its a financial exchange so after hours and weekend support keeps you occupied."
good,"ICE operates in a lean fashion and has high productivity expectations of its employees. However, it repays your efforts with its loyalty and opportunities throughout the firm."
good,"	Collaborated with team in Market Price Validation (MPV), a service offering consensus based method of valuing long dated and difficult to value financial products in several different markets for more than 35 of the largest financial companies in the world"
good,"- Learned to work with different personality types"
good,"Legacy NYSE staff is still struggling with technology, ICE management and technology is better than NYSE. Too many market data platforms with too much data, however none of them is organized well. Senior management needs to make some serious changes."
good,"Nothing really negative to say about ICE, my criticisms are probably more related to position I was in."
good,ICE is one of the fastest growing exchanges in the world.  It's a big company with a small company culture.
good,"Very secure employment but runs too lean. The deadlines were tough. However, most departments are not micro-managed and you are free to meet the deadlines with little oversight."
good,"During a work week, one of my biggest tasks is checking in on my staff and assessing their progress on various data entry. I like to discuss our priorities, and then keep asking in the middle of the day to check progress. I also attend a weekly managers meeting where I present my department’s progress to the executive board. On the daily basis, I make sure all these tasks are completed."
good,"Great management and team, good work culture, and ability to advance. I have been an employee at Intercontinental Exchange for over two years and have had an overall good experience."
good,"The company provided good career advancement, employee compensation and benefits. The culture is great and still need more organisation however this is great experience for me so far"
good,"benefits were fine,  people are nice stock options also if you stay with the company for a full year. The hours were reasonable. I would recommened it"
good,"ICE's management are incredibly intelligent and forward thinking, which shows why they've grown so quickly recently."
good,"Good Company.. Smart Acquisitions "
good,"Intercontinental Exchange is a fast paced, technologically aggressive place to work.  The pace is demanding but rewarding"
good,Worked for the company for over a year in the New York office during their integration with the New York Stock Exchange. A lot of history and information was lost during the transition.
good,a typical day at work
good,"A typical day at work included monitoring the ServiceNow queue and ensured tickets are claimed and completed in a timely manner."
good,Dedicated and professional environment.  team oriented and everyone strives to deliver for customers and new clients
good,My typical night at work is the clean up aspect of working overnights. Whatever is not complete from 2nd shift gets turned over to me to complete by shifts end. I like the fact that there is no stress working 3rd shift because nobody is there to interrupt so many tasks are completed quickly. I've learned a lot about patching and infrastructure because often times I have to perform cable tracing and inventory of the cable runs. The hardest part of the job is working nights. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Overall good experience,career growth,personality development,Challenging responsibility was assigned."
good,"Smart people, nice place to work.  Excellent office, good vacation and sick day policy.  Average compensation for financial industry.  Management team is very strong."
good,"i am Worked in online trading clearing & settlement hederabad"
good,This was the best job that I and so many other had and was closed due to a buyout and a two hindred year system of open outcry being moved to a electronic trading platform.
good,"Company is an excellent place....for the right person. Personally, I did not feel this was a good fit. I found the personal connections lacking at the company. Not to say they were non-existent, I just didn't experience it.Overall, a very solid, financially rewarding and nice place to work....other than building friendships."
good,"Overall a nice place to get up and come to work everyday. Good management with staff meetings and feedback allowing freedom to express creative ideas and problem solving issues. Nice atmosphere, friendly people. I enjoyed the fact that I was able work with minimal supervision and creative input."
good,I loved working at the NSYE/ICE. It was a fun place to work with great benefits and awesome co-workers. The culture was diverse and everyone worked well together (at least in my department).
good,This is a company that continues to grow.  Challenges are daily and keep the work interesting.  You are able to learn a lot of information and proceed with wonderful knowledge
good,"I legitimately enjoy working for ICE. Without getting too into details, the bait-and-switch with the stock options getting removed this year was just not cool - especially considering the salary/bonus was not raised to match the loss."
good,The technology sector of the company is so robust. It has many different facets where you can experience every form of software development. The CTO expects the highest standards of software delivered to it's customers. Every aspect of the company understands that it's software and the teams that support it is their core business.
good,"Daily interaction to external and internal customers. Customers include;"
good,"Started my career path here."
good,empresa muy reconocida con muchas posibilidades de progresion
good,"ICE was a wonderful company to work for. It provided a balance between work and home life. If given another opportunity to work at ICE, I would not think twice."
good,"A typical day started with the opening of the markets. Would handled customer service inquiries. Create and review trading reports. Settle the markets. Learned computers, electronic trading systems, and rules of commodity trading. The management was very smart and proactive. The hardest part was dealing with computer issues. The enjoyable part was the fast pace of the industry and people I worked with."
good,Work with this company through a temp agency. But the full-time employees were very nice and well grounded in the company and very insightful when it came to becoming successful in my time working with the company
