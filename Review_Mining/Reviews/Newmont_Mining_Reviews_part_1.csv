rating,review
bad,I would not recommend any one working here. They are just starting out and have horrible work ethics and safety protocols. They don't have all their ducks in a row and horrible benefits as well.
bad,"Working at newmont is like home away from home, there is unity, principles and good team work. and above all conducive working environment."
bad,"Received, unpacked, checked, and stored merchandise or materials."
bad,"Unprofessional and no room to advace unless you kiss a lot of butt.  If not family... Forget it. "
bad,Newmont chose to outsource corporate IT and since I had just gone thru 4 years of terrible outsourcing contracts (Newmont paid millions of dollars to get out of contracts) and 2 years of new leadership and insourcing where the new Newmont leadership admitted it had nothing to do with customer service and everything to do with costs.
bad,"Management is completely unethical. They have a paper that is posted around the corporate and regional offices that says ""Got Ethics?"", which is supposed to instill ethical behavior, however if management does not understand the meaning of ethical behavior, then this message means nothing. My experience was a bait and switch game from the beginning. I was on a rotation and had to hold senior leadership accountable quarterly for fear they would leave me in that regional location for good. When you're employees start working for a company, the last thing they want to do is have to hold leadership accountable to their commitments. Then, when the warn act was issued that layoffs were coming, I somehow came up for a promotion. While I was going through those interviews, I was also interviewing externally. Somehow they found out I was interviewing. Management told me if I kept interviewing, I would not be considered for the promotion. I decided to be loyal to a company that didn't deserve it. I stopped interviewing externally, got promoted, and then two months later was laid off with the other Warn Act employees who were laid off. Leadership has no regard for human decency. It is a good old boy network of misfits who make statements like ""That's the elephant in the room, this isn't your same dallas cowboys, feed the seeds to fruition, run the pipeline, etc, etc. referencing absolutely nothing related to executable action plans."" The point is none of those things make any sense to getting things done and executing with precision. The company is completely unethical, management is terrible,"
bad,"This company practices the good ole boy culture."
bad,"The job was fun and challenging, but the person that was in charge of our group was all over the place. One day he is your bestfriend and the next he is your worst enemy out to get you and put you down. After tell management about issues nothing would get better only worse."
bad,"When I first started with Newmont, they were a great company, but then they got a new CIO and things went downhill fast. They quickly started treating people like they were just a number and laying people off by the hundreds. The CIO brought in all his old employees and fired the original Newmont employees. It quickly became a hostile environment where everyone feared for their jobs, and from what i've heard after i was laid off, things have gotten far worse, i would stay away!"
bad,"A typical day at work was pretty much a carbon copy of a day at work on most mine sites.  It's all pretty generic these days."
bad,"To this company  now you are just a employee number that's easily replaced, by another number regardless of job experience or qualified skills and years of service."
bad,A company steeped in tradition and not wanting to progress.   Unless you started working in the mines no one will listen to you.  Good people but hard to drive change.
bad,"I worked at Newmont as a contract employee. When I first started there, everything was fine.  I thought the people were nice and they allowed me to work the schedule that I had requested.  "
bad,"I Worked for Newmont several years and at first thought they treated their employes well but the more I seen the more dis heartened I became. Newmont promote a culture as a world class operation with world class people, this is not the case, I was in a position of leadership and seen how easy the got rid of people whenever they felt like it with no concern of the employes situation, firing people under the disguise of down sizing then re hiring again after a few weeks, new employes were put off with out any notice, newmonts policy was to make them get up at 3.30am travel an hour unpaid to site them terminate them as soon As they got there and give them 15 minutes under supervision to get their belongings, people lost their houses after Newmont made them relocate to Winnemucca with out any regard, Beware Newmont do NOT care about their people, if you want job security do not work for Newmont."
bad,I did not like working for Newmont at all. The management at the Cripple Creek Mine did not seem experienced. They definitely took production over safety. I have been in the mining industry for 12 years and this was the most unorganized place I have ever worked. They never had parts to do jobs correctly. Newmont was not a safe place to work.
bad,"If there was the perfect example of NON-TECHNICAL management its the IT Management here. They hire low grade engineers based on who they know. They don't know how to pick good talent because, well they don't know the answers themselves. It is completely pointless to have non-technical managers and it should not be allowed. The infrastructure manager there literally knew nothing about infrastructure much less networking. He was condescending and didn't appreciate talent that he did have... well because he doesn't know how to judge talent. The ONLY person that knew what they were doing was the Exchange Engineer. Everyone else was a joke. The ""VMware Engineer"" basically just used VMware support to get everything done. They had Jrs doing tasks above their pay grade and never rewarded. If you want awesome benefits this is the place for you. However, if you want to move up there you have to be part of the cool club and suck up MAJORLY ""KG"". One guy was there for 2 years at the corp office and ended up a director. The guy was horrible at his job and was a micro manager AHEM KG. The advancement there is not based on how hard you work. Its based on who you go to happy hour with and who you play fantasy football with. The IT Director is a really nice guy but also oblivious to all of the happenings and doesnt recognize hard work."
bad,Corporate personnel have zero understanding of the work done at the sites/regional levels and will treat good workers badly for their own gains. Now sacrificing an entire state workforce (Nevada) to acquire a Canadian compny
bad,The company was all about numbers and not about the people. I found it to be very cold and nonpersonal. There were a lot of work and the department I was in was unorganized and not skilled in the tasks at hand.
bad,The company engages in green washing. In some cases it will identify energy conservation and green house gas reduction opportunities but when it come to using capital to implement these opportunities Newmont always chooses to invest exclusively in gold production.
bad,"Totalmente desequilibrado, no permite planificar actividades en horarios libres de trabajo."
bad,Stress full and watch your back. 
bad,"The one thing I could appreciate about working at Newmont was the pay I received.  Beyond that it felt as though I were in high school again, dealing with snobby cliques and an narcissistic co-workers. Newmont seems to be pretty lax about the corporate dress code as well, considering there were a few ladies who dressed like they worked in a strip club rather than an office.  It was truly appalling. People without any real management authority were known to push around others (within their respective area) while the actual management itself took very little part in any of the day-to-day activities. There were also a number of lay-offs that occurred during my time there.  I would not recommend this place to anyone who is looking for professionalism or stability in their career."
bad,"Job was good, hardest part was gate watch during winter. Co worker was very rude and tried everything to make me quit. most enjoyable was when i got off to see my family. i learned if your upper management wont help find a better job."
bad,"Was recruited to start a new SX/EW facility and train all employees and supervision on the start up and daily functions of the plant. Helped with the design of a virtual simulator to aid in the training and development of personnel. Piped Leach pad, ran all equipment, adjusted flows and brought up plant. Daily operations consisted of grabbing and running samples, adjusting flows, rectifier settings, valves and temps based off findings of samples. Training was done on the simulator and hands on with the employees, all were eager to learn the trade and made the job fun, however long hours and minimal days off took a toll and that was the only downfall of the job. Most of the management team was willing to listen to my ideas and thoughts for the plant. I enjoyed learning the process of the hydromet all over again, from the aspect of teaching people that have never heard of solvent extraction was a new and exciting challenge."
bad,Good job experience good environment brand new equipment adequate safety  supplies  good place to learn all procedures room for expanding good first starting point.
good,"When Newmont fires you , you get a 3 line letter of service stating your name, ss number and date from and to when you worked there. That is all. You are told that they do this so no one knows you were fired. The truth is when using this letter every potential employer knows that you were fired. No cause for firing you is given. You have no chance at getting a future job unless it is the bottom of the barrel."
good,"When I started at newmont the atmosphere was rough but easy enough to handle."
good,You fell like flying and it fells good but then the wings get cut and you crush because management couldn't see your potential one supervisor I had said if a boss can't improve a worker into the worker he was going to be then he isn't doing his job as supervisor he shouldn't be supervisor
good,"I worked at Newmont for over 5 years,  it is a horse and pony show,  they say all the right things because it is required,  it is by far the worse ran business I have ever been apart of.... it is ran with the mindset of chasing gold and and half assing the way its done,  they don't put the company first,  they put their pockets first and have horrible mine planning abilities.  It is by far the easiest money I have made,  but the working environment is very sketchy... bad decision we're being made everyday and the good ole boy mentality kept people from being held accountable because nobody wanted to discipline relatives or friends... can u say cover ups?"
good,"If you are a geologist, metallurgist or some other ""ist"" in the mining industry than this is a great company to work for."
good,"Given my previous skills, there was no allowment for me to advance to help build a diversified and skilled team."
good,"Mired in local long term relationships and cronyism in their production region  as well as Corporate HQ politics Newmont has fallen from the number 2 gold mining company to #4. "
good,"Great wages, room to move up, good bonuses. Hard to get out of shift work."
good,Newmont is very old fashion in their management style and not very employee oriented.  They do pay well and offer good benefits
good,"Compensation is good for regional offices but they are usually located in small towns. Management changes every 2 years so you never really get to know who you work for and chances for promotion are few and far between. Nepotism is there even though they try to hide it, especially on mine sites. Everything is dependent on gold prices so layoffs are inevitable. Lack of workforce diversity is pretty obvious. Overall the money keeps you working there longer than you should."
good,you wake up every day wondering if you will have a job which creates a very stressful environment. overall the job was great and the company is good but at the end of the day it's a corperation so they have to take care of profits first.
good,Safety of All Mine employees is the #1 priority. Huge supporter of the local communities and employees. Committed to mining in an ethical and sustainable manner.
good,"If you want to make a good amount of money and can run mining equipment its ok. However.... if you value job stability or life outside of work this place is not for you. "
good,put production first saftey second. middle management was a joke. that is about all i wish to say. jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
good,"Conduct daily line outs, safety meetings and cross over between shifts."
good,"Troublingshootimg shooting eltrical motors,pumps , construction project and mobile equipment"
good,"There are many very good, talented people working for Newmont. Unfortunately a recently announced management / strategic reorganization has affected overall vision and job security."
good,okay pay
good,so far so good. All employees hourly and salaried are worried about their future due to the merger. We had great benefits now we are uncertain. At minimum we all lose seniority.
good,"Current executive team has done well improving financial performance and stability of the company. Positioned for long-term success in a difficult segment of mining. "
good,"Employed for over 27 years,good benefits,transportation to and from work. Able to learn other jobs if you want to. Long hours away from home. You work a month of days then a month or nights"
good,"Fast Paced and Challenging, safety focus, enjoyed working with the team at site, however, regional and corporate teams were challenging.  Workplace culture changed significantly in the last 18 months."
good,"Established environmental management systems, hired and trained more than 25 environmental staff.  Negotiated with regulators, trained regulator inspectors."
good,"Newmont wasn't a bad company to work for and the only reason I left their employment was they sold the site I was working at."
good,"Management is do what I Say and Not What I do Kinda of Trend. Management is is not the most competent, Leaders will have you written up over small violations, They are a Click and will make it very difficult to be upgrade in Tech. level. Company politics are present in the work area. Everyone will not pull their own weight and expect you as a worker to work harder than everyone else."
good,"its a 12 hour shift,i have learned to operate heavy equipment safely and productively,the management doesnt respect its people with experince that are out inthe field doing the job.My co-workers are all good people competent at there job.the hardest part of this job is the everyday stress of equipment failure,  getting tonnage,and doing the job safely.the best part is the satisfaction of doing the job safely"
good,Working in mining you get a good class in how to work efficiently and effectively. Newmont is anything but. They are into back stabbing. Lying to your face. Extremely “clicky” and full of union drama. Every employee has a story of how they were being fired and the union had to save them. It’s so common the union will represent you even if you are not a member and managers are always out dealing with these cases. So makes friends with the big guys ASAP and hope you never get any recognition because that’s the crosshairs on your back.
good,"Good pay but was getting overboard with limiting ability to perform our job because of safety policies, etc.  There's not much accountability held to certain employees when they don't do their job like expected."
good,"Decent benefits, less than stellar work environment. Policies that conflict with federal HIPAA laws, and that frequently change. Preference shown for relatives of those in positions of authority."
good,Pays the bills and a good way to provide for you family.  Enjoyed working hard and yes you an climb if you work hard here.  Gave me a good opportunity and a high paying career.
good,"Just one part of the vast Newmont network.  You are a number, not a person.  If you are okay with that, its a great job.  If you like a bit of acknowledgement maybe its not the place for you."
good,"Enjoyed different experiences, I have never worked with cyanide,"
good,Good work life balance with very low job security. Benefits are good. Lack of leadership in IT is rampant. Layoffs happen every year. Very high uncertain and negative work environment.
good,It pays good money. The Management plays favorites and if you don't get in good with them they will look for reasons to let you go. It is a union based mine so it pays to get in the union for job security. Many employees are disgruntled. Some employees are nice and easy to get along with.
good,"As a global architect support SAP PM:"
good,Newmont serves up a host of responsibilities that you must be prepared to take on.  Being a mining company it comes with a lot of obsticles and you have to be able to think on your feet quickly and ruthlessly at times.
good,"A great place to work until the price of Gold Drops. Newmont wants their professionals to move to different areas within the company every few years, which can be a good thing, unless you move just before a layoff and have the least experience in the group. However, some of the bosses I had were absolutely fantatastic at teaching you new skills and promoting you through the company where others just allowed you to do their job for them without any praise or backup."
good,"I worked here for 16yrs straight out of high school into the mill I learned how to run a SAG mill Ball mill and Verti mill, carbon circuit, and some of the Autoclave. I was in process for 12 yrs and then went to the maintanence shop for 4 yrs I learned how to rebuild pumps, weld, use torches for cutting and welding and work as a Autoclave Mechanic"
good,"The environment was fully safety compliant all the time. That was a constant every day. And, the contractor position was well compensated. I was very happy to work at the facility and some very smart tech personnel."
good,"The company lures you with the prospect of good pay but if you are working on the IT side, executive management looks at this division as a number and nothing else.  The environment is not bad and the customers are easy to work with for the most part.  But I was laid off because they wanted to go with a 3rd party company to handle their service desk and they had done the exact same thing 3 years ago with miserable results.  I would not recommend working for a company that can't learn from it's mistakes."
good,"Newmont does provide great benefits to their employees. However, the work life balance is not ideal. The work days are long but the weeks are short for admin. It is a great place to work to start your career though."
good,"in leach department.monitor sulition threw the columns and out to the pads, checking for broken lines. the crusher circuit operte gyro and jaw circuit. the mangement left me alone to run the place and working with co- worker in good spriit, the hardest and stressfull is working nightshift and the enyoyable is working dayshift"
good,Newmont has excellent benefits but is always laying people off. All of the management is horrible. Managing is done by non technical managers and technical people have no input.
good,"good pay per hour, room for growth within the company, classes offered to further personal growth. long hour days with travel to and from work decent vacation time"
good,"The pay and benefits at Newmont are very competitive with other major miners, however the days are long and job security is not the best in the current market."
good,We get work orders and do them through out the day and at the end of the day they pile on the work as if they weren't organized.
good,Worked with numerous people at a time. Great coworkers. Dealing with new management was better than the past. The way the benefits treats you is something they could improve on.
good,I enjoy the pace of work there. I was able to get training in areas I was lacking those skills. Large mixture of ethnic backgrounds and cultures. Makes working there fun and interesting.
good,Love to work with people and do other things  dont might working long hours i like to work for the company they have good benfinas
good,"Roster of one week on and one week off and also drive in, drive out!  Which means no airports and closer to home.  Good culture and people. I was employed as a casual and the company went through cutbacks so I was last person employed in our work area :)"
good,Working on all vary of electrical equipment and construction projects
good,Under joint venture of Nevada Gold Mines unsure of changes in policies until you are effected. All policies were not divulged. Policies from Newmont were changed to NGM policies and were not fully explained.
good,"I quickly and effectively hauled trucks with over-burden waste or ore for over 29 years.  I controlled the material that went out to the dumps, to the mills or crushers. I loaded 100 ton to 260 ton trucks to go to there designated locations.   I regularly took MSHA classes and safety classes quarterly."
good,"Newmont is a good company to work for.  There lots of departments to work for from labor, survey, Equipment operating, and underground.  The insurance is pretty decent."
good,"Great place to work, great people that work there, good pay, and benefits. Too much office politics and don't advance personnel that deserve to be promoted."
good,I worked 3 days a week and went to school 4 days per week. This company provided an opportunity to apply what I was learning in school. The experience was most rewarding.
good,good steady work in deadend posting. great team to work with on two generations old Operating systems and applications.
good,"The hardest part about this job was there was no room for promoting."
good,"Anything to do with finding a deposit from mapping, sampling, to advanced techniques. There are many levels of management. co-workers can be good or bad. Time schedule is rather flexible."
good,"An environment opened for learning for all levels and helps most importantly for freshers like myself to engage in all activities in your department and give room for improvement."
good,Solid company for the most part.  Good work/life balance but typical office politics existed.
good,"Newmont has some world class operations, but is facing challenges at all stages, Newmont has a great technical service group, and the company is good at developing talents,"
good,"•Sr. SAP FI/CO Functional Consultant with 8+ years of experience in SAP FI/CO covering multiple sectors such as Pharmaceuticals, CPG, Utilities, Mining, Entertainment and Manufacturing Industries. "

good,Newmont offers a four day work week for salaried employees. It gives you the flexibility to leave the area on weekends.
good,Here we worked as a collective society. Each of us had a task to perform. I personally like to operate heavy equipment.
good,Newmont was a fun place to  i liked my job the time off The pay and benefits was great they very safety oriented supervision made sure that you had the tool to do your job.
good,"Not bad. Lack of security makes it worse than it once was. Used to be the best, now is lacking in motivation and interesting work due to work for fearing for their jobs."
good,I have learned a lot from being with this company they have assisted in developing my skills and grow.
good,I was terminated nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo comment
good,"Welding repairs on mining equipment"
good,Everybody got along the safety culture was good the managers make sure everything was in place for when we got there if there’s any safety issues they made sure to correct them they were on top of the main sewer equipment and I’m top of treating employees very good
good,"was a good company to intern with. long hours, plenty of work. safe work environment, bus ride sucks but that's part of working at the mines. good days off"
good,"The company itself is outstanding and a good encouraging way for making a fair, financial future. It is a gold mining company. The company is a good company to work for. I liked the people I worked with and I have been in the construction industry for a lot of years. I have seen a lot of different characters in this trade of employment. Newmont is a good company to work for, An employee can earn a good living. "
good,"overall nice company."
good,"Worked at 3 different Newmont projects in the last 7 years, having this opportunities is a boon for me and a credit to the company itself for maintaining sustainable minesites."
good,Newmont is on its third cycle of outsourcing IT.  In the past 4 years there have been one or more layoffs each year in the corporate offices and in all the regions globally. They don't know what they want and are unwilling to invest in IT to get things streamlined and more effective.
good,"Empresa seria, bien organizada, que todas sus operaciones las realiza tomando en cuenta los maximos standares en seguridad, con inducciones y evaluaciones constantes a su personal, basados en valores altruistas."
good,Great company and benefits are good.  Management is poor and work stability is poor. Management does not care about individual employee growth.
good,"The ability to cycle rounds...muck, bolt drill, and blast...adhear to safety and work well with others unsupervised at times...I was also on a nationally ranked mine rescue team so my skills go beyond just mining."
good,"To whom it may concern,"
good,would probably still be with them if my oldest son hadnt passed away in an auto accident
good,"Overall a good place to work for. Management is poor, they go off of college degrees not experience. Your boss might be book smart, but no commen sense or work ethic."
good,I had health problems at the time. The Management at Newmont helped by working with my schedule so i keep working and get the medical help i needed. great company to work for.
good,"A typical day would start with me checking all of the bulk commodity levels at multiple mine sites through out Northern Nevada ie: sulfuric acid, lime, fuel caustic acid and the movement of gold ore from one mine site to another. Followed by checking with end users needs would be for that day or week and then getting with our contracted trucking companies to make sure they had the right equipment to satisfy all of the needs of an end use on any mine site in Northern Nevada belonging to Newmont Mining. At that point I would forecast how much of a commoidty we would need for that week and source that particular commodity. The work place culture was great for the most part working with good friendly people, being basically the liaison between my carrier contractors and end users within Newmont. The hardest part was defiantly the contract negation portion of the job. Trying  to help all of mine upper management realize the rates were what they were; considering the fact that they typically had no experience in putting a Transportation Services Agreement together and how its ever changing.Finally it was my responsibly to reconcile all bulk commodity and ore deliveries some were reconciled weekly and some were reconciled monthly. Finally part of my duties were to manage the Dunphy rail terminal where our copper concentrate was shipped out via rail over seas. Along with out copper, our sulfuric acid, lime , and grinding media all came in via rail at the dunphy terminal."
good,newmont is a great place to work. The work culture is all about safety. The pay is great along with the benefits. At times there is opportunity to take a class for somethings.
good,"Good amenities (gym, basketball court, football court. But the only problem is those “local chefs” working in the kitchen, they have “crab mentality” attitude.."
good,"Mon-Thursday work days 10 hour days. 8 hours in the field most day very little time in office. Management at the time was for himself other than that other management was great,"
good,A job where you can support your family and feel valuable. The management is fair and the safety culture is top notch. There is also  room for advancement and the training for such is in house and done well
good,"I enjoyed my time at Newmont, unfortunately, it was just an internship. The only negative aspect was that, as a mining company, they do well the economy is unstable; this can lead to a king of job insecurity"
good,"Newmont is a forward thinking and progressive company.   Newmont is aware of the core business, and remains focused to achieve annual objectives.   Safety is first always.  Employees are well compensated.  Employees have proper tools to complete their job.  Newmont considers the exterior dynamics of their business.  Family, Community, Sustainable growth initiatives.   "
good,"A supportive company who enlists education to safe practices as a priority for the company and for the worker. Good camp for one of the remotest camps in the world, and very friendly environment considering the harshness."
good,"I learned a lot from this job. Especially when it comes to safety. The days are long days, 12 hour shifts. But really it is a 14 or 15 hour day cause you have a hour bus ride out and back into town. Management were good for the most part. the hardest part about the job was long hour and lots of stairs. Best part was the pay and the people."
good,"I enjoyed my career at Newmont, learning more of the cultural differences working for a global company and the issues in building a sustainable business in developing countries."
good,This job takes dedication and hard work. You are exsposed to the elements working on site. With all of the possable hazards and contaments we deal with every day you need to have your head on strait and be on your toes. Working in my field Health Safety Loss Prevention. My role as an Industrial Hygiene Technician is a very unique skill.
good,"Days started early and finished late quit often running to 15 hour days. The mine being some 42km from the camp meant quite a bit of traveling each day to attend the crew shift changes. In the 7 years at supervisor/Foreman level one important thing I took away from Newmont was what could be achieved through department goals and commitment. "
good,Great company to work for. Good experience. Management was a little disorganized.
good,This company would be an industry leader if the layers of management did not get in the way and erode profitability. Growth of the corporate structure has tripled the staff at the corporate HQ to the detriment of the organization.
good,"Typical open pit mining operation. Some training is available to further or learn new skills. Not in a consistant manner though. Co-workers try to help each other and have a ""fun time"".Pay rate is high compared to other states & companies. Overall a good company to work for."
good,Great opportunities and culture.  Very smart people and good ways to develop with projects and connections across the globe. Culture is very driven from the top.

good,"I worked 14 hour days ."
good,"I enjoyed working day shift at the gold mill.  I tested and calibrated different types of monitoring equipment.  I saw the largest autoclave I have ever seen, and worked on the equipment.  Electrical, instrumentation, and PLC troubleshooting and repair."
good,i cant complain abt newmont i reaaly loved my job. and all my co-workes. i want to work for newmont again and show them i can be honest and not let my personal life come to work..
good,Newmont has offered me many chances to advance in my career. I began working and a labor and have worked my way into a Health and Safety role.
good,"I start the day by lining out, a 40 man crew. I learned that communication is a very important tool. Working well with upper management is a key. My co-works were a pleasure to work with, sometimes challenging but enjoyable. The hardest part of the was to keep ahead of the crew to  keep them working. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see everyone going home the same way they came to work."
good,"great compensation - salary & benefits, good opportunities to grow & learn, but poor morale with ongoing layoffs.  duplicity of responsibilities leads to high overhead and confusion for moving projects ahead, yet critical departments and positions are being eliminated while those accounting positions remain"
good,"Supported Newmont's world wide operations with a great team of people."
good,"Great place to work, strong team work and culture weather long term employee  or greenhorn. Reliable operation with minimal breakdown"

good,"Great job for me .    Kinda of miss it  did loader operation, drills & bolsters  I had a lot of fun an work went fast  cause I liked it so much  also trained a lot of people for different jobs  an that was great also  people need to be trained to watch the dangers of being underground"
good,This was a good place to work and good environment.The people here were goo to work with and I learned valuable skills. There are plenty of opportunities here.
good,Newmont is a great place to work. I wish they would have kept the Nevada Mines under the Newmont flagship. I still love my job but wonder what possibilities are out there.
good,Newmont mine clean up was a good place to work.Everyone was up best and fun to work with everyone watch out for everyone safety even for a long work day everyone was fun to be with drama free work ace
good,This role was was a great experience in exposure to worldwide practices and rules such as SOX that is required for all US based companies. The culture of the company was excellent and provided a great learning platform.
good,"I have not been a part of this organization for 20 years. At the time it was great. they were devoted to safety, training, and promoting from within. I believe they still do."

good,Newmont was great.  My manager was horrible was one of those people that thinks it's funny to dry hump other employees.  Very odd when you're making 150k a year. Strange people do that type of thing

good,"I would recommend newmont to anyone, was a great place to work. stresses safety over all that we did there. Mining can be dangerous by nature, the company does their very best to mitigate all hazards. The hours could be long but the people I met there were awesome."
good,I really liked working there the pay and benefits are great. I had a few issues with some of my two faced co workers but that's everywhere you work. Its very fast paced and numbers driven which creates an environment where no one wants to help anyone else because it will negatively affect their production numbers. One co worker in particular would be all smiles and tell me I was doing good and then go to the shift manager and complain. Management kinda tried to help sort of but I repeatedly asked ways I could improve and was always told I would figure it out myself which was very frustrating. I was also talked to because I was too quiet which caught me by surprise but when no one wants to help you and a co worker is constantly talking bad about you behind your back its not easy just chatting away with everyone. All issues aside it was a cool job and I would definitely recommend working for them.
good,Very focused accounting and planning team with an ability to deliver results and meet stakeholder needs. Geared to career and development opportunities through training and on the job experiences.
good,I enjoyed driving large equipment. I was able to driver different types of equipment. This company's number one thing was safety over production.
good,Everything is great but want to relocate to Cairns. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I'm home every second week and can drive home at anytime if something important arises.
good,"Working at Newmont was a great experience. I worked around very large mining equipment, and was trained on some of the many different types. Including excavators, dozers, loaders, RTDs, blast hole drills, and graders. The company was a very safe place to work given the nature of the mining atmosphere."

good,"Newmont Mining was an excellent place to work and there was a high demand on employee excellence. I learned many things that helped me advance in my career, and worked with an outstanding group of people. Newmont was good at hiring quality employees who were passionate and cared about the contributions they made to the company. The hardest part of the job may have been the high demand for results and completion of duties as required."

good,"A typical day of work was productive but laid back enough to make sure no short cuts were made. I learned that safety is the number one priority while also learning about maintenance on crushers, conveyors, pumps, different liquids, and the general process of ore. The management in my area was very level headed and organized which made the environment enjoyable. The hardest job I have done was replacing conveyor skirting from inside the chute due to the tight, confined space as well as the dirty nature of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job would simply be working alongside the coworkers you interact with every day."
good,"This was my first mining job. I was taught how to be a safe and productive miner. The only reason I left this job was because there was no more room to advancement,"
good,"I worked here as a temp. The company was very thero with there training. We trained in each area for months till you not only knew your job ,but you could trouble shoot any problem completely. The Newmont lab is a very big operation. The crews are made up of 23 individuals with four rotating crews. They sample thousands of asseys a day. The work environment is very good.
