bad,Management will try to fire you over anything no work life balance no room for growth in the company once you max out expect to work 60-80 hours a WEEK. Work 12 hour shifts and only get one 20 min break rarely
bad,"Clayton,nj   very very dirty place to work"
bad,Losses of $50+mill per quarter and near bankruptcy till Hindalco/Novelis buy out 2018. Expecting plant closures. Inside of plant there's a lot of sleeping employees and outdated systems.
bad,"Place is full of favoritism "
bad,Hostile environment to work in for mid to lower levels.  Too many chiefs and not enough staff.   Caste system in place and unbreakable.  Major projects are executed by lower level staff and no credit is given.
bad,Better place to work when it was a small company.when CLAY owned the company.
bad,"Er wordt je veel voorgelogen door de hogere pieten daar, bedrijf heeft geen toekomst en de collega’s zijn allemaal een bende ***. Er wordt meer geroddeld dan gewerkt"
bad,"Up until the beginning of 2019 things were pretty good at Aleris Rolled Products in Ashville Ohio. The start of 2019 came with new management/supervisors that seem to have no clue of to do things. The moral and overall atmosphere at Aleris went downhill in a matter of months. Management started treating people poorly, and expecting employees tonwork everyday of the week 12 hours a day. Honestly Aleris was a place I thought I’d retire from until here recently. I hope things get turned around, but I won’t be here to see that. If it does."
bad,Poor management with a lot of flaws in their system. Very unfair management and they disregard the safety of their employees as all they care about is their monthly production goals or targets.
bad,"Great opportunity to work with PLCs, AC Drives, and all electrical components to include power distribution"
bad,"The first two weeks was in orientation, but once you get in the plant, real life starts and everything you were told in orientation is a lie, guess that's the reason they have such a hard time keeping anyone in maintenance management."
bad,Worked in richmond casthiuse very hot in summer commin winter... work everyday your married to the job... management terrible... the union sucks terrible also.....
bad,"Very stressful! I had to self manage and felt undermined by immediate manager for a long time. There was much rollover with my managers management. Our marketing department was only tolerated, despite the hard work we did. I would rather face unemployment than to continue to work for this company. They overspend in excess for self serving executives, and under-spend for middle management hires and employee advancement and education. Poor organizational structure and stability. Great potential, chosen, systematic, motivational fail."
bad,"12hr shifts up to 84 hours a week when covering hot and dirty. Fan if working to keep you cool in the summer heat. No respect towards your good work efforts. Watch out for the back stabbers. Always firing people for stupid reasons. If they don`t like you there you won`t last long. So if you don`t like long hours, sweating, smoke all around you at all times this is not the place to get a job. Hope this will help the next victim."
bad,"Company has had many changes in the past 10 years. Most not for the good. Many,many employees seeking employment elsewhere."
bad,"The guys you work with are good..  The company lacks accountability for hourly and management, makes following through tough and change even harder. There is great promise but you need the right leaders for that to change."
bad,"Aleris plant where I worked was all show but no doing. Advancements were given because of race complaints from union at times and the acceptance of workers reporting off, stealing and other things made supervising extremely difficult."
bad,Managment is focused on profits/production numbers causing a poor work atmosphere. Employees do not have a good family/work balance due to high overtime loads.
bad,"Worked there 5 years. Glad I left. Lots of overtime and really hot in summer. Low morale, bad management and lack of safety. Ok job but wouldn't stay long"
bad,"The pay rate is 40% lower than comparable jobs in the area. The schedule is nice because it is set, however there is no opportunity for overtime or advancement."
bad,"I enjoy working for this company, good benefits, paid vacation. Chances to win incentives with safety checks, very safe place to work for. Rewarded for quality and production. Some supervisors are very impersonal (not a people person)."
bad,"Hours are long and work environment hot and dirty. Consistently shorthanded and forced overtime. "
bad,I learned while working at Aleris that work/life balance was very important to me.  The most challenging part of the job was the culture and management.  I did however enjoy the work that I did and met a few great people while employed there that I will miss!
bad,"Top heavy management / company.  Difficult to get anything done.  Resistant to change.  "
bad,"Ever changing management with no leadership."
bad,"A typical day of work is mundane, repetition, and long hours.  The management at Aleris is total disarray.  The hardest part of the job is working a rotating shift with long hours."
bad,nice career but very dangerous working around a hot furnace. Also they work outdoors so the weather can be uptight. they also have a lot of lay off which makes the job security questionable. the people are friendly and have excellent training programs. I learned how to handle the material in various ways.
good,"They worked you as much as they could. Lots of overtime, but didnt see family much. Worked 6-7 days almost non-stop until they closed down."
good,"I work at a facility that was purchased by Aleris. Looking back, it is now clear that from the beginning their intention was to close our facility. We had little communication and absolutely no support from upper management or corporate. Management and supervision at our facility was stretched so thin that most had to work seventy to eighty hour weeks up to the point the closing was announced."
good,"Huvudsakliga inriktning var att göra kommunanalyser inför eventuella nyetableringar av särskilda boende. Deskresearch och kräver omfattande research. Mitt första jobb o0ch praktik plats i Sverige. Språk utvekling samt statistick förmåga. trevliga kollegor även det var kort tid, den svåraste delen är att inga förmåner, bästa är att mitt första praktik plats i Sverige."
good,Top loaded company looking to go public but not positioned in the market at this time.
good,The hours are long and I don't like working night shift. Have been denied the ability to advance from my current position for 8 years although others have advanced ahead of myself. They do things their own way and every new manager has to make their mark. There has been quite a few changes in leadership over the time i've been there.
good,"it's ok would be better if I lived closer to the plant ,some of the equipment is dated and could be replaced, that's all I feel comfortable saying other than I'm driving 1.5 hours one way to get there"
good,"work life balance is non existent.  the Lewisport Union runs the plant and I mean runs the plant.  Management from a supervisors standpoint stinks, your hands are tied literally.  They hate you at the top and they hate you at the bottom."
good,"Worked there for 2 years 7 months, no more and no less. Met some great people there and had an opportunity to look over documents for the company as well as use their computer system."
good,"Typical day was busy from start to finish"
good,"For a dirty dangerous place, they should pay much more and offer better insurance. "
good,"Pay is good and benefits are ok. There is no chance of first shift in sight because no one will retire that’s been there for 40-50 years. So if you like third shift.. apply. Management will dump on you first chance they get with even the slightest mistakes... their point system is unrealistic to life balance. So people get fired all the time. If your the low man in the company, you get forced in on your days off. Up to 6 days in a row with one day off."
good,"leuke mensen om mee samen te werken "
good,"Een gewone werkdag als alles goed verloopt,is goed."
good,My manager and director are effective but also understanding when life gets a little in the way of work. Not everyone at the company is so effective. Management is not always supportive of attempts at individual advancement or new ideas to improve the company. They are also not doing great in terms of business metrics.
good,belle entreprise  pour la transformation de l aluminium  charger les fours a l aide de chariot élévateur  ajouter l alliage requis  et couler l aluminium liquide en lingots
good,"I work in an environment of continuous improvement so there are a multitude of potential projects. Plants are spread throughout the country as well as oversees, so a great deal of traveling is required but there are a lot of people with a lot of knowledge and experience to share."
good,"Vår hverdag på Medisinsk Senter er ganske lik.Våre brukere kommer og går kjapt. Man må ha god oversikt over dagens gjøremål. Jeg har ikke jobbet på et privat medisinsk senter tidligere så dette har lært meg å se rekkevidden innen pasientenes behov på en annen måte. De kontakter oss for å få en hurtig time utenom det offentlige og er fornøyd med snarlige resultater fra våre leger med at de betaler privat. Det blir nå tettere samarbeid mellom senteret og sykehusavdelingen, og våre to ledere jobber nå i team da det skal bli en felles resepsjon b.la. Mine medarbeidere har lang fartstid innen helsesektoren som meg og samarbeidet er trygt. Den vanskeligste delen kan være ved sykdom/sykemeldinger når det er lite folk på jobb. Da må vi andre dekke flere arbeidsstasjoner. Den mest underholdene delen av jobben er besøk og nundervisning av legefirmaer. Og også internundervisning fra våre egne leger."
good,"I worked there for 20 years and enjoyed it.  I grew up at Aleris "
good,The job is easy but you can become bored quick because there isn't much to do. You are only allowed to do just your job so that is a plus. Good pay for what the job is
good,"Aleris was a great place to work. The user community was easy to work with, knowledgeable and friendly. Unfortunately, many members of the leadership team were not respected, which made decision making challenging."
good,This is a 12 hour per shift job.  It is an aluminum recycling plant.  It is very dirty and hot in the summer.  They provide you with uniforms.  This is a non-union plant.
good,"It good money, but you work long hours and Overtime too. We work 12 hrs. a day/half of the year.  You get ever over weekend off."
good,"Det var bra med arbetskollegor vi samarbetade jättebra. Mina arbetsuppgifter var dokumentation, journalanteckning, genomförandeplan, vårdplan och avvikelserapport. Jag hade stort ansvar för brukarna, gav omvårdnad och omsorg, och var socialt sällskap. Jag följde de dagliga rutiner som personalen hade schemalagt. Det bästa delen av jobbet var att göra aktivitet med brukarna.Den svåraste delen av jobbet var att vara resurs.På mitt arbetsdag hade fått jag mera erfarenheter."
good,"good place to work, good management, union shop but not ran like one.  Liked job and environment too bad about lay off. Typical factory conditions."
good,Good place to work. As much overtime as you could want. The time off was great but when you are working thats all you are doing. the twelve to sixteen hour shifts are tough.
good,"Aleris recently purchased 4 rolling mills from Quanex, my plant being one of those. I have had good and bad days with Aleris. They have provided Front Line Leader trianing, only to find out we were going to be shut down. The company has great benifits for employees. Just haven't been apart of the company long enough to have an opinion."
good,"Supervisor crew to maintane the up time of the equipment. Acountabilty way more for one person to deal with. "
good,Aleris offers great benifits and decent earning potential. The environment can be fast paced or steady depending on tge orders being processed. They also offer a great profit sharing bonus depending on overall pounds shipped per month.
good,Aleris is a relatively younger company for which can be a positive. Employees have the opportunity to wear many hates which quickens ones development.
good,Hot environment long hours good pay plenty of overtime good benefits not hard work 60 plus hours a week shut down for two weeks during winter months . Union job
good,"Good place to work overall, but manager was very inconsistent with respect to expectations, process, etc.  Otherwise, great company and growing organization which I would highly recommend to anyone."
good,"Bra ledningsgrupp "
good,no real room for growth if your not one of them there against you employees are very bitter and depressing you work 12 hours and only get a half an hour lunch for working all day very loud warehouse and hot heavy clothing you must ware at all times
good,"This position was responsible for accounting, internal reporting, inventory costing and month end close cycle for  an aluminum recycling operation in Oklahoma. "
good,Always on the go all the workers complain about their job everyone is ready to quit including me
good,"Hours and pay was good with good insurance, associates were friendly and a good team,  too bad the work force was reduced quite often and layoffs happen to regularly"
good,"-easy to advance"
good,"Llegar con mi relevo y que me resuma de los materiales y hornos ir a platica de seguridad revisar materiales cantidad de cada uno de ellos, realizar las cargas preferentes para la aleación que se este realizando o se valla a realizar darselo al trascabista ver que materiales podemos mover para una producción mas rapida."
good,"hjälpa pensionerade med vardagssysslor. "
good,Aleris was a challenging place to work with tight deadlines and a good work ethic. Health and safty was high priority due to the amount of hazardous waste being stored and hot finished goods stored on the yard. I enjoyed my time at aleris learning new skills such as driving a front loading shovel and bigger forklifts than i was normaly used to.
good,"Bon compagnonnage"
good,"I enjoyed my time as an information technology intern at Aleris. As an intern I was not given many responsibilities, but I valued everyone I was given."
good,"Great place to work; lot's of opportunity if you are willing to be a proactive contributor."
good,The co-workers were the best part of this job. Dealing with the heat was the hardest thing to adapt to. A typical day was providing was providing General Motors metal when they requested it.
good,"Så här kan en dag se ut"
good,Ever-changing landscape creates a challenging workplace.
good,"A typical day consisted of completing journal entry and reconciliations for the monthly close. The area's typically included cash, payroll, medical, AP, and prepaid's. When not working on the close process I typically had one to two projects with upcoming due dates.                                                                                         "
good,Uma empresa que esta em pleno crescimento e como todas empresas em crescimento tem acertos e erros mais uma boa empresa .
good,Aleris is a good company to work for that provides a good work environment. In my position I oversee all functions and task on the recycling foundry. Make sure each furnace and the shredder has enough scrap to support their daily goals. I have learned to blend metal to get the specs needed for certain alloys of aluminum. I go over all the plants paper work and make sure all information is correct. The culture of the work place over all is very good. Dealing with the different personalities of the employees working on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the day is when we reach our goals safely.
good,"job is very demanding but environment is very good far as being clean for the plant being 44 years old, there is a lot of descent people and helpful just like every plant."
good,"The pay is very good for the area.  The company has a lot of potential, but there is a lack of accountability and follow through.  With a little more guidance from Upper Management, and better work ethic culture I would apply again."
good,"For the area, the financial compensation is top of the line. However, the poor management practices and awful culture (a mixture of management and the union that operates there), at times, the negatives of the job, far outweigh the benefits. Overall, it's a great stepping stone for someone looking to get excellent situational management experience."
good,"Daylight leadman give out task to be done after morning meeting."
good,"12 hours days 6 to 6."
good,"good boss , safe work place, most counter parts work well together like any where  & typical work day goes by fast when weather breakes"
good,Company with a lot going on and a lot of potential room for growth with a culture engrained in the past.
good,Aleris is a good place to work. They provide good benefits and a competitive salary. Aleris is always investing in their employees. They like to see their employees advance.
good,"If you get the right crew, the day goes by pretty quickly and smoothly. Advancement depends on seniority so you do have to put your time in. Good things is that most people enjoy what job they do so many people don't move from there position."
good,"If you can handel the heat its a good place to work. They poor molten metal so it gets very hot , there big on saftey and in that enviorment thats good"
good,The management was very supportive.  It was a good work environment.  This is probably the job I learned most of my experience.  I greatly appreciate all that they did helping mold my future.
good,Managed the shipments of molten aluminum to Aluminum Foundries for die casting. Managed the batching of aluminum scrap to meet certain specs for producing spec alloy ingots.
good,"I would still be there but the company got in financial issues and I was laid off. re-hired and laid off again. The people work great to work with, plenty off overtime was available."
good,a typical day it is very hot but when you get past the heat the day is easy. I learn how to drive a forklift there. management was great. the co-workers where great a they teach you a lot. The hardest part of the job like i said is the heat.
good,"Everyday was a new challenge. Dealt with managing top executive calendars, travel, logistics, and expenses. I learned how to deal with diversity and adapt to change quickly to get the job done. Management allowed me to do my job and listened to suggestions if I found a more efficient way of performing a task. I enjoy working with others and being a team player; however, I am self-sufficient as well."
good,I started my career on the plant floor then was able to be promoted multiple times over a series of several years.  Aleris cares about the talent that employees have plus the ability to be promoted from within.
good,"My acknowledged helicopter view, based on solid experience & knowledge in several disciplines, allows me to participate in plenty of projects and strategic exercises. Personal  learning has changed towards effective knowledge sharing as internal consult. "
good,"As with foundry work it can be hot in summer cold in winter. Cold due to the amount of raw goods constantly feeding into the building and Coldwater, Michigan winters are frigid at times. A loner than I like commute made it even more challenging. The team work of all the workers in my charge made it a real fun place to work most of the time. Lay off was always just moments away it seemed."
good,"Loved everything about this job, the people and the work itself. only left because my husband and I both worked there and thought we shouldn’t have ‘all our eggs in one basket’"
good,"I worked at the rolling mill in Uhrichsville Ohio in the Engineering department.  The staff were wonderful.  Everyday was a joy.  I left the company to pursue advancement in my career, however I would go back if there was an opportunity for me."
good,"The work can be fast paced and slow paced at times depending on the days, the co-workers and Supervisors are great to get a long with but Management can leave a bit to be desired. Overall a good place to work at."
good,"The work there was very good and challenging, presenting new opportunities for learning and growth, but most progress is stifled by the union there. Whenever an idea was presented that could help production but was a major change it was instantly shot down for putting union workers jobs in jeopardy, which was simply not true. Probably a better place for the hourly people than salary."
good,"Aleris is a great place to work right now due to the fast pace and growing nature. Employees may work long hours, but time flies because of all of the wonderful people who work here. Benefits are a little expensive, but they offer different incentives to bring deductibles down!"
good,"Det är en rolig plats att jobba, med bra ledning och arbetskamrater."
good,"Die Arbeit ist zwar körperlich schon anstrengend, aber die Bezahlung und das Betriebsklima sind gut"
good,It was nice to be apart of this changing company.  It has shifted gears over the last decade.  It seems to be be a steady company with a lot of growth.

Drive forklifts and case loaders for production and loading and unloading of trucks. Run different Machines and train new people on machines. Supervise production workers and also other maintenance mechanic when Maintenance Supervisor is on vacations."
good,bra arbeidsplass jeg trivdes der frem til jeg dro til Lørenskog på en annen jobb oppdrag i sommer
good,fast paced sometimes stressful but the other employs will help you learn the correct way so you don't get hurt. I learned hot to operate several different heavy machines as well as cranes and several forklifts. I most enjoyed the paint pull area you could work at your own pace and make your own breaks manage your own time it was all on you all you had to do was stay busy.
good,"At Aleris I learned a lot and would stay with the company if it hadn't been bought out. My job entailed negotiation, analysis, and a cost focus. It was a great experience"
good,"great people. great work. always something new to learn."
good,I'm just not happy with the new management for my department. He continues to put people down all the time and can never tell you good job when you have truly done a good job.
good,Great career move for me to learn the six sigma black belt process and get to travel around the Midwest to the various manufactioning facilities in Aleris.
good,Lots of room for movement within the company.  The general work environment is very hot dirty and dangerous being an aluminum smelting manufacturing facility.
good,The people that I had the honor to work with during my time at Aleris influenced me a great deal with my future growth and career development.  I learned a great deal during my time employed there.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is completing the work as a team."
good,Monitor coils and accurately record all information on a daily report. What i learned most about my job is how seven people must work together every day as a team. Management here at Aleris is more there for support. The hardest part of my job is inspecting and calling out the most accurate adjustments. I'm very happy when we make the correct adjustment and the process runs smooth.
good,I enjoy my doing my work all the co woker was nice I also learned how to manage my work task to me there was no hard part about the job I was doing because I enjoy working
good,Being able to show and make improvements in peoples lives and in the process really made for a very enjoyable job.  It gave a great sense of accomplishment to work for Aleris.
good,"Involved in project scoping, estimating, funding (ACR) process, specification, procurement and equipment  installation process for various heavy industrial projects. Such projects included specialty overhead cranes, aluminum reheat furnaces, rolling equipment, industrial ventilation, etc."
good,it was an honest days pay for an honest days work. it was hot as it was in a foundry. it was straight forward what you had to do on a daily basis. Management was okay but depended on who was in charge of your line.
good,"Aleris is getting into the automotive industry and are striving to meet all ISO requirements to get their self into a great position for the future of aluminum products "
good,"A typical day consists of meeting with the night shift supervisor and see if there were any safety concerns during the night.  Then I take a plant tour engaging in conversation with employees along the way.  I return to my office and review production numbers from the night shift and then I process daily production and look for opportunities.  Once I am done with paperwork, I then meet with the oncoming supervisor and review any safety issues and discuss the plan for the day.  We then go on a Gemba walk.  At 9:00 am we have a production meeting with the plant manager to discuss any safety issues or incidents and discuss OEE for each piece of machinery in the various departments.  I then meet with the maintenance manager, engineering manager, purchasing manager, etc.  to follow up on any issues or discuss projects and schedule down for the various machines.   I learned a lot over the years.  One of the most valuable lessons is engaging the employees in opportunities for growth and improvements.  The management staff and co-workers a a pleasure to work with.  The hardest part of my job is unplanned downtime do to mechanical or electrical issues.  The most enjoyable is a safe and efficient day with no employee issues and the machines are running at capacity."
good,"Så fort jag var färdig inom komvux med min utbildning till undersköterska så fick jag mitt första jobb på Bollnäs sjukhus och fick ett sommarvikariat."

Exiting times."
good,"A good company to work for it was Commonwealth Aluminum , it merged with Imco and became Aleris International in 2004.  Aleris had a lot of good benefits and good people working, there unfortunately they filed bankruptcy in 2008, a lot if us lost our jobs ."
good,"A small private hospital with 3 operating theatres."
good,Innovative. Sense of corporate purpose. Felt valued as employee. Plant management took personal interest in my projects. Growing company with great benefits.
good,Overall good place for overtime but upper management takes their time on communication and it’s not in a timely fashion. I don’t like the long layoff/outages for yearly maintenance
good,laid back lots of different jobs alot of different equipment to run. slightly dangerous you are wotking with molten aluminium. lots of layoffs but i would work there again
good,"A typical work day starts with a safety meeting that covers  incidents and near misses.  From that point, the lead worker communicates to the team the target goals that will be completed by the end of the day. The different variations of heat is the most challenging part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the completion of the target goals."

good,I load the furnaces with material and sometimes i work the floor and i have to haul material up for operators to run. I have to help tap the furnace and feel pots. Lock pots up and put them on trucks. The hardest part or the job is its very hot and swing shift. The management is very good.

good,Aleris is a very exciting and dynamic company. Each day brings a new challenge. The opportunities to learn and grow are plentiful. Most enjoyable- the people by far! Most challenging- balancing project priorities. There is never a shortage of great things to work on.

good,"well I spent all of my twenties, my thirties, and almost all of my forties working in a food plant .working close with management until finally having my own office with my families picture on my desk. a great way to spend most of my life how I wish I could have retired from there. made a lot of friends there. I especially enjoyed all of the potluck meals we would have for many occasions! I especially like making improvements to production. I always felt that this somewhat my calling wherever I am at. The most enjoyable part of my overall employment  there was having the full trust from the people that surrounded me.  Aleris is where I thought for sure I would finish out my working career . it was a small place but still made some friends . I taught them some things and they also taught me. overall the hardest part for any job is closing them down."
