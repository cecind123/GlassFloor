rating,review
bad,"I'll be honest, I was expecting more from this company and role. Here's an honest review from someone who actually worked there."
bad,the company acts like they own you. Your on call 24/7. everyday you go to work you have to worry about management following you around trying to fire you.
bad,Management only has one focus filling share holder pockets every employee is a waste they do not want they hate payroll and they hate having to follow safety protocols
bad,They don’t care about the employees or families of the employees. Management is a joke . They don’t give you the tools you need but rather throw you out to figure it out on your own. On call 24/7 never know when you will work because of poor dispatching and management. The company will send letters out of record profits then turn around and cut jobs because its slow. The company is nothing but  a bunch of greedy toxic snobs. I would not wish that job on anyone. I hope every share holder and board members lose everything and have to be put out on the street and starve. I hope they all are fired and get back to railroading like it should be!
bad,"Some days it’s the management, some days it’s the coworkers, some days it’s you. But it’s always the way railroad employees are treated poorly overall and it’s getting worse."
bad,"Corporate is so greedy with money that they are willing to run it to the ground so that the government will bail them out. They do not care about workers. They use them and then throw them away like they are nothing. They are making enough money as it is. Their comment, they are lying and everyone can see through it. People that are still working there are looking for other jobs and those that have been laid off, they said they wont go back if they ever call them. They are getting a bad rep so fast that no one will want to work for them ever again. Good job corp. Hope you sleep good at night knowing that you are destroying families just for the money."
bad,"Cons"
bad,The employees working here are racist. They won’t give you a chance to improve anything. Management jumps to conclusions without asking the right questions first.
bad,This place hires you to fire you I would stay away.  Management and supervision are very bad and will let you go in a second.  You are always being watched and harassed.
bad,Laid off and getting ready to lose my house cause of greed. Don't care about their employees just their pockets and how much money they can shove in them.
bad,"On call, little time off, plan on missing anything and everything your family does. Great if you are single and want no social life.  Work a lot of nights"
bad,"Started after high school. Grew up in the railraod industry, 3rd generation railroader. Love the railroad but the lack of job security is a huge negative."
bad,Management is terrible.  No common sense and drill seargeant mentality.  Manage solely by intimidation.  Still remains the most miss managed class 1 railroad.   They make money on the hard working backs of the employees.
bad,Norfolk Southern is a tough company to work for in reference to work life balance. Unfair practices and they like to play management against the union. Time for a new job.
bad,Idk where to start. Interview process was tough. School down in georgia was most stressful thing ever. Didnt pay enough while down there for food etc. Course was tough but fun. Coming back no one liked working for NFS. So it was very discouraging to hear so many people that have been there for years say that with us being new. Got laid off after being there for not even a month after all that hard work put in. So many new people laid off. It was rediculous and really sad that they would do that to all these new hires who believed their presentation and got us to leave jobs to go start a new career with them.
bad,"Worst place to be employed by. I wouldn't wish my worst enemy a job here. Management will steal from you, blatantly lie to your face and spend countless hours looking for a reason to fire you, or just make one up."
bad,"I work there. Trust me you spend more time on trains and in hotels than with your family. Management is terrible, they're constantly trying to fire you, and its getting worse. It takes years to hold a job, so planning your life is literally impossible. Money is cool, but thats the only positive thing about it honestly. Expect long walks in the woods at 2 A.M. when your train breaks down, because they don't think 18k tons won't put stress on their barely serviced engines."
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend anybody be a conductor in the Macon, Georgia district, bunch of backstabbing, racist, red neck engineers and conductors who don’t want to see people of color succeed, will lie to get you fired especially if you are a conductor trainee and ineligible to join a union. Poor and rushed training, two faced train masters hide in the woods trying to catch you breaking a rule so they can fire you, before you are eligible to join a union."
bad,The company culture is toxic.  There is a lack of employee development.  The senior leadership does not have a goal aligned to accomplish the tasks shared with stakeholders.
bad,Norfolk southern is a awful place to work the training is terrible and the pay is not worth it at all! If you want a railroad job do yourself a favor and go to one of the real companies like bnsf or cn you will make twice as much and they are ran much better.
bad,poor poor management I wouldn't wont my dog to work for this rail road they are to lowest paid rail road for a reason! they want to fire you every chance they get and the workers and never right and we are liars no matter what. worst rail road it is
bad,Norfolk Southern is synonymous with employee mistreatment and business mismanagement!  Extremely poor and unsafe working environment!  Management personnel are given performance reviews based on how much discipline they hand out!  Mistreatment of employees to the point of injury and loss of business!
bad,"ok place to work if you can get pass the older disrespectful engineers"
bad,this is a terrible company to work for. They hire you to fire you. I worked here and loved the job all up until an injury that was caused due to the company being lazy.
bad,This job is awful if you want to leave home for 3 weeks to go to a training school in Georgia where they talk about how you will get fired more then they teach you anything then it's the job for you on the road you will be on call 24/7/365 you will answer when they call or you will get fired you will be stuck in a hotel for 20+ hours hope you dont have any kids because you wont be seeing them anytime soon and wile you are in training for 6 months there will be no overtime but you will work the hours no detention time for the long hotel stays you will make nothing but 600 a week that's it and they just changed to 12 hr shifts you will also be reminded all the time how easy it is to get fired I mean all the time dont believe me here a little something for you the UNION who is supposed to protect you sells FIRED INSURANCE not for if you get fired but for when you get fired there is a little saying in this company THEY HIRE YOU TO FIRE YOU and dont think that I am just writing this because I am disgruntled because they fired me I realised that the road life wasn't for me I quit
bad,Management is not representative of the people that they serve.  It is made up of uneducated high-school drop outs that have no idea of how to manage individuals with growth mindsets.
bad,"Pays well, good benefits and room to grow. You can go as far as you are willing to work for."
bad,"Poor management, the work environment is stressful, consistently force of overtime to pick up the slack, the constant unprofessionalism causes a great employee overturn"
bad,"Will hire you to fire you.  Has no regard for there employees.  You are just a number to them, and they have no value in you.  Want you to live at work, and have no home life."
bad,Don't bother applying if your knowledgeable in your field and have good work ethics. It's only a waste of your time. This company loves to employ big talkers and none producers.
bad,A lot of moving peices. Hard to keep up with were all tracks are and and locomotives. A lot of acountabilty And stress. Get woke up all hours of night to make reports. Took away company vehicle. Hard on family life.
bad,NS is the absolute worst company i have ever associated with. Management is only focused on cutting jobs and benefits. every day you go to work wondering if it will be your last day.
bad,The pay is good but you need to put up with a lot.  Not very good for a young family or someone who wants to be able to do family things on the weekend.
bad,"Quite honestly if all I wanted to do was cry about being over paid and under worked, along with saying whatever I want when ever I wanted to whom I wanted to with only minor reprecussion's then by all means sell your soul!"
bad,"this company is poorly managed, they look for a reason to fire you instead trying to help you succeed at the job.  Constantly trying to catch you breaking a rule.  Management will go far as to hide in bushes to catch you breaking one of the thousands of rules they have in place."
bad,"highly stressed and under appreciated.  Not open to newer, more efficient methods of management! Very old fashioned, archaic work ethics....terrible and uneducated managers! Nothing to enjoy, just work and no opportunities for advancement!  try to stay away from this place!"
bad,Their work culture is very outdated where they expect employees not to telecommute and be at the desk without any breaks all the day for 9 hours with very unhealthy serious montioring.
bad,Most over managed and mismanaged corporation in the US. Warren Buffet was correct in his in his opinion of Norfolk Southern
bad,Great coworkers and team. Learned and enjoyed a lot working with my team. Involved in critical projects. Decent amount of red tape and politics.
bad,"There is no typical day.  I loved servicing industries.  I didn't like being unproductive.  There was a lot of just sitting around, waiting for other trains to pass.  Co-workers were very much into gossiping about other co-workers.  Very uncomfortable"
bad,"a typical day at my job consist as of. "
bad,"This is a company that puts shareholders and board members above everything else at all costs, they couldn't care less about the average employee or lower management as far as that goes"
bad,"If you want promoted you will work 7 days a week, 365 a year.  After you  receive a promotion you are in fear for your job, even if you do well.  Have to be liked to advance further, it does not matter the quality of work."
bad,"Your life belongs to NS once hired. Your life will be spent waiting on the phone to ring never knowing where you are going or when you will be back. Don't make dinner plans or plans to attend family functions, sure as you do the phone will ring. Pay use to be great, but it hasn't kept up with the cost of living so its average. Your gross pay will look good but once you have Tier 1&2 taxes withheld, union dues(not an option NOT to join), medical insurance, and hit and run(an insurance policy for when you get fired)  you bring home half of your gross.Don't get me wrong pay isn't $10 an hour but its not $30 either. Average salary for a conductor is 50-60k a year. If you never mark off and answer the phone every time it rings you can make 80k. But that means for one year you never had a life. You will walk miles in ballast on 45 degree angle hills in the heat and rain. There is no room for error, Management is very stern with discipline. If you are single, it would be a good job, if you're married then look for another area within NS as transportation is held to the highest of standards"
bad,"Ns has to be the worst company in the country to work for. Mgmt literally hides in the weeds begging to fire you, they will furlough you at the drop of a hat. Outside of decent pay, it's the worst job I've ever had"
bad,This company use to be great to work for...untill the stockholders decided they need record profits every quarter. They cut jobs and then try to force the work on to the employees they keep. You can never get your vacation time when you want unless you make deals to help out management. Its uncertain everyday if you will have a job in a week. Always try to find a way to screw you out of the pay the job in entitled to. Dont work here. You have basically 0 life. After 5 years i could hold regular jobs. Now it's like i just started iver amd cant hold anything
bad,Management comes and goes. The good ole boy system is in full affect. One day you are good employee and the next day you are consider a parasite. No consistency in the handling down of punishment.
bad,One of the most unbelievably mismanaged companies you will ever work for. Can never have the parts you need to fix locomotives. Stocks at all time highs and they’re laying off workers. Wouldn’t recommend a job here for ANYBODY. Have to worry day to day if you’ll have a job the next. One of the worse instances of corporate greed ever.
bad,"The life style is the absolute worst. On call 24/7 365 with little to no off days. Management is terrible, Picky about approving your earned off days. You never know when you will be home, you never know when you be off, you never know when you going to work. In a way you are a slave and they use you how they see fit. Also NS is the lowest paid class I railroad in the United States making far less money for the same amount of work as other railroads. The good part? easiest job iv ever had when it comes to actual work to be performed(most days). Aside from that and a good retirement I have nothing else good to say about this company."
bad,"Do not approve off time that you accumulate , Hire you to fire you! The most depressing place I have ever worked due to management. The actual work is not to bad but the management team are like snakes in the grass!"
bad,"The job itself is not hard. A lot to learn but you have time to adjust as long as you have co-workers who are supportive of your learning curve. Most engineers are but some aren't. That falls on management. Management, in my opinion, is not supportive of the individual and character of their employees. If you are not in the union you basically don't have a leg to stand on even when things are not your fault ad out of your control. Without the union, you are just a body; so new conductors trying to make a career for themselves are at the mercy of a poor management system. "
bad,Incompetent management. No job security. Union's are worthless. Easy job overall but everything that comes with it is not worth the pay and headache of being on call. Don't ever work for a railroad
bad,"I hired at Norfolk Southern in April, 2018. The hiring program included time at the present HQ in Norfolk, VA. The orientation program there was good. Next, I traveled to McDonough, GA, for ""Conductor Boot Camp."" That was a great experience. I earned conductor certification through the company's operating department."
bad,you always had to look over your shoulder. managers were always looking to try and fire you. theyd spend 10000 to train you and spend 20000 to find any reason to fire you.
bad,Working for this company has shown me that Unions no longer have any power to do what they should.  It has also shown me that no matter what you do they will always try to fire you and place any and all blame on you.
bad,"Don't work for this company!"
bad,"Cons"
bad,"Very racist company , who not recommended them to anyone, not hard work just bad people . The good old boys system. Very very very racist"
bad,"LOW PAY, BAD MANAGERS, NO STABLE WORK SCHEDULE"
bad,Don't work there. The implementation of precision railroading has eroded the heart and soul of the railroad.  It is now all about mouthing words of safety and in actuality many things are unsafe.  If you become injured on the job they will send in a team to discredit you and make your life very difficult.  I would not recommend working here.
bad,"This is one of the worst companies to work for, you are literally just a number, they care nothing for you until it is time to get write ups.. in transportation with 9 years and they are constantly cutting the workforce to where you have to have basically 25 years to hold anything.. they hire management out of college that are clueless to the work, but tip top on write ups and rule book “violations”.. on call, nothing on schedule, so absolutely no chance at a normal life.. highly recommend looking away from this company"
bad,"Not what it used to be.  This company could care less about their employees.  Each day is like walking on glass, no work/life balance, no nothing useless managers, who use intimidating and bullying tactics on their employees, with the threat of discipline over the most ticky tack offenses.  Managers are promoted on how many hourly/union employees they write up.  Constant layoffs, to fill shareholders pockets.  Would not recommend to my worst enemy.  5 years ago this was a decent place, but with the implementation of the scam called Precision railroading this place went sour fast."
bad,"Take my advice and find something that you enjoy, and a company that appreciates you. This is not the one! Constant stress of being written up for nonsense or layoffs. This company is only focused on shareholders, not employees. Don’t let the money suck you in!"
bad,Most of the management have no clue or very little experience in railroading. Safety and concern for employees well being is no longer a concern of the company. Personal training is lacking in all departments. If you have no concern for your safety or home life while being under compensated this is a perfect job.
bad,Try to fire u all the time and  ur just a number to the company and they want rid of u.  They don’t pay enough to be away from ur family all the time they think everybody wants to work there
bad,"Don't do it, the company only cares about it's stockholders and your always in the wrong, they hire you to do their best to fire you! No job stability"
bad,What use to be an excellent blue collar high paid job with great benefits is being pillaged by greedy stock holders for a quick buck. Technology has and will continue to make many of these jobs obsolete. The company has a labor agreement with rail labor unions which they regularly breach with no repercussions from the dual toothless unions. (BLET and SMART UTU).
bad,13 year with the company been layed off twice and I don't know if I will will have a job next week. Only industry that offers job insurance for when you get fired. Management is trained to treat you like an inmate's. Company run by stockholders.
bad,Awful MGMT with zero support for line personnel. Everyone in MGMT too busy kissing whoever is above them regardless of necessary functions to complete tasks. MGMT will neg rate you to gain cudos above them. Awful company don't work for them if you can help it.
bad,This was not a bad job when I started but local managers and especially upper management have turned it into a terrible place to work. Who would want to work for a company where day to day you have to worry if you will be laid off?   Horrible culture terrible management.
bad,"You have to be out of your mind to work for this railroad. The only employer in the world that treats its employees any worse is the Devil. Bullying, intimidation, declining your pay, and medieval harassment is what is in store for you with this place. Trust me, move on with your life. You work weekends, holidays, nights, etc...terrible job."
bad,"They care nothing about their employees only stock holders and aren't afraid to say it. Management is foregoing safety and properly repairing equi to cut costs to lower expenses now to drive up stock price.  This is not sustainable and will eventually fail in a couple of years. In the meantime employees and the general public are in danger."
bad,This is a poor place to work. The company strategy is get rid of as many people as possible and treat the ones who stay like slaves with no time off ever. If you have a family don't plan on seeing them.
bad,There is no concern for the employees it is all about money in the share holders pockets. They are very poorly managed and upper management knows little about maintenance .
bad,"Hire you, train you, then spend every waking moment trying to write you up or flat out fire you, no family life, no personal life, complete disregard for negotiated contracts. Supervisors contribute nothing to the bottom line but are treated like gods and your treated like a number"
bad,No future at this job. All yard switching is going to short line. Company does not care about its employees. The attitude there is poor. Management is poor.
bad,"You will be fired. You will be harassed. You will work on call. You will never be appreciated for your work. You will be laid off. Management is treated worse than union employees which makes them miserable and transfers to you. "
bad,"You are not a person. You do not matter. Your family doesn't matter. Dirt is given more respect. You will be told to do something a certain way one day, and then fired the next day for doing what you were asked to do. Management does what they want, when they want, and have no remorse for abusing the general workforce. The Unions that represent the conductors and engineers at the upper levels have all sold their souls to the company and only have their best interests in mind and will sell out their brothers and sisters faster then you can blink if their own pockets get padded more by doing so."
bad,"If they think they can make more without you, then they will dump you. If you are able to keep your job after layoffs, they will expect more from you. If you accept a job in transportation; don’t feel that anything is for certain because they have sent many home the day they showed up for training. I’ve been here for five years; I hate it. They use you, always try to find ways to fire you, and is the only place, I’ve ever worked, that o felt hated their employees."
bad,"The management is a good ole boys network. It's not very friendly to women and they put their own interests over the company's or other employees. It's the railroad, so obviously the hours are horrible, but it's the unqualified managers that make the place miserable. Being smarter than the managers is something that's difficult to deal with because they make less money and they take out on the employees."
bad,"They don’t care about you. Don’t train you. Work you like a dog, when they no longer have use for you, they lay you off. I was there 13yrs and due to corporate greed, they decided to restructure and laid off me along with other men with 30yrs service."
bad,"Love the job and the people I work with but job security is scary, never know when I'm gonna work and constantly moving to different jobs because of someone that has more seniority takes your job."
bad,Money isn't everything value your family and friends first. You'll work every 10hrs. You'll never sleep or see your friends and family again. It's not THAT bad but it's close.
bad,"Was told over and over how much money i'd make."
bad,"it was a nightmare, horrible management, hours sucked stayed out of town a lot ,hid in the woods to catch you doing anything wrong you are constantly looking over your shoulder"
bad,"Horrible culture. Management are complete idiots with no respect."
bad,"If you have no life, or family and friends that you would like to spend quality time with on special occasions and most important if you don't care about your safety, coworkers safety and the general publics safety this might be a good job for you."
bad,Always subject to firing or losing your job. Rules change often. Always cutting jobs and hiring then cutting jobs. It's a total scam.. only those who have 30 years in benefit from working there
bad,"They expect you to jump over mountains to get things done ""quickly"".  Safety is now number 4 on the agenda behind hurry up,  don't worry about that and that's an order.   If you have a family go elsewhere,  the pay is fourth upon the top 4 class 1s, they WILL fire you at will and harass you until they do.   I'm in too deep to leave but I do regret coming here,  The grass isn't always greener."
bad,"Do not apply. Run in the other direction as quickly as you can. You've been warned. They do not care about you, your family or your life. Money is ok. Other railroads get paid more. Look there."
bad,If you are lucky enough to get through their training program the way it is set up now... you will be lucky to NOT suffer a serious injury soon after you get marked up.
bad,good paying job. nothing more .you will have to give up everything  . however if you can stand being cut down . lied to then this is the place for you.
bad,"Everytime you turn around you are looking for a white vehicle to stop and fire you.  They recently qualified some new conductors for the road, (45 days) and are forcing them into the yard jobs. And expect these guys to perform like they have been out here 20 years.  Setting all new hires up for failure. The bad part is our spineless union has let them do it."
bad,"Long hours 75 plus a week, company preaches ethics and diversity, but the reality is the opposite. I would not recommend to anyone who wants to have a family and a life outside the railroad.As a woman the railroad is a challenge and Norfolk Southern does not prepare you for the role they place you in,"
bad,Overall a good company but ran by poor managers that have no experience with dealing with people on a routine basis.  Company places a lot of emphasis on moving trains but doesn't have a set process to get it don.  Long work hours and harsh conditions with no training to better the situation makes it even tougher on all employees to figure out the details on how to make the profits.
bad,Not worth the money to worry if you will have a job the next day. Management is rewarded for finding you violating a rule. Do not let the good pay ruin your life like it did mine
bad,"Benefits are excellent, private retirement, insurance, 401k, everything else sucks about NS. I'm a 5th generation railroader with 12 years of service all with NS and the old Southern, part of what is now NS, and over the last year I have been treated like a number. After 12 years of DEDICATED service, they have cut my job and made me a floater to try to force me to job they cant get any one else to fill and that i didnt even bid on. Our management is stupid. They are college kids that don't know anything about railroading and people who just want to suck up to the bosses and try to move up the corporate ladder. Anyone living in an area where NS runs you'd better get ready because with the idiots running our company there's no telling what's going to happen."
bad,All employee morale is very low. There is little organization in the management. You don't feel valued as an employee. Hardest part-dealing with supervision and payroll.
bad,"Days and nights are long, 12+hours....you can make a  living if you never want to see home....."
bad,"This job was by far the worst I've ever had, with management hiding to spy on you while you work to being constantly on call and working all hours day or night. I never felt more like just a resource to a company than with NS. Quality of life for their employees is only expressed in the pay that you received."
bad,"DON’T DO IT!!!!    Treated like a criminal terrible management, no organization, a two year old  kid could run this company better. They hire you then hide in the bushes to try and fire you. Find other employment TRUST ME!"
bad,With all the job cuts and upper management saying we are taking advantage of them because we don't want to work 16hrs everyday to cover furloughed employees.
bad,"Pay is great, but from the time you are hired they are looking for a way to fire you. Management are all afraid of losing their jobs so employees are written up or fired daily for petty offenses so local supervision can justify their job. There are no days off! You work on call 24/7 from the time you hire until you either get fired for nothing or you somehow miraculously make it to retirement. You work all weekends, all holidays, nights, days, and everything in between..... and then after 14 years you get layed off bc a ceo who has no idea what actually happens on a day to day basis decides they have too many people.......... good luck if you get hired. It's not what they make it out to bewill"
bad,"Horrible company.  No concern whatsoever for employees.  Morale is extremely negative.  Working here is not an occupation, it is a lifestyle comittment."
bad,Don’t even waste your time the only thing good about this company is the pay and couple co workers. They’ll throw a shxt load of work on a single crew and expect it to be done in 8 hrs. Wanna have some OT? Go over 8 hrs and have your tapes pulled to find out why you’re on overtime. They wanna do MORE with LESS!
bad,"This company cares for one thing only. Making money! Employees both hourly and salary are nothing more than replaceable parts. The culture created from the top down is toxic. If family is what you cherish and find important, stay away from this company!"
bad,"Currently furloughed because of ""precision railroading"". Whats that you ask? Streamlining business according to them but its really just firing as many people possible and making the remaining employees work their butts off. Even though its still not enough for them... I mean what kind of company lays guys off right before the holidays. We have families..."
bad,"No matter how much you do you're expendable. Do better! Management knows better than you do, even if they're new and you've been doing your job for years. And dont forget, if the shareholders need more money for their million dollar estate's you will be thrown to the curb before the holidays. We dont care about your family and children."
bad,Work culture is poor/ management hiding in bushes to write you up for slight safety infraction. Poor morale and no job security! I was furloughed after being told my job is safe!
bad,They are making record profits while killing American jobs and communities.  Catering to wallstreet and forgetting that what feeds America keeps America strong.  Getting material from other countries while exploring ways to outsource work to other cheap and sometimes unsafe areas. And if it fails it always someone else fault.
bad,"Cutthroat, only care about profit and shareholders. Careless of employees or wellbeing. You’ll just be a number, not a life to them. The tides can change any day and you’ll wake up without a job or lose your position you’ve been holding."
bad,"You live on call 24/7. The railroad is a life style, not just a career. This is the only career that offers you “job insurance” because as soon as you are hired they try to fire you. Management only moves up by handing out discipline. The company goes against the union contract daily. Without warning the company will cut dozens of jobs and lay you off."
bad,The toxic nature of every aspect of the environment that you are exposed to daily will make you hate your daily responsibilities.  Management continues to operate like it is the 1940's.  Threats and lies are just common parts of the daily conversations that are handed down as management assures that you understand their dominance.
bad,Never worked.  Always laid off. Management seemed more interested in trying to fire someone than finding new industries to service. Job would be a lot better if you could work all year.
bad,"The saddest part about the new push for a cleaner, more customer-focused, efficient railroad, is that the Senior C-Suite Managers are trying to sustain life within their Departments, but mid- level managers are extremely ill equipped and not educated enough to trickle those operating plans downstream. Employees have the lowest morale points that have been observed for the past 10 years. C-Suite Execs do the right thing and get rid of the waste at the top tier, only to spur wiggle room for more toxic growth at mid-level. Mid-level managers promote based on allegiance and not job performance. SPIRIT values are a slogan and nothing else. There is no teamwork between Departments, while the lack of integrity and finger-pointing amongst management and rank and file Agreement employees is a massive safety concern. Unfortunately, paranoia runs deep in the veins of those who are promoted, which largely impacts thoughtful  decision making abilities. This is primarily because they lack the knowledge to do the job, but have run the political gamut long enough to be tossed a bone. Incredibly sad for such a promising and once thriving community of railroaders amongst Class 1 roads."
bad,"The management is terrible and doesn't care about their employees. From the second you're hired,  they're tying to find a reason to fire you.  The unions are weak and dues are expensive. The union leaders are worthless. Benefits are okay,  but the pay is below the national average for railroad employees. Enjoy family life and have hobbies outside of the railroad?  Forget it.  "
bad,"I worked here for over 9 years, and they owned my life the whole time. You are on call ALL the time, never know when to sleep, eat, see you family, etc. The management culture here is the worst I've every seen. The moto is they hire you to fire you. Everyone buys job insurance so you can still get paid when they do fire you. I got fired while learning a new position that I was forced to do. Best money I've ever made, but 9 years I'll never back in my life."
bad,"Mom always said not to say anything if you don't have anything good to say. But, I wouldn't want anyone to get excited to work for the railroad and then get crushed like I did. I believe at one point during a derailment I worked 35 hours in a row. The regional manager took our off days away for 15 days because our region was not performing well. Our region went from Kansas City - Michigan - Louisville. I was located out of St. Louis where our numbers were well, still did not get a day off. This whole process was going on as we were implementing clean sheet railroading. Needless to say there was not one employee in our company happy, unless you were a union employee wanting the overtime. Our St. Louis terminal manager literally slept in his office several days in a row. The positive out of this.... I can put put out fires, manage multiple contracts, ensure timely deliveries, keep within budget, and operate a 3-400 million dollar operation."
bad,"Furloughs consistently happen and they just expect you to “pack up and move” when you do get furloughed from one location. There is a chance when you do move to another location you can get furloughed with 0 compensation. It doesn’t matter how qualified you get or how hard of a worker you are, seniority prevails in this kind of work environment."
bad,Nonweekend off jobs even at 20 years of service.No room for advancement.no sick time no comp time.Not allowed to use single vacation days.Hostile work environment.
bad,The divorce rates are high at this company because they put job before family.  It's toxic in HR which trickles down to the other departments.  They overtly cater to and fast track minorities to management positions and hire based on racial quotas and not based on merit.  Company has lacked foresite for so long that its left them scrambling to diversify their business in a changing environmental landscape.
bad,"The job is not difficult. Management doesn’t have your best interest. Always looking for any reason to write you up so they can advance. The company is shedding employees, hiring contractors just to squeeze out more profits for Wall Street."
bad,"Norfolk southern is unwilling to cooperate with any of your needs they belittle you."
bad,"Job is easy. Dealing with petty bosses and bad shifts and hrs sucks. Pay is good, health and dental good. It seems they go out of their way to make life hard on you. Abolish your job so they can give you Wednesday Thursdays off. no more then 10% of work force can have a weekend day off."
bad,NS doesn’t care about employees at all nor do the unions who cater to NS they value stockholders perception much more than the men and women who keep the company profitable they will lay off people who have dedicated there lives to the company without a second thought just to gain a few dollars per share on stocks but good news for stock holders CEO Jim squires will do anything to make money for you!!!!!
bad,"Worked for NS for 8 years, bumped around a few times to stay working. I cut my teeth there in my railroad career, so that I don't regret at least getting a start there. BUT..."
bad,"Awful management. Trainmaster’s literally hide in the weeds and try to fire u. No schedule at all, no home life, live at work and are on call 24/7 365. Company doesn’t compare about their employees and have laid people off on Christmas Day. New hires will spend 10+ years on call with no schedule and be laid off in their first couple years then once they finally get some seniority go u will be forced to become an engineer and start over from the bottom again."
bad,"They hire you to fire you,hid in weeds trying to catch you breaking rules,if they don`t catch you they invent something.allow 3 days off in 90 day period or you are wrote up."
bad,Management is not supportive of staff. The culture is toxic and everyone is out for themselves. Old school corporate culture that is harmful to employees.
bad,"They get you with the pay and benefits but management is always trying to fire you or write you up over anything they can so they get a bigger bonus and they are cutting jobs left and right  and contracting out our jobs while the hire ups keep getting pay raises and bonuses, and they do not care about you or your safety they just want more from you while they are waiting to get rid of you, my first day there someone who was there 15 years said congratulations on getting in now they’ll spend the rest of your career trying to fire you and I thought he was joking but now I know how true it is."
bad,"You would do well to steer clear of this pit. The people here are a miserable lot. Gossip, lies, bullies, harassment.  From the front office  right on down the line. Most of your fellow enployees will make a point to go in the office and slander.Will steal your tools if ya leave your locker open . It really is like junior high and the management is largely a joke. Only a few good souls there.. Honestly do not know how they live on a daily without wanting to walk away.  If you do go here, after the initial hiring process, they never drug test again. Ever. If there is even a rumor it might happen, those with tenure find out and mark off.  So. That is one bonus for you if you roll that way. Feel free to booze it up or smoke up. They never check. But they will check your hearing from time to time . Just not real concerned with how safe ppl are showing up to work still buzzed or red eyed. Coal pier 6. Take your tools and run. Definitely run if you are a chick. They treated them like dirt."
bad,"Worst company I’ve worked for. Management was poor from foreman up. You are required to work 12 hours with a 20 minute lunch. No breaks   Most stress I’ve had ever. In construction you will be digging with a shovel by hand for hours on end. While the excavator sits and smiles at you because they are afraid to dig and hit current working lines.  My construction gang was lazy couldn’t get anything themselves and left garbage everywhere on job site expecting new or lowest seniority to clean up after them. Foreman ward sits in truck for 12 hours and gets out 1 time if at all.  Hostel workers and work environment    I wouldn’t wish my worst enemy to work here.  If you have a family, get used to sending them post cards as well because you will see them 1-2 times a month if your lucky"
bad,"NS is worried about stockholders only, this comes at the expense of the customer and employees. Jobs are being reduced, eliminated, consolidated in order to save a buck. This directly related to rail safety and customer service, numbers which are hidden from stockholders by management. Quality of life for employees is horrible but you have to accept that coming into the job."
bad,The money for this job was good. the managment was terrible. If you were not personal friends with the supervisor you pretty much had a target on your back.
bad,"This company does not care about their employees.  They will use you for all you are worth and then toss you out at the first opportunity, pay is good but that is it."
bad,"I never imagined that I would need job insurance for a job.  My job is to make sure the public is safe around railroad equipment.  If I fully do my job I am threatened, and told to stop looking.  I have worked with excellent people that have been pulled out of service, taken to trial, and fired.  If you go to trial it is a 100% chance of getting fired."
bad,"Not a place to think about for career choice strong culture of bias again minorities and women. they pay well but i think its hush money to keep you quiet, I was there for almost 10 years it was the worst time of my life all they hire is people from the woods and mountains that are social misfits but fit right in with the companies way of thinking."
bad,Good money but terrible supervision in the transportation department and were always trying to fire you almost everytime you went to work or tried to get a day off since they wanted you to work 24/7 365.
bad,There seems to be a constant struggle between workers trying to do less than as little as possible and management trying to get workers to do more than possible.  Weekends off are only for those who have been there about 20 years.
bad,"Try not to get fired daily. Keep your head low and your morale lower. Do not plan to see your wife or kids. Forget about the burden of proof in any instance, whatever they say you did wrong becomes the truth."
bad,"Was very suprised with the lack of on the job training after visiting Norfolk training center.  Every two weeks after the 6 weeks training in Georgia, we meet for a so called taining session. Which was more like story time for the instructor.  "
bad,"would not recomend working for this company.  Not a great environment.  not great all around.  N/A"
bad,All the management are low life individuals. They will hide in the bushes and watch you for hours while you are working outside in the 100 degree weather or in the pouring rain so they find something wrong you are doing so they can issues you out a discipline letter. The company doesn't always want to pay you for what you are entitled to. You are on call 24 hours 7 days week. If you like being away from family and don't have any friends and don't care about having any activities until you are 60 years old. Then this is a job for you !!!
bad,"When everyone hears you work at the railroad they always say.. “oh you have a good job!” Well that is simply not the case anymore. Years and years ago it was a rewarding and fun place to work. Now that the railroad is trying to squeeze every bit of profit from every corner and cut as man jobs off as they can, it’s simply just a well paying terrible place to work with no hope. The pay isn’t worth the crazy hours. You really do sell your soul to the railroad when you get hired. Which is why I up and quit after 9 years."
bad,"The job has changed so much & gotten so bad that I'm now seeking other employment even after all these years I've put in with them. Family time or time to yourself is almost non-existent anymore."
bad,"I worked HARD there, and sacrificed everything for 15 YEARS, missing out on priceless memories with friends, family, etc for the company. Out of NO WHERE, even being at the top of the seniority roster in my craft, they laid off majority of the shop, even though they had all time high stocks and profit but wanted even more profit for those clearly selfish soulless “higher ups”. Now, my family and I are losing everything, home, had NO Christmas for my son, and having a baby in two months with no hope or anything in our future!!"
bad,This company cut me after 5 years to help reduce costs for their share holders. At this company you will be just a number. The days are long lots of call outs in the middle of the night and the supervisors are heartless when it comes to family time.
bad,"they are fully a corporate company. they dont care about you. they will fire you or lay you off just to get a job advancement or to get more ""profit"". the vacation is terrible. no sick days. 1 personal day after 8 years. you will not have off any holidays trust me unless they get bought out stay away."
bad,I started this company in hopes of making it a career move. Little did I know starting out was only giving a small starting amount which does not help a family person. Constantly traveling during your training period and pay does go up going through each stage but it’s making it through all stages of training to still be the low man on the totem pole. It’s pretty much based off of seniority. I say for a young person shoot for it and stack your money.
bad,"All managment does is try to fire you. That is their job. They follow you and make you stressed. Rules change daily, so something that was okay to do for the past 3 years was okay, but today it is not and a trainmaster saw you do it so now you get written up and possible fime off un paid. Yearly wage has gone down and stress has risen. Not worth it."
bad,If the management wasn’t out to get you the employees who didn’t care for you being there or who valued their job over yours were. It was nice to learn a lot of different things I’ve never done before but after that I got to the point I didn’t know who really was looking out for me or working against me. Does not pay enough for the lifestyle they want you to live.
bad,I was fortunate to come in at a time that let me gain enough seniority to not be laid off. I always enjoyed the work and co-employees. I respected some of management. I really wanted to maintain a good working relationship with everyone from those around me to management and above. After 17 years there I understand why everyone from every department hates the company. They actively work against employees trying to fire them.  Norfolk Southern is morally bankrupt.They do spend the majority of their time trying to find some kind of fault to discipline you by.
bad,"Norfolk  southern  is in the process of eliminating  jobs .if you have a job do not quit it to work for NS , very likely  they would displace you in a short  time after going to work for them .you will receive  no unemployment  benefits  if you have less than 5 months in the previous year  after july 1 very unstable  work very in the dark as to what to do once you hire on .reconsider any job offer from N/S"
bad,Was furloughed twice in 6 years not bc of lack of business but bc it’s all about the shareholders in this company. I would never tell anyone to apply! You’re on call all the time and you have 48hrs off but can get called up to the minute of b4 your 48 starts.
bad,"Quit a good job in hopes of bettering myself and my family, only to get laid off before training was complete. The company as a whole is failing and doesnt care about its employees. Strongly discourage anyone to join the railroad through them."
bad,Employees stay at NS because of the benefits. The company is very siloed so its hard to move between departments. The culture there was horrible. No one cares about doing a good job or about the company. No work/life balance and they don't care about your well being. They're currently laying off employees while making record profits. The company just follows what other railroads are doing (ex. when other railroads started implementing PSR that's when they decided they should do it). As far I know most of the employees are looking for other careers somewhere else because its a dead end.
bad,Was great at one time they won’t allow you to take your paid time of their training sucks they hand you a piece of paper or pamphlets. Then you are trained you make a mistake they want you gone. It’s never their fault I have seen officials make up lies to fire people to get promoted. Only job I worked where you carry job insurance in case the dismiss you
bad,"The work is not hard, but is very dangerous. Take care of your own safety. The managers are pretty terrible to work for. Dont take my word for it, read the reviews, and/or go find out for yourself. If you work in transportation, i.e. conductor, or engineer, you will make great money, you will meet some great people, but make no mistake, you will miss a lot of time with your family. They own you, and if thats not a problem for you, go for it. They do their best to warn you ahead of time so take serious consideration. The management is seriously terrible. Its a very old school type of mentality. I guess thats the reason the union is still able to hold on in the industry, its still needed. If your interested in working for NS but would like to be home everyday, stay away from transportation. There are plenty of other jobs in the yards that compensate well. Good Luck!"
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at Norfolk Southern to anyone who doesn't have an immediate back up plan. You always have the stress and worry of possible Furlough and in many cases you won't ever get called back. When you're working you do very well financially but it can be taken away without any warning.
bad,"Norfolk folk Southern has an attitude that you are expendable and if you break  they will replace you."
bad,"This is poorly managed. The supervisors think there job is to dismiss as many people as possible. If they don't change and change quickly, one of the other major Railroads will buy N.S."
bad,Management changes in the past few years has resulted in a poor workplace environment. I would look elsewhere. The moral among employees is very poor.
bad,"work 10+ years & not hold job. pay union dues 4 nada."
bad,The workplace culture here became toxic in my location after very poor leaders were brought in and put in charge.  Overall the job was not hard and there are some really great people here at the craft level.
bad,"poor management, terrible job, do not work for this company, stay away, treated like a dog, hostile work environment, away from home way too often, not worth the pay unless you are single and have no life or family"
bad,This company views all employees as numbers. I was excited to work here and over tome learned that the managers are incompetent. The pay is excellent benefits are excellent.
bad,"If you are young, have no family and willing to put in 14-16 hours a day, you can go far in this company as almost all promotions come from within. Having said that, it is CYA all day. You will be burned for any little thing you do wrong. You will have 4-5 conference calls a day, that could easily be solved with one or even an email. You will be micromanaged like you never have before. As a supervisor, if you aren't writing your people up for every little infraction, you are seen as not doing you job, regardless of how well you run your operation. The salary is below what the other Class 1 railroads pay their supervisors, but it's still decent money. You will be called to work your off days, give up vacations, work way past whenever you shift ends. The work life balance at this place is horrible. Senior management sees this company one way, but on the ground level it is totally different. They preach positive reinforcement to change the culture, but all that goes right out the window when it comes to saving a buck and even that is a bunch of hypocrisy. They will step over a dollar to pick up a penny. Be very weary of this place and be prepared to be stressed to no end while trying to do your job."
bad,Wall Street is dictating to many business decisions when the decisions should be based on customer needs.  Profits and shareholder dividends are all that matter currently in the railroad industry.
bad,"Stressful job. Team leads are horrible. Union position, so if you are hired on new, you will get a bad shift.  Expected to work 24/7. Very stressful work environment"
bad,"This job requires you to be responsible for any and all activity that occurs on your territory during your shift.  For a job that has such a direct effect on the company's bottom line, the attitude that they have towards our job is demeaning and flippant.  Discipline for rule violations can be both excessively harsh (dismissal for a first violtion) and completely arbitrary (the same people getting different punishments for the same violation).  The company has no regard for the extensive knowledge we have of our territories and the people that work on them, and instead view us as interchangeable.  The company continues to add work to our jobs with no regard for its impact on our ability to do our work safely and now have decided to force all 400+ of us nationwide to move away from our homes to a new consolidated office in a much more expensive area of the country."
bad,"good money, good benifits, however, the turn over rate is insain. they constantly look for reasons.to dismiss you. we had over 10managers in 6 years.. lots of people fired. then alot of cancer deaths after retirement.. may or may not be related, but im sure it is."
bad,get treated terrible worst place i ever worked. Management has no idea what goes on cant use vacation forced to work odd shifts for straight time. Bye
bad,"80 hour weeks are often required with many shifts being 6pm to 6am and longer, and often with switching between day shifts and night shifts on a weekly basis (not healthy). Company culture is extremely silo'd with each department going to extreme ends to avoid being blamed for anything. Needless to say cross department functionality was often compromised. "
bad,"Worked here for a year and a half. Have not nor will I ever recommend this job to anyone. "
bad,A typical day is nothing more then individuals in leadership roles who are not deserving and lack leadership competencies. The company doesn't recognize hard work they promote only former athletes such as college football players and women. It is in most cases stressful and work life balance is a major problem. Outside of financial gain most are not put in ideal situations to be successful.
bad,"Work from home which was nice, but company only cared about profits. Customers were not their number one priority only completing the job and getting it closed out in the system."
bad,"Worst management ever. Not an exaggeration. From the top down. I've been here eight years and it's gotten continually worse. Not just my feelings, but across the board my co-workers feel the same! I could give a hundred examples , but not enough room. If you want a paycheck go for it , but you won't be happy"
bad,"This is a typical huge company with the attitude of ""We don't care if you go or stay... there are 1000's of people that want your job"""
bad,"24 hours on call, great money and benefits, management is horrible and very biased"
bad,If I could turn back they hands of time I would take back my 10 months working at Lambert Point Yard as a Carman. Being a student carman and not able to get overtime just cause me to get behind on Bill's. And then I got laid off on my day off what about the Union you ask there not worth the writing or my time explaining it.
bad,"The pay is good and the people you work with are great.  When you start you will be on call 24/7.  After 10+ years you will be promoted to Engineer and likely spend the rest of your career on call.  You will make sacrifices in all areas of your life for the railroad, and they will repay you with constant badgering and attempts to fire you.  Good luck you're going to need it."
bad,Norfolk was the worst company I ever worked for. Great pay but the company wants to fire you for everything. They laid off lots of great workers all over corporate greed
bad,the railroad was awesome when I started and I enjoyed going to work for years.  eventually they started treating every employee and customer like they were a number.  constant job cuts and eliminations.  supervisors are scared for their jobs so they mess with workers constantly to justify their positions.  its getting worse by the day.  cut the ranks so deep and have run away all the small business we used to service.  benefits are good but the premiums are getting higher every few months and the employees are having to pay more and more out of pocket for all medical services.  for the first 5 to 15 years you will probably be on extra list that fills vacant jobs - u will never know when you are working or what location.
bad,Lack of direction in company makes a stable employment non existing.  Layoffs are always looming.  Job security is non existent. The work itself is fulfilling. What you learn is cool and great as far as the expertise required.  The problem always comes with the lack of job security and always wondering if you are going to get laid off.
bad,"The union that controls Norfolk Southern has allowed for an environment that stifles on job improvement. Foreman are always in fear of losing their job to new employees. After gaining access into the union, employees no long tale their job seriously, resulting in new hires having to work twice as hard to prove themselves, while senior employees can slack off on their work. This is due to the union having a stranglehold on the company, therefore there is no threat of job less or repercussions of actions."
bad,"While railroad jobs can be stressful everywhere, I felt that the management's Us VS Them attitude made the job almost unbearable.  There are very good managers working at Norfolk Southern, unfortunately - there are more bad than good."
bad,The work atmosphere at Norfolk Southern has become extremely toxix. It has gotten worse over the last 5 years. The inexperience of the middle management personal make it tough to work at. The people in transportation them selves are the one's that make it somewhat tolerable. It is very sad that after 21 years at Norfolk Southern I'm looking to go elsewhere.
bad,"This Company is the worst.  They mess with your pay, management hides in the weeds waiting for you to make a mistake and then tries to strong arm you into admitting you did something wrong on purpose.  Just not a good work environment.  I would never choose to work in a union job again."
bad,"As a supervisor, handling the operations is fine. But upper management forces you to focus on finding your employees violating rules creating a horrible environment and work culture. The expect you to dedicate your every waking moment to the job."
bad,"Employee morale has been low for years. You are nothing more than a number and there is no such thing as job security. Company is so concerned with hiring college grads for management, they forget to hire anyone with even an ounce of common sense."
bad,"NS  was at first a class act and a dream come true for myself since I respected the entire railroad industry as a whole. I found out what it means-dog eat dog world and this company is full of this type behavior. You implement safety and as long as it doesn’t upset anyone, your OK but the moment you do, regulars less of how safe you are not how dedicated you are, the gAme of playing favorites is and always has been the problemhas ALWys"
bad,"management will stab you in the back then act like your friend the next day. You are a person that gets the work done, thats all they care about. You will get laid off due to work being slow then hired back a week later, i have never seen anything like it. The reason people work here? Pay is high and benefits are good."
bad,"Not a stable place to work. Bad management, can not trust anyone. Day to day employment is uncertain. Pay is great, 401k. Work long hours, no comp days"
bad,Company is poorly run at best. Terrible decision making which cost a lot of waste. Management have no clue about runners by a business or dealing with employees. The company doesn’t care about you. Your just a number. It doesn’t matter whether you work hard or not
bad,The job is stressful you get very little rest and time for your family. You may have to chase work in other cities and even other states. The management is very difficult to deal with.
bad,"After 11 years of service - Not valued as an employee.  When injured on the job, I was let go.  Not given the opportunity to change positions within the company."
bad,Management knowingly breaks contract agreements and safety protocol for the benifit of the stockholders and without any disregard for the safety of their customers or employees.
bad,Don't do it. Always gone from home. Good to be single but not to be a family man. The supervisors are add kissers. You can make a little money but is it really worth it.
bad,"Norfolk Southern is not an employer for those seeking long term employment. Their goal is to run a railroad without employees. In pursuit of this goal, officers cultivate an environment that breeds resentment and chaos. Work discipline, pride in workmanship, and ethics will do nothing to for you at this employer. Fraud, lies, employee discipline, and intimidation are the tools of the trade within this organization. ""I like my hammer"" is a common statement by officers in the field. You will be stressed, you will be intimidated, and you will be ask/required to make calls wide right of federal, state, and corporate policies."
bad,Managers are on call 24/7 no work life balance! There is a lack of communication between management. They do not care about their employees. Will call you at anytime about anything.
bad,"The pay and benefits do not make it worth sacrificing your time and home life. On average, you will be away from home 5 out 7 days a week and never know when you are coming or going to work. Expect lay offs if hired because this company is managed poorly from top to bottom and cut back to make profits look good on paper."
bad,"the workers were great. the company and management not so much. the workers were really great people and did our jobs. the management was always talking down to the workers. the main reason i left was for just over 19 years i spent most of my time in a hotel room away from my family. the money was great, but my family is better."
bad,not an employee friendly company.. more concerned with the bottom line than they are the well being of the employee.. they furlough way too much..I’ve been employed there for 9yrs. An have been furloughed 2x now for a total of almost 4 yrs.
bad,"I really enjoyed working as a conductor there. I still find myself missing the job culture and lifestyle... But the trainmasters and other management made the experience working there horrible. They truly act like cops that's looking to meet a quota. They'll ""fire"" you for the most minor incident. They truly don't mind throwing you out on the streets. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE."
bad,"Horrible managers who write you up for every little rule infraction they can. Management also thinks it is their railroad, and it would be unsuccessful or less profitable without their brilliant minds and ideas. Locomotive fleet is dated and not maintained in the slightest. Company resources or capital upgrades are basically wasted because no input is gathered from hourly workers."
bad,NS was once a great family company. The introduction of Precision Scheduled Railroading has been a poison that will cripple the entire rail industry. They threw away a lot of great employees so the shareholders could gain a few cents on their return. The infrastructure is crumbling. Worker morale is at an all time low.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for the department of Crew Management under Norfolk Southern because there is no quality of life. You have to start off on call and that can last up to two years or more before you can obtain a regular schedule. Once you have obtained a regular schedule, your days off will definitely be Monday through Wednesday on 2nd or 3rd shift. Moreover, you are only allotted one week of vacation your first week and two weeks of vacation until you have eight years of seniority."
bad,"Good pay for the work but don't count on having a job long. New CEO blows worse than the previous. Cut over 200 people in one day, so much for unions helping you."
bad,Its a great job but the management in this area is terrible. They will do anything to get you fired. They actual set traps up to try to catch you doing something wrong or they make up things to get you fired.
bad,"not a great place to work, unless you like being on call 24/7 and living your life next to the telephone , management is very poor and inexperienced , the new managers and young and first jobs out of college with no railroad experience whatsoever"
bad,The most enjoyable thing about my job with Norfolk Southern was a 24 hours off. Due to poorly skilled management teams without pervious experience and the nightmare of poorly trained new employees. These situations made horrible working environment for all employees. Every man and woman working any shift seemed to express their low morale of higher management decisions. The transportation dept. seemed like the top of the dead end section effecting the effective movement of freight.  These company Officials would severely punish all who mistakenly broke rules due in part to how the officials interpretation of the rule. All were found guilty despite evidence of no damage or wrong doing.This company fires their employees without regard to simple levels of punishment. I have learned for my time at Norfolk Southern Study to the rules of procedures closely.
bad,Well I always wanted to work for the railroad and busted my butt to get in ..you are told how great it is and all this company positive culture etc ..I loved this job the pay was awesome and guess what I got furloughed ... After all I went through especially the training and it's over ..union is a joke where is the job protection ..I got bumped out of my postion !! Sorry if you are thinking about the railroad think again ...it's an extreme risk ...now their cutting few thousand positions ...look elsewhere ..shame on Norfolk all they. Are about is yearly profit not employees just ask around ..bring people in due to offering great hourly pay ..then send you to the curb ..I really feel bad for a few friends I worked with ..they had little kids at home and were afraid that they would loose their homes ..very sad
bad,"would not go back o work fro them personally  "
bad,"at Norfolk Southern you can expect a position that includes good pay, good benefits, good co-workers. Good retirement package for those who  age.reach retirement"
bad,terrible atmosphere to work. you will never be good enough. unrealistic expectations. complex rules they want you to violate but come down on you when you do
bad,"Lied to alot to faced if you mess up by accident they have it out for you, favoritisms,claiming they have no work when there is.days off for no apparent reason."
bad,"No advancment, old boy network. Management worries more about advancement then the railroad operations. Very very little communication, often questions go unanswered for weeks."
bad,Management does nothing to lift the workforce up or give them the tools to succeed.  Employees are treated as slaves and if they do not comply they will be fired.
bad,Company is purely profit driven with no regard for employees only shareholders .Company makes record profits and still cuts employees to make larger profits.
bad,With the implementation of psr. You become a slave to a paycheck you arw not appreciated and your job is threatened every day from the first day of employment. More so now and with more fact behind it than ever before. Management is actually scared for their jobs as well and cant come to grips with the fact they may also be let go
bad,"This place sucks,long hours, longer hotel stays, working on call 24/7, all the managers that don't do anything to support the employees, all the do is hide and watch and listen for mistakes to be made and rules to be broken so they can discipline you"
bad,"1 year contract, the team I was on had a snake for a manager. They treat their contractors like second class citizens. I literally had my development station (2 monitors, mouse and keyboard) stripped down to just a laptop to give the peripherals to a new employee. Team would go to lunches, etc, contractors would not get invited."
bad,"Indifferent. It’s a job. If you work there, stay to yourself and do the bare minimum to keep your job. Times have changed but not the culture. Buyer beware."
bad,"My typical day when I was traveling would be get up early and go to each location that needed IT upgrades."
bad,This company has terrible living conditions.  Management has no hours of service.  Plan on working for over 24 hours straight and getting screwed by those above you.  Decision makers are completely incompitant.
bad,"NS sends trainees to Georgia for a very extensive conductor training and only give employees three weeks to learn a lot of information.  If you fail a test during this training, you will be sent home and cannot collect railroad unemployment."
bad,You will have a great retirement but will have a horrible work family balance. The management is always looking to fire so you must always be on top of your game.
bad,"stressful place to work each and every day even on the weekends "
bad,"Not for everybody but if u like travelling it is perfect. not as they portray in training camp. they throw to the wolves, don't tell what to expect you learn the hard way. They are quick to fire people."
bad,"Stressful working environment with lityle to no concern for work life balance.  Some manage through intimidation and micromanaging.  Telecommuting is offered to some, but generally discouraged."
bad,"work day.. 12 hours of mismanagement"
bad,"The job is what you’d expect. Long days, very unpredictable schedule, and very stressful at times. All of that would be fine given the decent pay. The problem with NS is the company culture. Specifically the culture of the management. It’s very clear from the beginning that it isn’t the responsibility of the Trainmasters to ensure safe, efficient, and effective transportation of their cargo. It is their responsibility to harass, threaten, and discipline their workforce. Extreme consequences for minor mistakes. The more discipline distributed, the better a Trainmaster looks, the more the Trainmaster promotes. Absolute terrible business model and culture. To be clear, my time spent there I managed to stay out of any serious trouble, but only out of complete luck. I was harassed often, and watched others treated the same. I watched conductors fired for the most trivial reasons. The money is not worth the hostile environment. I would never recommend this company to someone I care about."
bad,"all the company cares about is themselves. they do not want you to be home whatsoever, and they will make you work every single holiday and weekend if they can. Railroading was know as a big pay job a long time ago but not anymore, with the amount of taxes taken out, union dues, rr retirement, 401k, insurance you basically bring home less than someone that works 9-5 and is home with there families while you are away every night. A typical week with the railroad goes like this you are on call so when they call you get 2 hrs to show up dressed and ready to work then you get on a train for up to 12 hrs and ride or stop and work industries depending, once you make it to your destination they put you up on a dorm in lets say a not so good area for no less than 10 hrs for rest and this is away from home you might stay there 24 hrs depending but once you're called back out to get a train to take home the next day you'll spend up to 12 hrs on it then when you get off you'll have 10 hrs off work not including drive time and after that time is up they will call you back to work and you'll be gone away from home again for another 24 to 36 hours. you work 6 days straight with 48 hrs off meaning its not 2 day its 48 hrs. If you get off at 10 pm and it takes an hr to get home well everyone is asleep by the time you get there then you have the next day off and the day after that you go back to work at 10pm so you don't get two full days off just one basically."
bad,They are forcing people out and cutting costs all over due to Wall street.  Company was a great place to work several years ago. They do tend to have the good ole boy mentality when applying for company positions.
bad,All I am going to say that I would not recommend working for this company in its current state.  Top heavy management has completely lost focus.  You have been warned
bad,"Speaking soley on my experiences in my department, I would not recommend this company to anybody.  Management team was ineffective as the management style flowed from the top.  Those leaders are retired now so the potential for change is there.  In all fairness, other departments should not be judged on the experiences in this department."
bad,"Compensation is not enough for the hours you will be working. "
bad,"Unhealthy eat/sleep schedules... tons of mental stress having no schedule of when you’ll work or what you’ll be home for.  Miss family events, friends, childerens sporting events, etc, etc. get your mandatory 10hrs rest time after 40hrs gone and may go right back for another 40... or get your rest and then possibly get called 10-12hrs after when you are tired again and ready to go back to sleep.. so next time, maybe you stay up a while in order to time your rest for a train you might catch later but get called by surprise on something that came out of nowhere.  Now you work a 12 hr train and have been up 36hrs"
bad,If you like being told how to do your job then this is the place for you! They live to micro manage and find reasons to suspend their workers.  This has the culture of a good ole boys club.
bad,This is not the place to work if you seek a long fulfill career. Culture is to over hire and slow down work to save as much as they can. Poor management and bad company practices.
bad,"As a conductor your pay will be completely inconsistent.  They have ok benefits that get worse every time you get a new contract. You will make less than conductors made 10 years ago, and that is not adjusting for inflation or cost of living. Management preaches safety, but pushes employees to brake safety rules. When you break a safety rule there are no warnings, management goes straight to a write up for everything even when they tell you to do it."
bad,"Don't apply for it.  There are a lot of things you are not aware of when going through the process, No Vacation for 1-2 years of starting.  Morale is low. Hard to advance."
bad,Norfolk southern railroad use to be a descent job but with all the management always sneaking around trying to fire you it makes for very stressful situations and a continuous distractions
bad,"Management is by far the worst part of this job. You are micromanaged by someone whose ink just dried on their college degree and thinks they know everything because of it. The actual working jobs are constantly getting cut while there are more while more management positions being added. The pay/Insurance/retirement are good. The work is not very difficult and your coworkers are the best part of the job. You're never truly on a set schedule until you have at least 5-6 years, Then you go to engine school and it starts all over again."
bad,Company wasn't very good on diversity at that time. I understand that they have improved in that area.
bad,Major disconnect between upper management and the personnel who do the actual work. The company is going through a massive down sizing. The railroad is not what it used to be.
bad,"Poor management and were really fast to try and promote family members and friends  seniority based with friend benefits. Wouldn’t pay travel expenses and we drove upwards of 1,000 miles a week in our personal vehicles"
bad,You're working outside in the elements. Management is always breathing down your neck threatening to fire you. Seniority based job so you have alot of incompetent people that have security over you and will prevent you from holding good assignments. Really good pay and benefits though.
bad,"Upper level management and CEO of company could care less to put you on the street and let your family starve. No work/home life balance. Low employee morale with no desire to improve. Personal days and vacations are never approved. Not allowed to be sick more than 3 days during 90-day period or subject to discipline, all the while working 24/7 in all weather elements."
bad,"If you want to work for a company that would fire you in a heartbeat, has zero respect for their employees or customers,and expects you to devote 100 percent of your life to them this is your company."
bad,If you want to work for a company who does not value its employees and will put shareholder profits above everything else this is the perfect company.
bad,Good salary and benefits but downsizing is putting thousands out of work. If it were not for the furloughs I would recommend this job to family and friends
bad,I was really excited to start here. Chicago was miserable. You have to learn seven yards. You can get called to anyone any night. They will send you out even if you aren’t qualified. There is no work and life balance.
bad,"I would like to work for an employer that actually cares about their employees. I have always been appreciated and have appreciated my employer, but they make you feel like you’re not valuable."
bad,Bad management no time off stressful work environment and sometimes hostile work environment pay sucks really went down hill since PSR and PTC has taken over please the investors
bad,"I've worked for several railroads, but this company seems to always be behind the 8 ball. There's no communication between management and local personnel.  You make more money when you're suspended than if you were at work. Lying no good for nothing company. Benefits were great, but I wouldn't recommend this company for at least 5 more years."
bad,"Work days as a transportation operations supervisor often left me with little to no sleep. 12+ hour shifts, being on call (only to be called out repeatedly). Sleeping in 2 hour pieces here and there is no way to live. For a company focused on safety, this type of work practice only leads to accidents and injuries. Quality of life is difficult to have in this position."
bad,"Great for employee with no family, pay was decent but not enough for time constantly away from home be ready for furloughs your first 5-10 years at anytime"
bad,It's not for everyone your on call 24/7 working every shift in one week.  Management will literally hide and try to catch you breaking a rule to fire you so they can move up the poll. Pay is decent sounds better then what it is you have a lot of deductions. Can be fun at times it has its days you work in all weather climates
bad,"If you are selected as new hire to go to Mcdonough for ""training"" let me clue you in something You Do NOT have a JOB with this company, It is an elaborate selection process nothing more once again it is NOT A NEW CAREER, This Company is a Miserable Pile of lies & secrets, They will lie to you & send you home with nothing  if you fail their process on top of all that they conjure every conceivable"
bad,A corporation that hold the stockholders opinion higher than the employees. Cut throat atmosphere where 90%+ of the employees seem miserable and only stay due to benefits.
bad,"Management at the Croxton terminal are corrupt and incompetent. They make business decisions for the company based on their vindictive whims and personal preferences. Most of the people I worked with were great company but there's more than a few hardcore snitches, so watch your back if you go there. Other terminals are not quite as bad. A lot of the problem lies with one low-life trainmaster who has been there way too long and needs to get shipped out. Better off waiting it out to get on NJT or Metro North IMO. Working at Norfolk Southern is not neccessarilly a plus if your ultimate goal is to hire on at NJT, Amtrak or Metro North."
bad,Pay and benefits are good. Management and organization is ridiculous. No accountability except for train and service employees. The management intentionally look for things to discipline the employees for no matter how minute or miniscule. Local management cannot make any decisions on their own. Always have to call the higher management to decide discipline. Stressful environment not knowing if your going to get fired that day or not. Crewcall office is absolutely inadequate. Constantly making mistakes with the train and engine service employees yet are never held accountable.
bad,"This company does pay well. The sacrifices you make in your home life aren’t worth the money. You could be the best employee they have and you can get fired for minor infractions. If you have a family, you don’t want a job at Norfolk Southern"
bad,"CAN be a great work environment if allowed but B5s and above are more concerned with CYA than providing leadership. Instead, they focus on micro-management; terrified that they could be blamed for something that is part and parcel to operational incidents."
bad,One is able to provide for his or her family but has no family time. No life outside of work do to heavy work schedule and miss management of people and equipment.
bad,"not a good place to work. supervisors have no experience. management unwilling to work with workers to solve issues, not enough workers on the job."
bad,"Worked for the company for 7 years , loved every second until they hired a new VP, cut costs , jobs , put a lot of good/ hardworking people on the street ."
bad,Good pay thats all. Not concerned with the well being of the employees. Spends lots of money training employees then in turn constantly is trying to fire them. Did I mention good pay?
bad,"I cannot stress the title enough. Their promotions are based on handing out discipline. The more people they put under their feet, the higher up they go. They will go out of their way to find you doing something wrong. And if they don't catch you, they will make it up and punish you anyway. They have zero integrity while claiming they have an abundance."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is that you don't know when your going to work, so it makes it very difficult to make plans such as doctors appointments ect."
bad,It used to be an awesome place to work. Now they are just interested in stock options. We were a family but now they force OT. Family time isn't considered a priority. Odd shifts and odd days off.
bad,"Poor place to work, management looks for a reason to fire you. Horrible hours. They don’t care about you or your well being. No time off, always on call. Ability to take away your personal days."
bad,"Work all hours on call with a 1.5 hr call notice, 12hr shifts, work every holiday. They are making cuts and furlough without any notice and transfer your location without any indication of how many weeks/months/years you will be gone. Management retaliates if you don't come to work on your days off. They have no regard for their employees."
bad,"on call 24/7 365"
bad,"Great learning experience.  However very difficult to get out of a department once inside.  Good chance of moving up in a department, but not outside."
bad,"You are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week including holidays.  You will never be home, and will lose friends and possibly spouses.  "
bad,NS is a company more concerned with profit then anything else. It is a closed union shop that requires an expensive monthly dues that yields almost nothing in return. The company’s management team is not given what they need to properly manager their respective areas. The company offers almost no opportunity to grow while severely restricting overtime options
bad,"No home life, all weather conditions, management is unfair and unforgiving. Layoffs are common with economic downturns. Hard to have a healthy family life style working for this company."
bad,"The heath insurance and retirement is amazing if you give up any semblance of a normal life for it. Every large company only cares about profits, but this one has even taken the decency of face to face communication (layoffs etc) out of it and uses an automated machine to leave you a message"
bad,"A ok place to work but lots of dead weight to have to cover for, terrible management on every level, big chance of lay offs , your really just a number nobody cares about you, the union is a big joke that just rips you off monthy , lots of psycho employees that should of been fired years ago"
bad,"Working for Norfolk Southern was supposed to be a promising career. I resigned from the company I was working with for nearly 4 years based on the promises to earn a lot of money and support my family for years to come. Plus a benefit plan that included paying my wife for being married to a Norfolk Southern Conductor upon retirement. Only to find out after one year of employment, Norfolk Southern decided to implement a plan that would remove several hundreds of jobs including my own."
bad,"Mechanical dept. - Ok pay, good benefits, management is the worst, if you get hurt they will discipline you / terminate you. Culture of fear! Depressing! You will be watched and hunted by management on a daily basis! I left and went to another RR , Good luck!"
bad,In my experience the compensation is far below what other Class 1s pay for the same work. Seniority districts are small and when operational changes are made they company does very little to accommodate. Management makes knee jerk decisions and bucks industry norms to please shareholders.
bad,"This company positions itself to lure people in. In the interview they tell you how miserable your life will be but then tell you all the money you will make. Heres the Truh, you have to pay to work, after all of the deductions you might walk away with 50% of your earnings. You have to have fire insurance that the union will set you up with for a monthly fee. Because you will get fired and while you wait to gain your reemployment you wont starve. This is a direct reflection of the managements lack of competence. Once you are hired then you begin the wondering when you'll get laid off... not if... again when. And once again a reflection on the leaderships incompetence on predicting their needs from month to month. Terms like culture are laughable, the culture is the workers hate the managers and the managers try to fire the employees."
bad,"I resigned from Norfolk Southern due to the horrible work/life balance at the company, and the overall way they treated their employees.  After 12 years with the company, I could no longer justify the time I missed with my family and children due to not only spending 12 hours a day at the office, but then being required to work at home on most evenings, and weekends.  Also, middle and lower level managers were expected to continue to work remotely even while on vacation unless out of the country."
bad,"In my opinion, I believe this company is extremely mismanaged they do not care for the well being of employees. The benefits are nice. union very weak."
bad,"After 8 years working in the Mechanical Department, I have been laid off twice.  Guys with less seniority have been laid off much more often.  My union always makes back door deals with the supervision and doesn't look out for union brothers.  Supervisors get brand new company vehicles to take home and they do nothing.  Supervisors will literally hide at night in the weeds and use binoculars to watch if you doing your job and write you up for things as petty as leaving a truck door unlocked.  Supervisors have to justify their jobs so they write you up for anything and everything.  If you comply to all of their rules and do everything safely, you will be written up for delaying freight. System wide layoffs are happening now and precision railroading is failing causing massive internal dismay."
bad,I have never worked for a company that tries harder to fire their employees. It seems as though that's all management is concerned with. Safety is just a slogan. They only care about safety when it benefits them. There's basically zero chance of moving up in the company without having to relocate. Morale is terrible.
bad,"Beware ,after all the training you achieved they will set you up for failure looking for ways to fire you so they can replace you.If they don't find a way to lay you off first.The train masters will treat you like garbage no loyalty here your just a number .No life at all work 100% get paid for 80% long hours if you had a life before this job you will not have one now welcome to despair."
bad,The company could use A lot of improvement in managing there workers and really getting to know them.. Have one on one with employees and see what's going on with there life as a whole and offer anything that may help.
bad,"Poor job training, especially considering dispatchers are responsible for the safety of other railroaders.  Only days off if you are on the extra board is your vacation days, that’s it.  Expensive union dues with little to show for.  Lower management is ok, but upper management has little concern for employees."
bad,"*Very pleasant crew depending on the floor and department your working with"
bad,Work life balance is non existent depending on the department you are in. The salary is not worth it because you put in more that 50 hours a week. It is a secure job.
bad,Training in McDonough Georgia. Learned a lot and met a lot of good people. Not so much in the North. Was let go from employment 1 week before I became union. I never had a write up and was not told why I was being dismissed. Very Cut Throat!
bad,"Management is terrible. Does not want to treat employees fairly. Expects low end managers to fire the employees all the time. Saying out there is "" the only company that hires you to fire you"" ."
bad,"Norfolk Southern is not a place that you need to work if you want any sort of family life. You also run a high risk of being laid off for extended periods of time in your first several years. You can make good money when you pull a lot of overtime, but the work/life balance makes it rough to deal with everyday."
bad,"Unprofessional, inadequate management. inadequate training provided with extreme discipline administered when errors are made.  Including constant suspensions without pay."
bad,This company is repeatedly listed as one of the worst run companies in America.  No trust in their workforce and nor is there any appreciation for the men and woman on the ground level making the locomotives move. Boss' are taught and trained to always create friction with agreement workers.
bad,Life sucks on the railroad. Your seniority determines what job you can hold. Most are on call jobs and you never know when you are going to work. Pay is decent but not until you have been there 5 years and are at 100% of the pay scale.
bad,"If you work in field operations (transportation, mech, engineering) be ready to sign away your life . You will work all kinds of hours, holidays, and put up with micromanaging bosses. I could see working in corporate as being a lot better but the pay is average and they are relocating many office workers to a building that's too small in Atlanta."
bad,"The culture of NS is not univeral throughout the company. There are different cultures in different departments, even those in the same building. The RACS department is very challenging due to the culture that will never change. Standards are set for individuals based on personal feelings and not professional opinions. Everyday you will cry before coming to work. The job tasks are not hard at all, a 5th grader could do it. However, management is horrible. Complaints and investigations have been filed with HR and EEO. All investigations stop at management and of course are found in favor of management. The only thing that will keep you coming to work is the salary and benefits."
bad,"NS was a great company to work for 12 years ago but corporate greed, management's personal agendas, ""good ol' boy club"", and pushing safety out the door for production ruined that career."
bad,Company is more invested in bottom line and turning profits than employees and the safety of them. They view you as a deduction to profits and you will be treated as such.
bad,"You're just another warm body to them (management). Hurry up get the job done! Go go go push push! Favouritism shift to shift. You can forget it, if you have a family. Union dues are extremely high for nothing. It's all seniority and be ready to have 2nd shift with Wednesday & Thursday as rest days."
bad,terrible job security and management. constantly on call you never have time for family and will never know exactly what or how to plan your week. the compensation is good and its a great job for someone who is single and has no kids.
bad,Employees are at the bottom of the priority list. They care more about the shareholders than properly running their company and it is evident in every location other than the corporate offices
bad,"You are a number here, and more accurately an expense and liability. An expense and liability that they would love to eat rid of. The management to employee culture is toxic at best for the most part. The kind of thing where they will hide in the bushes just to try to catch you so they can put you out of service. On top of all that, every day you go to work you don’t know if you’re going to have a job the next day due to some lay-off or furlough. Awful. Only good thing is the pay."
bad,"They will hire you to fire you or lay you off to copy their competitors ideas. Because it's a union job, you're last in, first out and that's exactly what happened in 2019; mass lay offs company wide. Norfolk Southern copied CSX's ""precision railroad"" strategy, which in turn caused a lot of people to lose their jobs. The guys you work with are great, management is average but don't expect to stay on if you don't have any seniority."
bad,"Great benefits and compensation however this job will consume all of your family time.  Additionally, they have unexpected layoffs and furloughs which is unfortunate for employees for the newer employees because this organization is all about seniority and union policies."
bad,This job is not for the faint of heart. You have to be quick to make solid and safe decisions that affect you hours in advance. The management team is very unprofessional and overly concerned about self growth as opposed to the company bottom line
bad,Long days but a learning process. No family time and the workplace culture depends on or which side of territory you worked. Management sucked and you are always on call. The pay sucks if u have no seniority and that can take five to ten years are more.
bad,"I would not recommend the Transportation Management Trainee program to anyone. NS was very misleading on what this position entailed, saying that we would be primarily in charge of yard operations, when in reality, you are in charge of babysitting the union employees and enforcing rules upon them (much like a police officer). I learned almost nothing about rail ops (the whole reason I took the job), and felt that I only wasted time here. I felt extremely under-appreciated."
bad,"The work place is nice and newly renovated. The company has a mixed culture which is great. The only con about this company is that its not ""geared"" towards promoting women into management positions. I would just caution any female that is looking to grow into a management position to consider working at a different company.  It's just not my opinion but statistics show that men dominate the management positions at this company."
bad,"NS does not treat employees well and does not cultivate creativity. Work life balance is not a priority in Operations, you are expected to be connected 100% and compensation does not reflect as such. Compensation is good for 40/work week."
bad,"My job was as a dispatcher for 12 years.  You are required to be in a union and doing a quality job is meaningless only seniority allows you to move ahead, so you could be the best dispatcher but least seniority, you will not get the job.  While this part is not NS fault, NS does not allow adequate training in using a new dispatch system that was basically forced on all dispatchers and expected to learn on your own with little to no education on how to use it.  Do not expect to have a life outside the railroad, you belong to the railroad once you are hired, mark up and get years under of seniority behind you before you get off the extra board and stand for a regular job.  Even when you get that first regular job it will NOT be a Monday through Friday job on 1st shift.  Respectful managers are far and few now under the company's new regime to centralize the dispatchers in their new Network Operations Center in Atlanta, you are looked at as a number and the only way to get any break is to mark off sick because so many have retired or quit in the last year since the centralization of dispatchers began.  If you want a good paycheck and health benefits but could careless about seeing friends, family and having any outside life, this is the job for you.  One thing about it, every day is different so expect variety, there is lots of stress as you are basically a railroad equivalent of a air traffic controller and lots and lots of responsibility.  You are CONSTANTLY under scrutiny so do not expect a pat on the back for a job well done.  Expect disrespectful colleagues to relieve you"
bad,Have to perform work in all type of weather including serve storms type weather. Management is out to get you instead of helping or working with you. People have to look out for themselves while working for the railroad.
bad,"Would be excellent place to work, however recently the entire work environment has changed into one of constant stress and contentious atmosphere. As management has created a constant environment of a hostile work environment and looking to fire employees from day one."
bad,"Great paying, but not worth what you give up. From day one that you are hired, they spend the rest of your career trying to fire you. Company doesn’t care about teaching rather than warm bodies and fall guys."
bad,Railroad life is hard but the pay is good and benefits are ok. Advancement with new technology makes it really hard.  The lifestyle is not for everyone.  I would recommend going to school first and be really careful when selecting your hiring location
bad,"The compensation is very fair, however the company treats all employees and managers as a number.  The threat of losing your job to a corporate downsizing or relocation event is always present.  The lack of a traditional work schedule causes many personal problems."
bad,"Current management is cutting jobs with little respect to how long employees have been there or job performance.  A very ""yes"" culture is being created with anyone questioning the ""why"" getting the cut.   Favoritism is rampant, employees who can do great jobs are being forced out while employees who can't do jobs are being kept on because they don't question the status quo.  Benefits are less than they used to be for management, and overall the stress level is ridiculous. Upper management pushes various HR programs that do little to retain employees, and while you're expected to follow along with the HR project of the day such as ""positive reinforcement"", you'll rarely see upper management lead the charge."
bad,"no time for personal life whatsoever.. and no job security, to many people willing to try and advance themselves at your cost. The company is always trying to fire you instead of mentor you even when you are new. It is not a job for someone with a family."
bad,"Lack of management knowledge of the job."
bad,Hard work. No play to spend the money. No family time. If you have family please consider as you will be able to pay all the bills and have all the toys you want but will not have the time to use them.
bad,Poor culture.  Most Employees unhappy and it continues to increase.  Lifestyle of the company is not so great.  Lots of time away from your family.  No schedule.  Work all times of day and night with only a 90 minute notice.
bad,"Hurry up and wait ! The job is a sacrifice of your family, friends, and any hobbies you might have.  On call 24/7 is not so fun . You can look at the board to get an idea of when your going to work but it can change any time when people mark off or they add extra jobs or they take jobs off.  I found myself constantly checking the board to see what I was going to work trying to plan my day and when I was going to get some sleep. I got set up and off training pay (you will bring home about $890 every two weeks) and got furloughed shortly after that. Some people even got furloughed before their training was even finished. So if you already have a good job it is a risk that might not be worth it. As you gain seniority the job does get better. In 10 years you will be able to work in the yard, days Monday through Friday and have weekends off. Only for a short amount time before your mandatory promotion to engineer and then you will go down to the bottom of the engineer board where you will be working on call again out on the road.  The job it's self is easy as far as physical labor you will do a lot of sitting and waiting . Many times got called for a train, I showed up to work waited 2-4 hours for the train to get in. It was easy money but I soon realized I could be doing much more with my time. It is a good job if you can keep it and you can live the lifestyle . If you don't have anything to lose give it a shot. It just wasn't for me ."
bad,On call constantly in transportation. I had absolutely no life. Kids hired as supervisors fresh out of college telling a 30 year man that they have been doing the job wrong the whole time when they have no idea how to the job themselves.
bad,"Probationary period can last 9 mos and there is zero tolerance for mistakes. Management and peers constantly warn of rule violations and always one mistake away from being fired. Hundreds of rules and they all have exceptions. I was fired with 45 days of probation for throwing improper switch in dark and pouring rain, resulting in no injury or damage to equipment. all overtime has been eliminated due to feds pressure but days off are still rare. Met some great people and controlling train movement was cool...however, I would advise against NS as an employer. Management is unorganized and corrupt in my opinion. Supervisors do a great job of making liars out of good honest workers. Constantly firing workers and furloughs across the board."
bad,Poor management and co-workers are there for themselves they are cut-throat wouldn't recommend this enviorment for anybody. no home life
bad,"You are just a number, work life balance is terrible, and very tough as a new employee because you are low in seniority.  Low seniority means you can't hold any jobs, and get bumped off jobs and that causes no work means no pay."
bad,"Major cuts and restructuring is leading to skeleton crews to run the NS system. This is making moral pretty low, as well as job security for low senority extremely unreliable."
bad,Too many managers doing a job they are not trained to do. No schedule and no home life. Good pay and benefits. A complete lifestyle change to anything you are used too.
bad,Pay and retirement excellent. work was fairly easy. coworkers were great. used to be a stable industry. you work 40 hrs and most holidays. vacation takes awhile to add up
bad,"As a mechanical employee the pay is great 67k plus a year. However, the recent clean sheet decision management made left a lot of employees across the board on furlough status. Before this decision to cut back I would have very much recommended this company unfortunately that is not the case any longer. Pros, great pay. Cons, no job security and for training you will be in Ga for about 7 weeks straight for mechanical"
bad,Company is very top heavy with most of the management trying to fire workers to keep upper management happy.  People working the ground usually have a bad view of management.
bad,Not much room for growth in the company. Management needs improvements. A lot of gossiping goes on in the workplace. This is not a place to choose if you are wanting to move up the ladder.
bad,"Cut throat job, people get fired everyday for minor stuff.  On call 24/7, no off days.  Management will fire you if your boots don't have enough tread even though every day you walk in rocks.  Management pretty much gets promotion based on how many people they write up or get dismissed.  No real leadership just brain washed robots.  Hotel/msi they put you in sucks, rock hard bed, bad Tv channels, bed bugs, and high risk of food poison from the cafe."
bad,"I worked for NS for 20 years and, over the course of my career, the number of work hours became greater with each new promotion.  The work/life balance was awful for both myself and my family.  "
bad,Norfolk Southern was a great place to work. For all my years of service I was terminated for a rule that wasn’t in place nor could I have ever known about. I believe that the train master and terminal superintendent that fired me knew of the rule change coming. I lost my career for a rule that was bulletined 18 days after my termination.
bad,"Job was really enjoyable when I first started working for NS. However, several years in it became noticeable that management does not care about you, or your lifestyle, they just want someone who can sit in a seat. You are required to be in a union, which is the worse union to be in, mainly because the union doesn't have ground to stand on. Anyway, company management does not believe in career progression and only select individuals ever get promoted. The wages they pay are fair, however, you don't get any benefits or overtime for working holidays, weekends, shift differential, or any other compensation for not working regular hours, but that's thanks in part to our union and not the company's fault. Furthermore, the managers will contact you at any time, and almost demand that you cover their inability to properly schedule people for shift vacancies. In addition, working with some co-workers was hard and some even belittled you. Dealing with workers you were in control of was like babysitting, as most of the people you were directing would question everything you did, and were demanding that you ran the railroad their way, even though they had no idea what was going on outside their job. The new technology that is being implemented was shotty at best, and even critical systems would regularly fail.The job overall is very satisfying for people who like to move equipment."
bad,Not always the best balance of work life relations. Company strives itself of balance but it is not always followed through. Advancement if you are willing to move and often.
bad,Company does not care about work life balance at all. 90 hour work weeks are normal. Vacations will be interrupted. Off days are constantly taken from you. Higher level management will take your off days from you and make you work through them. I worked 12 hour shifts for 28 days straight when I was a yardmaster.
bad,"Will you make money? Yes but money isn't everything. the typical day is 8 to 12 hours. You are on call 24/7 on an extraboard. an extraboard is a list of people in line waiting to work. Snow ,rain or sunny it is time to go. A lot of rules and a lot of management. If your famliy means alot to you maybe you should think of another place to work because you will never be home to enjoy them."
bad,The company is driven by bottom up performance.  Benefits are incredible although have increasingly become less competitive with other companies. Work-life balance can be a challenge.
bad,I choose not to respond at this time. Thank you for you patient and understanding.  I have learned so much in this ordeal and have plans to learn much more.
bad,"Not much to say. It can be rewarding if you are self motivated. There are great people to work with and the work can be mentally challenging. However, it is a different type working culture."
bad,"There is no incentive to work hard. Management literally hide in the woods watching you work. When you make a mistake, you are overly disciplined. "
bad,"The work was not hard, depending on your department.  You work with rail customers or other railroads to ship cars.  Most of the jobs are unionized and management treats you like a  child.  Micromanagement at its best. The pay is great but the stress makes you question is it really worth it."
bad,Tough  environment. People are paid for the inconvenience of the jobs that they offer not based on the skill levels required for the job. Work extremely long hours!
bad,If you are looking for a good paying job without having a life this is the place for you.  This company will tell you that they care about you and your family and want you to spend time with them and then the very next minute they will expect you to spend 80 hours a week out working.  You will miss everything that has to do with family and off time.
bad,Great pay and benefits.  Lifestyle is very challenging with family.  No set schedule.  I did learn to multitask and became very proficient with many new skills.
bad,"If you are considering this as a career and want to have a life, turn around and run. Training is horrible and rushed. You have managers that work here that get bonuses for finding you do the wrong things and are continuously trying to fire you. Although the pay is good I don't think it's worth working 15 years and then you get dismissed and cant come back because someone needs one more person to meet his quota."
bad,"Getting your route log/yards you will work, communicating to yardmasters and supervisors. Work place culture was okay, but my experience wasn't the greatest. The various schedule was definitely the hardest part."
bad,"Nice career,enjoyed the overall experience.I worked in several area of the company.Majority of the time as an Locomotive engineer and a manager in transportation."
bad,I've worked at NS for over 9 years and the only way to move up is knowing the right people. Great performance reviews will not help in any way. Very poor work life balance - expect 24/7 response with large territories.
bad,"Not a great company if you want to advance through the rank.  A lot of old world mentality."
bad,"There is no typical day at work. It changes from day to day, which is one of the good things about working at Norfolk Southern. I have gained experience in the rail industry, logistics and customer service that has allowed me to fine tune my managerial skills to tactfully handle any situation or environment."
bad,"The training is cramed into a short period of time and then things you didnt learn they use against you to get rid of you weeks before becoming a union member.  They work you over 40 hours and 6 days a week as a trainee with only a flat pay no matter the extended hours."
bad,"The benefits are great, salary is ok but the management and job culture is horrible. There is not a work/life balance at all. You can forget about maintaining friends, family and anything else that interests you. Management wants you to go through hell and high water to prove your worth! Not worth your time!"
bad,"All in all was a good place to work. They provided training. Getting from second to first shift would take at least 10 years due to seniority. Off days included most people having midweek 2 days off like tuesday wednesday off.Work could be dirty at times but for the pay and benefits I would not complain. Unfortunately due to PSR most railroads, including this one,  are trimming the workforce by close to 50 percent in alot of areas. Was hoping to get off of second for family reason after 8 years. With constant cuts from PSR i was looking at another 10 years almost causing me to begin looking elsewhere. However a big lay off ended up making the choice for me."
bad,"Extensive pre employment process requiring all medical records physical and background checks, after waiting a year and a half for a call back. Training was good very thorough however once released it seemed the company officials had a sort of quota to fill firing employees, actually hiding in the bushes waiting for mistakes to be made."
bad,"SO many changes in management. Nobodys job is secure anymore. "
bad,One would have to try it and make a decision based on their experience. Everyone experience is different. My experience was a once in a lifetime experience. I am thankful for the opportunity.
bad,"The day they hire you is the day they will try to fire you. Kiss your life goodbye, no schedule at all you, will work every major holiday. The moral is terrible ."
bad,"I made money when I traveled for this company, otherwise it was a bad experience other than I worked with some good people. The managers are brainwashed and trained to create obstacles and they do not go by seniority for the union workers."
bad,Many times the management micro-manages you. You have been given instruction do tasks but not adequate training on how to accomplish it. The culture of the workplace is toxic.
bad,"Need to Up pay wage. Make breaks longer, especially working 12hrs a day. When winter comes Have heat in trucks. Need new energetic terminal leaderrs.."
bad,Norfolk Southern Corporation offers high paying jobs in the transportation field but with little work life balance. My work days are always 12+ hours long with the constant conference calls. I oversee the operation of trains in my area but have been asked to cut cost to a point where we can’t provide adequate service.
bad,"review daily bulletin, work safely with others and wait for the train"
bad,"you put in long hours and deal with alot from managment, you never know when the contractor will pull out and somebody else will take it over and u are out of a job....."
bad,"Started good, good benefits, good pay. Vacation slow to achieve, no sick pay. Job security deteriorated to basically a weekly wonder. Decent coworkers."
bad,"I was very satisfied with my employment at NS; however,  i was furloughed from the company in sept 2019 and am seeking other employment. As a carman,  i was certified welding/burning, fork truck driving, airbrake certified, and qualified to operate heavy equipment."
bad,"Poor Work Life Balance"
bad,"You are owned by the company, do what they say or else. You move when and where they say. Budget cuts, layoffs, anything to get that extra money into the shareholders pockets. You can make good money, but your personal life will pay the price."
bad,Very high stress environment with little chance of advancement.  Excellent pay and benefits.  Terrible management.  Terrible hours and off days.  Job satisfaction when you know you’ve done a good job.
bad,"Stressful work environment for sometimes seemingly simple work assignments. Management leads with an intimidating managerial style. An agenda has been implemented to get the overall number of employees down. I wouldn't personally recommend a friend to work here, but if you need a job have low morals, and a bad attitude, then this may be a good place for you."
bad,"Everyday is different on the railroad. Management hiding in bushes to review your work or to see if your doing anything wrong. Customer complaints, fellow employees, equipment and being outside are just some of the factors you have to face. Great compensation and benefits but not very good off days starting off. Works on seniority."
bad,"The pay is very good, as are the benefits, but as with most companies, Operations works terrible hours. This is alright when one is young, but terrible on a family. The agreement employees are coddled, and with the new ""ADI"" BS, the work environment has become a joke. mid-management (any B5-B6 level supervisor in any dept) only wants the next promotion, and cares little about how they achieve it. There is plenty of room for upward mobility, as most of the upper level management will retire within the next 5 years (many would have already gone if the market hadn't tanked in 2008). Norfolk Southern (or any railroad) is not a bad company per se: they have never laid off management, the pay is excellent, the benefits are good, but Operations is a life sentence (can't transfer to non-ops), and the burn-out rate is very high. Morale across the railroad is very low right now due to internal politics...not sure anything besides a complete changing of the guard can change it."
bad,There are many other better places to work within the railroad industry than Norfolk Southern.  They are in the process of trying to catch up with the rest of the industry.  They're one of the only railroads that continue to do their own locomotive maintenance and that's cost them dearly as the locomotives have become much more complex and NS did not keep up with the training of employees.  That is why they are typically last among all the other railroads in operating ratio which determines the profitability.
bad,"We used to have fun until the yes men started micromanaging. If you scratch your butt with the wrong hand you're in for discipline. "
bad,Working at Norfolk Southern was very and the  trainmasters were not the best. It was long hours and not the best work environment. The benefits were the best thing about the job.
bad,Much of this does not apply.  I was a contractor and therefore did not encounter these issues. The people I met were friendly and helpful.  It took four weeks to get my PC and user credentials.
bad,"Norfolk southern will find anyway to cut a corner on employees and equipment"
bad,"This company - in particular the location and division I was assigned to - does not care about work/life balance.  The compensation is good, however, I found it to be inadequate compared to the demands that were made.  "
bad,"Never seen a place that promotes their management on how many people they can bust doing something wrong. Most places promote because they have a good crew and get the work done. Not here, you get promoted if you hide like a snake in the grass and bust someone for looking the wrong way."
bad,Great opportunity for advancement and to make money plenty of experience for those who enjoy the rail road. Able to move up to management or change locations
bad,"long work day , protect your self at all cost,  on call call a lot, the hardest part of the job would be being away from home and family. good benefits and pay"
bad,"People are great "
bad,"I learned a lot working for Norfolk Southern. I realized that they don't really care about you in reality, but the trick is the money. So that's why the bad management and things are still going on. Once you train ad get the job down pack, its very fun because a lot of people doesn't know what it take to get the freight moving on the railroads."
bad,"The Benefits were great, but you have no life. You go into the job knowing the life though. You need to be aware of rules and must follow them or could possibly injured or worse."
bad,Worked almost all my life for the Railroad.It was a good job to meet my family life.some days was a different job to be completed.The work was hard and in demand to do a good job for the company
good,When you take a Conductor position at Norfolk-Southern-Corp you pretty much give up a positive work life environment. You could work all three shifts in a week and they don’t care how it affects you. Management was one of the worst I’ve experienced!
good,"Very dysfunctional boys club work place. No room for promotion, poor salary structure, no path for conversion from contractor to perm. Poor family to work life balance. Unqualified management placement based on friendship not knowledge."
good,Dispatcher is a tough life on call until you have enough seniority to hold a job.  it never shuts down you will work holiday and weekends and no added pay for doing this
good,I'm sure they are thoroughly aware of this.  Lack of quality of life and lack of respect you get as a TA employee from management. If they treated their employees better it would be easier to stay with the company
good,Watch out they are in the bushes waiting to catch you break a rule. Your life ends as you know it.  You are on call 24/7. The benefits aren't worth it!
good,"If you are single and have nothing better to do with your time, then you will feel right at home here working 60+ hours a week, getting paid for 40hrs"
good,They do not know how to balance work and family here there is a lot of disgruntled workers who look at this as a Job and not a career which makes it difficult to work on a career due to lack of commitment to the Career
good,"Well, it would be a great place to work if you didnt want to have any type of home life and never want to actually plan something. Someone who is single with no kids might like it."
good,"Always gone on working. Spend 12 hours or more on a train regularly. Pays well. Your in a hotel more than your home. Perfect if your single. Management will hide in other trains or from afar, watching you with binoculars waiting for you to make a mistake. Your immediately terminated pending investigation depending on the mistake. Overall a real easy job. If u dont work out, youll get fat. You will spend a minimum 12 hours on a train if your going into Chicago. You will spend minimum 10 hours in the dorm. On average i spent 24 hours in the dorm before coming home."
good,"If you are the type of person who can be thrown into a jungle and still achieve order, this is the Career for you. Guidance is very minimal, entrepreneurial drive is an unspoken requirement to succeed in any capacity with the abundance of resources from peers and inter-department, yet minimal guidance from superiors who also have carved their own successes by their own trials and errors. Consider it lucky if you can find a strong support group within the company, otherwise it is a thankless job with growing expectations and gradually declining pay. In 2018, Bonus pay was reduced from 15% to 6-8%"
good,The company lacks on employee gratification. The past 5 years morale as slow dropped to an all time low. The workers dont feel appreciated. It's a sustainable living if you want to be gone from your family and know about what you'll make every check. It just doesn't pay enough to be gone so much.
good,"Pay is decent; pension is a plus.  Otherwise, not a great place to work.  Grueling schedule and alternating shift work.  You get worked like a dog and treated poorly while you're there.  No work life balance.  Nepotism at its best.  You get promoted if someone important likes you, you're kin to someone important, or if you sell your soul to the culture of how hard you can drive employees.  Otherwise, no real opportunity to move up/around.   It's the complete opposite of a meritocracy. Inadequate management and training.  Learn the best you can.  Good old boy network.  Minorities don't get a fair shake.  Absent the pay and retirement, people would not stay there.  Stay away from operations mgmt."
good,not for a family man your never home or off on weekends. will be on call for the first 5 yrs or so maybe longer and supervisors are puppets they will be sent out to watch you violate a rule and fire you. the union sucks there is two of them neither better than other its up to you.
good,"NS seems to promote people lacking management skills (at least in the Transportation department). Often seeking managers more intent on promoting poor culture than helping employees progress. I'd say they need to take a hard look at where they want to go, but I believe they have. And, I believe this is the route the company has chosen.... Which is a shame. Good people come and go and the company is successful despite these woahs. The wasted money on management turnover must be obscene."
good,"My day consist of cleaning, sanding, supplying and fueling locomotives.  The hardest part of my job was getting the computer for the fuel ramp to work properly. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my great co-workers.  I learned a lot about safety from my co-workers and also how to operate a locomotive.  My immediate supervisors were great."
good,no family life job requires you to be on call wich mean never home no schedual cant plan anything on call 24 hrs a day 7 days 365
good,"Transport crews andn paperwork to and from hotel and terminal, and stock the offices. We were on-call 24/7, including holidays."
good,"a typical day is very knowledgeable, learn something new each and every day"
good,"If you're in management, every hourly employee hates you when you walk through the door. Other management leads by fear and hires employees just to fire them. Poor culture to work in and absolutely zero work life balance. Attrition is super high and the turnover rate is above any other company I've ever seen. Good money but terrible management training program."
good,At Norfolk Southern the job and a lot of ups and downs. During my time there it has provided a good life for me and my family. The benefits and the retirement was probably to us the best part of the job.
good,"It is a difficult lifestyle if you are family orientated.  There will be many life moments missed while working for the railroad.  But the railroad compensates you for your time,  But sometimes compensation is not everything."
good,"This job has no job work/life balance' The money sounds great until you see all of the deductions that are taken out on your paystub. You're basically paying towards your retirement. They even deduct a retirement fund for your wife. Even if you don't have one. Which in my opinion isn't right."
good,Hardest part of the job is to deal with incompetent bosses that try to fire you instead of work with you to better performance.
good,"on duty call 24-7, ready all required paperwork, ready train and depart for away terminal, very good rail experiance, hard comunication with management, most co-workers very professional work habits, hardest part was getting up to work at all hours, running train was most enjoyable part"
good,"It used to be a great company to work for but with the introduction of Precision Scheduled Railroading, it has become a company that only values shareholder profits. Layoffs and downsizing are the constant norm."
good,Interested in becoming part an organization that appreciates my production and effort. Pursuing an opportunity that encourages me and my team to help the bottom line.
good,The management at this company was almost all around horrible. There were management was caught several times verbally sexually assaulting certain female employees in which they were never punished for. There were managers that would try to force you to do something against federal law just to make themselves look good.  Management at this company was not organized at all. A lot of great employees and skilled workers. Learned a lot from senior employees. Hardest part of the job was putting up with management shenanigans. Had to many employees in leadership roles that have never turned a wrench before and was trying to tell mechanics how to do something properly.
good,CSX pays better same union but pay scales are different norfolk is poorly managed jump tru hoops to hire you and look for ever reason to fire u  hard to move up tru the company unless u have a degree even if the degree doesn’t pertain to the task of job very micro managed
good,I absolutely enjoyed coming to work and working with the men and women that became family to me. The job itself is fairly simple after you get in sync with everyone and everything.
good,You will make a good living but you will never see another weekend or holiday. Off days will be in the middle of the week and you will be forced to work most holidays.
good,Management is unsupportive and agreement employees are disgruntled. Pay is good but job requires a 24/7 on call window. Work is more mentally challenging than physical although still a physical job
good,Company has become poorly managed. Mostly upper and middle management. Company does pay well and has decent benefits but anymore it is not enough to overcome the stress an expectations put on its employees.
good,You will never be at home unless you are laid off. Don't confuse this with job security. You will trade everything and everyone you know for this profession.
good,"Impossible to plan working on the extra board"
good,This company and most employees in the transportation department are men. They look down on women and don't really do anything about harassment. The hours are long and not worth being away from your family.
good,When I started it was a fun place to work. Has steadily declined over the years. Not all management or managers are bad. But it only takes a few to ruin it for everyone.
good,Most of the work is easy but boring. Coworkers are easy to get along with. The hardest part is putting up with supervisors who don't really know what's going on but still try to fire you. Would be a better workplace if they would hire more management employees from a craft rather than college. Pay and benefits are good. Insurance is going to get worse with next union contract but still not bad. Overall not a bad company to work for.
good,If you plan to be away from your family all of the time and work 80+ hours in just a few days then apply away. The turnover rate is extremely high as well.
good,"Employed as a sub-contractor. All the responsibilities of an employee without any of the benefits. Many road trips without any detail as to the work to be done. "
good,"The morale on the railroad is nonexistent. Management treats you as though you're 10 years old. No cell phones, no internet service, no leaving the floor without getting permission."
good,Each day you will experience something different on this type of job wether it's about the job or the company or the person working alone with you. The most difficult thing about the job in is when you're being call to different hours of the night.
good,"Well I will put this lightly. My dad was diagnosed with cancer in May 2010. I filed for fmla shortly thereafter. From that time to my firing i was wrote up for 6 minor disciplinary actions which was more than I had received in 5 years total. I tried to take off to go to another relative's funeral shortly after my dad died. They refused to let me off with permission and charged me with marking off with false pretenses. They lied on me at the investigation, and despite all the inconclusive evidence against me , I wasn't reinstated. To my own fault, I will say, I wasnt happy nor was I the best employee my last year there. All in all; good job, bad business practices."
good,Very unstable place to work. They can and will downsize when they see fit. Union position but the Unions are not very strong. Can be called out at any time for work and forced to work several hours from home with out travel compensation.
good,"Local Level is good, upper management is all about share holders, that's the bottom line. You are on call all the time, you can be bumped or cut from job at almost any time if they decides to close jobs, job security for new people is very low."
good,Great job not much off time but you are able to provide a good living for your family 12 hour days lots of time in hotels every other day and you are probably going to miss a lot of family time.
good,"I enjoy being a conductor very much, the concerns i have are with job security, life balance and job advancement with Corporate furloughing jobs and layoffs."
good,"working for norfolk southern u will be underpaid for the work u do, there are other railroads doing the same exact work making almost double what u are making"
good,"This use to be a great place to work, but with the new mind set, there has been much job loss.  Several layoffs, leaving employees with 5+ years under their belt, no where to go.  No severance, and the unemployment pay is less than minimum wage."
good,"Tasked with repairing, troubleshooting,  installation of locomotive electronics. 2 years of student time to learn job but training is spread out and has gaps."
good,"I was a Boilermaker on second shift. I thought the job was pretty easy going. Sometimes there was a rush to get something out the door, but most times you could take your time turning a 10 min job into 8 hours. There isnt much quality control. They could paint a whole locomotive and a week or two later there stripping it for a new mod or design. The management only ran around on first shift. The vacation time sucks. You get 2 weeks off one full week and one split week. You have to work 8 years to get 3 weeks and one personal day. Unless you have a good number your stuck working second shift and possibly working the weekend. There were a good group of guys which made it fun. Then like any job there are a bunch of ball bags that dont have the skills to do the job or just dont like working and would rather stare at there phone for 8 hours. There are no discounts on anything, not even a train ride. If you make it 30 years you can retire at age 60 with pension . Some stuff sounds like it sucks but I thought 33 an hour was decent money  for the area."
good,"The work life balance does not exist. This is your life, not a job. Expect to be on call 24/7, have thousands of emails, and expectations you are required to meet. The people on the base level are good, but the higher you get, the more difficult it is to work with everyone. Each department is so silo'd."
good,NS has a strong safety culture that is followed throughout the company. Employees are constantly reminded of the importance of a safety given the industry in which the company operates.
good,Feels like your job is in jeopardy daily. Management doesn't care about your family life or if you have proper training. Training really could be better. Most enjoyable part of the job are the people/employees/team members. I have learned a lot about logistics and railroading. The job can be overwhelming at times but it gets easier as you persevere. and you only get a 20 min lunch if you find the time to take one.
good,The job would be fine if it was not ripe with miss management and greed. The pay is fair but not comparable to other railroads. They always take you out of service (temporary firing or permanent) over any reason they want. If you just want to work and be left alone then this is not the place to go.
good,"a job that is dangerous, hard and will take over your life. you work in all elements of weather and around questionable areas of work. If you can stand all of the above this job is for you."
good,Handling people or firing them determines if you are good at your job.  At some point we’ve ran away from moving freight to firing people.  The retirement will be great but you have to make it that far first.  If you a have good friend in high places you will be taken care of.
good,Railroad job. Work in all weather elements for long hours. Very stressful and detail oriented. No home time and trainmasters try and look for ways to fire you.
good,"Locomotive Engineer, Pittsburgh"
good,"Working for Norfolk Southern was both a great learning experience about the railroad industry and a series a trials that tested my patience with my the industry. A typical day involved a safety briefing and an assignment to a particular task. As a manager, seeking solutions outside of the box was looked down upon and connecting with your workers was viewed as a waste of time. Safety was overtly the biggest concern of everyone which is fine, until it actively impedes progress on simple, non-hazardous tasks such as filing office paperwork."
good,"NS is not one of those companies that are striving to stay competitive with other employers with regards to offering their employees quality of life benefits.  They are however, a great place to work if you are money driven and do not place importance on down time or family time."
good,Norfolk Southern is not a place for new graduates or people who want to make a difference. Salary is below market and it's not many advancement opportunities.
good,This company epitomizes a large corporation. For some this may be the ideal work environment. It a very serious and incredibly disciplined culture and revolves around the union.
good,"get laid off every month, while the ceo rakes in huge paychecks, and record high profit margins are met with more and more layoffs, but they let you back before you can get your unemployment, but then lay you off again."
good,"They are just going to furlough you.. they just hired about 15 of us for Harrisburg... it's not that stressful... an the pay is complete garbage, lowest paying RR especially for trainees.. I made more than double trainee pay with BNSF "
good,"You can work here for 15 years, and if you make a mistake (or if they consider) you had a rule violation.  They will just pull you out of service with no pay.  They may even to dismiss you no matter how much time you have with company.  You can NEVER EVER let your guard down.  So basically, its a good job considering pay, benefits, etc...management is so out of tune with you personally, they dont care if they put you on the street.  Always live below your means just incase one day at work they decide to pull the plug on you and throw you out.  Union is ok, but they are limited to the companies Court when your in a investigation.  The best way I can put it, the Company is Judge, prosecutor and the jury, you only the defense.  It is the most unfair Investigation you can be in....if they dont want you to win, they wont let you, even if you have all the proof in the world."
good,"You work in all types of weather conditions, and under extreme pressure to perform or you will be fired. You work in an us against them environment, Management is not their for support, they are their to monitor you ambush style, which is childish and ridiculous."
good,"Very poorly managed, work employees extremely long hours.  Has a fire first mentality when it comes to managing employees."
good,"In Crew Management, you cannot have any kind of a family life.  They do not want you to have family time.  The divorce rate is over 80%.  Morale is the lowest I have ever seen on a job.  Management encourages this.  The company itself is better, but that department is a very depressing place to be."
good,On call 24/7 365 with not a lot of family time. Location has a lot of good hard workers which management could care less about one screw up and you are out of a job.
good,Norfolk southern has good benefits and great pay however the management is terrible and job security is shaky. The managers are constantly out watching for mistakes and enforcing every single little rule in the dictionary sized rule book.
good,The lowest paid class one railroad out there.  The management try to operate by fear and micro management.  Has the potential like any other company to be great.
good,"This is a great company to work for with fantastic pay and unbelievable benefits, but they will make sure they get their money's worth. Certain jobs are better than others so be careful what you choose and do your homework on your time commitment."
good,"The railroad is not a great place for a new family to be a part of if in transportation. Have to put in at least 5 years before you can breath and not worry about getting laid off and not having job from month to month. If I knew half of what i was getting into i would have never even applied. Now some may love it and if you do, you will have a great career if your not laid off, great pay, decent benifits, good retirement, easy work but be prepared for 30+ years of no schedule leaving your house a 2-3 am for 2 days at time. Management for me has been fairly good as long as you are on call and dont tear up anything they tend to leave you alone, but i have heard horror stories. This job on paper sounds amazing but once your actually working and know what its like its hard to get used to. Great career if you can take it mentally and are willing to sacrifice about 75% of your free time and forget about keeping friends or a healthy social life. Final point is that if you have never worked a job where you are on call 24 hours a day 365 days a year or maybe military background( a lot of guys that work are ex military). I would think long and hard before applying. If you have a family with kids be prepared to go months without making any real money in the first years. Also the expensive dues to a union that is a shell of what it once was. you can go into management but then the company can relocate you anywhere they see fit at any time. Again great career and there are fewer and fewer places that offer any real career without a degree but you will earn it by being away from your home,"
good,"Good career just unsteady, feast or famine. Up and down. Unreliable, hard for a family employee, not a honest evaluation of workers, hard to decifier from employees because of being union."
good,"Not a stable career choice."
good,"My experience working for working at Norfolk Southern was very bitter/sweet. The training and experience are memories are something I will forever cherish and am extremely grateful for my time there."
good,"pays great, retirement is great if you are one of the lucky ones to make it that far. management makes life/work stressful. company is all about the big shareholders, not the employees. not a family oriented company anymore."
good,The people you work with make it what it is. Precision railroading forced many good young employees to find employment elsewhere and it is all based on profit dollars. I made friendships that will last a long time and but the pay and what is asked of you doesn't balance out. Underpaid as a conductor without ability to gain access to additional training to become an engineer until your turn in line. I would have went to engine school within two years if I was able but because of Unions you are forced to join they have negotiated that option out. They will continue to struggle with hiring and retaining people until there is some solution to that problem from employees standpoint.
good,I enjoyed the salary. Disliked the the amount of time spent away from my family. I enjoyed meeting new co-workers. I also didn't care for the amount of time I spent waiting on a phone call or the time I spent in hotels away from home.
good,Management couldn’t manage a candy store but the people you work with are great. You have a very poor work/life balance but for the most part you are able to provide for your family. This company needs a lot of improvement on how they treat their employees and their customers.
good,I loved my job at NS. I enjoyed the folks that worked there as well. Management is something of a question mark. I will say they hire you in the first day and Pat you on the back and then try to find a reason to fire you every day after the first. They lay off workers and then pat themselves on the back and give stock holders a bonus. Company doesn't value it's workers. Could've been a great career. But got laid off.
good,"I like working for NS. I enjoy my job as a conductor. It is a good paying job with excellent benefits.  I dislike my life balance and job security.  Over my career I have missed out on a lot of things for my family and my kids.  I have had to move my family a few times to try and avoid layoffs.  The company is making a lot of job cuts, so I'm afraid I will be laid off soon."
good,I would rather not say at this time.  This is a complex work environment and the less that is said about it the better during this time of transition.
good,"Everything about the job as far as the pay goes is solid.  However, I believe Norfolk Southern needs to improve the training process for new hires.  Management is poorly fair to an employee.  Culture ain't worth much.  The hardest part of the job is the work hours, so be prepared accept that as a new hire.  And the most enjoyable part of the job is having advancement, and great benefits."
good,"Work is very satisfying, but it seems that the company does all it can to fire employees. Not many things are done in favor of the employees and the contracts between the Union(s) and carrier are not honored."
good,"The pay is top notch for the work you do. However, the older employees and managers keep you stressed out and make you wonder if it's worth it. ""Old heads"" want to keep everything the same as when they started and don't want the department to advance in any areas. Manages apparently are told to not engage with employees and be as rude as possible. The hardest part of the job is ignoring the overwhelming negativity and focus on the job at hand. The most enjoyable part of the job is the paycheck."
good,"Norfolk Southern, NS, has many long term contractors. I was one of them. I was there for almost 8 years as project manager for 3 IT groups - Web Services/EDI and Database Groups, then the Enterprise Windows Services group for the last 6 years."
good,"oversee repairs"
good,The railroad isn't for everyone. I personally was hoping to advance but ended up moving in another directions. It's a rewarding job if you love the railroad.
good,Management cutting jobs caused my seniority to stall. Any bending of the rules results in company attempting to fire you. Union tries to protect jobs and employees but is unsuccessful most often.
good,"Hot in the summer and cold in the winter no room for advancement very dangerous job, good coworkers, great hours weekends off and no holiday work, pay was average"
good,"Operations at Norfolk Southern in Birmingham is very fast paced and requires lots of planning and organization in order to succeed. The employees are very prideful about their jobs and I enjoy leading them. Management will hold you accountable, and they expect you to lead by example as a company officer. The job can get stressful at times, but is rewarding in the end as well."
good,Low morale company wide. Management is always looking for a reason to fire you. Always keep you in the dark about what's going on in the company until it affects you.
good,Working at Norfolk Southern is very stressful. You never know when you're going to work and being on call 24/7 is not helpful. You never get to spend time with your family.
good,when you start you are on call for 24 hours.  will get at call 2 hours prior to going to work.  I enjoy the job that I do and the people that I work with.  Hardest part of the job is may having to do 16 hours without notice.
good,Great job if your willing to give up your home life. Managers are constantly trying to reprimand the employees to meet quotas. Hours are long and on call 24 hours a day.
good,Transportation managers are required to work all hours of the day and night and move often to anywhere on the railroad in order to advance.
good,"Great place to get your start, but don't stay too long or you'll end up miserable. Only saving grace is their excellent retirement benefits...but the price you pay is steep."
good,"At  Norfolk Southern I have had formal training consisting of supervisory leadership, material management, budgeting, reporting, and emergency problem solving."
good,"The railroad couldn't run a train around a Christmas tree. My husband spends endless time waiting to get in the yard to get home at a decent time. He misses every family function, holiday and special event. If they would learn to run crews across the road maybe these employees would have decent home lives"
good,Management is terrible and the pay is the lowest in the country for railroads. Not worth giving up your life and friends for such low pay.
good,"I gained a variety of good skills that I hope carry with me. It was really long work days in all kinds of weather, rain, snow, it didnt matter there was work to be done. Management was good for the most part."
good,It is a demanding company to work for that is adapting to industry changes.  There is ample opportunity for advancement and a large number of possible work location.
good,I enjoy what I do at work.  Work is a very hazardous work environment.  Company has made many cuts in the past year and I am worried I will be out of a job soon.
good,"The work on the railroad is good and serves more of a purpose than just making money.  Coworkers for the most part are good to each other, if you work hard then the work will get easier.  There are a lot of stupid rules that can actually get you fired although they say the purpose for these rules are safety.  Most of the rules just make the job more difficult.  If you show up and work you will make great money."
good,"Norfolk Southern has provided me with an outlook of perseverance, humility, and dedication.  The company gives our employees new and unique tasks every day.  The projects require very detailed organization, critical thinking, and problem-solving, along with managing all these different aspects of the projects."
good,The management not very knowledgeable when it comes to railroad practices they believe every thing can be done in just a few minutes when it takes time safety is fourth priority
good,Very volatile. Great benefits and pay. Management/ Supervisors acts like tough guys instead of leaders. Most employees are skilled and solid. Would recommend with caution.
good,I have work there for 8 years thought everything was good until new management took over and corporate greed set in. They started making big cuts across the system.
good,Good pay and benefits but you will never have a family or life.Weekends off never plus you are accountable for everything you work on. So if something fails it’s your fault and not supervision. Used to be a good place to work in the old days but times have changed and the Railroad has not.
good,"They sugar coat everything in the interview process. And during your 3 week training in McDounough, GA. You get home to start your on the job training and its nothing but chaos and confusion followed by another 90 days of never being home training out of town. They will hire 50-60 conductors, train them, then lay them all off. Lower management is ok, upper management not so much. The job itself is great, the company not so much. The company only cares about its stockholders, not their employees. Ask any railroader about life on the rails before applying to this company, you'll thank me later."
good,Good Job. Awful Home/work life. Good lifestyle for a young single man.  Safety rules are a must.  Follow them or get fired.  Which is a good thing.  Managment is awful.
good,"Norfolk Southern is a fast paced company which prides itself on safety. Typical responsibilities for a conductor are directing train movements, switching, supervising train operation, and making sure your train is being operated according to company rules and federal law."
good,"Great place to gain experience in the field through working with contractors, union employees, and other engineers. Travel is must if you want to succeed/ climb!"
good,"Its the railroad, supervision will lie cheat and steal every chance they get, drugs and alcohol run rampant, but some the guys are good to work with, overall its ok place"
good,The lack of complete leadership and concern and the fear and discontent that spread through the company harvested hate for the management and anger toward the union employees and vise versa is not ideal for a heathly work enviorment for anyone..
good,"""Cars in, cars out"" is the basis of what we do.  Learned even more about situational awareness with rail cars and their dangers.  The hardest part of the job is the lifestyle that has to be formed around it."
good,On a normal day we start off with a call to job brief about the duties that need to be porformed in the day ahead and how it will be done safely. When i arrive at the location of testing and maintenance then another job briefing is held with any works involved.
good,Laying off after putting many workers through training was very disappointing to discover recently. Could be a wonderful game lace to work but management needs to look after their workers rather than the numbers
good,"compensation is good,  A 70+ hour work week is common.  Vacation time is very good.  Managers are constantly second guessed and derided.  No balance between work/life."
good,"Management sucks. They have a job to do but the majority of them are just trying to move up the ladder and will get you in trouble for anything."
good,"If single this is a good job. As family is concerned it is very hard to plan a life. Lifestyle is hard, but if you pay attention to eating habits  and getting sleep when you get a chance it is not bad. Long hours away from family gets tough, but the reward is you are paid well. If you enjoy working outside this is a good job. Every day brings new and diverse challenges."
good,"The workplace culture at NS is one that drives morale down.  Job cuts are on everyone's mind and you think about it constantly.  If you are in a position where your management could change due to a retirement or reorganization, you fear that you will lose your job."
good,Do not agree with the policy of working out of town and working for the company but paying out of your own pocket. Transportation with the company is meant for single people
good,Its not for everyone but it might be for you. Plan to work long hours and weekends. Spending more time away then at home. All I can say is try and see. It wasn't for me .
good,"They don't want to know what I think. I have expressed my concerns about the future of our employees and I have been ignored. Wall Street runs this company now. If you're ok with that, then by all means jump on board. If you are looking for inspiration and personal fulfillment, you may want to continue looking elsewhere."
good,"jump from task to task with little organization. Middle management is the fall guy for problems with union employees unless you are liked by upper management. A workday starts at 10 hours and often goes 12 or more hours, then you are on call for emergencies 24/7 unless you are on vacation. As much as the company has tried to integrate departments to work together, that idea has not come to fruition. Duties are not compensated according to responsibility, 50 year old compensation are still in effect. It is also well known across the industry that NS pays the least to its managers."
good,The pay is high but the stress is through the roof. There is also a long period of time before you can hold any kind of regular job or schedule. Coworkers are generally good people.
good,A career at Norfolk Southern Corp is very demanding but can be very rewarding if initiative is given. It takes a lot of effort to learn the proper procedures and safety in that industry.
good,"A typical day at work varies whether you work locally in a yard or over the road taking trains to their destinations.  They send you to their own school for training and you learn a lot about the railroad industry, especially your first job as a conductor.  Unfortunately the management and the union have very polarizing viewpoints which can negatively affect the workplace environment.  The hardest part of the job would be having to work on call and not being able to plan a lot of things in your personal life.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the learning experience which can open up other opportunities down the road."
good,ALL benefits and pay are great. NO life outside of work. Lots of micromanaging from fresh out of college people. You have to be made of teflon to put up with the nonsense.
good,"If you love railroading, this is one place to do it. Get ready to be another number. It's kinda like a horse-drawn wagon, and you are the horse. Pay and benefits are good."
good,A typical day at work is busy and consist of long hours. Safety is important and it is important to remain focused at all times. It is a complex operation and multi-tasking is important.
good,I manage 80+ union employees and 4 non agreement supervisors. I am charged with running the daily operations of a Rail yard for 8+ hours daily 5 or more days a week. typically I work an 8 or 12 hour day unless there are issues than it can be up to 20 hours. my main functions are ensuring the safe and efficient operations of freight in the terminal and look  for cost saving and production efforts where we can.
good,I was assigned to patrol all rail yards in Detroit and S/E Michigan. I was to make sure there were no crimes being committed on or to the rail road property.
good,Company is well established. with proven success. Hardest part is dealing with 24 7 work availability. Outdoor work environment is a norm.
good,"A typical day as a conductor for Norfolk Southern included, getting all paperwork and information for train, making sure engine has all repair equipment ready for the trip, lining switches and derail, radio communication with everyone on the railroad, taking authorized orders from dispatcher, and much more."
good,I made descent money but I never knew when I had to work or when I'd be off.  The paychecks wern't consistent because it changed every payday.
good,"In the IT department, you are locked into a job.  Sure, your job-title might change, but you will not likely be doing anything else for a long time."
good,"good steady work at a fair wage, if willing to be on call 24/7 without days off or holidays. good training program, but has a set required career path. good benefits package."
good,Norfolk Southern provides excellent potential for initial hiring and then career growth for younger people with college degrees.
good,"Norfolk Southern is a wonderful company with unprecedented job security, a very enticing retirement package, and excellent benefits. The job sites on their system are not desirable. The level of respect from employee to supervisor and supervisor to supervisor is subpar. Upper level management uses micromanagement to fix problems that never seem to get fixed."
good,"Customer support "
good,"Build trains and then deliver them. overall a good company to work for."
good,New hires should not plan on working too much unless it summer months. You will be on a extraboard that fills in when regular people are off. The pay is good for this economy but the way your treated by management is terrible. They are known for harassment and itimidation to employees. There has been several cases against them under the whistle blower law. If you can go to work and ignore the stupid decisions and inexperienced management that make poor decisions this is the place to work.
good,Typical blue collar job where you are nothing more than a number. Agreement employees are held to a different standard than management. Most projects are reversed engineered where the burden is put on floor employees to figure out and implement.
good,"NS is a great company to build a career at.  Excellent opportunities to learn, responsibilities fit the positions, good people to work for.  Abundant opportunities for advancement."
good,Use to be a great company but corporate greed has ruined and cuts 1000s of jobs for shareholders benefit. Some Supervision is helpful but most is clueless and yes men.
good,Very dynamic. Environment and job description is always changing. Great benefits. Very useful experience gained from working on the car side and locomotive side of Mechanical department.
good,"Typical job, lots of work. Learning new things every day. Has responsibility for many projects early in being hired. Lots of different positions and opportunity."
good,Management running around looking for someone to fire. Payroll always trying to scam you out of a few dollars. On call 24/7. No rest. Benefits are GREAT. At this point they are furloughing and firing everyone. When its good its good. Right now its bad and appears to be going downhill fast.
good,good job and benefits. Old school management. Make sure you get all the insurances! Training for the job was good. They allow you to let them know when your ready to mark up.
good,The company is full of great employees who love the railroad and the transportation industry.  This company is the first and last job for many employees.  It is also considered an excellent place to retire based on the industry's Railroad Retirement Pension.
good,Company is not the same anymore focused on its shareholders and nothing else. Was never happier than to get hired here treated us great in the beginning.
good,"Work schedule is taxing. Work is on call as needed. A lot of night work. No such thing as a holiday. Weekend work often required. Job security pay and benefits are a huge plus, and it is one of the few jobs that still pays a pension. It's a hard life for a family."
good,Norfolk Southern is a good company to start your railroad career off at. Training is very good. The pay is the lowest of the Class I railroads and less than some Class II railroad. Benefits are good. They used to be great.
good,New leadership and direction is somewhat troublesome. Alot of oldheads are being pushed out for younger inexperienced employees that work for alot less.
good,"-Money is good although they have been cutting out overtime, new pay raises is starting to make up for the difference. "
good,The hardest part of the job is being on call 24/7 7 days a week for most jobs as a conductor or engineer. Management is sneaky and backstabbing. Money is great depending on the job. The most enjoyable part of the job are the coworkers.
good,"If you are a work a holic then awesome, you will love it. There is alot of room to promote quick when you will move anywhere and dont mind disciplining employees, If you value a work life balance, not for you. I enjoyed my job but not the 60-75 hours a week i worked while other people in other places across the system were getting paid the same and worked 45 hours a week. Employees are great most of the time, management not so much."
good,Could have been a better company if management was on same page a better schedule for all the workers would have took at alot of stress away and  healthier on our bodies
good,"I saw two people get fired after working there for many years for no serious reasons, and the nature of the job is too slow, you spend alot of time doing nothing by the desk."
good,"Norfolk Southern has always had wonderful benefits and good salaries, but their middle management leaves a lot to be desired. The company invests a lot of money in management training, but it seems that the managers do not want to listen to what the training says. If you are a good worker who doesn't need a lot of managerial support, then you will be able to easily excel at this company. The pay and benefits are worth it."
good,Great company to work for with great compensation and benefits.  It just takes up so much of your life.  You will have very little time for anything other than work.
good,NS is a great place to work if you are looking for good pay and retirement.  Other than that it is a company the truly does not care for its employees.
good,"Very unstable industry for next few years despite record profits. "
good,"Very competitive field, lots of opportunity for advancement. Relocation opportunities. Quality of life is not good. Hard to balance family and job duties."
good,"Company provides excellent compensation in return for a demanding job. A typical day consists of shift preparation, turnover, safety meeting, monitoring workforce, preparing turnover and briefing the incoming shift, and daily paperwork. I learned a lot about different management styles and cultures. I also learned how to manage in a strong union environment. As in any workforce there was a diverse workforce and managerial staff. The hardest and most time consuming part of my job was quelling rumors. The best part of my job was learning about the people I worked with."
good,"Can be a tough job with varying shifts and schedules, but as long as you can make that work then the pay and benefits are usually worth it.  Usually more of a career than a job."
good,"we safely transported train crews to and from the trains to keep them running in a timely, efficient manner. three drivers usually scheduled per shift, and the drives were scheduled to be equally divided, so that someone didn't drive 20 miles to someone else's 200. we kept records of our work in triplicate, and also were responsible for talking to the dispatcher. (dispatch let us know what crews needed to be moved). "
good,"Mostly on call positions which lead to poor lifestyles, unable to make plans, see family. Poor management in most areas. Struggle with off time. Work on a as needed basis."
good,I work between 8-10 hr days in which we must perform our duties safely.  Management has a good reputation in making sure we work safely and profficiently.  I dont belive there is a hard part of the job because everything is repetative. The most enjoyable part of my job is teaching the conductor trainees how to perform on the railroad.
good,"My work day involved, having a job briefing with all crew members involved with the current work for the day. We would build the train for the customers that we had to service for that day, working with management when needed to get the job done efficiently. The hardest part of the job was the random hours, and constantly sitting and waiting to perform our work."
good,Fantastically paid job however you will never be home. You are on call 24/7 and constantly under the threat of management trying to fire you.
good,"Diagnosis and repair all equipment that works on the rail and off rail, including Tampers, Ballasts Regulators, Snow Jets, Cranes, Spikers, Spike Pullers, Back hoes and Bulldozers. Work with all major diesel engine manufactures, Cat, Cummins, Duetz, Detroit, and John Deere. Perform all major repairs on the road with service truck. Diagnosis and repair diesel Power Plants and Packs, Compression Ignition Engine Fuel Systems, Compression Ignition Air Induction Systems, Vehicle Air Cooling Systems, Vehicle Liquid Cooling Systems, Automatic Transmission Assemblies, Manual Transmission Assemblies, Transfer Case Assemblies, Hydraulic Brake Systems, ABS Brake Systems,  Mechanical Steering Systems, Hydraulic Steering Systems, and Electrical Systems. Performs organizational and limited direct support maintenance, Troubleshooting Repair and Inspection on Heavy Mobile Equipment and Vehicles including service truck. Worked on several traveling gangs keeping up with the fleet of machinery, services and ordering parts."
good,Usually on call and away from home a lot. The guys you work with are pretty good for the most part but the ones in management have no structure about them.
good,The life sucks the moneys good if you can keep working. The bosses are good most if them but some are cut throat. When your out at work watch your back they'll do anything to try and get rid of someone. They have a tendency to over hire.
good,Expected to be furloughed after a year service. Management is constantly changing. Shareholder don't care about the worker they care about profit. not bad
good,"I understand fully that this job is an on call job where you may be called at any point in time, however the system seems outdated in certain degrees. The major problem with job overall however is the poor management, out-of-nowhere changes to the company, and care for employees. The management constantly ridicules and harasses employees for small things or nothing at all. Management seemed to be massive bullies the entire time I was there and didn't seem to care about employee care or even their own lives. I was let go and fired by management due to 1) being overcrowded in the work place and 2) not being in the union. They didn't try to fight for us they just let us go like we were always expendable. I thought going in it was going to be a great company (especially for being a Fortune 500 company) however it shady than legit when I arrived. If you like getting paid and want good insurance, then job works. But if you also want to be treated like a human being, I suggest finding something else."
good,"The company does not value family and it is also hard to advance upward in management unless you know someone. If you are a conductor, expect to work long hours and be on call for years"
good,good co.pany very stressful always looking to fire you pay good not good for transgender. no place for people who isnt safwty mibded. bad manafement and
good,"Pros"
good,I was a Locomotive Electrician for just one month short of 10 years. I really did enjoy my time there for the most part. My issues were with the idiots in management.
good,good job with benefits all weather conditions required management potential for interested persons high potential for unexpected layoffs no guarantee of long term emoyment
good,"Overall, the company itself is horrible. The work is not difficult. The railroad culture is good, as long as you have thick skin. The main reason to work for this company is the great benefits"
good,"Norfolk Southern was an amazing career opportunity for a kid out of high school, no college degree, no advanced skills, and no family. However, due to the greed of modern day corporate America, the company has made cuts upon cuts to slash their workforce down to the bare minimum. This in turn eliminates any form of morale at the lower levels of employment while it lines the pockets with millions for the elite few that benefit from it. While those that work the ground have union protection, management literally fears for their job every minute of the day."
good,This job is not hard. The work is actually fairly easy. The long day are not bad either. Its the unknown schedule and hours that make the job hard. not knowing what days your going to be working or the time your going in to work. Not knowing if its going to be a 6 hour day or a 12 hour day.
good,management is not very personable some are and they make it a good workforce but the business is all about stockholders freight and bottom line transportation employees are expendale
good,Tired of supervisors trying to micro manage and find things to write people up about because they scared to stand up to foreman and tell their employees are doing a great job
good,"I liked the work and learned how to stick weld. But the ""office politics"" were hard to deal with. The work wasn't strenuous enough. Management often tried to stretch federally mandated rules to increase profits and car inspectors were required to keep the public safe. It was a tug of war often times."
good,"honestly the job was not terrible. It was a very management versus employee type of place but the worst part for me was the amount of time you didn't have anything to do. You were mostly on call just waiting for work. I dreamed for work. But most of the time you just sat around on the train waiting for another train to pass on their congested network. Not entirely their fault, but definitely not for me. If you like a job that where you are either really busy or really not busy than this is the job for you."
good,Norfolk Southern is a stable company to work. Most people are friendly and easy to get along with. Work environment isn't stressful. Opportunity to learn new technologies
good,"Didn't work here long enough to know much of the company. I came into the office, worked, ate, then went home.  I'm only typing all this because I have to for my resume to be uploaded."
good,"The job that I had at Norfolk southern was temporary, but horribly mis managed. I was working as an intern, had 3 different managers that never communicated, and it was overall an unenjoyable expereince, though it seems isolated."
good,"Great benefits, no family like.  Traveled from Sunday to Thursday.  Good company with great pay and benefits.  A lot of travel, good training. Provided company vehicle."
good,Not of a lot of time with company due to getting layed off.  I was basically a standby to fill spots due to people being on vacation or missing work.  Would have liked the chance to work more.
good,"The job is easy. Pay attention. The hardest part is being away from the family so much. Travel is required."
good,"Was on call and was called all the time. "
good,I enjoyed the internship.  I met a lot of great connections and was given the option to continue working at the company full time after college.  I travelled all over which was the best part.
good,"Responsible for safe transportation of consumable goods and hazardous materials in accordance with Federal Railroad Administration rules and regulations in addition to company guidelines and regulations.   Operated track switches and supervised train movements to properly place, couple and inspect rail-car equipment and assemble freight trains in rail yards."
good,NS is a great place to work. Promotions are limited to many employees. The company could improve its HR recruiting and selection processes. I would however recommend this company to college graduates.
good,You work with a group of guys who watch out for you and you do on job training. Management tried to cause problems between guys just to get reactions out of people.
good,"Stressful, Long hours, On call 24/7, Put your personal life on hold because the railroad comes first, the MOW&S still has a very visible glass ceiling and the workplace culture will never appeal to the majority of women with children or looking to start families due to the long hours and the railroad comes first attitude."
good,If you think you would enjoy being away from your family for 30-48 hrs at a time then by all means apply but if like to watch your kids grow up dont even think about it.
good,"This is a role unlike I' have ever had previously.  I thrive on high stress environments and working as a team to accomplish a goal or task.  While NS provides a vey challenging atmosphere, the expectations can be unrealistic at times.  It is very difficult to find balance between work/family life which puts a strain on the family unit.  While I am well compensated, I wonder if it matches what I and others in my role actually do."
good,Challenging and lots of heavy travel. Must be available to 24 hour/ 7 days a week on-call. Benefits are excellent in all categories. Start out as Conductor and advance to Engineer.
good,Company had great benefits.  Workplace culture was on the conservative side.  It's been over 17 years since I've worked for them.  I can not provide a current review of the company.
good,"great benefits, good pay but not a lot of time offered if your a family person until years of seniority depending on location. everything will always be good as long you follow the rules and show up for work."
good,NS was a great place to work.  Great pay and benefits.  Union job so you were generally treated fairly.  Sadly operations have ceased at several of their rail yards to make the company more profitable for the investors
good,Norfolk Southern is a good company overall for students graduating. If you are looking to advance with this company then it can be a struggle if you do not come into the company in a non union position.
good,"proactive railroad transportation company. safety ,priority. production and ontime train service a priority. supervision sometimes does not have enough rest time at home"
good,was my dream job but have been laid off. went south real fast. now I have to struggle with my family to try and make ends meet and put food on the table. NS use to be the most efficient railroad out there but greed has gotten the best of them!!!
good,"A typical day could consist of scheduling training sessions, facilitating classes, evaluating trainers, reviewing course content, developing or revamping course content; you get the idea. With my current job I've learned the importance of investing in the development of people. Developing and delivering training for adult learners must exist of a foundation of various learning methods and different learning levels. As challenging as this may appear, it can be achieve by identifying and utilizing the various talents of the group in association to the task. The job can be very demanding but the reward is in the success of those who come through our training center."
good,"working with various conductors and helping the new ones was enjoyable, Some management was good. best part of job was always learning something new. hardest part was dealing with difficult people."
good,"Management was always lost or confused, rarely had accurate information regarding your work for the day.  Company could be run 5 times more efficient with proper leadership."
good,this is a great company to work for. I like the job and the co workers are good to get along with and i would recomend the company to others if they would like to apply with NS
good,works are good good pay do u like outside weather heavy trains continue work being on call relocation being home or over the rail work
good,enjoy what i do. my co-worker are easy to get alone with. learned a lot about the railroad and how to work safe. Develop many skills
good,"Annual bonus contingent upon success of the industry, huge gap in Baby Boomers to Millennials, old school culture with dominated management of males."
good,"This is the job I co-oped during school and was hired as a full time contractor through Open Systems. What I found impressive about the company was the importance it place on hiring co-ops from nearby colleges. This showed the company's invested interest in future workers."
good,Excellent Benefits and retirement opportunities.  High liability job with a lot of risk.  Expect to relocate frequently.
good,"The company is a solid company and will be around for years to come. Pay and benefits are better than most employers offer. The problem is the work environment. It is stressful and not employee friendly. Management has more concern with what the company wants than for the welfare of the employees. Safety is a main concern which is good but rules enforcement takes priority over common sense in many cases. A job with this company can be a good career but you must be willing to deal with strict rule enforcement and in most cases supervisors who have little concern for the employees and are definitely ""company"" men."
good,Great benefits.  Growth to advance.  Would recommend any young person to apply for a position there.
good,"Great pay, always on call then mandatory promotion to engineer"
good,"- Nice people"
good,Stable Industry Leader but lacks management willing to develop employees; Old school management style
good,Enjoyed job. Had Medical issues and chose to leave. Nice benefits. Safety was a very very important thing and your job depended on it. Good and bad people everywhere.
good,"Although it's a great company, the money was not worth giving up all my personal time with my family."
good,I managed train crews from Canada to Detroit. I was responsible in calling crews to fill work orders in the shipment of goods across north america.
good,Crazy hours but great benefits and retirement.Getting up in the middle of the night to go to work was not fun but it was a decent living
good,Very political since it's not a competitive industry.  Don't go there if you want to remain at the leading edge of your field.  They do spend money on professional development.
good,Good place to work but not sure about the future....good pay and benefits....  good group of people to work with. ....too many layoffs and job cuts to plan for a long future right now might get better later
good,It was an okay experience. Honestly there are a lot contractors and people who are not there to help. The internship program should be more organized.
good,"It has good benefits, but is a stressful place to work.  You will make a good salary, but will not have much of a life.  You spend most of your time on the road and when you are at home you are sitting by the phone waiting to go to work."
good,"outside work, year round, 24/7. not physical but required exceptional alertness.had to learn hundreds of rules and signal meanings.very dangerous at times and in the case of a fatality you had to remain vigilant  until management arrived."
good,"Right now with precision railroading it is not the place to be , I come in everyday wondering whether I will have a job . It is now completely run by stockholders.they do not care whether or not if you will be able to survive without a job there , Only the stockholders . Whether you will be able to eat is not there problem..."
good,"On call majority of the time, learned a lot about the rail industry, and enjoyed the work.  The pay was good, it was just quality of life that was lacking."
good,Stay away from train and engine service unless you like living at there beckoning. Yes you are on call 24/7. for many years. Forget about a family life.
good,"stressful and also hotel stays with a 24 hour on call schedule, limited sleep with changing shifts. managers are hard to work with and the job in general is dangerous."
good,"I felt like I was contributing nothing to the world on this job. Typing, contacting the rail crew, contacting customers, etc. The job is easy enough, but management tries to make things difficult at times."
good,While I worked at Norfolk Southern I saw many people get promoted when jobs were not posted and people in my department knew nothing about the openings. There were people in my department that had been there for 20 + years. They told me that they had applied for other positions but were always turned down. So there was no opportunity for growth in my department. 
good,It is a good job with good pay and benefits and good people to work with.  But the management has turned it into a hostel work environment. They have started  trying to fire everyone they can or make them quit to cut costs and make more money for the stock holders.
good,"It's the railroad. If you don't mind a 1.5 hour call to work, any time day or night, and never sure where you'll be the next day, then it's a great job. Puts a lot of stress on family life, but if you're single, go for it. It's good money and benefits."
good,"This company focused heavily on safety which was a great philosophy in this setting. The rail shops have many potential dangers but the company does a good job to try and minimize risks. The job is really what you make out of it, depending on how well you get along with the other people you work with. It is hard work but most days go by fast as long as everyone does what's needed. Communication from upper management was not as efficient as I would've liked and there were many points where projects were stalled for issues that could have been easily planned for."
good,The compensation and benefits are amazing. You get 3 weeks vacation and bonuses starting out. There's a lot of opportunity for advancement. Work-life balance is horrible. Company expects you to stay engaged 24/7. Lot's of shift work and late nights into morning. Sometimes you aren't allowed to take your vacation depending on what is going on.
good,Keep trains on the track and to keep the public saftey. The hardest part is getting used to the weather outside. But I have learn alot of things about trains and operations.
good,"Disciplined, dependable professional with experience in accounting, payment system processing, special projects and customer service. A team member with the ability to work in multifunctional groups, maintain close customer relations, meet tight schedules, and remain flexible in a dynamic work environment."
good,"This was an incident that occurred one of my first weeks at Norfolk Southern.  I had to come out to a site in Trenton, Michigan  where I had to relieve another conductor because of a railcar he underestimated the distance on,not placing the car in its proper track. Instead of it going in properly it derailed leaving the car teetering back and forth on the rail. Once I was on site I talked my engineer back where we connected to the railcar, salvaged the railcar and put it properly on the track with no damage to the car or injury to ourselves. The hardest part of that job was visibility because it was dark and snowing. the most enjoyable part was helping ultimately get this railcar put back on track"
good,"- Great Railroad benefits"
good,Great first job out of college and great introduction to business.  Exposure to many different groups and unique industry challenges. Old fashioned culture.
good,"Great company as far as pay, benefits and job security go. You might ask what else could you want.....a personal life and rest I say. If you didn't know the railroad operates through rain, sleet, snow etc. There is no work/balance for new management. Expect 3rd shift with tues/wed off and in some cases 12+ hr 5 day work weeks."
good,One of the best group of people I have ever worked with so far.
good,"good days. bad days. Compensated very well for your time, but no social life early on."
good,"It is an OK company to work for, but the pay is not great."
good,"If you are looking for an employer that encourages free and innovative thinking, a railroad is not for you! It is a solid work environment but the layers of management make change happen very slowly. Like any large corporation, there is so much potential for improvement but everyone is busy guarding their turf."
good,"Great Job with good benefits. Will be working nights, holidays and weekends, so it can be hard for a young person to adjust to."
good,"Good job with nice benefits. However, scheduling and future uncertainty over technology advances make it a little unsettling.Most of the work is outdoors so you need to be prepared for the weather."
good,"Overall a good company, but lately seems like they’ve lost their way. Benefits are good, but are not as good as when I hired on 13 years ago. The people in the office buildings in Norfolk and Atlanta get a lot of perks which are not available to those working across the system, which is most employees so don’t let on-site childcare and things like that fool you, unless you’re at the two corporate locations you’re not getting that. Work-life balance depends on what you do; for most people in the field there is a whole lot of of work and not much life. It takes a special kind of person to work here and enjoy it. I’ve been somewhat negative but overall I’ve enjoyed my positions here and enjoyed the work. I’ve made a very good living to support myself and my family and the company has been very generous, so I’m very thankful for that and I can’t really complain."
good,Norfolk southern is a very rewarding job. A typical day consist on being on call until your spot has reached first on the boar. Once your spot has reached #1 you will receive a call telling your where and what train you have and its final desitination. Once the train arrive to it's home terminal you will be transported to hotel once rested  you will repeat the same process. I feel Norfolk Southern was a great job just very time consuming.
good,was a great place to work but alot of hours and stress i enjoyed what i did but some management was terrible.sometimes did not understand at all about family issues.worked alot of hours and was even asked to work more then i had too.
good,"This company is a good one for people with family or other focuses, but less approrpriate for young professionals who want to learn the most trending technlogy skills"
good,The day starts before the sun and often remains unfinished. working with a union is difficult as a manger. as a supervisor you feel like you are fighting with the employees and management above you
good,I survived a culture that pits management employees against contract employees. And it’s all about money. Where does management win via the labor contracts(there are different contracts for different crafts) and where do the contract employees win? Every Day.
good,Working as a conductor is a life style not a job. on call everyday of the year. the money you can make off sets it a little. hardest part of this job is walking and staying awake.
good,Training pay sucks starting off...senority based job...work on call for at least 4-5yrs. Can make money in the right situation. Health and 401k benefits are OK
good,It's a good job to have. Employees are great to work with but if you do not enjoy working in the elements then this job is not for you. A typical day can be lengthy depending on amount of trains called.
good,"This an organization that is currently surviving a transformation.  The closure of one faciltiy has the domino affect within the organization.  This also includes major renovations, and relocation of the Atlanta office. For many this transformation has brought about change which can be positive.  The relocation has forced our department to a new location but still i  walking distance for the original building.  For me his is welcomed because I am accustomed to change.   I am adaptable and flexible which I am reminded of daily by staff.  The day begins with the distribution of daily report to staff and management.  The responsibility of revenue protection comes with daily challenges, because there are new scenarios.  These are learning experiences for myself because there is a wealth of knowledge from others in the department.  Most have longevity in excess of 16 years.  This is fascinating but also provides the skills required to train new staff, and other employees.  There teamwork, and passion to retrieve revenue on a daily basis is rewarding and reflected in the department.  There is not a task incomplete at the end of the day.  The hardest part is to see that these employees have the potential but management does not challenge them. They exceed the daily requirements but there should be progression for those that exceed their job description.  The fact that I work in an union shop has been a learning experience."
good,"Communication is vital in executing assigned tasks that are constantly given verbally, and/or via the crew management center task order listings.  Disseminating work to train and engine crew while adhering to their rest restrictions, status changes, is crucial in developing relationships.  I know one must be proactive instead of reactive to all imminent tasks that lie ahead.  So anticipation must be administered on a constant basis, with an look behind, right now, and look ahead attitude.  To sum it all up, the most enjoyable time is quitting time."
good,Very diverse company to work for and fast paced. There is room for advancement if you want it. Salary and benefits are good. Very good company to work for.
good,Didn’t expect much but it was a good experience . I liked the fact that i was close to home . I was kind of promised a permanent position but it never happened.
good,Overall as a whole this is a great company to work for.the management is fair and are professional with the employees.the only big downside to working for them is the ammount of time it takes to get PTO.
good,To advance you had to relocate and possibly with little notice. You were sold on the benefits first then it seemed the actual reality of the job was nothing as told.
good,"It was tough. Training was all over the place, had people tell me to find a job elsewhere, and I didn't enjoy it. At the end of the day, I was not happy and ready to try something else."
good,Hardest part of the job was learning everything at once in a short amount of time and being on call at any time of the day. The best thing about the job is the money.
good,"As a rail road employee, we rarely have any type of daily schedule.  The rail road runs 24 hrs a day 365 days a year and you have to be alert and ready when your phone rings. There is a tremendous amount of responsibility involved but there is training and you learn to work with all types of people, most of them very helpful and some of them not so much, but if you are willing to learn the job can be great!  You work in all kinds of weather and get accustomed to that.  Keeping yourself focused on the job at hand is extremely important, it is a very dangerous job and nothing can be taken for granted.  The days are rarely eight hour days and usually twelve hours of longer, a lot of time is spent away from your family in hotels.  But if you like to travel and see parts of the landscape few get the privilege to see it is a great job and a great adventure that pays very well.  It isn't a job for just anyone, but if you are willing to work hard and be on time, you can enjoy a career on the rails."
good,"The railroad is a stressful place to work, the work life balance is hard to obtain. On call lifestyle of management employees in one of the busiest rail hubs in America is never ending, the retirement is great and the job can sometimes be rewarding."
good,Jobs at the job site were very long hours and sometimes seven days a week was very hard keeping reliable help no matter what you offered people just seem like they did not want to work I found after many years working as a team really works keeping advancement and giving well-done to who it deserves keeps workers happy they seem to work harder and are more responsible
good,Hard work that was fast. Worked in teams had a few breaks threw out the day. Good pay and a chance to grow. I was unlucky and got poor management but that is rear my brother father and uncle still work for them and are doing well.
good,It was a pleasure to work for this company and be exposed to a multitude of challenging and exciting opportunities. The people are pleasant and always thoughtful.
good,"If you do your job, you'll be fine.  People are nice.  Upward movement is limited depending on the department you work in, which has caused many employees to become quite disgruntled."
good,Objective was to achieve 2 miles a day of inspecting a repairing East coast railroads. Management was 18th century(not so good) Everyone got along but sometimes very unfair decisions were made.  I enjoyed getting off int the evenings a where ever we were managed to find a pool hall.
good,"a secure company to work for, benefits are good however hours may be long.  learned how to manage people and challenges that come along with that.  CEO is very caring and nice."
good,"very interesting culture, continuing making head on innovation but still has a long way to go. excellent opportunity for growth."
good,"Working for the railroad, not just NS, is an extremely demanding lifestyle. On call 24/7 with 90 minutes notice to be on duty. A lot of guys choose this lifestyle for the money that can be made which is available to MOST employees. I was laid off in January of 16 after being hired in May of 15. I never made any significant amount of money and sometimes went an entire week without being called for work (unheard of in normal railroad setting). You will be required to learn a lot of information and if you fail to do so or don't take it seriously enough you could easily get hurt, killed or fired. People get on these posts and use it as an opportunity to vent their complaints about a company which is ridiculous. The company really has nothing to do with the root of their problems. NS isn't a bad company to work for but the railroad industry has many cons with some pros. Be prepared."
good,Hours are hard on your family. On call 24/7. Away from home constantly
good,I loved working there. The work is challenging. You do something different every day. You have to have a great deal of knowledge of the different places that you work at. You work away from home and rarely have weekends or holidays off. You don't get to see family. It isn't for every body. It is different than any job you will ever do.
good,"Supervisors work for sata they r brain washed. Heart cut out no concise,  if you can deal and turn your concise off  , go for it  it will pay for your lifestyle till you die and go to hel.  no home life at all   Good luck"
good,"Constantly on call, but great pay and benefits. Great job if you're okay with not having a life outside of the job. That is all"
good,Would be a great place to work if the coal industry was booming.
good,Working there is a life style change because you are on call 24/7 and going to work at all different times. It was fun but over the course of time the stability of the job is shaky.
good,"I worked there for 3 years and then joined the military with intentions on coming back under federal law and 2 weeks before my contract was up, they laid off over 31 electricians, to include myself without any head notice. Good pay, and will provide training but you have to go to work everyday wondering if you have a job to go to or if someone will pull your shift. Poor Management"
good,"They are always trying to find a way to downsize and squeeze people out if the door. The main office is moving from Roanoke to Atlanta, so they may have more jobs."
good,Good benefits and retirement. Not much work and family life balance. Relaxed atmosphere and must be a quick thinker and respond quick to certain situations
good,You will not be able to find better pay and benefits but you will never be home. 48 hour round trips and often only 10 hours at home before starting another trip. no holidays and almost no time off. Management is harsh and you need the unions protection often even as an excellent employee. Can be dangerous.
good,For such a big company you would expect more.   Management has to find things wrong to prove that their jobs are worth keeping.  Most of the employees here are good people.  Worst part of the job is the management.
good,"Norfolk Southern Corp is a very great company. I enjoyed the high level of management responsibility that molded me in to a great leader. The company on the other hand will work you 24/7 365 days. There was not much of a down time to spend with family, if any. I enjoy being recognized for the change I made with the company. I loved seeing my work trend in the right direction while working as a team."
good,"Your family has to be flexible with your work schedule that Railroad provides. You are on call all the time and have 90 mins to get to your train once called for a job. Time with family is limited until you get a seniority position that would then have a consistent schedule. I found my family in this situation and I'm a family man, especially with another on the way. The money is GREAT however you can't have both."
good,"Maintain and test crossings, switches and electrical components/track circuits.Its outside work so you have to work in all types of weather. Must have strong troubleshooting skills."
good,"Your day starts when you get the phone call to come into work. You have 2 hours to arrive on time once called. You use all of your training to work as safely and efficiently as possible to get your train built and over the road as quickly as possible. Management tried to rule by intimidation, not all managers but some did. The hardest part of the job was being on call 24/7 and having to live by your phone. The most enjoyable part was working out doors and always using your mind to figure out new situations because you could work the same job everyday, but have a different outcome each day."
good,a very dangerous place to work and no productive interactions between the supervisors and employees. you are forced to go to engineer school and if you don't pass you will not be able to go back to your craft.
good,Pay is good benefits are great but no time for a normal life. Always on call. You will have to work almost every holiday and only have 7/10 weekends off a year unless you mark off.
good,If you’re single and no kids and want to make money this is the job for you. Your first few years might be a small struggle because of where you’ll be at pay rate wise but it’ll get better.
good,"Pay and benefits are great. The work schedule is hard to get used to.Management needs to worry more about their employees, rather than getting a promotion."
good,Everyday its a new rule or a new supervisor that has no clue what you actually do.  The guys you work with are are the thing that make most days bearable.
good,"I enjoyed working for NS.  The pay and benefits are good for my region of the country, and my co-workers were colorful, but enjoyable to work with.  After work there is no thought of what did not get done, which means low stress to me.  The negative aspects are that you will start at 75% pay grade, and it takes five years to get to 100% doing the same work.  Job security is not stable in the beginning, and it takes a special person with a positive mindset to adjust to the irregular hours through out your entire career."
good,"Great pay longggg hours. Working horrible hours, asking permission to leave town on your rest days(Monday and Tuesday) run like the mafia. If your mothers on her deathbed, you still show up to work."
good,"All in all most jobs with Norfolk Southern pay very well for the work involved. The down part is most jobs are on call until you can build seniority. The management style is very old school, more down talking than most are used to."
good,"Great pay, terrible work/life balance. On call 24/7/365. Co-workers made the job worth it. Job can be stressful or relaxed depending on how you handle the situations."
good,"Norfolk Southern was a well rounded job with its ups and downs. A typical day involved pre-planning routes and procedures for our work, handling paper work, communicating with proper authority and executing our work according to plan. Work culture as far as fellow employees was great because everyone looked out for each others safety and well being. Management would often rush employees to meet deadlines such as times to complete work, but we always had a compromise between employees and management to complete our work as quickly and safely as possible."
good,Overall NS is a good place to work with the ability to advance and move to other departments depending on your skills. The medical and dental benefits are about average compared to any other job.
good,Lots of walking. Good pay. Good insurance. They will fire you for no reason at all. Really liked the people I worked with but management  was always out to get everyone there
good,As a road supervisor you are on call 24/7 and the phone rings constantly. Home life really takes a hit. Management depends on the territory. You are required by the company to work over night on occasion. This is by no means an easy job.
good,NS Railroad has good benefits and pays well but working in the transportation department is difficult because of time away from home and odd hours while working the extra board.
good,"Work life balance is non existence for operations supervisor. The pay is good benefits are ok, retirement is phenomenal. In general a high stress work environment."
good,"Norfolk southern competes in pay grades with other competitor companies. They promote from within, with moving packages that help you transition, in case of relocation"
good,"Working at NS has its good days and bad, but i enjoy who i work with. Competitive salary, no two days are the same to say the least. I've learned how to be technical in my role, as technology has improved and will always evolve,. The hardest part of the job is how much of a workload you may have, it does get pretty overwhelming with specific deadlines."
good,"Good retirement job with good benefits. Management was the worst. They made you feel as if you had to worry about being run off from your job. A lot of nepotism, cut throat, and micromanagement."
good,"Not for the faint of heart.  Long work hours, longer working hours in the days, 24 hour transportation operations, and only went to work when you are called by the phone."
good,"	Assisted and instructed train crews with coupled and uncoupled cars."
good,"Conducted inventories and accountability of tractor trailer containers. Associate with the different work areas to accomplish inventories. Easy basic job for the wages, however there was not enough structure or supervision control."
good,"Norfolk Southern is a good place to work with great pay and benefits."
good,very unpredictable schedule.  Compensated well for your time.  a tough crowd to work with.  Physical work in the yard. I didn't have a problem with management although many did.  Enjoyed my co-workers and they were very helpful through the learning process.
good,"On call 24/7 everyday of the year, not a suggestible job for a family man"
good,Norfolk Southern was to busy adding young diverse talent that they did not even look at what they already had in place.
good,Norfolk southern rwy. has always provided fair wages and good work environments.
good,Good pay but job security is just not there anymore. So be prepared to be furloughed at some point in time maybe multiple times. I hired in February 28 2011. It’s actually a decent place to work but just try to keep a backup plan in your back pocket.
good,Great place to work and you are well compensated for your time away from home. You must have a very flexible life due to the very hectic and unpredictable schedule.
good,You will make money. Your health and weight will decline. Home time on the road jobs is terrible. Your social life will be non existent. But they money is good if you can handle everything else.
good,"Co- workers are great, helpful. Always have to worry about job security. Management is hit or miss depending on location. Never sure where you will be able to work or how long."
good,"I liked the company... work is good, pay is good,,friendly people to work with..what more can i Say?  Being ask to review a former employer is not cool..this ought not to be required....."
good,"Tests, tests, tests!  You must pass a lot of tests if you're going to learn to be a conductor.  There are many rules to memorize and use daily on the job.  Your safety depends on it!  I love the job, and wish I could still be working but after 8 months of work, I was furloughed.  The earliest I could return is 3-6 months!  Railroad fluctuates based on the economy.  You will need at least 5 years seniority to be safe from lay offs, but everyone would say, it's worth the retirement, so bank your money hardcore.  I can't wait to return to work."
good,It’s rough getting started but get through 5 years and it’s a nice job to have benefits are great and if you’re in the military you get paid while you’re deployed
good,NS has been an amazing experience for myself. I have loved trains since I was a small child and now I get to drive and work on them. But with the recent culture change of Precision scheduled railroading the fun in the job is beginning to die inside me and many of my closest friends have lost their jobs to corporate greed of the almighty dollar.
good,The company encourages mobility. You can pretty much move between departments freely. Great place to work. The company is moving towards the new age with technology and beliefs.
good,"Working at Norfolk Southern is a strenuous job made difficult due to poor management. Hard work is expected however, not rewarded. Excellent opportunity provided to gain hands on technical skills. The hardest part of the job was the uncertainty of whether or not you will have a chance to work. This is not a job for a family oriented person. You rarely have the time to spend with your family."
good,"Less secure than the RR used to be, selling out employees for profit margins. Some managers are threatened by knowledge and are malicious when intimidated. Hard workers are exploited. Different cultures in different departments. Had to find out from local news media about relocation to new state instead of from Company ""leadership""."
good,"I worked at the 24/7 help desk that was quite stressful. Most of the time I worked 1st shift Mon.-Fri. but, I also worked a lot on 2nd shift, including one or both weekend days."
good,"dangerous"
good,"on call 24/7, 365. stay in gross hotels. management hides in bushes to try an catch u breaking rules. can be a dangerous job.  not good for a family.."
good,"It's a very demanding job and will consume most of your life. Typically 12 hour shifts or so. The culture is fairly down as our safety metrics on the railroad are poor. Hardest part of the job is always being awake. The most enjoyable part of the job is always learning something new, the opportunity for growth, and the retirement plan."
good,"Be willing to work different shifts, starting out you will most likely be on 3rd shift, be willing to travel, have a clean police record, no drug usage, in good physical health."
good,"Operation track switches, couple cars, applied hand brakes, track warrants, and assembling trains in the rail yard in compliance with all safety rules and regulations."
good,working the extra board with no schedule was extremely difficult on family and family life. management was good safety was a main stay of the company and I felt very comfortable with that being so. I worked there for 6+ years with no safety issues good job reviews and maintained a safe work culture in my station and area of work - ALWAY  put SAFETY FIRST
good,The rail industry is making strides to stay relevant and competitive.  The company is becoming more diverse in upper management as well as more socially conscious. All levels of management however do not follow the corporate example.
good,"Productive, demanding work environment with pingpong table.  As a Sr. Service Operator, my daily duties were upon assignment to perform print jobs on either xerox or Riso printers, shipping and/or receiving and when called upon mailroom services.  Overall very challenging and productive."
good,Not enough direction. Operational confusion daily. FRustration at lack of support from upper level management account managements lack of understanding of the job we do.
good,"I love how diverse my job is, here at Norfolk Southern (Signalman/Maintainer).  I tend to get bored fairly quickly with things, and my position is constantly exposed to different scenarios (IE:  different equipment that's being upgraded, terrain, job location).  We definitely don't do the exact same thing very often at all."
good,This is a very good place to work if you are 30 years old or younger. You will give up your life for the railroad. it is extremely hard to plan time with family.
good,Working with a union allows you to have job security and a layer between you and management. Be ready to work and work hard. Worth the guff you would get at any other job.
good,"Tough for those trying to have a family, but great benefits, pay and co-workers. Great for exploring more parts of the country and becoming more connected with employees at different places."
good,"As a conductor your on call, that means it can be a blizzard outside and if they call you, you have 2 hours to report to your terminal(some terminals are 90 minutes). So its hard to determine when your going to work next. Physical job as well, sometimes you'll be outside for over 10 hours or more depending on what job your on. Pay was pretty decent, but the job wasn't for me. But it was pretty fun being on a locomotive going 50 mph."
good,I learned a lot and got paid very well during my time at Norfolk Southern. Sadly they outsourced the department I worked in so there is no chance I can re-apply for that position.
good,"If you get to be an employee, you get a job for near-life and a great retirement.  Work demands are reasonable to lax.  Pay is moderately low.  I was a long term contractor which is terrible there - no chance for advancement, drastic pay cut to become employee, and 0 rate increases allowed as long as you work there.  People were nice for the most part, but ultra-conservative management."
good,Good company to work for depending on the area. I worked in the coal industry so work was on and off. Very good pay and benefits. I would recommend anyone to seek this job for a career.
good,"Old school company that provides great job security. If you are looking for a steady job, a typical nine to five day, friendly co-workers and a good retirement, this is the place."
good,"Good if you are single. Work hours, are uncommon and erratic. Good pay and compensation. The saying they hire you to fire you is pretty much true. Great Benefits"
good,Not always home with family..Work nights..Weekends..Some holidays..Has good insurance and retirement benefits. Could be on call for many years before being able to hold a regular job but pay is good.
good,"Norfolk Southern is an excellent place to work. They pay great money for people without a college degree, and even more for the managers who do have a degree. Be prepared to be gone from home a lot if you are a trainman. Be prepared to move if you're a manager."
good,I enjoyed the internship.  I met a lot of great connections and was given the option to continue working at the company full time after college.  I travelled all over which was the best part.
good,"A typical day was 12 to 16 hours, and on occasion 24 hours if there was an accident, incident or bad weather. What i learned - The rules and regulations. Management - The open and accepted refusal of co-workers to work as a team.  The hardest part was definitely the hours. The most enjoyable was definitely the training, travel, and the responsibility"
good,"This is the best job I have ever had, I loved working with Trains, being outside and meeting such wonderful people.  We transported merchandise by trains, we learned how to build trains, and learned the territory for our district."
good,"Typed letters, reports, freight bills, balance due bills, and various forms for a team of  six or seven Customer Accountants.  Posted payroll for union employees.  Posted vacant job positions.  Reconciled unidentified payments for the monies to deposited into banks for use by the Company."
good,wow always waling and have to listen to people cry out about being at work then you have people that have been working for 40 years and don't know the rules or signals and you can get fired for getting a 85% on a Rules Test just crazy
good,Strong safety focused company. Work diffrent tasks daily. Work is out side. Co workers are great and managment is ok.Learned many deiffrent heavy equiptment.
good,This is a very stable company with many opportunities for advancement.  In hindsight I would not have ever left.
good,"""Hurry up and Wait"""" was a quote commonly used during my time on the railroad. A typical day started with Logging into the company system and checking bulletin up-dates concerning the conditions, hazards and overall activity on the railroad. A daily safety  meeting and stretch was required, from that point it could go from hurry up and do a assignment to waiting for action."
good,Very low morale in the work place. I have learned a lot about federal railroad admin and railroad rules and regulations.
good,This is a great company to be apart of. Fellow employees were so nice and it was a great experience for me here.
good,"Very structured, with difficult work schedule. Worked on-call for 15 years out of 20. Management was always trying to fire you. Very stressful."
good,If you dont like work any and all shifts and weekends and holidays this is not the place for you. You will also be required to work on holidays and fill in for others unplanned.
good,"It was a great job. I had a zero stress for the entire time I was there. I had no issues working alone or with a partner, many times my partner would be from a different craft. Felt that I could go to any supervisor at anytime for help with any issue I may have."
good,I enjoyed working there..working on something that makes 50000 horse power was a thrill for me.working on tier 4 new engines was hard at first..you had to put tool on top of power assembly to stretch the bolts out so you came remove the nuts .
good,enjoyed working with the people there and the benefits.  Free coffee was a nice touch.  My coworkers took turns bringing breakfast snacks and worked very well together. Having recently merged with another railroad did present challenges in dealing with different IT groups.
good,this line of work was very different than anything I had done before which was a nice change of pace.  This job is perfect for those that like to travel and don't have a family.
good,"It's not the railroad it us to be, but its still a job. The benefits are not that good anymore. Not must opportunity for overtime. But the pay is ok and you are guarantee 40 hours a week."
good,"The hours are a very unforgiving at times, but the pay off is very rewarding. The benefits The hardest part of the job is being away from your family. The work isn't hard at all."
good,"The current upper management is retiring, and all of the employees that have been there for forty or more years are retiring now, which is a change in new blood coming in with a different outlook. The roster has almost thirty jobs posted every two weeks in my territory, and nobody wants the job, or they have been fired or left entirely. "
good,I enjoyed working for Norfolk Southern. Overall the Management team was excellent. Worked hard made decent money and began my railroad career there. i would return to this job if it were open.
good,"This organization is one of very few that will allow you to grow, advance and retire from there. The compensation and benefits package is unlike most organizations."
good,"- slow paced"
good,good place to work if you don't mind working off hours. not terribly hard work just work very safely the only thing that bothered me was the no weekends
good,"You are well compensated, however, it is difficult to balance family life and work life with the hours required on the railroad. Local upper management is strong."
good,"Everything is on an ""estimated"" basis. Trains times aren't accurate so you have to be ready for anything at anytime. It allows you to utilize your brain capacity and its strengths."
good,"Stressful work place with the union in control. Worker are protected by the union and 90 percent of the time they get their way. A kinder, gentle work place."
good,"Overall, a great way to provide for your family.  As long as you do not stay available, you are getting paid.  It is just impossible for a single mom to be on call 24/7.  Great for someone who has a strong support system at home."
good,"Duties included, but not limited to:  Safe operation and handling of the train governed by Federal Railroad Administrations.  Moved cars, freight, maintained breaks on each car, threw switches for navigation purposes, constant communications with dispatch, exhibit innovative in problem solving for mechanical and technical situations on a daily basis."
good,"print out paperwork. then when called to go to train, we would. then take train from fort wayne to another city. hardest part of the job was not having much time at home and missing a lot of family events while out of town"
good,"Pros:"
good,Norfolk Southern is very structured environment. They offer great benefits and have room for growth.
good,Hard work is rewarded.  Lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"The railroad environment is very dangerous, you have to put safety first. The lifestyle that comes with the job can be challenging at times. Overall it was fun and I always expected something new."
good,"Responsible for operating controls in order to activate traffic signals and track switches."
good,"a typical day at work would be getting my train list and then communicating with coworkers/yardmaster about to days work. then getting my train together, servicing customers or taking a train across states or out of town jobs.learned how to do all types of transportation work. didnt mind the management to much for the most part cause they leave you alone and your pretty much in charge of getting your work done."
good,Great place to work. Good benefits and checks are always in the bank.
good,"nice place to work, good people and good pay.. worked there 15 years and they get rid of me due to my eye being 20/60 (right eye)"
good,I found that working for this company overall has been a good experience. I think most of their problems arises from having bad management. My co workers treated me as if i were a family member. I've met a lot of good people on the job. It is nice there are different types of jobs to bid on. The hardest part was the long hours on the Gangs and long trips to and from work. It was nice benefits wise the company takes pretty good care of their employees.
good,"Great job for single guy or girl with no family or someone that expects your presence. Fantastic wages , easy work but a lot of rules all of which are impossible to remember.  I really enjoyed the job for 4 years  but couldn't handle the lack of a personal life ."
good,Working at Norfolk Southern  is very demanding and time-consuming. There is no set schedule when it comes to responding to emergencies and dealing with day-to-day safety operations. The compensation is good
good,Norfolk Southern is a good place to work if you can put up with the demanding work schedule. Pay is great and once you make your way up to engineer the perks make up for hardships.
good,It od a railroad company with a future and aplan to stay competative with the other railroads. With modern plans for safety and travel pn the rails and fuel econoy
good,Good company culture and a nice work environment.  Work/Life balance depends on department.  Good compensation and decent benefits; healthcare options could be better.
good,Norfolk Southern is a great company to work for.  They offer great benefits and great pay.  The down side is that the managers and train masters job is to catch you doing something wrong so they can fire you.  overall a good job if you don't mind being watched at anytime.
good,"In a typical day a yardmaster would inform me via phone or radio my instructions. The workplace is stressful at times but its definitely the last best job for ""Americas's Dummies"""
good,I am a union employee and this company offers great benefits. The pay is pretty good however there will be many deductions every pay period. The company is a great place to work depending on the department.
good,"The company itself is well run and very organized and they provide great benefits, however you pay for those high salaries and benefits with the lack of home life."
good,"Working at Norfolk Southern will require a great deal of your personal time, often you'll find yourself working late and with unconventional off days. That along with the requirement to relocate for most promotions makes it hard to establish a life away from work. However, they pay very well and railroad retirement might be the best retirement plan there is (if you make it through 30 years on the railroad)."
good,"working for NS is interesting because you meet people from a lot of different backgrounds and over time these people become like family, also mostly everyone tries to help each other out to get the job done safely and efficiently."
good,Great place to work but I need full time employyment and as a conductor you’re not considered to be full a full time employee. However it just hasn’t worked out for me
good,Earnings and benefits are excellent.  Good number of paid holidays.  Upper Management doesn't really care about front line employees.  They care about their bonuses and the bottom line.
good,Conscious of safety and efficient production I. Traditional hours with overtime. Relaxed atmosphere but production important. Safety a  Good benefits.
good,Coworkers are always willing to help along in the training process and the work is rewarding. Nothing like moving something 100 times your size to make you feel accomplished
good,Ok company to work for overall but advancement can be a bit tough depending upon management. Paid sick time off and an excellent vacation policy. Compensation compared to other industries is lacking.
good,Good job for anyone with only high school education. This job is seniority based and requires you to be available to work shift work. Operates twenty four hours a day.
good,"NS has been a great place to work and I'm very thankful for it. However, upper management is so far out of touch with the workers I dont think they really know what's best for us.  And let's be honest, this is a huge company, who really knows how to run something this big correctly? The benefits are good, pay is great and always on time."
good,I would never degrade the corporation that I am currently employed by. I am very appreciative for the opportunities I have been afforded by the Corporation.
good,"Great culture at Norfolk Southern. working with locomotive engineers and other crew members to coordinate the movement and delivery of freight and consumer goods was the daily task. These tasks and duties were very rewarding, I felt like I contributed well, I could see the results of my work. I have no negatives about Norfolk Southern except that I was laid off due to lack of work which is sadly a fear with any industry or company."
good,Careers with Norfolk Southern are demanding with an ever changing and unpredictable schedule.  Benefits are worth the hardships related to the job.
good,"Upon starting my day I would log on to a main frame computer and download/print work orders and pertinent information about my job, since starting with Norfolk Southern I have learned the safe operations of the railroad industry and the language of the control signals that navigate trains across the system. The management team is willing to help in any situation but will also reprimand when needed. In the short time I've been with NS I've formed a great working relationship with my co-workers based on trust and working skills.The most difficult part of this job is the varying hours and switchable shifts. the best part of my job with NS is working closely with all the other co-workers as a team, what others do affects me and what I do affects others, I have learned to pay very close attention to proper instruction from supervisors and co-workers alike as not doing so could lead to having a collision of trains and or locomotives."
good,Very fast paced work place with unpredictable work schedule. Pay and benefits are above average for the area. Work force is mostly union and skilled.
good,"As the 2nd shift senior electrician my responsibility's included keeping the facility electrically  running during operations, minimize down time effectively using any planned shutdown time to perform preventive maintenance and proper repairs to all the dock equipment and conveyors. 2nd shift senior electrician is tasked with coordinating the other electricians on the shift with electrical projects and prioritizing electrical needs on the dock. Also i am responsible for director reporting on down time and maintenance to my managers."
good,"It is a way of life, best life for a single person. Good job to start when you are young starting out. If you stick with it for thirty years you can make a great living."
good,"Things you must be willing to do succeed as CO @ ns - accept that you will not be able to make plans, accept that you will miss holidays and Family events, accept that unless you hired @ 18 years you will never hold the good day light jobs , ever . Accept even if you scheduled the day off   you may be stuck in another City and not get it . Accept that you are just a # . "
good,"Great place to work, for travel, job security and great benefits.  You will travel a lot and spend a lot of time away from home."
good,"Norfolk Southern is a great company to work for, with the great pay and benefits. The Co-workers are also fun to work with. The job is done outside in any weather."
good,"No day is ever typical always changes each day that you work, I learned to be patient and be willing to learn things, management usually are reasonable, most co-workers are helpful when needed, hardest part of my job is being away from home, the enjoyable part of my job is running a locomotive and the challenge."
good,Norfolk Southern is a wonderful place to work at where company values are put into practice down to every line of code that is produced.
good,"Was pleased with the training and the work atmosphere.  Was told there was no chance of furlough and there hasn't been any lay-offs in 30 years.  I was 5 years away from full retirement at my previous career and left a secure job to better myself going off what the recruiter had told me.  Almost received my full conductor certifications with this company, when the company furloughed me."
good,Norfolk Southern is is a place with vast opportunities and an extremely stable work environment for those interested in working for a transportation company.
good,"Got dirty and loved it.  Co-workers were the best, lazy but the best.  Management was cool, they allowed us to do our job.  Hardest part was making the decision to move on.  Most enjoyable was the laughs we shared."
good,"Good job security and compensation/benefits. The company is undergoing a culture change that is needed, but the change will likely by slow to take affect. I enjoyed my employment and would recommend this company"
good,Norfolk Southern offers great benefits and compensation and the work itself you will do on the track is tons of fun.  Long hours will be a must but is well worth it.  the only problem that exists with this job is that you're constantly traveling and have no home life and its nearly impossible to get a position working close to home unless you've worked there 20+ years.  I had some really great supervision and some really bad bosses as well.  I'm a Christian and don't appreciate supervision cursing everyone and being disrespectful.  Some supervision is so unprofessional in regards to that.
good,"I started with Norfolk Southern in 2010.  I went to McDonough GA for the training and passed all of their tests.  I never have been more excited in my life.  I had just watched my first son being born and was expecting another one.  I was a trainee for 5 months until graduation.  I made excellent money and never had to worry about anything.  For some reason, the trainmaster hired over 20 new employees. . . work started to slow down, and started to affect my bills being paid.  I requested a transfer to Manassas VA (Piedmont Div) and was extremely excited for a new beginning in my hometown.  I spend $2500 of my own money to move my family.  Once I was settled in, I found out that Payroll had made a mistake, and I did not receive a paycheck for a month.  Countless conversations with my trainmaster and payroll ensued, but there was no solution.  I lost EVERYTHING I owned. . . . my vehicle, my house, tv, furniture, etc and was forced to take what little money I had and live in a hotel for a couple of weeks.  I didn't get an apology from NS or even an offer to pay me the money that WAS OWED upfront.  After receiving my eviction notice, I felt helpless. . . .with nowhere to go.  I applied back to this company and they had the audacity to not even consider me back after THEY screwed up.  I was proud to work for NS UNTIL they made a mistake without acknowledging it or making it right."
good,This is a great company with great benefits and retirement.
good,The people ive had the honor to work with are what made me fall in love with the job. everyone there is kind and is willing to help you learn and grow as atrain conductor.
good,I've said everything  I could think of in the scant time that I spent there. I wish things was different. I really wish NS handle that racial mess better than how they handle it. At least they did got rid of that low down senior general Foreman. But they didn't call me back. I even finance a brand new car of the same year to make sure I had reliable source of transportation. To eliminate all doubt of being late and or not able to get to work.
good,"There appears to be too many layers with no real power to make changes or improvements.  Change happens very slowly at the railroad until it comes down from above, once something is decided it is implemented quickly without due dilligence to determine potential pitfalls"
good,"The job was one of the best I have ever had. The work was fun yet dirty. I had to learn how to drive something that was 400,000 lbs. That my friend is awesome. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a very people who just hate everybody. You have those everywhere. Management did what they could do to keep everyone they could. I really enjoyed what they did for me over the last 4 years and I'm grateful for the knowledge I now have of the railroad industry."
good,"you only get training pay until you mark up, Management will hide in bushes and take other means to watch and find reasons to fire you, on the other hand as long as you show the will to learn others will train you to the best of their ability and help you however they can, don't be cocky or act like you know everything. once out of training status you can make a  lot of money, all this is provided based on if you can pass the 3 week training course. its info for it to only be 3 weeks or training but its completely passable if you put in the effort to learn"
good,nice if u want to work and not have time off.  but there is little career advancement once u become a seasoned railroader.  Must start out young and not know much.  The don't wanna pay for experience.
good,"Its a good job, know your rules, if you have a question ask, do not assume you know the answer.  It is a hard job, long hours, outside in the elements, cannot plan anything, on call 24/7/365.  Good benefits, and pay, but you will work for your money."
good,"Good paying job. Lots of bosses, training good. Wished they had explained more, more experience would have been benifical. Good job overall besides drama"
good,As an intern I was given the opportunity to work along side of network engineers not just watching but doing the work.  They treat you like a real employee never have you running around getting coffee and drinks. There was no one looking over your shoulder to see what you were doing. The department that I worked in was great I enjoyed coming into work everyday. The hardest part was leaving at the end of my internship.
good,Work was non stop and would keep you moving at all times. Would of liked a little more backing from upper management and more chances to advance.The safety culture was great and demanded your attention every moment. Would like to get back to Norfolk down in the southern regions and move up and learn more.
good,"Productive and groeth oriented place to work."
good,"Norfolk Southern overall is a great company. There are plenty of growth opportunities if you are willing to move around different jobs. The workplace culture is currently changing. In some ways for the better, and others for the worst."
good,"Few days are ""typical"" - when they are, one must be grateful. This can be a very rewarding job, but it also takes its toll - in many, many ways. Safety is paramount...injuries and fatalities can be part of this job, depending on the position."
good,"The money is great, you can make up to $4000 bi-weekly bring home pay. To many rules. That can get you fired. Supervisors hide in woods trying to catch people breaking rules"
good,Everyday is challenging which enables an individual to get a different view of operations per craft. The Mgmt. team are very helpful in reaching daily work goals.  The work culture is about obtaining daily work goals.  The hardest part of the job is; the morning drive in and the most enjoyable is the drive home
good,"Management sometimes are puppets, young , and want to advance so they will do anything.  Its a union company so the salary and benefits are excellent. Easy to get caught up things that will get you fired."
good,"Report for duties checking all bulletins and having job briefings preparing for your day, making contact with the yard master/ train master in charge, great place to work, hardest part are the hours being away from your family and the most enjoyable part is learning how to operate and run trains moving freight."
good,"Felt pretty secure."
good,"great people to work with"
good,"On a daily basis the conductor is building trains and walking several miles inspecting the cars and loads. hours were based on an ""on call"" status, 24 hours a hour, 7 days per week. I was well educated in several aspects of the railroad and coal mining industry as well as dealing with contracted customers and handling all necessary paperwork. Safety was well enforced with many rules. All co-workers made sure they're partners were informed of the work needing performed and made sure they're safety came first. The most difficult task to perform was just being on call 24hours a day. Every day was enjoyable. There is always new things to learn and a new task to get through."
good,Long days and long nights. The pay is good but the management sucks. You will meet a lot of good people. The hardest about the job is stay focus while you are tired.
good,"The Medical Department (Occupational Health) was a major component of the Human Resources employment process. There are over 30,000 employees, and thousands of applicants. This was one of the busiest departments (in my opinion) in the entire corporation. "
good,"Work as a machinist in a locomotive overhaul shop. Right now I am in the CNC machine shop on 2nd shift, working by myself. I machine locomotive parts and component parts I support of the overhauls and running repairs. I do my own programming and set-ups and also operate. I also so do manual machining for one peace parts or alterations that the diesel shop may need for the evening. Overall, Norfolk Southern is a great career choice. The only downfall is that it is jobs a seniority bases and it usually takes several years to get a comfortable shift assignment."
good,"Fun and Productive easy to get along with co-workers"
good,Good training program and good support from management. There are some that still stick to the separation of management from employees but it is improving with the introduction of new age management. Hardest part of job is it has some long hours that can get into the 20 hour work day and there is no room for family time usually.
good,"Hard to find a better career for this area. "
good,"A great job but very demanding. If you like to travel and career progression, the management program is the ideal place to start. The pay and benefits for the management team are the best."
good,"It was a good place to work. I learned all aspects of working on locomotives and diesel engines. management in the office did not always see eye to eye with the workers if something broke it was most time blamed on the workers or if a locomotive came off track it was the operators fault, but usually the boss on the floor was more helpful and understanding. some days you would be assigned jobs and you did not always have the parts to complete the work. the people that you worked directly with and the satisfaction of completing the job that was assigned to you"
good,Ensure the safe work environment for my employees. While still meet production levels. This is what makes the job so much fun. The fact that we can all work safely and still complete the task at hand.
good,"As a conductor you have to work outside in all weather conditions, for example: rain, snow, high and low temperatures, etc."
good,"As an intern, my supervisor had an overall attitude that he didn't care to have an intern. Wasn't willing to give me work or feedback on the work that i did. I had to beg other managers in my team and from other teams to include me on projects or teach me new skills. The work i did was meaningful to my area of study and the overall work environment was good.  However, other supervisors were very attentive to their interns, so it just depends who you get."
good,"I rated this company at a 4 overall. i was able to work my way through the ranks, starting as a conductor. I moved 4 times in 3 years. Took advantage of the learning opportunities..."
good,"First of all they will tell you that ""you are married to the railroad."" If you don't mind traveling and being away from family this is a great place to work.  Benefits, compensation, retirement and advancement are great!"
good,"A great place to work that has some of the best benefits you will find out of any company, anywhere. The culture is fairly inviting with some ""railroad culture"" still ingrained. Opportunity for advancement is available while a dedication to the job is most definitely required to fulfill some of the hefty responsibilities involved."
good,"Strong brotherhood of committed men and women. Rewarded for working a very difficult on call schedule, all weather conditions and times of the night. Enjoyed the culture and service."
good,Great company to work for. Good pay and retirement package offered. Chance to travel and see the country. Plenty of opportunities to advance and grow within the company.
good,"great people,  great environment, great staff, tremendous learning experience. Easy to work with and knowledgeable folks that make you feel right at home."
good,"Overall, I had positive experiences at Norfolk Southern. I did not want to work there full-time because I want more experience than just rail design. However, they compensated me fairly and their benefits can't be beaten."
good,I have have the best bosses i have worked for here and the worst ones I have ever worked for. Overall the company is a great place to advance if you put in the work.
good,Culture centered around productivity and Safety in tight deadlines. Daily activities include dealing with many different people in an ever changing environments. A keen eye and attention to detail with strong work ethic is necessary to be successful at this company.
good,"I was sent out of state for my training , which involved many different aspects from, learning all the different parts of a train and its systems. , I was also certified as a welder and enjoyed the work I did there for the company."
good,"Great job. I got to travel, see, & learn a lot. I definitely feel like railroading was My niche in life. I was young when I started working with Norfolk Southern so, I got to experience a lot of those things early as a Man. I loved working there & I'm currently trying to get back into the rail life."
good,"Your co workers really make the job a lot better than it should be. The pay was great, the hours were horrible. That meant more money in the end. The Management could have been better, but they had the good with the bad."
good,"build train, paper work, knowing track signals,knowing other yards in illinois, working with different people every two days,working with government agents"
good,Great place to work with endless opportunities to advance in new fields within company.  Have to get used to working different shifts with possibility of no weekends off
good,"A regular day at Norfolk Southern would be to print out paperwork and call the right department for that trip of the day, And make sure everyone in my crew was notified and on the same page, so we could be safe!"
good,Responsible for following all rail rules and notating all stops. Also working in train yard coupling and uncoupling cars. Worked Rotating Schedule. Enjoyed traveling to different places.
good,"I worked for Norfolk Southern Corporation as a summer engineering intern. As mentioned in the header, the work was challenging, but overcoming such challenges makes for a rewarding job experience. The tasks given were not the source of difficulty, but the amount of travel required for the position. It was hard to find a place to live, and I worked in up to 5 different states during my time as an intern. If you are someone who enjoys traveling for work, then this job is ideal. The work I completed was interesting, and each day presented new problems to solve and equipment to be inspected. However, if you are a sociable person you will likely not enjoy this position. All of the travel required makes for a lonely experience, but if you are a fellow introvert this may be a positive element."
good,"If you have a family this is a very difficult job as it requires alot of time outside working hours. You are staying late almost daily, always on your phone (emails calls), work all hours and days. Dont get holidays off nor compensated for it. You relocate several times your first year."
good,Typical day for me  is being organized . Make sure the I look at the goal for the company and make sure that I break the team down so that my team will meet that goal set by the company. I will give great brief so that all team member know what each member suppose to do. I will also stress the important safety. The hardest part about my job for railroad is just getting time to complete your tasks being that our have to move trains to make the money. But when we do get time I stress to my team that we have to make every second count. I enjoy make building a team that enjoy work with their co worker.
good,"Good company with good benefits.  As a company officer in operations, you will be required to move frequently.  NS currently operates in twenty two states."
good,"My typical day would be to arrive at 7AM, work on project plans, attend meetings as required, take a mandatory hour lunch break, and continue with my job duties."
good,"It's a great company to work for if you're looking for long-term employment, as exhibited by many of the employees with 30+ years of experience. It's a stable industry with good benefits."
good,While the pay and benefits are great you miss out on just about every family even due to working 2nd or 3rd shift without weekends off. There's a bunch a bad mouthing about employees between supervisors as well.
good,"A typical day at work was laid back and so was management as well as my co workers. The hardest part of the job was remembering signals, territory, as well as the rules and what to do and what not to do. I learned a lot about railroading and being in charge and operating a freight train. I learned how to read signals and distinguish the colors of the signals, i also learned what the signals meant and what is needed to be done in reference to the signal. There is so much more to explain that i learned but i must say it was a exceptional experience. My training was interrupted due to a family emergency of my mother passing on. I was off work during my training for 2 1/2 weeks and i feel that corrupted my training. I lost my job due to this."
good,"I learned a lot here. Not just work related. I  did have hands on learning with excel and the accounting systems. I also learned the value of job culture within a firm. I would work here again. I would come in and be assigned a task then elicit the help of my coworkers if needed. The management made me feel at ease. That this was a learning environment. The hardest part was the security system. If I lost my badge, it was a pain not having access to my work area. The most enjoyable part was all that I was able to learn and take away from this experience."
good,"The job is delicate and the people are mostly good. There is plenty of job spots and being new they throw you around. It also gives you the 24/7 on call position until you gain ground in experience. Management is not really on point sometimes, but being a large corporation, interpretation of the rules sometimes differ."
good,"Definitely a hard company to work for, but this isn't a bad thing. It is a job that will teach you discipline, commitment, endurance, and will be teaching you everything you need to know about a corporate lifestyle. "
good,Fast paced learning environment where much work is done in a touch  and go manner. Co-workers are respectful and easy to work with. Projects tasks are well structured and defined.
good,"Attend requirements meetings, review requirements, kick off meetings, create test cases."
good,The job provided great insight into the railroad industry.
good,"Good for internships. Lots to learn especially in the field of Mathematics, Computer Science and industrial engineering."
good,Insure a safe working process is adhered to with the sense of urgency to efficiently complete tasks with providing reliable equipment and running trains on time.
good,It's a good job. Currently in a shift up in their employment tiers to try to improve its business. I would recommend working for the railroad to anyone.
good,your job is day to day of uncertainty. you cant count to go to work every day you must take it day by day. it is a seniority based job. you have to go where the work is
good,Good place to work.  Hours shifts and days off change can be hard on a family at times.  Sometimes outside and away from home for short to long times.
good,I enjoyed the rigors of being in the elements throughout all seasons. I enjoyed the people that I would work with on a day to day basis which help strengthen my skills with the company.
good,"In my current position, a typical day involves data entry, reporting, filing, answering phones and expense reports.  I have learned many job skills throughout my career, most importantly multitasking and adapting to change.  The most enjoyable part of my job at Norfolk Southern is the great team of people I work for and with."
good,"I learned how to effectively meet goals, operate machinery, and work as a team. The management was very involved with their employees and showered care towards all."
good,Safety and Quality works are the most focus for the shop.  They will take your suggestions and idea and try to work with employees to improve the shop conditions and work environment.
good,Transport all freight to destination in a timely manner without any mechanical technical or otherwise issues. Train and develop other conductors and engineers.
good,"A typical day here was very productive, I've learned how to change brakes, slack adjusters, chambers and more. Management was courteous.  I believe the hardest part of the job was that no hanger was provided so being outside in certain times of the season became a challenge when it came to snow and ice but the overall experience was good."
good,"It was a very demanding job. Nothing for the new generation to deal with. They won't work that hard."
good,Old school corporation but with a forward leaning view toward technology. Strong job security. Good midtown location. Well managed company at middle and upper levels.
good,"Norfolk Southern Railroad Company is a great company to work for, if you are flexible. Any number of the entry level positions could require you to work any shift on any day. My experience was with the Operations Service Support department. This section of the company works based on seniority. That being said, you may likely start on an overnight shift and stay on that shift for several years into working with the company. Jobs with preferred shifts are bid upon, and your seniority determines whether or not you get the shift you desire. YOU MUST BE FLEXIBLE with this process because this part of the job makes your shift, not your job, lack the security and consistency many desire from a work experience. This is likely the only major pitfall in working with the company. Upward advancement is encouraged and available for employees at all levels. The security of the job is a great positive in these uncertain economic times. The compensation is highly competitive. Last, the benefits are solid. I would highly recommend the company."
good,"Typical 8 hour workdays, plenty of chances to advance within the company, good health benefits, paid time off, company provides all necessary clothing and safety is a priority."
good,show up to work have safety meeting discuss tasks for the day and everyone leaves to go to jobsite job brief again do work that is  required to get the job done in a safe efficient manner. learned a lot about rr and how it runs management seems to get better in the beginning I worked for a lot of new college graduates (didn't know much) hardest part of the job is some people on a day to day bases think you should know what they know even if you have not worked in that area and the hurry up and wait. Overall everyone is enjoyable to work with from new hires to management.
good,"going along the east coast states spraying and repairing the tracks and keeping the right of way clean for trains to pass through , spraying pesticides and herbicides , hazmat training"
good,"Process invoices for payment in SAP"
good,The workflow throughout the day at Norfolk Southern maximized productivity but still allowed employee freedom. My first (ROWE) environment was amazing
good,"Norfolk Southern is a great company to work for. It is family oriented has a lot positions, and chance for advancement is great. Hours and days of work is outstanding to allow for a personal life outside of work."
good,"Norfolk is a great place to work. I really enjoyed working with this company. It was a excellent work experience. If I were in GA, I would definitely still be with this company."
good,"hours are great, work environment is often loud and demanding. Lots of  suck ups. Frequent lay-offs. Strict on attendance and safety"
good,I completed all my tasks clearly. I could improved technical skills and met nice colleagues to work with. I worked on sprint iteration environment with daily standup meeting and weekly knowledge transfer. The company has stable managerial hierarchy.
good,"The railroad is a great company to work for, great benefits, great pay, great co workers, and management. The only down side to the railroad is the schedule, there isn't one. I am on call 24/7 365 days a year."
good,"As a transportation intern:"
good,"Every morning started out with a detailed job briefing, we were assigned various duties for the day, collected and moved material all over as needed, completed our job as safely and quickly as we could with a team effort. I learned endless proper ways of how to fix track, maintain proper track and what to look for before a problem occurs. I learned how to work as a team. The best part of the job was being outside and doing something different everyday, there was always something new to learn. The hardest part of the job was working with all men and having to use my physical abilities everyday."
good,"Definitely a good, solid company that knows how to take care of their employees. Has a few quirks like any company does, but the positives outweigh the negatives. Not for all, but it was a terrific learning experience for me! I enjoyed working there."
good,"Norfolk Southern provides a very stable environment, opportunity for advancement, and benefits. You have an opportunity to travel and work with great people. Norfolk Southern is a great company."
good,"I was the senior Engineer at the time of my retirement.  I worked at a place called "" Motor Yard"" in Macedonia, Ohio.  It was about 25 miles south of Cleveland, Ohio.  My job satred at 7:00am and we usually switched firms on  the Mainline of the railroad between Cleveland, Ohio and Hudson, Ohio.  A distance of 30 miles.  "

good,i learned how to drive a yard truck and alot about computers semi trailers trains i love working with the employees and people
good,Great pay scale and benefits.  Promotes within.  Down fall job comes before family.
good,"When working through freight, I am on call, getting 90 minutes to be at work. Reading work bulletins daily for changes, receive train dispatchers orders along with train information. Work with a conductor, taking train from point A to point B. I have learned that we can work unsupervised while completing all work to be done. Always working with a different conductor. Supervisors may or may not be around while you perform you duties. The hardest part of the job was always being on call. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I gave my best in all my different tasks. I am injury free in my career."

good,"run a machine 10 hours plus everyday"
good,I enjoy my job. I have great management staff who willingly assist me with learning the job. The hardest part about my job is being away from my family.
good,"Norfolk Southern is a great place to work. If being away from home all the time sounds bad to you, this place isn't for you."
good,"good place to work."
good,I loved the company and their credo but I did not like the way some of the middle management employees addressed their subbordinants. Great pay. Great location. Bad middle management.
good,"As a track laborer for norfolk southern I quickly learned how fast paced it really was. I became better at the work, heat, and pressure of the job every day. Would definatly love an opportunity to work in this field again."
good,"There are times where management instructs workers to do less than satisfactory work in or let things go that should be repaired.  Quality control among management personnel is a problem that should be addressed.  Aside from that, work environment and employees are great.  Good work experience and culture with the railroad."
good,The employees were extremely helpful in mentoring the interns. The pay was great for an intern salary. I was pushed to learn new technologies and given the room to put it to use. There was no micro-managing great environment.
good,This was a very fast paced job. Work and home life balance was very difficult. I would still be there but had to relocated for family. Enjoyed my co workers
good,"A typical day at Norfolk Southern was very productive and fast paced.  I enjoyed working with the new employees, making sure their paperwork was in order and explaining their role.  The hardest part of my position was seeing the young people resign or terminated.  The most enjoyable/rewarding time was knowing I was doing my best in this position."
good,"Great company.  Loved the job, the people, the benefits, even the communt.  They moved operations to another state and lost a good portion of their employees in the process."
good,Great company to work for just paid at the low end of the pay scale
good,"Great Management, many key skills were gained in the area of managing people and resources"

good,Great place to work with super benifits. f you like travel you will love it.I
good,Good company to work for with railroad retirement and good benefits. I enjoyed my experience here and I feel that I learned a lot and grew my abilities and leadership skills as a result.
good,"Being a Locomotive Engineer was a job that I took much Pride in. It was a very challenging and rewarding career."
good,"One of the hardest parts about the job was trying to track time from the train dispatcher. C&S (Communication & Signals) wanted to run their trains and MW&S (Maintenance of Way & Structures) where I was assigned, needed to do work on the tracks. It was a hassle some times, we would sit in our truck waiting to get track time."
good,"The people are amazing, they made each day worth it.  My only complaint was that you did not need an Electrical Engineering degree to do the job.  The pay and benefits are very good too."
good,"I worked here for about 2 years and really enjoyed the work, would have stayed but life outside of work got in the way. It is one job that you can get hurt real quick if you are not paying attention to your surroundings"
good,"Norfolk Southern can be a bit disorganized, but the company culture is very relaxed. People are very interpersonal and it is nice that they let you complete projects on your own time."
good,Good place to work overall. Excellent pay & benefits. Tense deadlines in the Accounting department though. Great retirement benefits as well. Closed Roanoke office-only reason I left.
good,"Did something new every day, but management made sure I understood everything that was happening. A lot of traveling. Great work environment. Worked in every condition rain or shine"
good,"The company was frustrating at times but they understood the work-life balance that we all look for. They were not the best in regards to pay, behind industry standards on most accounts. However, the job security and time off did make things worth while. I'd be happy to go back anyday."
good,"By working at Perry Rubber first; it trained me to ready to do a good job and be ready to re-act fast in a time of emergency. It taught me to take my time and learn the job, right. And working so many different job, meant I worked with so many different people. Because I knew the job well, all the people I worked with, were comfortable working with me. Tried to make the job fun. I did such a good job; that my boss would have me do the jobs that needed done fast and right. Use to think he was always picking on  Me."
good,* Assigned to build blocks of train cars per customer pick up.
good,"Really enjoyed working for this company , alot of times wished I wouldnt of left ,but needed to get my Retirement time in with the Department Of Corrections.GReat job miss it alot. Would go back if I had the chance."
good,Norfolk Southern Corp is a great company for people with
good,"Due to the nature of the job, you have to be on call during nights and on weekends, practically 24/7. Was not the lifestyle for me...................."
good,"I love my job but I am unwilling to relocate to Atlanta. I the company wasn't moving, I would stay in this job. I work independently and my work does not need to be second guessed."
good,I was an intern in the strategic planning department. People are nice here. The atmosphere here is quite technical. Maybe it is because most of the staffs here are Phds... You will learn a lot from the project-based work.
good,There are nice employees there always work that needs to be done. Very Rapid Pace to keep up with alot to learn in such little time frame.
good,"Norfolk Southern is a wonderful place to work at where company values are put into practice down to every line of code that is produced."
good,I feel NS is overly crowded with upper level management. It is a very fast paced and unpredictable place to work. You can work a regular 8 hours on Monday and work 20 hours on Tuesday.
good,"No work life balance depending on position"
good,"Stressful, fast-paced environment. Not for the weak-hearted or family oriented per se. I loved working here, however. NS does nothing but first-class."
good,I worked for Norfolk Southern for 5 years and I have been through 2 furloughs.  Not a very good workplace for a man with a family who needs job securty.  Insurance and retirement is great.
good,There are areas where improvement is necessary in management. Overtime distribution and contract adherence. Safety issues should be addressed more professionaly and with concern. Training and hourly employee advances locally can be applied by marking up in various crafts.
good,You will not have a life. you will lose your friends and never see your family. you will be compensated well in exchange for this. Really not for most people. Definitely not for middle-aged people who already have a family. I enjoy my work but am almost the only one who does.
good,"Good company,safe,good pay and retirement,excellent transportation corporation,Norfolk Southern is 100% safety orientated company."
good,It is a good paying job with great benefits and great coworkers. I enjoy working here and so does everyone I work with. One of the best companies to work for.
good,"Great company , nice working facility , great benefits, wide culture environment "
good,I've had a wonderful experience with NS. I've learned the ins and outs of the railroad life and will take my experience with me for a life time. Management is sufficient and always helpful. The people I work with are always a joy.
good,"Government intrusion in the form of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is the biggest hinderance to the work here.  Every time the naïve government office workers, with no working experience, enact new rules it costs me 25-30 % of my income.  Good honest hard working folks doing an excellent job are your coworkers."
good,"Wish there wasnt a slow part of the year that causes several lay offs, Long days full of manaul labor and the winters can be quite cold if on the ground. Dirty yard usaully leave covered in dirt from head to toe. Can be a dangerous plkace like all rail roadfs if your not paying attention, or there is poor communication between you and the supervisors working that shift."
good,I have enjoyed my time here. Excellent job. The biggest downfall to dealing with the railroad is sometimes the travel can become excessive and run you all over several states. The pay is top notch and so are the co workers.
good,"very good company , very motivated team. The managers are very understanding and technically very competent . I would love to work there if i get the chance."
good,"Started at any hour, ended many more later."
good,The environment is very challenging but at the same time very team oriented.  Everyone works together for the common goal.  Have been blessed to have the opportunity to learn here.
good,Great company. Apply and grow. Management positions are available. Company getting ready to hire conductors and they will train you. Training is paid. Great benefits. Good retirement.
good,"NS struggles to stay relevant in it's relation with it's workers union and the current market.  ""Good'ol boy"" culture is on the outs but laziness is on the way in.  Non-competitive workplace makes for lack of ambition.  Job security gained only after more than 3 years of service."
good,"Work days with this company consist of the following: Working in the yard terminal, properly operate hand throw switches, and derails safely, Proper radio communication, Knowledge of NS signals."
good,Great place to work if you are an employee. Contractors are usually around for a long period so very great career choice but the benefit is as an employee
good,"Typical day in management was to oversee operation, coach subordinates, handle personnel matters, review budget requirements,  handle customer matters, "
good,"Transportation service industry in Class I railroads.  Great Fortune 500 company. Headquarters in Norfolk, VA and Atlanta, GA."
good,"Mocked up signal systems and tested prior final field installation."
good,Norfolk Southern is a great company to work for they offer good benefits and they have Lots of room for advancement. I would highly recommend anyone apply for a career with this company.
good,this was the best paying job ive had so far and it wasn't really that hard I was just away from home ALOT. most of the people you work with are nice but you will run into a few that aren't so friendly but how your day goes depends on your attitude and your work ethic
good,Great company with lots of room to grow.  Learned a lot about freight movement in the railroad industry.
good,great job for a single man just never home pay was great..................
good,"Being a crew dispatcher required me to ensure that each train had the correct crew and was ready to roll at the proper time. Whenever a train was assigned, I would call each crew member to work, making sure everyone knew the correct time and place and assignment. The engineers and conductors would call me to change jobs, call out sick or mark back up, and  discuss legal moves and procedures according to their territorial guidelines. This was a very exciting job. I really enjoyed interacting with the crews and trainmasters, but more importantly feeling a sense of accomplishment when everything was on schedule and ran smoothly."
good,"- Enthusiastic, on time and conscientious about goals and responsibilities."
good,This is a great company they uphold the best interest of their employees at all times.
good,"hard work repair nice breaks,good management,nice coworkers heavy work easy days"
good,"Life as a Conductor isn't easy but Its hard to be the pay, benefits of the job. Sometimes stressful when long hours and no sleep meet head on. Your with your co workers more than your home family so there pretty much your family at work. It's a great career choice but I got laid off because of lack of need for conductors."
good,Been there for almost 13 years now. Work in all kinds of weather. Good pay has railroad retirement. I get 3 weeks off and one personal day after 8 years.
good,Being a conductor was very interesting at times it was challenging at other times it was absolutely wonderful. Norfolk Southern Railroad is a great place to work.
good,"For me typical days were very long 14 to 20 hours.  While at Macon the days were typically come in 1 to 2 hours prior to your shift in the tower.  You would perform rules compliance and safety checks then work 8 hours in the tower managing the traffic flow of in and outbound trains.  Good communications skills essential. for this position.  Excellent planning and management skills  are a must.  After tower shift there would be another 2 hours of rules compliance and safety checks.  "
good,"Conductor for railroad, 150 miles 5 to 6 days a week; co-workers were always responsible and helpful. Team players. On the road a few days at a time. Excellent benefits."
good,"The best thing about this company is everyone is almost like a family and helps each other in the time of need. The pay is wonderful, the benefits are great, and also the people you work with. It is a very diverse workplace. The usual day at work can be long and demanding depending on how much traffic is on the rails, in the yard, etc. the hardest part of the job in my opinion was having to stay awake over twelve hours at sometimes 2 or 3 in the morning and the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be that the work on a day to day basis was never the same and I enjoyed that because there was no way I could ever get tired of it."
good,"Most jobs are very demanding, 24/7 and 365 for the most part.  Just because you are not on company property doesn't mean that you'll  not be expected to be working.  Must be in constant contact and available.  Management is good and generally looks out for the staff.  The job can be rewarding and the benefits are good. The engineering department jobs are the perfect single person career that doesn't care to relocate or travel 70-100% of the time."
good,"Inventory, Unloading of trucks and stocking parts. This was a repair shop in Roanoke."
good,Start  with safety meeting. Then go into the workshop to be given a job for the shift. There were easy jobs like computer software upgrades or real dirty jobs like repairing traction motors. Most enjoyable part was watching the locomotive leave after being repaired.
good,"If you love to travel you'll love this job. You get to travel alot, see the inner workings of a train and how the railroad works, and make some really good money!"
good,"Very rarely was there a rush to get the job done. After coming from a Auto manufacturer, it was difficult to get the mindset of not getting things done as quickly. this was mainly pushed by the other employees, not management. Most of this had to do with the Union atmosphere."
good,Great place to work if you do not mind odd shifts. Shift promotion is based on seniority due to Union life. Union dues are reasonable and the job itself is not hard.
good,12 plus hour shifts working in all weather conditions at least 5 days per week including holidays.  Management has absolutely no concern for personal time.  On call 24/7/365
good,"Great place to learn, colleagues and people are well read and pleasant. focus on work is a lot, HR activities are minimum. "
good,"I love working for norfolk southern but i was recently furloughed and stayed on with the company but had to relocate 5 hours away from my family to work,"
good,"Working at Norfolk Southern has been a valuable experience.  They have trained me to be a safe worker and to abide by all rules to protect not just myself but my co-workers.  As I am getting older, I have grandchildren on the way and family is very important to me.  The travel required while working at Norfolk Southern sometimes keeps me out of town more than I am at home.   Looking for a more stable work schedule."
good,"Great company to get into. Benefits are great but management could be better.Tso trains, Inventory , programming ..U name it ,Ive done it all. Co-workers for the most part are ok. Hardest part of the Job is being an extra clerk  not knowing what your hrs are ."
good,"I had a great time working at NS. Everyone that worked there was helpful, nice, and a joy to work with. Management is great and wanted you to succeed and made the work environment a collaborative place. The only drawback is that it is not easy to move up in the company."
good,It is a good job not really steady you can not have a outside life cause it is a 24/7 job and you never know when you will go to work.
good,"you don't have to be furloughed due to corporate restrictions or financial adjustments."
good,"NS is a 24-7 operation demanding work mentally and physically demanding, dangerous place to work if you let you’re guard down that could be the last day you’re alive, besides that ,Ns only wants supervisors that come out college and have no railroad experience, that is not a good thing .W hat ever I do I want everyone to come home to their family safe."
good,Be able to work all days at anytime. The pay is great and the insurance. You will have to give up all holidays and plan on missing a lot of time with family and friends.
good,Great company to work for with great employees. This company has been around from the beginning of the industry and has a lot to offer for those willing to embrace the railroad life. Excellent Supervisor retirement benefits that allow retirement at 55. Expect to move for diverse training and advancement but know that there are benefits worth the lifestyle. Demanding requirements for operations employees as the trains run 24/7/365 rain/sleet/or shine.
good,"A good place to work.  A union shop with many rules to govern daily actions.  A large area with many people to work and interact with, plenty of work to be accomplished, 24/7 operation."
good,Highly Safety oriented Company.Rest days depend on seniority.Have good insurance and benefits.The retirement is the best you can get from a company in these present times
good,"Worry about being laid off, Management difficult at times, great benefits and pay, great insurance, great retirement like no other, room to move up into management/supervision"
good,I loved working at Norfolk southern railyard. It has been one of my favorite jobs. The management out there is great and all the co workers get along and create a good safe work place while putting in a hard days work.
good,Great place to work and great people.  I have been fortunate to be placed in lead positions on numerous projects.  This requires excellent multi-taking skills.  The hardest part of the job is the 24/7 on-call support.  The best part of the job would be the employees and the retirement benefits.
good,just like highschool its amazing  the money is grewat benifits is good  great job for a family man
good,"variety of tasks everyday - made it always unpredictable.  "
good,"Easy to moderate work. At times logistical and have to think outside the box. Definitely need to know your AAR book when it comes to inspecting freight. Management isn't always the best. Most of them are college grads that aren't always ""railroad smart"". Your off days depend on what your seniority can hold. So don't get your hopes up for weekends off anytime soon in the car department. It's only hard if you come unprepared. Be smart and don't overwork yourself. They pay by the hour, not by the job. I enjoyed most of the guys I worked with. The pay and benefits are beyond normal companies. Just do what your told and don't bring your home business to work or everyone will know it. Best part of the job is knowing your work is riding the rails."
good,If you are single with no children!!!  Not able to make plans with family.  Hard on marriages due to being gone all the time.  Training program for this job is wonderful!
good,Always challanging. The hardest working group of people that one will ever deal with.
good,"Get a job and you will work hard, but you will be payed well for it!"
good,"Pending your personal drive, you have the ability to gain much knowledge of the railroad and its practices.  The sky is the limit based on your desire and education.  The environment is not an easy one as the railroad industry is very demanding.  You will need the will and the drive each day to make it a successful one.  You do work all hours of the day, and travel a lot.  The hardest part of the job is working for perfection.  Although no one is perfect, you need to have the attitude that you can be.  Safety and Servicing the Customer go above the rest.  If you cannot work safe, this is not the job for you."
good,A typical day is 8-12 hours. I learned how to operate a locomotive. The hardest part of the job was being on-call and working multiple shifts per week.
good,A typical day was to get in my vehicle and sit in the yard to wait for a call to pick up a train crew and drive them to/from the train they were using.  I also supplied water to the train crew hutch and picked up trash at all buildings.
good,"extremely intense, competitive atmosphere. Management was well organized. Training and adherence to safety and compliance to rules was made the highest priority.  Interaction between management and Hourly employees on a professional level was maintained, producing a better than average working relationship."
good,Sad to leave a job of such good benifits and retirement. It is a full time commitment but a wonderful job and lots of good people and community.  If looking for a career it is among the best
good,"I was here not to long went to Georgia for the classes and past the tests no problem. When i got to the feild i was not a fan of not feeling as important,and sitting a long time on the train also you work hours are not set .but if your patient man that doesn't  mind not working real hard this is a job fir you"
good,"I learned a lot about customer satisfaction.  How to perform my job safely and confidently.  How to be honest, sincere and a loyal person to my job."
good,"Norfolk Southern sells a service that their customers are in need of. We worked daily to assist both groups in achieving those goals. Our group in customer service worked tirelessly to assure that the needs were met and that the correct billing was associated with each action. This is a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week operation. "
good,Its a great job to have a typical day is going to the yard off then off to a mine to load a train or pick up coal cars. 
good,No breakman i feel ns is selling out to another company . They dont care about their employees. My future is not bright at a company i gave 17 years of my life to
good,Great experience great pay great Benifits  just got furloughed enjoyed going to work everyday safe environment great equipment good management great people
good,"Great company, great job, but not so great work/life balance. You have to be on the train & away from home for long periods of time. They do take care of their people though."
good,Good to work. Overall a good project.need to improve.being a tester there was great scope to learn new things.I hope this project grows and we can learn more .
good,"safety is #1 priority, co-workers are the absolute thing that makes Norfolk Southern fun to work at. there was little to no advancement at Norfolk Southern unless you wanted to start from the bottom of seniority again."
good,"I miss it really wish I could go back. You can make all the money you want, all you have to do is answer the phone and go to work. Money money money they will give you."
good,when i started working at norfolk southern I started learning right away. my job was to work on and fix locomotives which could have been anywhere from changing a fuse to complete over haul.
good,"Working at Norfolk Southern is a great learning experience. You're able to obtain lots of information in a short period of time, and if you're feeling overwhelmed you're fellow employees will jump right in to assist you."
good,"Days at Norfolk Southern were hectic and fast-paced; trains had to be kept on time and ran in the most efficient ways possible.  There was a high stress level as people's lives were on the 'line' while I worked and supervised my territory; yet, still, I enjoyed working for this employer and learned quite a bit about the railroad industry."
good,"They say that if you love the job you do,that you never really work at it..I truly loved working on the R.R.. Everyday was a unique challenge of,equipment situations,personnel challenges, weather conditions, and of course the anxiety that goes with handling 100's of tons of materials across the railway.

good,"Mentally/physically challenged/occupied from the beginning to the end of each tour of duty. You must learn patience and flexibility in such a dynamic environment. When you leave the crew room there is almost nonstop movement around you until the end of your tour. Be aware not only for yourself but for the safety of others and the equipment around you. Make decisions based on training & experience not impulse & haste. "
good,"Signal construction crews are responsible for overall construction of railroad signal locations and road crossings. Signal Foreman responsibilities include employee payroll, material ordering, construction timelines and completions times. Ensuring the completion of the job while remaining on time and budget is the most important task of the foreman. I enjoy a challenge, and the most enjoyable part of the job is overcoming the challenges and seeing the job completed."
good,this was the best paying job ive had so far and it wasn't really that hard I was just away from home ALOT. most of the people you work with are nice but you will run into a few that aren't so friendly but how your day goes depends on your attitude and your work ethic. very will managed company and they pay great.

good,"The company is a good company to work for with excellent benefits. The people are hard to deal with sometimes, but its just due to the culture of the people that have worked there for 30+ years and don't take to newcomers very quickly."
good,"Norfolk Southern was my employer for 32 years. I began as a trainman and advanced to conductor within 2 years. I worked  on freight  trains and was responsible for the safety of the  crew and the efficient movement of the cars and engines assigned to me on that trip. The most difficult aspect of the job was that all road men on the railroad work ""on call'. I was to be rested and ready to take a call of availability at a 90 minute notice.  This presented a hardship on my family, as the railroad worked 7 days a week."
good,"building a train to take it to other locations. I learned how to do track warrants which ensures everyone that there are no movement on the thack but one train at a time. The hardest part of the job is school, which wasnt so bad. I enjoyed working with the engineers and yard foreman."
good,Somedays can be easy and some can be hard.  Just depends on where you work and who you work for.  I personally have a lot of good days at Norfolk Southern.  They tend to hire management straight from college and no work experience.  It has caused a lot of stress on the craft employees.

good,"A typical day as a train controller involved direct control of operations of one of six sub-districts, approximately 600 track miles per sub-division. As Chief Train Controller, I monitored every aspect of the entire division's operation, including but not limited to; monitoring train performance as compared to schedule and advising the train controller which train should have preference (not be delayed), answering rules related questions, approving/disapproving work/maintenance on track infrastructure based on anticipated need of a given section to avoid service disruptions, and directly manage the office staff of 10-15 employees. I learned to be proactive, and to make safety a first priority in all decisions. Management were very knowledgeable and obliging - without their assistance, it would have been most difficult to complete my University studies. The hardest part of this job was dealing with regular fatalities, and even more so when one of our employees were involved. Most enjoyable was walking into the office and relieving a co-worker who'd had a bad day to the point of being nearly delirious, understanding the situation, and making arrangements to resolve all outstanding issues as quickly and safely as possible."
good,"As a boilermaker, I was responsible for fabricating, welding, and repairing damaged locomotives.  When I moved up to mechanical supervisor I was responsible for payroll, safety audits and meetings, and maintaining rail traffic."

good,"Great place to work. The dispatch center is fast paced, and can be stressful. Management are trying their best to make the transition to Atlanta as pleasing as possible."
good,"On a typical day , You might start with a plan, however that soon changes and you must be flexible and sharp to handle sudden changes in the flow or your plan. You must be able to Multi-Task, as multiple issues will arise through your day. I have to say the hardest issue that I face is having the Crews work efficiently and safely. At the end of the day , when you take a look back at the over-all performance of your day and see that, most things went pretty well, and you did the best that anybody could've done."

good,"A typical day is your monitoring crews for upcoming trains and yard schedules for trains. you consisting learn new call signs, new jobs, products and clients in which their using our business for transporting of their goods. Each desk which there are more than 30+ in the crew office covers a different demographic of the united states. What can be difficult is making sure you have enough man power to cover the trains that need to be ran each day, but it doesn't stop the overall joy i have in interacting with the crewmen and the my immediate team whom i work with in the office"
good,"Report on time, accept and understand location and movements of trains including any  problems and ""on track"" equipment also including any marine traffic affecting bridge openings.

good,"At nineteen I left home to go work on the railroad. Working in an all male environment I learned to appreciate sophomoric humor. The hazing was constant, and I discovered how to give it back in a respectful way. If your coworkers did not like you, they will not say anything to you. The company I worked for would not promote an employee without a four tear degree, so this started me back to college. I worked the 11 -7 shift and took classes early in the morning."

A yard job has very little traveling.

good,"Treats employees well.  Can advance in field yoy choose.  Management involved in everyday activities."
good,I did not learn much during this internship but it was very laid back and compensated well.  After the internship they offered us all jobs and there was job security.  It just really depends on whether you are someone who can work on the railroad everyday outside in the cold or the heat.
good,The compensation and benefits I received from this company exceeded my expectations. I am glad I had the experience of working at Norfolk Southern Corp.
