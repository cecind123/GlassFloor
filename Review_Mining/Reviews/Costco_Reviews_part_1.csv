bad,Costco was a miserable place to work. too much work was expected to be completed in an unreasonably short amount of time. Everything you did was scrutinized with unrealistic expectations and the management would hound you about minute details. the management was never on the same page and would regularly give out contradictory orders and harsh criticism about job performance in failing to meet all contradictory orders. Any work related grievance was dismissed even thought the company claims to have zero tolerance policy for punishing whistle blowers. basically if you're willing to shut up paint a fake smile on your face and lie about how great it is to work there you'll do fine.
bad,"Great place to work, until you get a disability. They will make you hate your job to the point you either hav to quit, or they'll limit your hours so you need another job. DO NOT TELL THEM IF YOU HAVE A DISABILITY."
bad,"super stressful place to work, management plays favourites with their staff and there is little to no room for advancement if you are not part of the ""inner circle"". Most management is unprofessional."
bad,"Did not like working here at all, the managers take their job way too seriously and love to play the power role over less important employees. If someone saw you mess up or make a mistake they were sure to make it known to a manager or your boss."
bad,I really enjoyed working there and it was a safe environment. Everyone was treated equally and individuals were able to express themselves without a fear of penalization.
bad,"I left on L&I because they force you to push 360 lbs of carts around for 8 hours a day. I completely destroyed my shoulder, they waited until my physical therapy was done and I got cleared to go back to work than they fired me for no reason."
bad,"You are never appreciated for all the hard work you put in. The shifts you are given are all over the place. One of the supervisors had been a bully towards me and was absolutely nasty. Not one person is happy there, its a miserable place."
bad,They take members side all the time over employees even if they’re wrong. Environment is clique oriented and very hostile. Keep you away from your family
bad,"Done "
bad,Très mauvaise expérience chez costco ne recommanderais pas aucune ambiance travail stressant!!!
bad,"Hi,"
bad,"Costco is said to be one of the best companies to work for. The store I work at is corrupt, management is unfair and the store manager is incompetent. The store makes money by telling its vendors that items came in damaged that were not. People go out for food while on the clock. The store shows a clear example of favoritism in the workplace."
bad,"If you are different in any way or have any mental health issues, Costco is the worst."
bad,"Management will never fail to remind you that speaking with each other is forbidden, because it wastes company time, but will also never fail to spend 30+ minutes chatting away about their weekend to fellow managers. Everything is always your fault. Your hours (if part time) will be steadily reduced so they can save more money. When you are injured, they stick you in the office out of sight and forget about you. They ignore doctor's orders and yell at you to work harder despite your injury. They frequently ask you to perform tasks outside your job description. Training is non-existent."
bad,"While working there, they did not treat the temps fairly. It would have been more beneficial if they had treated us like real human beings, and not someone to be easily thrown away."
bad,N/a....not the greatest to work. Management sucked. Health and safety is non complaint. Waste too much food too. Never give staff any benefits and militant place.
bad,"Although this was a student program the company did not provide anytime for my studies and basically refused to lower my hours, whilst in school as well as not following my disponibilities, therefore causing me to quit."
bad,"At Costco, you never feel safe. Your job is constantly threatened if you get hurt, don’t increase speed constantly, fail to push yourself to the brink of exhaustion. They “time” the cashiers, causing them to throw items to across the register to the assistant ( I have huge  bruises and photos ). If the cashier doesn’t make the time requirement, they are suspended from the register for a number of days. You are hired at 24 hours per week, but they will schedule you for 40 without consulting you.. They pay better than average, but the one who pays, is you.  What they care about,  is production. I think the one thing Costco must invest in is a good P.R. Firm. The people who sing their praises, are employees who have nowhere else to go. They are often hostile to anyone who dares to disagree with Costco’s policies publicly, yet warn you in private, not to rock the boat. Be careful... It may be a bit more pay, but what you lose, may be more precious."
bad,"Kelowna store stay clear ...."
bad,"If you have a college degree at Costco it does not matter.  Experience in the various departments that you may work in does not affect the amount of pay per hour, starting wage is $13.25 or $13.50; after so many hours worked your raise kicks in automatically accordingly.  Most members are horrible customers because they know they will ninety-nine percent of the time get what they want from management.  You should have a very thick skin, the company has their very broad return policy and their old school ideological ""The Member is always right,"" credo, management will not back you up when you try to deny a return that is egregious or absurd in its essence.  Your degree from a university does not matter at all at this company; most of your superiors, General Managers... will not have a college education; this company prides itself on your loyalty to the company and getting rewarded accordingly; starting at maybe a cart person then over the hours and years worked, increasing your individual pay with time spent with the company.  But if you actually think that your college education will grant you an increase in pay at the outset, think again because at Costco: It ain't that type of party.  For real-for real."
bad,Management is a joke. They play favoritism and the only give them time off. You work your butt off only to get passed over by one of their favorite drinking friend that they hired on.
bad,"Pire experience, je me suis fait renvoyer sans explication pendant que je donner mon 101% pour eux a chaque quart de travail"
bad,"Managers and HR do not tell you about their policies during orientation most people don’t know the policies until they get written up or fired. Managers do not care about employees. Costco will fire you for calling out 2 days even with a valid doctors note. Training is half assed. Forced to work more than 40 hour weeks even if you’re part time. Part time members are basically full time with part time benefits(no health, no 401k, no pto)"
bad,Managers go around harassing and provoking employees based only on looks. They do not introduce themselves but instead state that you should know who they are.
bad,the management was beyond horrible from the immediate supervisor all the way up to the CEO. The way they handle serious allegations is degrading and disgusting. Would never recommend working there.
bad,At worked at Costco and asked Management to help me several times with issues at work instead they would just laugh in my face. Management is useless and they promote people not on hard work but those who react better with people. I think that’s why all the managers are unhelpful cause they are all brain dead. They also play favorites.
bad,Just don't waste your time with them. Its a nightmare. Their values are not up to the Australian standards and staff colleagues aren't up to the mark as well.
bad,"Not flexible and dishonest. Management needs training on Customer Service, Honesty, Loyalty and train the employees the same. Needs to be consistent with everybody."
bad,"Ajax Costco, is not a great place to work because of management. Management do not respect employees nor do they talk to them with any dignity. Everyone who works at Costco only cares about climbing the corporate ladder."
bad,Was told job security was a lie was told care for the employee was a lie. Bad experience unprofessional supervisors who need a lot more then experienc.
bad,"Felt like a cog most of the time, managers don't even remember your name and clearly do not care for their employees as they are over-worked themselves. Good place as an entry level job but do yourself a favour and don't stay for too long."
bad,Basically do what your told! Don’t give suggestions because if management takes offense they will bully u until you quit. Don’t ever disagree with management or the members it will get u fired. Working for these people is like literally joining a cult. They are mean and rude but smile in everyone face! U been warned!!
bad,It’s a nightmare and they are full of sh^t I don’t advise or recommend anyone ever coming to this sh^th0le they are all liars ver disorganized unprofessional and above all favoritism
bad,"Management is not reliable, and they don’t care about their employees. All they care about is making money. There is really bad repor between workers and so called upper management. Which in turn leads to poor product and services. Don’t get stuck here because of decent pay and benefits. It isn’t worth it"
bad,"never again will i ever work for this company again, not even sub-contracted through their call center located in Ft. Myers FL............................"
bad,"This isn't  too bad of a place to work. Although management  chooses only good looking people to run registers, they don't  give average person a chance."
bad,"Micromanaging, employees are rude! Upon my first day I made a mistake and a regular employee was trying to send me home. They literally have everyone running around and keep you running around by promising you things."
bad,"jason the guy who does the hiring is a liar, and will tell you they arent hiring when they are hiring. I have friends who work there and tell me that they are hiring and then i go in every week for months on end and get lied to probably because of his own personal reasons of not liking me. disgusting attitude from someone who represents such a position at costco."
bad,They put me in a position that they knew I wouldn't be able to meet the requirements due to a spinal cord injury. The front manager told me that he didn't have the time to train me as a cashier. They could put me in another position because to move to another position you had to have seniority. I wasn't asking to be the CEO.
bad,"Do ya ever get that one rock in your stomach that collects and collects until you end up with a boulder? Then, when ya ask for help getting it fixed, ya get kicked to the floor and spat on? Welcome to Costco Wholesale...gotta bless those shareholders no matter what am I right??"
bad,I have never seen such a poorly managed store in my life. They never listen to the employees when we come to management with concerns and always expect more then we can offer them. I do not recommend working for this company.
bad,"This is for the Danville, CA store. During the interview I was told a specific hourly rate and that I could work 15 hours a week.   When I was hired Human Resources told me it was actually $2.00 less an hour and I had to work at least 20 hours a week.  I was constantly put on the schedule for 25-30 hours a week. I always received the worst shifts and was forced to do the messiest jobs.  There was no balance.  The break room is filled with old picnic tables.  There are no chairs with backs to rest. They promote young adults with no experience to supervisory positions. This is how they are able to pay such a low wage for a tough job, these kids don't know any better."
bad,The place sucks there is no organization or communication amongst the managers. They hire dumb people that don't know how to do the job. There is no training any of the employees.
bad,They have basic employees absorb the duties of management along with their hired position tasks without the proper compensation. Schedules are constantly changed without notice. Superiors text employees. The list goes on. Very unorganized. Hire new employees instead of increasing hours of part time employees. No training. Verbally abusive
bad,"I always heard Costco was great to work for. This was not my experience. I was hired after having an interview stating that I would not be working all the time in the morning, it would be possible to do that sometimes. Basically every shift after I was hired was  at 6 am. The management during the morning merchandising and stocking are cranky and sarcastic to the employees. Plus it was only 25 hours a week and minimum wage, which is no where close to what I need to live."
bad,"Beware, expect nothing but people showing favoritism and rampant brown nosing. Supervisors are incompetent and managers don't give a care about anyone but themselves and people who brown nose."
bad,A company that doesn’t work with any other job they require you to make them your only option If you have more then one job Costco want them to be priority
bad,It's a lot of favoritism in the company  employees are constantly quitting. Sometimes two three or four a week. They lost a lot of good workers. A few went on their lunch break and never came back to work. Members are rude and very disrespectful. Hope all the other aren't like this one.
bad,"Over work and under paid  Management lack discipline"
bad,Working at costco i have learned a lot of cusomer service skills that I have benefited me working with others. I have been able to gain the understanding that as humans we have different perspectives and it takes an open mind to be respectful of others beliefs.
bad,"It was a very non inclusive environment, the managers were very rude an arrogant, constantly belittling employees, also very openly talked about how they would force people they did not like to quit."
bad,While working at costco your hours until your next raise are counted starting at 1000 or so hours until you reach your next raise. I have reached as low as 300 and the second time as low as 400 and both times i have reached that low. my hours reset to 1000 because the STATE increased minimum wage. It is a dishonest company that does not scale against mandatory state wage increases. impossible to get any kind of promotion unless you want to be a supervisor. And doing so puts you in the 50 hour a week category in whatever store or hours they want to place you in. Almost like some kind of fraternity. Managers and supervisors are rude and treat employees link mindless pawns. Employees feel under appreciated and work slowly on purpose because management does not accommodate them or explain situations politely. some employees are scheduled up until midnight even though we close the store as late as 9pm. If you are just starting out. You will likely stay this late for an uncertain number of years.
bad,poor management.stressful working conditions worked extremely hard follow all the rules and it was never enough. management always standing around doing nothing but talk in groups and pick out DIFFERENT people that doesn't look like typical people living in the suburb areas.
bad,This job position was very easy to accomplish but the Team work was very difficult. Alof of my co-workers loved to chit chat instead of working and It made things very difficult for my work ethnic.
bad,Alright to work for. Not much room for advancement. Employees can be hard to work with when you are a newer employee. You get breaks and a lunch. Customers can be very demanding because they pay for their membership.
bad,"A good company to work for, overall.  The pay and benefits are really good.  The management is hit or miss, with good managers and incompetent managers."
bad,My worst job ever I don't know how I lasted five years. You are treated like a robot and when majority of pharmacy staff complained to upper management nothing was done. Instead they victim blame.
bad,"Management was terrible. They do not care for employees or what you were hired for. I was put out on carts everyday in the hot hot heat or the cold cold rain. For hours on end, if you are young you will mostly be out on carts."
bad,"A great place to work with friendly employees. I learned about how the front end works, stocking at night, co-workers are great that I work with. Management was great to work with. Everyone has a great attitude, On your feet all day, making peoples day with they come in purchasing and are happy with there purchase."
bad,Was made to do trolleys more than 75% of the time spent at the place and was told women shouldn’t not push trolleys as they are weaker than men. Was hired as a cafe assistant.
bad,"Terrible management, no communication, not enough employees actually working and helping, horrible training, employees were rude and not helpful at all"
bad,"Horrible, poor management. "
bad,Will never go back. The manage are very racist and bias. You start off as part-time which is horrible. The oppurtunities are very slim when you work for costco
bad,I would not recommend  working for this company They do not look after their employees or care about anything happening in their lives. As a student needing some time off for ems etc. they were never accommodating/
bad,There is nothing positive I can say about Costco. It’s a job not a career. I have bills so therefore I have to go the work. I am currently looking for a career that I will love
bad,"no thanks this was just part time "
bad,Can’t advance in a company that always transfers people from other cities to be promoted in your location. Poor management skills and lack of leadership. Some people work twice as hard as others for the same pay so be careful what department you end up in.
bad,"Hours were never the same, managment would tell you one thing and do something different, i was going to school and they told me they would work around it and wrote me up for changing my schedule because they would schedule me during class times, AWFUL place to work"
bad,"did not like working here, low pay rate for hard labor, extreme working conditions, lack of support and teamwork.  extreme business, lack of qualified leaders."
bad,"The management at McDonalds is 100% better than Costco Concierge service. They dont care about their workers, often trick them to switch shifts. then refuse to switch it. Every time you were up for a raise, they would find a reason not to give it to you. Promises are used all the time, yet never follow through."
bad,A typical day at work would be come in an hour before closing clean up my work area then after the store closed we would unload the trucks and stock. Management was terrible they would pick favorites and were very rude to pretty much every one. They are always understaffed so work never gets done and the employees take the blame for not working hard enough.
bad,My experience with Costco was bitter and long. However the pay and benefits were good enough to want to go back if I ever truly just desperately needed a pay check.
bad,"Working at Costco was unorganized, unfriendly and stressful. I was told by a supervisor to move my arms from side to side faster, to make it look like I was working harder. I don't even want to shop there any more."
bad,bad management all the way around up to the CIO.  unrealistic expectations without the proper personnel to execute the tasks.  Inexperience leadership
bad,"This is a tale about two faces of the company. First we have COSTCO that every knows and loves. The warehouse where we all shop. We all love it. It's a great place that treats their employees with respect and pays them fairly. This is not that Costco. "
bad,"managers are mean, work is under appreciated. get out while you can. wage is good i guess but they treat you pretty poorly, overall the benefits and the wage make up for the misconduct of managers, but it is to the point of of bullying."
bad,I work there for 6 months i did waht they ask me to do got pass my 90 days and got fired because some one said i punch bay door but i didnt mine you i have watch one person gets suspended for cussing somebody out and go back to work one person Kick trash can cussed and everything and never even got suspended both of these people were white and still work there my family had just left me due to some Unfortunate Events and i still went to work everyday
bad,"Bad Management made this location a bad fit for me. Don't think your job is secure, even if you worked harder than most. Truth is this location had a revolving door of personnel and Managers. Having to put in time to get raises instead of Merit raises is horrible. It's like a jail sentence! Driving from Ventura to Goleta is a costly venture and became to much for my family."
bad,The company hired me for the Christmas season and during that time I only received 4 shifts of 8 hours each in a span of a month. I called at least 30 times asking for hours and didn’t receive any. I was promised at least 2 months of employment but on received 23 hours. This was unacceptable and very shady
bad,"This is a cutthroat very laborious job where you will work, pushing carts in the rain and if you need a break after 3 hours or 4 hours of that labor, they will put one in freezer/cooler section to break down. I got very sick after this. I asked for something else and couldn't get it because I was low seniority at that time. You can suffer many injuries and your schedule will be whatever they need you to work leading to sleepless nights, and inconsistent work schedules. They will not accommodate single parents, so I would not recommend this job to anyone that is and who has to hire a babysitter. I have told them many times I can work Sundays, yet am never scheduled to work one, when I could use the time + 1/2 pay. I was also told I couldn't attend yoga teacher training because they don't recognize that as an actual school, even though I could teach anywhere in the world after graduation (anything that requires attendance, work and graduation is a school). "
bad,"i did not enjoy working theyre not very oganized "
bad,Had the most Racist and biased managers. They will use and abuse you like a pack of replaceable dogs just because they pay alright. Definitely not a place of mutual respect at the least.
bad,"Sure it pays good and the benefits seem great at first. As time goes on you'll be worn down after being understaffed constantly and having to work harder because there are less people. Many nights I had to make up for work other coworkers did not do during the day. Managers will spy on you, write you up, and wait for you to slip up. They are more happy to fire you than hire you. Every day my coworkers and I grew more stressed and defeated. I quit and not soon after many more people quit. "
bad,Very fast paced environment. A lot was expected to be done in a short amount of time. Lots of food was wasted instead of being donated to food bank and less fortunate.
bad,This has been absolutely the worst place to ever work for. It is the most dysfunctional and bipolar set of managers and supervisors I have ever worked for. I wouldn't even recommend this job to a homeless person.
bad,I am dissatisfied with the hours and the lack of communication given to employees at my job.  There is no place to advance and quite frankly the job is dull and boring.
bad,"You review your cart, learn the key selling points and try to convince people to buy said products. Tasting the samples during your break was the best part."
bad,"The fact that Superior Colorado managers are allowed to run this store in the manner they do, is absolutely disgusting, They tire shop is a Mess and allowed to run rough-Shaw over customers!! Terrible Tire shop..OSHA NOT Approved...Music is blasted daily!!!   Managers should be fired!!"
bad,I didn't enjoy the job at the location was too far to travel everyday and the hours were long and the overall company wasn't good to work for. never again.
bad,I hated it. I worked there for 5 years. It was the worst experience of my life. I want to die. I hated it the whole time. I am going to kill myself because I have no money from working there.
bad,"The management team at the costco i worked at were mean, nasty, and self absorbed. they were not understanding at all, and did not care to help if you were ill. you had to come in to work even if you were running a fever."
bad,"There is not any definition or process for technology management career path. Technology in general is many years behind market.  Decision making is not transparent and often leaves out staff subject matter experts. Management is unduly influenced by sales, sales engineers, and consultants."
bad,"It’s a paycheque "
bad,"I take incoming calls from Costco Wholesale members who have problems or issues with any PC,Tablet, Printer, or Cameras purchased from Costco. We provide free tech support and remote assistance to try and help resolve any issues or concerns they may have with their item."
bad,constantly micromanaged and under appreciated. Typical day is a nightshift consisting of stacking shelves and reorganizing or re-allocating palettes for the next day.
bad,"getting yelled at by customers , managers do not care enough to give you a bathroom break. we had to use a trash can. Getting write ups left and right for mangers mistakes , by not telling you what needed to be done."
bad,this place think they are a military base.. they treat people like they dont know anything unless your part a a circle or click. they talk to you like shoot and dont even make a small mistake you will pay for it
bad,"The job was too far from home insults were constantly made and in different languages. customers were pushing, shoving and fighting for samples. I got sent home more than once and it interfered with my school schedule."
bad,Wouldn't go back the management was horrible ... promise things and then don't deliver at all .. very sad about the position I was in and the way they treated me there
bad,"I assisted cashiers with customers, boxing and unloading product.  Also helped customers load and unload product. I learned how rude people can be, and how managers can be so clueless and disorganized. I was highly disappointed in that job, I clearly over-estimated that scene.  I love COSTCO as a consumer but to work there was a total disappointment.  Hardest part of the job was the commute and the scheduling, the only thing I enjoyed was looking at all the great product they have."
bad,"Costco has started to slack in its treatment of the employees, over the last several years. Once the insurance plans were really good, the covered all the employees needs. Now you're lucky if they cover them at all. Then there is the treatment of the managment staff, which is a trickle down effect."
bad,"Managers and employees are horrible to work with, they make you feel like you don't do anything when you do so much more than they see."
bad,Just another retail shop. Bigger than the rest and not very good for part time work. No fulltime work available. Hopefully you can get along with your co-workers.
bad,"Always was something to do, would work me hard each day. they offered great hours and great benefits. was working in a warehouse and worked a lot with inventory."
bad,Only worked there 3 weeks new opening over hired so I was layed off. I really didnt get to do nay work there more than assisting the cashiers
bad,Management is difficult and I was disrespected many times.  The breaks were very short and inconsiderate. Pay is okay . Overall could be better
bad,"Not a very fun workplace"
bad,This place is a joke. Don't work for this company. They stay in court for fraud and many other problems.The last time I checked They were in Bankruptcy court.
bad,"Typical day at wok could mean selling dresses to prom kids or pageant girls, or it could be all about cold calls, making sales nationwide and making sure to follow up so we can get and keep our clients. The hardest part of my job is besides the cold calls, i could sit around for hours having nothing to do."
bad,Worked for CDS which is part of Costco. Very good to work for.  Had to leave because of my husband had Alzheimer's.Girl's were very good to work with management was good. most enjoyable was cooking the food and serving to our customers.
bad,"My day is usually boring and all that. I go in, stock stuff before the store opens then find something to do before my shift is done. Overall, Its not a place where I want to work at after my degree. The management is pretty horrible. I get that you go in to do your job, but even that alone doesn't satisfy them. Managers should thank their coworkers as we work hard to do what you want. Some (not all) Coworkers don't treat you that great even if you work hard on the job. Yes you work as a team but a lot of people I work with have no ambition. I've been there almost 3 years and trying to move to the front end because a lot of younger staff work there, and the hours are more realistic. That's another thing, these hours aren't ideal, and if you're late you get a write up. Scheduling is horrendous as they make mistakes quite a lot on the schedule and I have to remind them what days off I originally gave them. I don't get benefits since I'm a student which is find cause its just temporary till I find something better. The job nature is fairly boring, routine and repetitive. Its just the people you have to work with at times that make it unbearable. Overall they ""treat their employees well"" but that doesn't mean that they value you as a person. The hardest part of the job I would say is that it can be physically challenging but that's about it. Also, once you do it over time, you don't really learn anything, and its not really a fun environment since people there just do it for the paycheck rather than passion.  Most enjoyable part of the job is that the people who have been there"
bad,A typical day at work was make sure everything  was in line or of the ground. I learned on this job how be patient. On this job management was easy because I had a job coach help me thought all of the step on the job. In the job co-worker was great. The hardest part of the job was standing. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how be a good lead.
bad,I had to get the orders ready and set up food carts I learned the different foods they can and can not eat there diets I njoyed working with my managers and co workers the hardest part of the job was making sure u had the right food on the tray n the order right and didnt mess up the diet the most enjoyable part of the job working with other people meeting and talking with the residents
bad,"Do Not work for this company, it is rubbish and they treat you like   dog muck the work is strenuous,back breaking, and you get treated like a  skive  all they do is use you then if your no good they will just tell you to go home and leave, as you aint good enough the company is SHOCKING to work for."
bad,"If you'd like to succumb to belittling by your superiors on a regular basis, costco is the perfect fit. The company has endless regulations and ways they demand you operate. Unfortunately, there is no adherence to the company rules by supervisors, managers, admin etc etc. Want to know your schedule? If it is busy and they are trying to cut costs, you wont get a schedule until a few days before. This is in clear violation of their own contractual rules but good luck having anybody care. Their claims of great pay in comparison to other retail stores is a bit far fetched. There is no reward or promotion for hard work or ability, all raises are scheduled i.e. after working 1000 hours you will receive a 25 cent raise per hour. This is not endless, you are capped around 20 dollars/hr unless you manage to become a supervisor etc etc. The drawback there is that it is a very dog eat dog atmosphere. Some people have been working as cashiers for 15 years. Communication is limited in all forms, sometimes deliberately, to keep you in the dark. The managers, assistant managers and most supervisors are not qualified for their work. The HR is nonexistent, management training is nonexistent. In fact, it is a miracle they are even functional, perhaps the warehouse manager does all of the important work and is the sole competent person running the show. Lastly, there is no training of any sort. (beyond CostcoU, the computer based ""training"" that they may ask you to do to meet corporate requirements). You are dropped in and expected to know everything they bark at you to do and how it is to be"
bad,this company is super up tight....and the will dog you out asking to to run instead or walking to each loction
bad,"Long hours, no benefits while on contract, not allowed to take vacation, management lacking, too many levels"
bad,"Full on hypocrites run the front end of this warehouse.  I was hired and fired all within a 3 week period.  Why was I fired?  Because I wasn't bright, bubbly, and cheerful the entire time.  They said I looked miserable.  I was not, but I am certainly not some kind of maniac who runs around giggling like a mental patient.  So they called me in, they had the paper work all set to go, no excuses, they didn't want to hear my point of view that was for certain!  Sign here and there, initial here.  Heres your check, get out of our warehouse."
bad,"Poor management"
bad,"Worst working experience I've ever had."
bad,Good company with quality inventory.  I enjoyed the excellent training experience.
bad,i hated it..
bad,wasent treated good people where rude not a good place to work
bad,"Overbearing managers that really did nothing to aid in situations where there was a problem -- they just went stupid so to speak. Aggressive requests to upsale their memberships or we would loose our jobs. Being brought into small private meetings and horribly treated , verbally assaulted. Accused of saying things to members"
bad,"I was admitted to the ER. The admin at my store told me to call back once I had recovered. So I did today and he tells me that I no longer have a job. When I've had nothing but good things on my evaluation and suddenly I now I have ""work performance issues."" I've never been spoken to, or written up for these supposed issues. I'm a vet that's fresh out of the military. I've honestly never seen so much disrespect and lack of integrity."
bad,They will use & abuse you.  While the pay is very appealing it does not compensate you for how poorly you are treated.  If you are not in their “clic” you can forget being treated equally!!
bad,"Was hired on is a seasonal employee,didn't have a good experience, was told I would probably be hired back on and wasn't. orientation ,and finding out your schedule was a challenge."
bad,"If you get hurt on the job. Management immediately turns on you and do NOT care about you at all. You are just a number to them. I do not recommend working here, you wear out your body VERY quickly. Beware."
bad,"A typical day was 8 hours.  No brains were needed to do this job...only a body that moves.  Watch others who have worked there a long time...they all have back, knee, or other medical issues from the repetitive work on concrete.  If you are educated, this isn't the place to be."
bad,"Had my application in for years had 3 inter6, was suppose to hear back in 4 days to this date has not heard from anyone. They wont tske a resume in store, you ask 10 people the same question and get 10 different answers. Got 2 interviews and it's been a month and no one k ows what's going g on. Ask manager all you get is a smile & I dont know what to tell you"" is his reply.  Very poor communication.  Gave up getting a job and gave up shopping there. Very disappointed in the Dartmouth location. Gave up going there and now take my business to Halifax location. You will NEVER get full time."
bad,No thank you I was not happy with the way that your family was to come after Costco. My family always comes first with me management was worthless and degrading
bad,"I thought I would have more hours and gave my all. I was eligible to receive full time work when a jobs became available. I felt Blackballed after a week in that the Budget was not enough to keep many people on. Later, I heard that there was plenty of budget to keep people on."
bad,"Costco in Sudbury isn’t a great place to work despite what everyone tells you. Unless you’re part of the manager bff club, good luck moving up. It’s 100% about personal relationships and absolutely 0% about your actual work performance and personality. The benefits are okay, but the pay is average and the environment is toxic. Also: the food court is an absolute disaster and once you get in there, good luck ever getting out. Wouldn’t recommend... hours can be extremely ridiculous and even though you’re only part time you have to work 5 days a week. Completely unfair if you are trying to work a second job to pay bills (oh by the way they don’t accommodate if you have a second job) "
bad,"Don't work too hard unless you love to feel under appreciated. You'll see people who don't work hard advance and they really didn't deserve it. If your a woman, get ready to be harassed EVERY single day of your life and if you don't like it..... no one cares. Horrible work culture, at least at San Leandro #118"
bad,The money was good. Is the only thing good about Costco now. Since him sinagel stepped down its been downhill .  They have there favorites for advancement . It's all politics at costco.
bad,"Supervisor was very demanding, and constantly over your shoulder pressuring employees to move faster. Also, management  made girls "
bad,"Costco is by far the worst company to work for. It is filled with liars, back stabbers and people that will throw you under the bus to get ahead."
bad,"I started out working in the front end and that was nice, but then they put me in the food court with incredibly incompetent managers who didn't do a very good job at anything except yelling and stressing out. It was the worst job I have had in my life."
bad,"My review for Costco is kind of mixed. Upon arriving at orientation, all of us were told right off the bat that we should always be looking over our shoulders; because they'll have no problem firing us and hiring somebody else. They were very descriptive on our expendable we were. The management is another story, they were unhelpful, never gave employee evaluations even if they were required. If you asked how you were doing, they would say ""I don't know."" By the end of my seasonal period there, they never really told me I would be cut from the company. Instead, they just cut my hours to 0 for 2 months; When I went into speak to them about it. They said, ""Oh well, I guess you didn't cut it."""
bad,I applied for part time or full time only to find out at orientation all 125+ of us were told we were considered seasonal until our 90 probationary period was over. Originally I was hired as part time. After not being written up and performing my job well I was called into the managers office and told my seasonal employment was terminated. Unbelievable!! They are letting over 100 employees go over the next two weeks. What a disgraceful Company to work for. I suggest staying away.
bad,"I asked for flexible hours because I wanted to go to school and I got ""LAID OFF"" the same day....HMMM I WONDER WHY....Management was not at all open to any suggestions...the job was terrible I felt like a zombie."
bad,"I started working in the Optical Department, which I loved BTW! Shortly after I was trained, my hours were cut and they crossed trained me on the front-end. My hours being cut was one thing, but when they put me on the front-end, it was to load and unload the merchandise to/from shopping carts, normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, EXCEPT I was 3 months pregnant and they wanted me to bend and lift heavy items. I made it VERY clear to ALL management that I was pregnant, my doctor even gave them a note stating that I was restricted from lifting, but THEY DID NOT CARE! They wanted me to compromise the health of me and my unborn baby for a 10.00 hour job?!! NO THANK YOU!!! I deserve to be valued as a person, not just an ""employee""-"
bad,Your experience at Costco depends on where you land. Some groups are much better than others. Many times the groups take on the personality of the director or AVP (Assistant Vice President) for that group.
bad,"Takes forever to hear back if you got the job. Preferance is given to people they know personally. Very poor management, they have there favourites.  Supervisors also have there favourites,  they totally ignore you, if your not the favorite.  The treat the CDS people like they don't exist.With the shifts, you have no personal life."
bad,They say they are family oriented and that they take care of their employees they do not I had to miss 3 days of work from hurting myself while working came in with a drs not excusing me for those days and they suspended me
bad,"I used to believe this company would allow me to progress and create a fulfilling career. Boy was I wrong."
bad,"They need to learn how to follow Costco's store guidelines, and they need to be more concerned with their employees health, they also need to be able to follow a few day training schedule for new hires."
bad,No interest to respect all cultures. Suffered form racism by a low qualified pharmacy manager. Don't want to talk more as this is a horrible experience for beginning a pharmacy career
bad,"I worked there for three years. Never did they help me get a schedule that fit with my life. I’m a single mom of three kids. They didn’t even lift a finger to help, I wouldn’t get home till after 8 to make dinner and they still ad the audacity to ask me to stay later. It’s a crapshoot."
bad,This place was a nightmare to work for. They have some of the most unprofessional managers running the place. This place is all favouritism and nepotism. A lot of people that worked there permanent were family or friends of the VP and other head office employees. They got away with “murder.” You will never get ahead in this company.
bad,Disfrutan Explotar a loa Trabajadores .Tratan al personal como peón
bad,You have to work there for 20 years before you get any real retirement benefits or any other good benefits. Pay is low and you are overworked for the pay.
bad,"I worked as an optician & made it less than a year before I quit. (I had been at my previous office 10 years.) Mgmt was TERRIBLE! We only got our schedules 1 week in advance but even then my mgr was constantly re-working them. She must have spent 6 hours a day going over the schedule and the other 2 hours trying to act busy. That's if she made it her entire 8hr shift without leaving early. There were days employees would get a call in the morning telling them not to come in for their shift because it was slow. Sometimes they would wait until they came in to be sent home because they were trying to make payroll look better. The thing that really sucks (besides driving to work and wasting gas to then be sent home) was that if you didnt average a specific number of hours it messed with your benefits & fulltime/part time status.  They also dont have a very good paid time off policy. You dont get ANY time off what so ever until you've been there a year but they wont let you take unpaid days off (messes with average hours) so you better not have any plans outside of work. Favoritism runs rampant as well. If your not one of them watch your back. They pay decent and raises are based on how many hours you work, not actual job performance. I liked the medical/dental benefits.  Overall the place was depressing & I had to drag myself in every day. There is no work/life balance...Costco better be your life! I ended up working for a private doctor office for the same pay & closer to home with coworkers & a manager I actually like."
bad,"Great place for part time benfits. No help from Management. It takes forever to move up now. You can't survive off of the pay here, unless you are there for 5 years"
bad,The job itself wasn't bad and overall I enjoyed my co workers. Management was horrible and they didn't seem to care for people's everyday lives. Job advancement seemed impossible in the store that I worked at.
bad,"At costco, managers were put in place that had no experience whatsoever. In the bakery where I worked, I had more experience and knowledge than my manager, who we acquired from the delicatessen."
bad,"All about sales and members, no work life balance. your life is your job especially full time. high volume sales with little encouragement or recognition from manager."
bad,"A typical day at work would be arriving before 11:00am, going to the PWC;s office, finding out what to do, setting up the table for the demonstration wearing gloves & hair net, at the end of each demonstration you have to sanitize everything!!!!! Or else the company will be sued!!!!!"
bad,"Management is very poor, I have yet to be put in the department that I was hired for, I get almost zero family time and when I am at work I am constantly getting told how to do things from people that don't know how to do said things. Almost everyone that works there does not work with a ""team"" mentality and only does just what they have to  and most of the time pass the buck off to the next person down the line."
bad,"seemed a really nice set of people to work with but cut backs meant I had to go other than that not bad."
bad,prepare the orders that come in through the window as the person is paying. after the order is done you continue that for the remainder of the shift
bad,"mala empresa no valora al personal."
bad,"Working for Costco meant paycheques so low I could not afford to pay the rent. Five hour shifts both weekend days and 3-4 late nights per week. I am over 35 and I was scheduled for 5 hr shifts till 10:30 while I watched 20 somethings leave 8 hr shifts at 6-7 pm. I have a little person to put to bed. At less than $14/hr I had to pay out much of my wages for babysitters. They think it's reasonable to change your shifts the night before and literally tell staff to ensure to check the schedule every day before they leave to see if more/less hours added or start times changed etc- literally- less than 24 hrs notice and they do it if you are off the previous day too- seriously ridiculous. There is a long term "" manager"" there with absolutely no skill in managing people and no professionalism whatsoever. Her name begins with P and she is a serious bully. She literally tried to give me trouble for going to the bathroom early on an open shift one Sunday morning. I was less than 5 minutes. I stood up for myself so she didn't like me, but she has a very bad rep for bullying staff ( many are 18 -24 yrs old) and the corporation does not care. This is the culture. Fear. Everyone is afraid to speak up because pay and benefits don't get good until you've put up with their culture for 3 years and maybe you'll kiss enough butt to get on full time. I've watched semi- fit, able bodied men in their 30's and early 40's stand around jingling keys in their pockets acting important inside under the heaters while staff- supervisors and cashiers that are over 55 and one over 65 are running around the"
bad,Hardest part of the job is dealing with the amount of customers by the volumes. Also it is a great place to meet lasting friendships with co-workers
bad,Total military management system. The higher you are on the totem pole the less you actually do. In reverse you do just about everything as an entry level employee. All my friends agree.
bad,"Makes you feel unnappapreciated as a whole. I learned to work fast under pressure. Most of my co workers were perfectly fine, management was my issue. The hardest part of the job was the cleaning, and if you didn't get it right you had to stay until you did. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paychecks."
bad,I would work long and hard as a cashier and then bust it outside pushing carts
bad,Wasnt a good place to work. people were not that nice and just didnt make me feel comfortable.
bad,Most of the managers are incompetent. In fact most of the store was run like a 5th grade.
bad,Management will ignore most of your requests and is not really willing to see the bigger picture. working for Costco was nice at first because all the high pay but the company will choose favorites and micromanage and won’t admit when Something isn’t working out.
bad,"It was a temporary job for me, its not in my desired career choice.  Upper level management needs some improvement.  Pay rate for the type of work, and advancement is extremely poor."
bad,people here are ignorant they make fun of you for being ten pounds overweight  they had us picking plastic out of meat. people here are like playground bullies low calliber co employees abound
bad,"Very racist, completely unorganized...quite filthy. Workers were rude and disrespectful and the food at the food court wasn't handled correctly. Cashiers ' rushed around too much."
bad,I didn't enjoy my time there. Management was horrible. I was personally promised things that never happened. I did the job because the pay was decent. The benefits are good. The hours sucked as well.
bad,"if you're looking for a job where seniority is everything, Costco is the place for you. this means be prepared to be stuck in a 90's high school movie set where you're the new comer and have to be pushed around until you prove you're ""good enough"". I overheard many people complaining about us newbies and how we had no right to anything (this meant sitting in the break room if there wasn't enough space for people with more seniority to sit in) and so on. I worked with 5 cashiers 2 of who were nice the other 3 well lets say I was made fun of because I asked for sanitizer after I touched blood from a customers meat (its common sense to not touch fresh produce after you've touched blood) the second one yelled and humiliated me informant of customers every chance she had and the third simply made me put 3 water bottle packs on to belt for her to scan then out them right back in the basket because she did not want to use the hand scanner. This made me throw my back out ad quit on the spot. I have been bullied many times throughout my life but this job was the worst to say the least. after I quit I called about workers comp since I was unable to get out of bed for a bit over a week and never heard back from them. I always heard that Costco was the best place to work at so I gave it a shot I do not know if it was just the location where I got hired or if all locations are that way,"
bad,costco have decent benefits but with working at costco you wouldn't have any personal life and level of the stress working there is very high which almost dosent worth to work there
bad,"Management is lacking, some who are part of management should not have been put into that role. "
bad,Poor management as everyone is constantly trying to argue with one another and not willing to see people as people instead of seeing people as numbers.
bad,There is so much favoritism and if one of the supervisors/ manager for some reason doesn’t like you you are basically screwed. Worse shifts/ schedule seniority doesn’t matter it’s all favoritism drama and gossip between employees it’s horrible and of course if you want to move up and someone up there doesn’t like you you are stuck I thank God I no longer work there
bad,"A typical day at work would be to assist members with finding products and general customer service. This review is for location #345. Hard work at Costco will get you nowhere . They will promote and give the jobs to lazy incompetent people instead. When they post positions in the store they already know who is getting it . A big thing here is seniority, everything is based on it. You can be the best worker but of someone is there longer then you it doesn't matter they will get the position or promotion first. Costco has been cutting hours and basically cutting staff to run the store now and it is a skeleton crew. It is almost impossible to get full time as i knew many people that worked there for over 8 years and were still part time. the pay is great when you top out but as of March 4th they changed the pay scale and being part time it will take about 6-8 years to top out now. The management doesn't have a clue and will stab you in the back when they need to . They never schedule enough people when needed and if you are new you will be ALWAYS closing there till 11pm or midnight. So if you have kids or are married forget your life. "
bad,They care little about people. they think they are better than everyone else because they have a management title. there is a reason why everyone is on stress leave.
bad,"It has been awhile since I worked as a cake decorator/Baker for Costco, but it was one of those job experiences you will never forget, and not in a good way."
bad,".............................  Bad management.  Bad management. Bad management. They act like they are helping you, but the whole time they are really trying to axe you."
bad,New people have to work really hard. While the people who have seniority are slow and rude. People in charge bark orders and just not friendly. Atmosphere is not the best and they barely talk to one another. In other words you end up working with zombies. Sad but true..I wish I had something nice to say..But Had a bad experience with Costco. I had high hopes.
bad,"Instead of fostering a cohesive team, management creates a hostile environment with it's employees. Management believes it is ok to talk down to the employees, say negative comments about employees in small groups, mismanages schedules, and target people to fire they do not like. If you complain it is like painting a target on your back."
bad,"Terrible management horrible scheduling, not nice and not family oriented, always made to work overtime and do jobs that were the managements jobs. do not recommend"
bad,"Terrible culture and environment to work in. "
bad,"I really liked the friends I made there. But the management was terrible. Always had favorite workers, didn't know how to lead a team. They didn't really care about us workers as they said they did and that was proven over the years I worked there."
bad,"The position was lacking job security.  Inconsistent and arbitrary management,  made scheduling unpredictable.  I am seeking stability and a more reliable environment."
bad,"You will not have a life outside of Costco.  Because they pay you well you are expected to devote your life to the company.  There is no balance, either you are all in or you are not."
bad,The management in Airdrie warehouse have their favorites and treat everyone else poorly. You will reach the top if youre best friends with management.
bad,"Worked in call centre.  Avoid this employer if possible.  You are micromanaged to an extent I never dreamed.  Every keystroke, word, movement, scrutinized and recorded.  It's really a dystopian, hellish existence.  Also, the company is presented as a wonderful place that values its employees in recruitment but in practice it's just the opposite."
bad,"For a young person right out of high school this would be a great job to gain experience and move up. Everyone starts at the bottom. But once you've 'proven yourself' help them move up. If your any older or come with a higher education, run. "
bad,"Stressful job with lack of employees, which leaves extra working falling on you. Grumpy customers, management doesn't care about you just about the job being done. Pay is good though"
bad,"On paper, Costco is a great company to work for. However, the amount of BS that employees have to go through is unacceptable.  Only the favourites are treated with respect and promoted to Supervisors. They are allowed to get away with anything, while those who are considered the 'undesirables' are treated worse by managers and supervisors than the actual members. "
bad,Moved on to bigger and better things now. Great for teenagers and college students though. Gives them a sense of responsibility.
bad,"My experience was basically overall negative. At orientation, they stress ""teamwork"". But it isn't until you are in your designated department, that you see how it really is. I won't go on and say it's Costco OVERALL, but I can speak from my experience. "
bad,"As a company they have good values however their management at the Arvada CO location is not good a all.  The managers lack social skills, managerial skills and the women managers treat fellow women coworkers very poorly however they are VERY friendly with the male staff.    Not a positive work environment.  If you like being talked down to, talked at and overall disrespected this is the place for you."
bad,"Staff have no respect for eachother, the senior employees that have been there longer act like they are kings and queens and put newer staff down. They constantly brag about all the seniority they have and talk poorly of others constantly. Toxic work environment"
bad,"Contrary to what I expected, Costco is a very toxic place to work. No matter the location, there is always something that causes all the red flags to go off. I feel as though I am stuck in this place, no matter what position I go to. I realized it all comes from the top. Micromanagement, favouritism, negativity. All of it."
bad,"Do not recommend. Its a place that has favoritism, you work the job of 3 sometimes and never get anything from it. I learned that im capable of learning and mastering many departments."
bad,This used to be a great company to work for. Unless you are in the click you are going nowhere. You can be dumb as a box of rocks but still get promoted as long as you pay for your whse managers golf fees or buy him gifts. Sign of how this company has outgrown its own beliefs or were they ever actually real.
bad,Working at Costco I learned quickly that they are a seniority based company and I didn't agree with how they operate and ultimately resigned due to unhappiness
bad,"After spending half a year as a consultant, I was hired on as a full-time employee at the highest rank possible for my role. Over the next several years as my performance increased, I was given less and less opportunity to strengthen my skillset. Instead I was shoved in a corner and told that, ""trust was hard to earn"" there especially when you were hired from the outside."
bad,"Costco call center pays great with great benefits IF you become full time.  While I was there they were attempting to outsource the jobs with BPOs.  Also, never expect to be promoted unless you are part of the click of friends that are the supervisors and managers that party with each other.  Probably the only company that would hire a high school drop out that has no management experience that will let someone become a supervisor just because they are friends with each other."
bad,"Management was absolutely horrible. Nepotism was through the roof, and learned very little skills throughout working there. The only way to get a promotion was brown nosing or having a family member in management already."
bad,"This company; like many corporations only cares about one thing, money. On orientation you are told that you will be treated like family and that you are cared for and appreciated but that couldn't be further from the truth. You are treated like a machine in a giant factory and are expected to perform an unreasonable amount of work with little thanks or recognition. On day one, managers decide if you are a favorite or an undesirable. If you are an undesirable you are assigned to one of the unfavorable departments in the store and expected to stay there until you prove you belong otherwise. It's a long trek because in one of these departments your hard work goes un-noticed and you are constantly abused by corrupt managers who favor productivity over the well beings of employees. Your hours are constantly shifting the will and benefit as the company as a whole and will go from 40 hours a week to 24 because upper management decided that they weren't making enough money. Example: While working in the parking lot on a 105 degree day, my coworkers and I were reprimanded for having too many water breaks. Keep in mind the work is very physical and there are lots of summer time furniture sales that ""members"" require help with."
bad,Very Bad Management.  So much drama at work place. Managers have favourites at work and try to protect the staff and promote people from same culture and religion.
bad,"Costco pays amazingly good, yes... but they treat you like a dog... get worst if you are immigrant. Just check how many Managers are Immigrants? People are over stress and management are the worst ones... protecting their loved ones and giving the tuff for the rest."
bad,manager did not like it when we y e e t e d products at the customers saying it was dangerous but only 3 children on average got concussions per hour. After many years of experience we brought this number to only 7 per minute. Thank god for universal healthcare.
bad,This has to be by far one of the worst places I've worked for I don't know about the rest of Costco but the department that I worked in was horrible  I was a commercial truck driver for one and a 1/2 years at fleet 960 in mira Loma ca  A place run by tyrants That talk down to you like you're stupid  The way people are treated in  this department is disgraceful and unnecessary  use to call the department Alcatraz   Because it's run like a  Prison Lots of Unnecessary pressure  There's lots of favoritism in this department Especially if you're a Snitch that's the only way to get a good Work schedule or  you have to wait 14 years to get one  Stay away from this place Unless you're a spineless person without any pride
bad,"The employees are great. The pay and benefits are great. Management is very poor. They are allowed to bully and harass the employees and corporate would not resolve the management responsible, instead the would sweep every complaint under the rug."
bad,"I really loved costco, but I feel they do not live by there word, very rude employees, favoritism, they will tell you everything your doing is great keep it up even train you for different positions and then just let you go well they told me it was because of budget cuts. They asked me to put my 2 weeks in my job I had for 4 years biggest mistake of my life!"
bad,"Working with the public on a day to day basis can be a very difficult task in itself. Working at one of the busiest warehouses in North America has it’s challenges and unfortunately the biggest one is management. They let the members do whatever they want, undermining the staff who try to maintain company policy. Eventually you become numb to your purpose as an employee and turn up to work just for the paycheck. :("
bad,"Racism from management and top management. No help the racist atmosphere, management teamed against me. Not even the company human resources helped me out."
bad,"I worked at the Costco in Alhambra. It was always busy and very stressful. I was placed in the kitchen even though I requested to be hired in the warehouse. The hours are not flexible. The employees that have been there longer have seniority so you can't get the shift you want. The supervisors I had in the food department weren't really good at communicating. They yelled at you all day and never gave you praise for the good job you did. I have 10 years experience in food industry so my performance was very good for a fast paced environment. I was actually insulted by the supervisor. She would say things like ""you're not going to make it past the 90 day probation period. "" I would've enjoyed working there if it wasn't for the management."
bad,"Do not work for this company. It is a game of favoritism, if even one manager dislikes you expect bad hours, bad shifts, and lack of consistency with your schedule. If you are not going to school this is a fantastic company to work for, but if you are going to school this is not the place for you. They claim to work well with school schedules, my personal experience had me going well over the scheduling managers head to have them work with my pretty strict school schedule, all because he was unwilling to give me morning shifts or have me work longer hours on the weekends and cut a week day. Once again this is not a friendly environment if you are going to school or working multiple jobs, do not recommend."
bad,very stressful work place. The expect thing and they dont give you time to learn it. On top of that management is not on the same page when it comes down to things
bad,Costco is great if you are single or do not have children as there is no work - life balance. There is no room for employees to participate in weekend sport.
bad,"It was an ok place to work the first 5 years there. Things changed when we got a new store manager. I've never experienced a working condition that comes close to the way employees were treated by the managers. Despite the decent pay, after you have put in many years of service, it was not worth the money to be treated like a worthless scrap of garbage. The conditions were so bad there, at least 50% of the people that had been long term workers, left the place. Since I've left, several more people are gone."
bad,"Costco was the worst place i worked for. Yes, they give you good benefits, pay you decent, but the work place at Costco was horrible filled with rasicm, racist managers."
bad,"stocking product, poor hours, management has poor communication."
bad,"They are one of the better employers in retail...and they know it, so employees are expected to work in a state of...basically full tilt panic, at all times.  Anything less than a frenzy and soaked in sweat isn't acceptable...which isn't sustainable."
bad,They seem entitled don't care for costco fired for getting injured on the job was still dealing with workman's comp when they let me go sorry excuse for a store # 449
bad,"Yes, the pay and benefits are great at Costco but that is about it. I have worked for this company for awhile now and have struggled the entire time. The management is power hungry and will try to assert their dominance from the start. Majority of the time you will have to answer to three or four supervisors and they will all tell you to do different things and then proceed to scold you when you do what you were told by the other supervisor. Also, don't expect to have a good work schedule newbies will get the left over hours while seasoned employees get the best shifts. I would also recommend never getting injured while working for this company. My coworker was injured and this company has tried to push them out by bullying and basically having counseling sessions over trivial minor infractions because they were never given the proper training in the first place. Favortism and nepotism is very prevalent at this company and don't be surprised to be reprimanded for something when a co-worker who is a favorite gets off scott free. Basically, if you kiss butt and work really hard to show you are obedient then this company will reward you, if not be prepared to face unfair treatment."
bad,"While I worked at Costco I did everything I was asked to do. I learned everything and went above and beyond to do my best. My co-workers were okay, though there were a few that were not very nice. The job requirements were pretty straight forward and not difficult. The supervisors are the ones with the problem. If you don't do everything perfectly, or learn something in a timely fashion, do not expect to stay there. The supervisors will ship you out the door for not knowing how to do something the right way, the first day you learn it. They like to pick their favorites, and if your not one of them you will be left in the dust. There are no guaranteed hours and the hours vary from week to week. Just not a great place to work if you are looking for a stable job."
bad,"Nepotism and favoritism abounds.  Not easy to get promoted now.  Promise new employees full time, but makes it difficult for employees to gain full time positions."
bad,"Gday from Australia we have know 3 Costco warehouses, heaps of burnt out overworked employees and are managed by a few NOT all idiots that just got the promotions because either they are american, kiss behinds very well or they have personal relationships outside of work (everyone knows whats going on outside work fellas ;))"
bad,Worked at Canberra and Melbourne.moral is terrible at both locations.management idea of motivation us through threats and intimidation .they promise you the world but rarely comit. 120% staff turnover in the first 12 months speaks for its self
bad,"Started out in assigned department and checked for missing stock and filled missing stock in. Always had to rearrange department to make room for new products which arrived every 4 days. Printed price tags for new products, and made sure department was fully stocked and cleaned before store opened. Management was poor, managers didn't care much about employee's and over abused their position as manager. Co-workers were nice but some really didn't like their jobs which created somewhat of a negative atmosphere. and a high worker turnout. The hardest part of the job was trying to rearrange an entire department with little/no help in under 6 hours. I cant really remember an enjoyable part of the job except when all the managers were not there for a week."
bad,"Typical work day would be spent cleaning up after others that had been poorly trained. Follow-up by attending meetings where executive managers would openly insult and discuss other executive managers. The hardest part of the job was trying to instill a sense of urgency or excellence. The stated moto was we ""Costsize"" everything so with that do not expect, like or allow ""spinkles"". Mediocrity was encouraged. Innovation was discouraged. The most enjoyable part was when it was allowed the opportunity to make a difference was huge."
bad,"Management was awful. I was a seasonal employee and they fired me and rehired me about 3 or 4 times during season. After a certain amount of hours the company is required you to give you a raise, so Costco would cut hours for the regular employees and had they're temporaries work full time. Not only would this cause tension between the new hires and the veterans, but when we would reach the threshold for the raise they would ""fire"" us and have us come back a couple days later. We would fill out paper work and go through orientation as if we were starting from zero."
bad,"Currently I am working at produce area."
bad,"I would rather push carts in 118 degree weather than work in the bakery. the only reason i stayed is because they signed me to work pushing carts. but later never switched me out of bakery. ""You wont be at the bakery for long. We are looking for a replacement"" They tell that to everyone. Dont be the closer in bakery! Its a 2-person job that you have to do by yourself. You have to do everyone's work before yours and then they will complain about you not cleaning. The manager likes to stick his whole arm in the cake mixes, that's why i don't eat anything from there unless it comes to us frozen. Everyone in the warehouse knows not to work there but no one is willing to say/do anything. you get all the ""benefits"" from being a member, you dont have to work here."
bad,"was an employee, loved working there until i hurt both shoulders. couldnt't do my job so i was let go.   but i loved working there benefits r good and co workers are great"
bad,"The location I was at hired an incompetent woman to lead a department she had no understanding of, causing her to give bad reviews and get most of the department let go over own failings."
bad,"The warehouse is ran as if it was a High School. The management teams allows employees to leave their stations, hide out in the car during working hours, and disruptive behavior. When issues are addressed, the managers team together to sweep issues under the rug so that it doesn't reach head quarters instead of acknowledging issues and putting an end to them."
bad,"Typical day at work- Angry customers, insanely busy, language barrier with majority of customers, ignorant management. "
bad,"Too much office politics, if the Pharmacy manager does not like you she will schedule you with less hours and she is only nice to the people she like, some of the staffs were afraid to speak in her presence. During work hours Pharmacy Manager talks continuously non stop, it is very distracting for others, she always gossips of employees to others employees not professional at all and there is no confidentiality and professionalism on her part and there is lot more in regards to her behavior, higher management need to pay more attention to employees well being. Above all, lots of bulling of new staffs, this need to be stopped. I hope higher management will monitor and makes this place a better place to work, I hope some of the current employees will come forward with their concerns."
bad,"Costco pharmacy just started using biometrics to measure pharmacist and technician productivity in a written counseling format.  But the time you are on the phone with doctors, transferring Rx, or speaking to insurance companies or faxing requests to DVM & MD office and patient counseling time is not part of the productivity report! There is clear goals #Rx per # seconds is set for each employee. I believe this action is harmful to all COSTCO members. As customer service is sacrificed or increasing number of Rx per seconds, members will drop costco. Most important is patient safety will go down. Lawsuits will increase and it will eat a big chunk of Costcos profit."
bad,"I was hired in the warehouse as an Ecom employee. The worst job of my life was transferring to the warehouse. They expect you to not talk what so ever if they catch you talking they will tell you that you talk to much. You are not allowed to even look at someone. The management is so poor overworking is 12 hours 6 days during season. They get mad if you would like to go home, even if your sick. They try to keep you in check every movement you make. Worst job ever !!!! I ended up transferring to the store way better. Also everyone in this warehouse knows somebody if you not someone’s aunt cousin etc.. they will treat you poorly and like slaves. They also will make you get down on your hands and knees and scrap the floor if nothing to do. Feels like a prison."
bad,Stressful and overwhelming dealing with lack of teamwork and verbal communication. It a diverse workplace that all employees work hard everyday even tho its  very busy everyone manage to pull through.
bad,This was my first seasonal job ever and at this Costco I worked at pretty much almost but not everyone was so rude to me no one talks to you durning break time the managers minus one person are very rude they talk behind your backs and treat you poorly.
bad,"They do not care about you, they prefere to use you and think they can because they give you nice assurance"
bad,"The Management at my Costco location was inappropriate, unprofessional, and unorganized which followed with most of the other employments and led me to leaving the position."
bad,"a lot of production outside the doors ready to be wrapped up and there only 1 person helping you during the day, i must hurry up and finish everything before 5."
bad,don't get injured at work they'll make you feel like its your fault. The guys are stocking the light stuff while the have me stocking the heaviest items alone and without help.
bad,"Turned me away from working in a grocery store for life. Don't even know if I can return to retail. Made me not want to live in our society, anymore. I no longer enjoy holidays. Thank you Costco."
bad,Job was busy. I served hundreds of customers at Costco. Served the gourmet food with recipes and display presentations. Daily sales quota  and monthly quotas.
bad,"A great company to work for where they take care of the employees. Only problem is the managers create a toxic environment, play favorites, and turn the other cheek when it comes to problems. Always understaffed creating low employee morale. With average pay and average benefits this place would lose employees left and right."
bad,"I started out fresh out of another job which was retail orientated. So I knew how to do cashier work and provide good customer service. I was told by numerous other employees that I was doing great progressing along getting the ropes of the trade. After a few weeks, I asked my manager if I could do a college program to work during the day more instead of closing. In addition to that to file the necessary paperwork for it at the end of my shift. I was granted it, flash forward to the end of my shift I was called the store manager's office where I was told I was fired. No reason why but was told, ""It's performance-based."" I was escorted out of the building with no further explanation."
bad,"At one point Costco was an amazing place to work, but unfortunately that has changed. It’s all about the bottom dollar line and making sure that enough hours are cut while at the same the same time trying to run a business. The warehouse manager was unapproachable and rude. You’d always hear him berating supervisor and managers and then they’d take it out out on their hourlys. Inventory nights involved being there overnight and only being fed ice cream while warehouses around the area get catering. Standards were so high but at the same tome resources weren’t available to meet those standards."
bad,"Costco has no proper training programs, job duties are inconsistent with other locations, policy is followed differently in each location. Upper management doesn’t give proper support with lower management. They allow employees to abuse policies and stress out the people who actually are there to work. A lot of favoritism and segregation in this location"
bad,"Pour y avoir travaillé durant 5 ans, j'étais terriblement déçu de voir comment l'équipe de management gérait les employés. Favoritisme au rendez-vous a coup sûr. Matériel très souvent brisé, aucune considération des employés, la compagnie n'est jamais dans le tord même si elle a causé une injustice. Ils fonctionnent souvent par ""intimidation"" ,se concentre sur une personne jusqu'à sa démission ou jusqu'à la dépression. Honnêtement, je suis heureux d'avoir quitté, je suis tellement mieux dans mon domaine maintenant."
bad,"I was hired as a part time cashier assistance, was given a 40 hour work load with no flexibility on scheduling or days off.  Everything works off a seniority basis.. So if you are at the bottom of the food chain, well good luck... Your best chance at any grace is to make sure you are nice and liked by everyone."
bad,"A typical day at work would be a busy day and understaffed."
bad,"When Costco first opened, they were all about taking care of their employees.  The work scene was a happy environment with very good pay, everybody got along, and quite frankly loved their jobs.  Now that most of the original founders/chairpersons are gone and the corporate chairs are different, this company did a complete 360 and it's all about the numbers now.  Most of the warehouse is miserable and hates it.  Management are a bunch of weasels that will throw ANYBODY under the bus if it means they can fatten their bonuses and/or advance themselves.  I'm talking about the higher-up managers, not the Department Managers - for example the Meat Department, Bakery, Service Deli, Food Court, etc. - are all pretty cool for the most part.  But the ""big"" managers are all greedy with no compassion for anyone unless it benefits them.  For employees who have been with Costco for so long, it's sad because we are sort of trapped now because after years and years of raises it's hard to leave and go find something comparable without literally cutting our income in half.  10 years ago I would've recommended Costco to anyone.  Nowadays it's just a money hungry corporate greed machine with conniving managers."
bad,its a great place to work fun friendly environment hard work pays off along with good people makes work enjoyable to be here not really a place to work if you dont want to run like crazy
bad,"As mentioned above a great place to shop not to work. If somebody currently works there that does not like you then you will not last. Best suggestion shop, do NOT work there."
bad,"A typical day as a stocker started at 5 AM. Upon reaching the warehouse I was guided by my manager to perform tasks such as unwrapping merchandise and placing them in their respective slots. During these tasks, attention to detail was given to the placement of the product and rearranging other merchandise to increase visual appeal. One 15 minute coffee break was allowed. The difficulty of the task varied with each day as some days included all heavy items where others included a mix of both. Co-Workers were helpful people and everyone assisted each other when necessary."
bad,"para  empesar  cuando  entre,  mis  compañeros  eran  buena onda al recibirte, me  capacitaron bien, si  no entendía  me  volvían a  explicar,  aprendí  a  trabajar en equipo, apoyarnos si  se  nos  dificultaba algo, ya  después  el  trabajo era  muy pesado, el dueño discriminaba mucho, y es muy prepotente."
bad,Former Work employees are amazing and the Money is a bonus but the mangement are not.
bad,"Management had no regards to anyones feelings, and couldn't see that a new worked takes time to get good at what they have to do. Wouldn't recommend working in the Service Deli at Costco, was very stressful due to management always on you about everything."
bad,Was told I was getting a part time job then I was told it's seasonal after I quit my full-time thinking I have a part-time job while I can find a full time to have 2 jobs
bad,never was a safe work environment and management didn’t particularly value the well-being of their employees. super busy location so they were always a mess
bad,"Title sums most of it up. I was part of an opening team and was among the first employees the new store would have. We were given strict rules about sanitation and procedures to follow, then shipped off to other warehouses to be trained. "
bad,"The company draws you in with the good starting pay, the benefits and the outline for salary upgrades, but the positives end there. The atmosphere of this workplace is very high school - if you're one of the chosen favorites you can get away with anything and everything and advance without so much as trying, but if you aren't on that very short list you cannot advance nor will you get recognized for your work. They will change your schedule without notifying you and penalize you for not knowing, and if you are unable to pay yourself for time off, then you cannot take time off. There is no unpaid time off available, save for a few times out of the year when you have to pre-schedule it and get it approved. That goes for being sick and emergencies as well. There is also no such thing as part time at this establishment, as part time for them is working an average of 37.5 hours a week or even upward of 40, but without the benefits of being full-time. The only way to get an actual part time shift of working 20 or so hours a week is if you're in school.  And that doesn't include being berated and belittled by members over the phone or email all day long. If you're only into the job for the pay, the by all means feel free to accept, but be prepared to be miserable."
bad,"There needs to be more upper management watching our managers. There is a manager who is inappropriate with female staff and customers, if you try to talk to him about an actual work issue, he just yells at you. He needs to be supervised better because this type of behaviour ruins the workplace for everyone. Anything goes at Costco, but the pay is good. I will say I have noticed everybody gains weight after working at Costco for a long time, there’s so much bad food to buy and the only food to buy on break is fast food."
bad,"Great job but definitely not a good career!"
bad,"This company fully sxxx. They only employ someone who is their friend or family member. "
bad,"Good company but mostly part time jobs,i needed full time but not available wont provide any materials i.e blades, clothing, massive company on a budget"
bad,Horrible experience working their and would never return.One of the toughest jobs I've ever had. I was a full time student working in a warehouse at 4 am slaving while managers barked order to move faster and no care for moral of the employees. F awful!
bad,"These are very few good things to say about Costco loss prevention. The department was just sort of tacked on and is under funded, under trained, and under motivated."
bad,"I worked as a stocker in an area where I had no business being placed in as I was not big enough to lift or carry items that needed restocking.  I found the training to be seriously lacking and management was not overly helpful when dealing with a work related injury. Co-workers were largely unfriendly and in some cases very rude during the 4:45am-9:45am shift. That being said, the hours were plentiful and management was most helpful in accommodating working parents.  Pay was slightly better than other companies with similar job positions."
bad,"Worked for Costco for 6 months had 12 pay checks only 3 were right they have a bad week u have a bad pay check, other stores maybe ok but stay away from one in Stevenage management are nice job is easy enough but bottom line left with 2 years worth of debt because of them considering legal action AVOID!"
bad,For the most part people only work there if they are a friend or relative of someone else that works there and this causes management to play a blind eye towards insubordination and bad working habits and therefore creates a toxic work environment.
bad,Was a perfect place for me to learn sales skills. Developed skills to deal with the members and provide customer services. Worked with a team and adapted the working environment.
bad,"My day to day included being reprimanded for making other employees look bad as I did my job better than them. They expect you to keep up minimum quotas all over the warehouse, however if you are actively trying to meet them and fall 1 or 2 short you are written up or talked to. Others who fall entirely short or only gain one or two out of the 15 tasks necessary are promoted and praised as ideal workers. Costco is not the place to work if you are a hard working individual who takes pride in their work; however if you are someone who hates work and everything associated, Costco is the perfect place to get ahead doing the bare minimum"
bad,"Mainly the co workers were the problem. A bunch of fake people. Too many people who thought they were “all that” or “look at me”. "
bad,Costco is ok but I had a horrible experience working for them in which I felt lied to and used.  I quit pretty disheartened with the company.  I was very disappointed that during the interview I was told one thing but then when I was hired it became something entirely.
bad,"Costco is a good place to work if you have nothing else going for you, or if you simply need money to get by. When you are going to school and working for Costco, it makes it really difficult to focus on your schooling."
bad,Managers have no idea what they are doing. 16 managers and employees left for stress leave because of general managers. dont expect to have a life outside of work. customers treat you like garbage.
bad,"hard job at the food court, unacceptable management, too strict on closing, made me feel silly, inflexible, impossible to get days off in advance, and fired me for being sick."
bad,"Stocking maintenance closet , break room . Cleaning restrooms , office,break room . Prep floor scrubbers and clean warehouse floors, pressure wash entrance ,customer service .."
bad,"It had poor management, they weren't professional, they were not being respectful and when I explain something to them something goes wrong and my holiday was already booked from the start of the interview and training and they would not give me the holiday off even though I told them way in advance."
bad,"I have been working at Costco for over 5 years, and the longer I work here, the more I dislike it. It's a step above shoprite as far as the pay and benefits go, but i would never recommend to make this place a career to anyone. In this company, it doesn't matter how hard you work, but more of who you are sucking up to. The worst part about this place is the management. They talk down to their employees, and make the employee feel horrible. It's bad when all my co-workers talk everyday how much they can't stand the place. My warehouse is union, but they find every way possible to not follow the guidelines . They make an excuse up to work around it and get away with it . They couldn't pay me enough to work here forever! A company that points out only the bad to the employees, never compliments! Don't get stuck here!"
bad,"Costco on a whole is a good company for customers but not staff."
bad,The staff was very helpful and encouraging. The management team was not. They often made comments about my hair and me being African American it is natural and often stayed in its natural state and that was a problem a majority of the time. Along with the color of my hair when there were other individuals with red or burgundy hair as well. Also comment about my weight were made and things of that nature all from management the people who initially hired me. It was a very hard and uncomfortable work environment.
bad,You can be number one in fast scanning merchandise as a cashier make numbers of sales to upgrade membership have great customer services and work in a fast pace and still they hire the one that is related to someone in a different warehouse manager family member because they aren’t allowed to work in the same warehouse so they rotate managers at different Costco locations and everyone knows everyone there because they have a relative in a different warehouse. Favoritism is horrible there.
bad,Pésimo ambiente de trabajo y pésima filosofía  ya que el cliente siempre es primero y te pueden faltar al respeto por el simple hecho de tener una membresía.
bad,"Worked here for 6 years and watched the management discriminate, terminate and be terrible to very hard working people, and then they did the same because the GM was a bad hearted person and if you did not agree with him he would set you up and get you fired"
bad,Will not recommend this to woman at all or to anyone who has masters degree and higher. You have to be in click with the old timers to get protected from your position. Bias evaluation based on personal dislike.
bad,Costco wholesale is a high stress / high energy environment I wouldn't wish on anyone. Standing for six hours cooking for low wages is not my idea of enjoyment.
bad,Costco promotes from within.  This means that virtually all of their managers have very poor supervisory skills because they have no training and little formal education.  Most of their jobs are temporary too.  They just don't tell their employees.  Only about 30% are permanent and even many of those employees mysteriously disappear.
bad,They waste your time spending hours filling out applications and when you go to the store you applied to they tell you they stopped hiring in October. Very unprofessional to waste peoples' time who are trying to find a job by continuing to advertise you are hiring when you are not.
bad,"I no have experience for work in Costco put I m hard work I like working in Costco because Always Busy and very good place for work "
bad,"Terrible leaders"
bad,"Costco is a place where you will meet a bunch of two-faced rats that work there. They will smile to your face but talk behind your back right as you walk pass. 9 years working there and I kept to myself, but even then they will find ways to get rid of you IF they don't like you"
bad,We were able to eat samples while on our lunch break. Other than that we really had no extra's from the company but a 401 K plan. They did add on some earned sick pay because of Oregon law.
bad,I find working at Costco extremely stressful. Higher management promotes employees to better positions through unfair preference treatment. There is no equal opportunity.
bad,"environment is cold, and the chicken room was hot, the oven burns our skin with steam when it opens, and morning staff were difficult to work with. supervisor was abusive."
bad,"Duties include straightening/ stocking merchandise for the store to open for business, also loading and staging  Delivery trucks to go on their routes."
bad,I enjoyed working at Costco. The hours were flexiable and there was room for growth in the company. The job was a seasonal job which required me to have to be laid off when the season was up.
bad,Seasonal staff is only asked to stay on with the company if they are willing to do remedial tasks.  Opportunities are only afforded to those with years of employment not by merit or quality of work/experience.
bad,"Fast paced pharmacy , constantly short staffed. New comers so unwelcome. High work pressure, bossy pharmacy techs, unfriendly, always passing snarky remarks. Very unprofessional in a professional job site. :)"
bad,"Good benefits and good pay for the level of work."
bad,"Most of the time it was your basic restaurant atmosphere, but late night on the weekends there were a lot of fights."
bad,No benefits for those who work in the call center. A lot of work but not enough care for the employees.
bad,It has it days where you love it and days where you are ready to find a new job.
bad,"This corporation relies on constant harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and threatening to employees to achieve their productivity goals ."
bad,"I really enjoyed working for costcos pharmacy, Sundays off, and the pharmacy didnt open until 10....I did not at all like the heavy lifting aspect as to where the pharmacy had to do the stocking of the aisles in front of the pharmacy selling vitamins and such....it is not easy for a tiny girl to lift heavy costco stuff. Also, they had absolutely nothing in their code of conduct about not allowing facial piercings...except if you worked in food...which i did not. They HIRED me with my nose stud and i told them about it in my interview and they were okay with it. but because me and the pharmacy manager did not get along because i continued to wear a clear nose ring after she told me to take my metal one out, on my 3 months probationary review they let me go.....i was also let go because of the amount of days that i missed during my probationary period.....i missed 4 days out of 3 months, all excused with doctor notes because i was struggling with multiple kidney stones at the time....i was informed that even with signed doctor notes from the emergency room that they were not able to over look that. So overall, my specific costco in brandywine md  is terrible but i know that they are a great place to work have great benefits and pay and i also had a problem with adhearing to the dress code ! they would not allow me to wear black dress pants...had to be jeans and i do not like wearing jeans...lol...anyways that is all,."
bad,"Employees are general pleasant to work with. For this type pf work the benefits are very good. Unfortunately, pay raise is scheduled and is not based on performance."
bad,Great place to work until you get hurt on the job. Compensation was nothing. I lost a year of my life and a life time of great wages. After surgery I was forced to quit or go back to work in pain.
bad,"Very bad experience working there, I felt like I was watched by the wardens at all times not a good experience at all.  Don't regret leaving that place never would want to work there again"
bad,"If you don't plan to work in retail for more then five years save your time and energy and work for walmart. They don't care about employees, they don't care about seniority, and hours are always capped at 25."
bad,hardest part of of the day is dealing with all the supervisors and managers. some managers and supervisors need to gain manners on how to speak to their employees to get a task done.
bad,I was treated rudely and a supervisor did absolutely nothing to resolve conflict and was struggling at doing her own job. The supervisor was very busy so instead of taking a deep breath and do her job she shued me away with you guys are worst then my kids implying i was her child in a argument when actually all i did wrong was my job and now looking back i should of went to my store manager and made a complaint proper to the way it should of been done. I did not and took this personal leaving the job on my own.
bad,"The Edison Costco is a disaster. They hire too many seasonal employees. They cut hours every single day, and complain when it gets busy, since they're short staffed. The employees make fun of the members for spending money just to buy stuff. Prices are actually marked up. Most of the products are not cheap in any sense. I had to wait almost a month to get a check. The supervisors and managers have terrible organizational skills. They stand around most of the day and check hours. There will be multiple supervisors on a shift when only 2 are needed, so they cut the everyone else's hours. Favoritism is used. If an employee doesn't brown nose then... Well you get the gist. Just a bad place to work. Not all Costco's mind you. Just the Edison Costco"
bad,"Unorganized, had a manager tell me I was on two different schedules. Won't own up to mistakes, overall very unpleasant experience. They did not train me like they said they would in the video/interview"
bad,"Overworked and underpaid"
bad,Title says it all. If you don't mind the employees being mean and rushing you even though you're doing your best this is the job for you. Everyday I would dread going in because of the employees in the food court.
bad,"A typical day of work is very fast pace with no down time, horribly managed break periods and management demanding perfection and adding pressure to employees with every transaction. 25 cent raises are given every 1000 hours worked. 2 Sick hours are given every 40 hours worked. Management is  acquired by applying for the position opening not by who is the most qualified for the position. After a brief interview done by management they will pick who they believe will the best job. Which if hired will explain a lot about how the managers got to the place they are."
bad,"I found that it was the people that were there the longest that were very unhappy."
bad,They run you down tell you quit and have no time to hear about your family. They take advantage of people since they can just hire anyone else in a matter of days.
bad,"We would set up for food samplings, clean area for customers. we would have a half hour break and be on our feet for 7.5 hours. it was an alright place in the beginning. But as time went on management was not always the greatest. their scheduling was never accurate, so  if you thought you had a day off they would actually change the schedule on staff with out your knowledge. And everybody was a boss."
bad,"Manger didn't work with us on doing her job, she didn't make sure we had a enough things to work with. We work so hard and didn't get the credit we deserve or the pay we deserve."
bad,"Costco offered very little. The pay was very low, no chance for full time positions which meant no benefits. My co workers were nasty and uncooperative."
bad,very good pay managers not so great very snappy and not family orirented
bad,"I worked for Costco for a little less than three months. I did not like the fact that the pharmacy manager would yell and have double standards. He, and the other pharmacists, were allowed to have soda and coffee in front of them while it was not allowed for the other employees. On top of all this, my ""training"" consisted of me going to each station for 2 hours. I was supposed to pick up everything in those two hours and I was not given any other opportunities for training. I complained about these issues and others to the store assistant manager and two days later I was being let go for ""Unacceptable Work Performance"". When I asked for an investigation it was refused and there was nothing I could do, according to the assistant manager."
bad,"I worked at Costco for the Christmas season, and honestly it was horrible. I was a front end packer and it was really hard work. I also spent hours outside in the dark in the pouring rain collecting carts. Would come back inside soaked to the bone. Working hear was like 20 grit sandpaper on my mental health. 10/10 not a good time."
bad,"Many of my coworkers were not happy with the working conditions, but were too afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. Some managers were very condescending and didn't treat everyone equally. I was asked by coworkers to contact corporate after I quit in order to report the poor management in this location."
bad,"Very poor management in optical and upper management rudely dismissed concerns when spoken to. I was made to work alone after very minimal training. Direct supervisor played favoritism, poor training."
bad,Costco hires 10 new hires every week and burns through them quickly and frivolously. I was let go 6 days before I reached my 90 day review and would have become an employee with benefits because I “did not pass probation” at the end of my 8 hr shift with the same managers I had worked with all day.
bad,"If you’re young and want a career in retail, this place may be for you, but be prepared for workplace politics.  Some managers are rude and unprofessional, some are extremely lazy, and some cashiers are mean and treat other employees like second class citizens, they did give new employees a heads up about their mean cashiers in orientation.  Stay away from the clothing dept. If you're unlucky and have to work in clothing with”it” you will know what I mean.  Treats new employees very poorly and as soon as they turn their back,  talks smack about them and tries to get everyone else to hate that person. Sad part is, there’s a history of complaints yet they still keep “it” and if you’re not Mexican and part of the circle, forget about it. On the flip side, there were a lot of good/ friendly employees too.  Some depts. are a lot more physical and demanding, and you better be prepared to be their work horse, you will be working hard and as fast as you can your entire shift. Still love shopping there, but this place is nothing special."
bad,In a typical day is fast paced and mentally stressful due to the amount of members coming and going and depending on what their needs are wither getting a membership or making a return or just wanting to complain for different reasons. you need to be mentally strong to be in that department.
bad,"I worked there for 3 years and when I needed them to be a reference for a future employer, they refused. They only wanted to confirm that I worked from 2014-2017. Even though I was a great employee and did everything right, they refused."
bad,"The Management at the COSTCO in Pewaukee, Wisconsin  showed a bias against workers above 30 yrs old. I was warned about this from other workers at this location when I started working there."
bad,"Management picks favorites and treats everyone outside that sphere is treated as expendable."
bad,"Good pay but stressful job, customers that shop there are very rude, this job does take a toll on your body with heavy lifting, management is very unorganized"
bad,"Busy day, long lines. People not working efficiently enough. Very repetitive work. Missed breaks due to work. Better management needed. More opportunities needed for career development."
bad,"Costco management were bullies and easily influenced by employee's opinions of other employees. Most of them were not friendly to deal with and unapproachable.  Costco brags about its high paying jobs, however, starting pay is $11 per hour and it takes approximately  5 to 7 years to reach the maximum pay. Raises are based on work hours accumulated, which is constantly being extended and Costco hires new employees part-time to begin with. It's been a while since I've worked there but my friends there say nothing has changed."
bad,Not much room for advancement but a good company name to have on your resume. the management is not very friendly but most of the employees were nice. The seasonal work is cool.
bad,"I was a seasonal worker & I quit after a month. Coworkers are rude, management is okay. Not flexible with shifts at all, they will put you to work 9hours right after your class ends & schedule you late night til 11pm which in my case left no time for homework.  Not very considerate towards your availability. Most of the new hires quit within a month because of the same exact problem. They will have you all over doing all kinds of jobs, not in one specific department. They will work you hard. Wouldn’t recommend for a college or high school student."
bad,Costco has to hire a certain number of local residents. To do this they hire seasonal. They let you go just before benefits begin and hire new seasonals. It doesn't matter how much cross training you do in other departments. The store manager will keep his buddies rather than the hard workers.
bad,"I trained all new employee's in all aspects of that job description. I opened up the Huntington Beach Costco and trained all their staff in Membership and other areas of the store. I worked in the office and completed my task's along with completing other employee's work as well. I opened and closed the store which includes: cleaning dusting, moping, returning go-backs, and helping other departments in the store complete their tasks ."
bad,"Non stop, hard work in a hot environment with no air conditioning."
bad,"I believe this Costco to be the Adult's version of high school. The Employees and management were petty and deceptive. Everyone was in everyone else business from comments to one's clothes to their habits and personal life. The work it's self was overwhelming and expected to be done to perfection with hardly any staff by an unreasonable time. I personally was expected to stock, face and clean an entire third of the store by myself in 4 hours."
bad,"I worked in the sampling department, and it wasn't the best experience the breaks were awful but it was an easy job it doesn't require a lot of work but it is eight hours of standing with just one break."
bad,"My review summary pretty much speaks for itself. Especially those to a new field like I was. I was brand new to the stock part of retail. I was at 81 days on probation and then was fired with just a little over a week to go. I don't know what they expect from PEOPLE, I gave it my all. If you want so called satisfactory work from each individual then I suggest hiring robots or fictitious super heroes. Because being new to something that you have never done before and be booted before given the chance to REALLY thrive is ridiculous. We aren't robots, or super heroes. We're simply human and we do the best we can."
bad,"L'environnement de travail est vraiment peu professionnelle, les gens qui sont charger de la direction vont parfois pousser des gens à démissionner en rendant leur vie au travail extrêmement difficile à supporter."
bad,"Terrible place to work. Terrible pay, terrible management. Such a joke. Pretty much a union yet...none of the benefits that come with being part of a union. Your current knowledge and worth don't matter. But hey, stick it out long enough and you too can become Costco Management - no formal training required!! Just hang out long enough!! "
bad,"Horrible place to work, no respect as an employee, and constantly having to rush to get things done because of unorganized managers. I for example was 6 days away from 90 day period ending when they laid me off."
bad,"New management is restrictive and not people orientated. They environment is very clicky, and if you are not part of the ""in crowd"" things  dont go well for you."
bad,"This place is surrounded by favoritism. Like every other job, but at Costco it’s bad. If they don’t like you will be stuck at one spot everyday. I never felt so stressed out  at a job until i started working here. The only good part is the benefits other than that, my mental health is much more important than working for Costco. I’m so glad I left, after I left I feel a piece of mind."
bad,"Was told be full time and after 2 months working with them cut everyones hours to half about 20 a week ??"
bad,"Hardest part of job is listening to employees and managers talked horrible about everyone behind their backs, just drama filled environment that management would encourage. Pretty disgusting and embarrassing behavior from adults. This is hard place to work if your a decent person."
bad,"Applied as  cashier, was put on cart duty."
bad,rampant favoritism horrible leadership total lack of concern for employees needs or issues store culture and moral is very low do to supervisors and management treament of staff they make it very clear that you are insugnifficant and expendable no matter how hard you work or how good your customer service is or how well you work and get along with others
bad,"Culture was friendly, but very micromanaged. Injured due to poor working conditions due to under staffing and refusal to send help. Had enough staff to manage, but wouldn't schedule them. then fired for ""negligence"". Non flexible with hours and time request off. Felt like  ""school-ish"" with their time punches."
bad,"Really hard to stay happy working at Costco. The management don't appreciate the hard working employees and enable the ones that don't work hard. People are encouraged to do the wrong things in order to move up in the company. Managers are really inhuman, dont ask or care much about their employees. Management display their favourites any chance they get. They don't help to encourage students to work and go to school fulltime. The members are allowed to yell at speak to employees anyway they feel because of the fee for their cards. Its a really toxic place to work."
bad,".I would arrive at work and prepare for the truck"
bad,"I didn't expect such a brutally busy low paying job. Management did not make good on promises. I was treated as if I was slacking off if I had a moment to catch my breath. Some customers were very nice-"
bad,Costco Travel is disappointing. It is confusing to move up in the company. If the people who were buying the vacation packages knew what it was like there they would not give us their money. I hope that they have grown and improved as a company since my employment.
bad,Co-workers were rude Training was terrible. You will get good pay and good hours. But the co workers were so unhelpful and rude to you if you did not know how to do something right away.
bad,"The culture is poor, the management is poor, if you have any education do not apply because it wont be appreciated. "
bad,"fast paced , baking bread  danish , cakes  ,wrapping  product,  ,  setting up for next day bake . great crew to work with . learned  how much i vauled my job i was dedicade to my wor"
bad,"The job itself is not difficult. But the company runs based on seniority, and you get no say in what schedule you work. Working a swing shift with no option in doing so creates a poor work/life balance and makes going into work less than enjoyable. Their policies on being late/sick/vacation time seem a little unrealistic and unforgiving for such a large company. Overall, I would not recommend working here unless you don't mind being on the bottom of the totem pole and being micromanaged all the time by multiple supervisors and feeling like you always need to be watching your back."
bad,"Corporate employees are expected to work 5 days a week. There is no option for 4-10 hour shifts etc. There is a vacation ""blackout period"" where employees are not allowed to take vacation time from October to January.This is all in an attempt to make it fair to warehouse staff that works with those same stipulations. They consider it part of the culture. Management positions are dictated largely by seniority and at Costco that likely means at least 20 years or more. For a parking spot that is reserved, that could be as many as 25 years for a good one."
bad,"you need to work fast and be able to have less than 24 hour notice with change of shift."
bad,Poor wages and hours. Slim chance for advancement. Customer can be a challenge as no one enjoys having their purchases reviewed as they leave the store.
bad,"i quit because of racism treating, if you are visible minority costco is not good place fit you in. there is double standard for you and majority and there is not enough training too"
bad,"Costco is a very stressful place to work, the managers are usually rude (not all..) and will always be on your back instead of helping you become better they make you feel worse."
bad,Costco is a great place to work if you want retail. The management is not great at all. There is no room for advancement and the work culture is more numbers driven. The store manager operates as a dictator and destroys the morale of everyone who opposes their authority respectively.
bad,Have been a part time employee for two years. I liked the variety of different duties but management is childish and unskilled. Blue collar pseudo-professionals. The pay raises are based on hours worked so when you never get full time it takes forever to make decent money.
bad,The one I worked for wasn't that bad but the managers were horrible. If you are not full time employee managers could careless about you.
bad,"Too many strong personalities in a small working area, very unorganized, very stressful, schedule would change constantly, sometimes without notice, other times when I would approach my manager regarding time off for school, she would just bully me into taking more shifts! A few of my co-workers were awesome, nice people, but the rest, well, I'll just say I'm happy they're not my co-workers anymore."
bad,It is a fast worker environment. Sometimes it's a fun job sites.
bad,"If you have a great manager, it really makes a difference. I did not get so lucky. Good company for a beginner, straight out of high school but not the best move for someone with a family."
bad,Very fast paced. Hard to progress if you're face doesn't fit. Very good pay increases the longer you work for them the higher the pay increases. All in all if your happy to work shifts and change without notice you will do well
bad,This job as cashier/front end assistant is very fast paced and you are not guaranteed a packer. If you do not have a packer they expect you to be the cashier and the packer and still meet efficiency goals. Hard on the hands/wrists/back etc. Management was sometimes rude and unorganized. Breaks are not on time. Management is like a cult and they only follow company rules when convenient to them. Very stressful for a minimum wage job.
bad,"Costco as a company is a good fit for young, inexperiencened workers willing to put in the time for their desired position.  Warehouse management has little HR skills and only focus is on bottom line, not providing a positive work culture."
bad,"A persons ability to do consistent hard work doesn't indicate an opportunity for promotion or growth. The majority of the management had certain favorite staff. It didn't matter if the favorites actually worked hard or not at all. "
bad,The company itself is very good and built on strong values..  upon starting working there The experience I had was very well received in orientation the build-up was great would it came to the orientation videos and the management's energyBut when I started working there I have realized that it was all a front it was chaotic environment with no strong leadership skills everyone was not allowed to be an independent thinker and used their own abilities to solve problems there was no individual thought when a simple question was asked everybody turned her head towards the upper management due to retaliation
bad,From bad people being in charge to cio no one has heard from. Costco likes to say they promote from with in but it's only in a nepetistic way. Terrible people get put in charge of things they know nothing about.
bad,Costco is very stressful. They are on budget cuts. Always running short handed. All ways busy.Always hard on body  Lifting all shift long. Over worked & Under paid
bad,"People have worked at costco for 4 or more years...to finally get full time hours. They coop you like chickens...you work 3 months or less...depending on when you started. Then they pick who they want for which deoartment..for ex:.produce.freezer.textiles etc."
bad,"Always looking over your shoulder to see who is trying to stab you in the back"
bad,"The managers who hired me gave me incorrect information therefore I made my career decision based on false info. The environment was non-inclusive if you weren't family, nepotism was alive and well at Gypsum Costco. Training was nonexistent and managements go to response for any issue brought to their attention was either ""that's not my job"" or ""what do you expect me to do"". Unbelievable! From the start the ""core employees"" were combative and rude.  The company itself provided great medical,dental, vision and retirement benefits. Not all managers at the Gypsum whs fit into previous group, there were some that tried to help where they could and their efforts were very appreciated by all who received their help."
bad,"They don’t care about your personal life. Every time I would request a day off to go to an appointment for myself and or my kids, they would disapprove the request day off and make me call in. And they are really strict on attendance so when I called in, I would get an “occurrence” which leads to getting a “counseling notice” which is basically like a write up. And when you get 2 write ups within a year. You can get terminated. Also, everyone gets sick a few times a year so I would go to work even when I’m not feeling good just so I won’t get written up. You would think if you went to work and showed up and they seen how sick you are, it would be fine to go home early right? No, you will still get in trouble."
bad,"Mostly everything is fine until their is something that you must take care of, then they say they'll work with you but they don't, they will simply say yeah your ok. Then when you come back to work you get in trouble and then they blame corporate .Even if you have a doctors note."
bad,Terrible experience. Terrible nepitism in the company. Terrible pay. Demanding hours. bad managers. Bad hours. they cared more abot money then their employees.
bad,"Once you complete training and doing your job you can expect to do that job for over a year or more. there is no advancement until you get seniority, You will be expected to work a very manual job and maybe get 26 - 30 hours you will not get more since they always say they need to keep labor costs down."
bad,"Under management's watch, I have been subject to slander, bullying, & harassment on a near-daily basis for 8 years. Rather than addressing these problems, my employer is trying to manage me out by cutting my pay by 2/5ths."
bad,"Currrently working here and I’m only having this job for the money. I’m not looking to stay here long term at all. Working in this place has its down fall. Work hours aren’t consistent. They complain that they need to cut down on hours yet in the shop they transferred another supervisor from another location and he’s full time as well as the other two supervisors and the manager. Meanwhile the regular employees have to suffer getting less than 40 hours a week. The pay rate for each department varies. In the tire center it’s 16 and hour and for supervisors it’s somewhere near 25 something. The workers who fetch the carts gets paid more than we do so as the deli department. If you have no bills and very little bills this a great place to save up your money but if you have bills to pay this isn’t a place to work at. Pay is bi-weekly. Love working in the tire shop because the workers are great, friendly and funny. Management is okay but not the greatest."
bad,"The work required was not only not specified in the interview but also when requested to work shift work in a rotation, the rotation aspect was not respected."
bad,"I have worked for this company for years. They pay well and give good benefits. But the problem is some of the long term employees are not mentally stable. Coming to work every day and working with these people, you never know what would happen next. Sometimes managers would try to stir the pot against employees that are doing nothing wrong. There is way too much drama, in my opinion, to stay at a company like this for the rest of my life. Not a lot of career advacement unless you suck up to management. Rewards were not  based on actual work done or having a good ethic. People that didnt deserve praise were given praise. Meanwhile the ones who mind their own business get treated awful. The only way out of this cycle is to get a degree and move on. Will not recommend when I leave."
bad,"costco was an ok place to work. It was to political for me though. I didn't kiss anyones rear and just went in and worked my tail off. Im a little disgruntled because i haven't heard from them, i was hired on seasonal but i thought i performed so we'll i would be hired on immediately but not the case."
bad,Menial work for decent pay. It will be years before you earn a full-time  position. Plan on a 25-hour work week. Micro-managing is excessive. Seniority-based company.
bad,"Costco is a good place to work if you are part of the chosen people or if you are a robot that does every thing with out thinking,the rules only apply to certain people and it is used against you if you are not liked."
bad,"Was a good place to work. However, management was hard to get along with. Management would demand things and did not want to take suggestions from anyone. Did not take experience in specific area into consideration when applying. I applied for one position and was placed in a different one due to not having worked for the company before, even though the position that I applied for was still available. After working for 90 days I was asked to resign due to three write ups that I didn't and was not told were write ups at the time."
bad,"As a maintenance worker, it is my job to clean any spills, leaks, etc.. However, at one point there was water leaking into an electrical room with low-and very live- wires. A plumber came out and stated that he would have to close off the womens restroom for a few hours, to which the manger stated that she would rather him come back after hours, and that I would just scrape the water out of the room. Every 15 minutes I would enter that room to scrape out 1.5 inches of water, essentially risking my life as some of the wire would enter the water."
bad,"Administración que no toma en cuenta tus aptitudes para ofrecer puestos."
bad,"I worked for Costco for over 3 years and was promoted twice in that time. However, I have to be truly honest about the terrible culture of this stone aged industrial revolution holdover of a company. They vastly under pay their employees with zero concern for cost of living. Do not expect to get a manager or supervisor position unless you play golf with management on weekends or are a complete brown nose....or your relative is a VP. In one area of the company in particular there are at least 7 supervisors that I know of who have AVP or VP parents in the same area. Conflict of interest much? Costco lures you in with a promise of a great culture and great benefits. Its a lie. It is a good place to start your career and get some experience under your belt, but all the real talent eventually moves on unless their family members are in high up positions to help them advance their career. "
bad,"A difficult place to work in after the holiday seasons are over."
bad,"The only reason I took the job was for the prominse of full time. Had I known the hourly rate was 9.50 I would have stayed at my part time job making 14/hr. "
bad,"The hardest part about working for costco is standing on cement floors ,the fast pace and management that don't have the skills to manage. The best part is the pay and benefits."
bad,"bad management, they didn't put in enough time to teach new hires everything and expected perfection without the proper training. So whatever wrong you do it on you not them even though it could have been prevented with proper training."
bad,not as great as its made to sound. lack of training and poor scheduling. expected to meet deadlines with in minutes of being asked to do tasks
bad,i worked for costco for 10 months. got a good review. never late no conseling notice but i still got laid off with no pay because i could not lift over 15 lbs
bad,The word 'yes' will be the only word in in your vocabulary while you're on the clock. Get ready to feel used and abused on a daily basis from those above.
bad,"A typical day includes coming in and getting boxes of raw chicken to skewer and put in the oven.  Depending on the day you could do 200-500 chickens and depending on how long you work.  You're expected to do a batch of 30 in under 10 minutes each.  In between your times of skewering chickens, you help with prep work aka making the dishes normally provided at the Costco Deli (for example chicken alfredo, sandwich platters, quinoa salad etc)"
bad,Not much room for growth no sick time. I work for an independent vendor inside of Costco though so there is a difference. I wish that the company
bad,if you want to be stabbed in the back work here got set up by management and upper management would not talk with me
bad,"My co-workers were the only positive part of this place.  One or two supervisors were decent, but management was a complete nightmare.  There was no need to have a brain, just mindlessly run around like a robot on high speed and make sure you lick the right boots.  Favoritism was rampant, and while I have never experienced hazing or anything like it, I figure it must be a lot like this particular Costco location."
bad,"Typical Day: They had me perform different duties everyday from cashier, re-stock and front/exit doors. They always made sure you were busy."
bad,lots of turn over and they always make the younger generation work the late shifts and weekends 
bad,"A lot of favoritism, supervisors having sex with employees, got hit on by supervisors on a daily, management are rude and not helpful when you need to be home with family. Its like being in high school all over again. I would not recommend working here to anyone."
bad,Receving Clerk
bad,"Get set up with my napkins, tray, food products, and samples on the tray for the customers to try."
bad,I hated it. Even though I had a college degree and 5 years with the company they refused to promote me as a supervisor. Pay Scale is ok but the whole time you're getting chewed out to work harder or you are doing something wrong. The economy is hard now-a-days and I feel bad for the people stuck with this job that has horrible management.
bad,"not fun, very tedious. day to day was boring and I did not enjoy working there. the manager was not nice and the work was unpleasant in my case. not to say it wouldn't be suitable for someone else"
bad,Management system did not care about its employees and over worked us in the food court with not enough employees . But they did give good pay and benefits.
bad,"Some (most) of the senior employees were great to work with and very supportive. Others were condescending and rude. Frequently, I was shifted from one cashier to another mid shift. Some cashiers were impatient and wanted things done their way. I was called out in front of customers for not doing everything the way they wanted even after only 15 to 30 minutes of trying to work with a cashier."
bad,I worked with costco for over a year and I ended up leaving because the management refused to train me to run forklift because of my mental health. I drove the electric pallet jack and my boss said that I was one of the best drivers however she was uncomfortable with my being a driver because of my mental health issues. I cannot work for a company that ignores when an  employee raises safety concerns just because they have mild mental health (my doctor has never been concerned about my stability)
bad,"Yes they have good benefits if you sell your soul to the place. Expect very physical work. Expect bad managers, no training at all but expect to be beat up when your not perfect. If mangers dont like you expect to go outside in the winter and push carts, even when your over 60 and have health problems, do they care, yeah thats how they get older people or people with an opinion and women to quit.  Have an opinion, shut up, low life how dare you, go push carts.  Expect lots of lifting heavy, expect lots of running across the warehouse to take things back and get stuff for customers who cant read a sign. Oh put this stuff in my blue bag and this in my yellow, oh god you are not fast enough. On the job training is a joke, you learn by being thrown into the fire and then expect to be beaten down by supervisors who tell you how bad you are, not fast enough, not good enough,, but heh you show up on time. Oh warm fuzzy.  Sups who stand around doing nothing but watch you to tell you you are not fast. good enough. yeah. Did ya sell a Visa wile you were throwing stuff into the carts. Jezz this is the dream right?"
bad,Great place to work if you are okay with high stress situations and not moving up. They take the best employees and make them not want to work there anymore.
bad,"They offer good pay and great benefits, the only downside is you HAVE to have open availability? Have a life outside of work? Too bad, you need to be able to work anytime they need you."
bad,I never had training at all it was a figure it out by yourself situation the work was extremely strenuous & very fast paced & no direction or structure
bad,"Lots of heavy lifting required in a short amount of time. Felt that the pay was too low for the work being done. Everyone was in the same boat so I'd always feel guilty to ask coworkers for help, knowing that they were struggling as well. Management was unclear, not sure who my direct supervisors were."
bad,Working at Costco is a good experience and good team.NIce job opportunities and good life work balance to proceed with.This is a wonderful opportunity to start your career with and have a good long term job
bad,"You will not see the benefits of working at Costco unless you plan to work there for the rest of your life. They give you horrible shifts that you cant plan around and sometimes they stop giving you shifts all together. (I didnt work for 4 months, blew through all my savings, and they ignored me every time I asked for hours and could never say when they would be giving hours again) Managers are unreasonable, they send you for your break when its convenient for them (usually 1 hour into a 5 hour shift) You will get in trouble if you dont meet their unreasonable quotas such as upgrades but also if you make a member mad from pushing too much youre in trouble. They act like you're at fault for not being able to do it when there are so many other factors involved like how you will probably never have a packer. you will be degraded by members and you will never receive any support from the superiors, member service means you are always in the wrong! Long time employees are more important than newer ones, you will ALWAYS miss out on opportunities over them and there will never be anything left for them to give you. My tip, do not work front end it seems like the best job but it is the worst.. only work in Costco if you can get a job in the bakery!"
bad,"Was there for short term, but great staff, but can be very busy. Depends on the location your working on. In terms as a pharmacist one of the better community settings you can work in."
bad,"Management needs A LOT of improvement. They promote within the warehouse and give management positions to people who have NO experience for that department. Very frustrating. All Costco's are slightly different, but similar in that management usually sucks. Also, you get raises based on hours worked. Not work ethic or abilities. The fresh out of high school girl who doesn't actually work gets played just as much as the others working their butts off."
bad,they just don't understand the meaning of part time. and everybody expects you to do their job. its stressful and unfulfilling. the pay isnt really worth it .
bad,"The job itself is not difficult. The people (public and colleagues) are a different story. If you don't have a thick skin, this type of customer service is not for you. There is ZERO consistency in the schedule. Meaning, you could work 9-5 one day, and 6 - 11 pm the next. If you have a young family, or want to have any type of social/family life, this is not the place for you. It is impossible to plan your life around your schedule, even while receiving your schedule 2 weeks in advance. The benefits are okay. But Full-time positions are hard to come by. So, while Costco pays for your core coverage benefits regardless, you still only get ""part-time"" benefits. You can also work 38.5 hours a week and still only be a part-time employee. They also honour a ""seniority"" based system for new opportunities and advancement, while having no other perks of a union. The starting wage is $15/hr and you have to work an insane amount of hours to get bumped up by $0.50/hr."
bad,"That is the joke that always went around when I worked there.  They place a lot of focus, as it should be, on their warehouse workers; however, they need to remember that if it wasn't for their IT staff, they would never ever be able to compete with Amazon!"
bad,"I worked for Costco for 3 years in the morning stocker department. I had few good manangers the others were extremely rude and demanding even though the job was demanding enough.The hours were ridiculous and the labor was intense. I have been gone for about a year and never been happier. Truly the worst place I have ever ever worked. I won’t be even step into a Costco to this day. I truly don’t think it’s a great company. The only benefit was good health and dental which makes sense because when you are over worked you need those things. Like I said, at least I had 2 great managers but all the rest were terrible."
bad,"management sucks new employees get screwed "
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the quick hours. I learned how to run a company from the CEO to the stockers. The work place environment is fast paced but relaxed.
bad,Hard to advance. Advancement based on seniority only. Low starting pay. Work mostly nights and weekends. Hard to get full time hours even working 6 days a week.
bad,"Costco has excellent benefits, but the scheduling and management is horrible. They say ""they schedule based on the needs of the business"", but what about the needs of the employees? Most the time even if you are a permanent employee, they would schedule you 6 days a week, only work 6 hours shifts each day, and every single day you would work a different shift! You would have a different day off every single week, so sometimes you would have a 10+ day stretch between days off. You cannot request days off in advance, so you have to do your best to trade with a peer to get the day off you need for appointments, kids, family, etc. They do make any attempt to work with you no matter the circumstance. "
bad,They pay well but write people up a lot for no good reason. They make you feel like you're not good enough no matter what you do or how hard you work.
bad,"I was hired as a cake decorator which I performed the tasks of for my first two weeks. I worked while a cake decorator was on vacation but once the decorator returned things changed; then I quickly was pushed into other positions of the department and warehouse. When asking management why, their response was that the payroll for the department was full and I had to work in other areas to receive a paycheck. I was not told of this potentially happening prior to joining the company."
bad,"Very little training provided, weak management and mean and miserable coworkers. People did not get along there. People do not work as a team and expect you to get it all done. I came in very excited about this new opportunity and the excitement faded quickly. I had no training besides some computer training and if I asked for help people they would get mad about it. People would call out a bunch so the workload tripled and they kept needing people who came from temp agencies to fill the holes. The workers don’t like each other and make it clear and the environment was very toxic. I started dreading everyday I had to come there and my anxiety went through the roof. I’ve worked in stressful environments and I love the chaos ,but this was over the TOP. I’m sure not ALL the Costco pharmacies are like this, but this one was. Stay clear!"
bad,Customer service. Poorly operated. Poor treatment. Inequal distribution of work. Preferential treatment. Eventually good hourly wages after many years worked. Good benefits.
bad,"Costco was a wonderful seasonal job. Original management was great to work with and understood there legal obligations. I got rehired a few months post season and with a new set of management and it was the worst place to work. Don't be surprised if they hire you for one position and switch you to a worse position quickly after with no notice. Don't bother saying anything as their open door policy is a joke. They'll just ignore your concerns, stop scheduling you and process your exit paperwork."
bad,"Workplace environment is based upon favoritism, with unproductive employees being kept on despite numerous complaints ranging from harassment to lack of productivity"
bad,"The atmosphere was horrible. Employees would quit from stress of poor managers and supervisors. Coworkers were snarky and loved to gossip to the point of causing trouble in the workplace. If you were an above average empoyee, you got the pleasure of carrying the load of the lazy employees."
bad,"I hated it.  I worked at the front end at the Issaquah, WA location, and the customers were rude, and the atmosphere was one of the most difficult to work. Every employee was out for themselves.  The culture was terrible.  Don't apply here."
bad,Slow paced. Lack of growth. No opportunity & recognition. Toxic environment. Bad management. Lack of Vision. IT is totally different from Warehouse. Lot of non technical folks
bad,"I am speaking the Regent Ave, in Winnipeg only, I hear the other location is quite different in its mgt. "
bad,"We do the same things everyday. Wrap baked good, stocked shelves, answered phones. Management just cares about their bonuses and just sets us up to fail everyday at work. The hardest part of my job would be the managers always setting me up to fail and leaving me with thousands of things to do at night before we close so then I would be there till 11 still doing things. I didn't enjoy the job due to the lack of management."
bad,"Costco is a very fast paced environment, they do like you to work short shifts over 5/7 days rather than a full 8 hour shift in one day so it would be ideal for students."
bad,"Not the best place, manager didn't like me, I did whatever he asked always came in early, came in whenever he needed help, used me and then fired me. some of the other managers were nice people but this guy was stressed and couldn't handle it and didn't wan't to help me work and go to school ."
bad,They hire everyone as seasonal and tell them that there is a chance to become permanent after passing 90 probation. Knowing they lay everyone off after they're done with season then start the callbacks. yep call backs like an audition. They don't even tell everyone that they're being laid off. You find out after checking the schedule and seeing that you're no longer on it. Expecting people to go out and get another job until you're so blessed to receive a callback is so arrogant of the company. They work you like a slave having you do this and that of strenuous work to where the pay isn't really worth the job.
bad,"I did not enjoy working here because the owner of this optical did not make it fun and was not very considerate of others, paid in cash did not want to provide checkstubs, didn't want to pay employees what they earned and would pay very late"
bad,les gens son prete a vous aider en tou temp et une bonne equipe
bad,"A typical day is helping customers greeting them and stocking."
bad,"I'm fairly new and I don't speak Spanish,  which can make things very hard if you're trying to fit in.  I initially wanted very much to work at Costco due to the higher pay and benefits after the 180 days, due to being hired at part time.  Right off the bat I was put in the front end and at first it was very odd, I was always feeling like I was in the way. But then I started to get the hang of it, helping cashiers loading carts and running products back and forth of the store, which is hard if you're not used to running through a big warehouse. Then, I was moved to the food court,  which was basically the end for me.  Loading carts, running, doing go backs was one thing, but working in the food court was ""brutal ""!  First,  if you don't speak Spanish  that's basically one strike against you. If you've never worked with food before, that's a second strike against you. If you've never been a ""dish washer"" for a restaurant before,  that's your third strike!  Forget ""any"" training on ""anything "", you're just thrown right in!  If whatever you're asked to do and you're not doing it at 100 miles an hour,  forget about it!  I've never been a lazy person, and I've always went out of my way to do my best, but in this case I was totally defeated!  I totally have respect for anyone who can work in the food court,  But I have to say,   what is expected from you is UNREALISTIC!  I've never had more bruises, cuts, pain in my feet, back, shoulders, hips, and neck in my life!  Waking up to my hands swollen and numb to where I can't even make a fist. I feel like I'm 80 years old and like I was"
bad,Fun place to work. Get to interact with customers . Service is key to sales  here
bad,"a typical day at work "
bad,"your on your feet all day .but the salary was good, you dont really get treated very good if u need to use the restroom or need a cup of water. i dont recomend working for the food court its hard work."
bad,"- arrive at 5am then set up station. Rewrap meat from the day before and refill counters before opening. Feed the machine until 1pm."
bad,"I enjoyed working at this company, it was interesting meeting so many people."
bad,"No room for upward movement. Too many politics, waste of time for a college grad."
bad,i didn't get much hours here so i decided to leave and find a new job that gives me much more hours.
bad,"it was ok place to work ,always busy specially during the holidays."
bad,management of costco is really bad they don't treat there works nice even you work as hard very rude place do be working.
bad,"The managers were very friendly and helpful, the co-workers were friends in the long run, and we all had fun but sold to be at the top. The hardest was to meet the quoted sales a week. I enjoyed that my co-workers were friends to me. "
bad,"A typical day at work means work your body to the max...its like doing P90X over and over again. I learned that not everything is what it seams. Management is not understanding, think only about themselves, cheat you on hours and really want there bonus come August. Your co-workers have worked with each other for so long that the new people have to work four times as hard to even be excepted as a co-worker. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the miscommunication. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the sweet members on occasion when they would come in. I can say the money was good when you work all your hours and you get a raises once you hit a certain amount of hours until you max out. When you first start you get crazy hours so you will have no life until they hire more people and you cant always count on that either."
bad,"good summer job but awful shift work, long back breaking labor but very good pay."
bad,allways on the move fast pace.
bad,"Interacting with customers on items numbers, prices."
bad,Benefits are excellent compared to similar companies. Not a bad place to work if you are looking for a entry level position for their starting pay.
bad,"This company don’t backup their regular employees when they have immigration situation, they just terminated them and give their job away. They don’t try to help you in your careers growths they rather find ways to get rid of you."
bad,"not recommendable. If possible, look for other job"
bad,"I left my full time job of 8 years to come here seasonally. Everyone talks such a big game about Costco, “Oh it’s awesome!” , “Oh, it’s worth it!” "
bad,"I worked for the night shift the manager was not good at communicating at all. Messed up my request for day off. The only time that he talked to me was that I was not fast enough. "
bad,"I have been employed here for 2 years. The job is easy, but the management is horrible. "
bad,Some mangers do not support their employees.  Some are more concerned about themselves and not the good of the customers. Not enough support from upper management
bad,Emballer au caisse durant 8 heures en ligne était de loin une des pires expérience de travail. Le temps passe très lentement et en plus  tu dois remplir un quotas de petit coupons qui emmerde les clients. La moitié du monde qui travail la depuis plus de 6 mois on le regard vide a force de ce pogner le beigne en dessous des vieux neon blanc dans la cage a consommateur.
bad,"It used to be a really good place to work but now is more about taking care of the people on top and not the employees or even the members, is all about if you fit the profile of the store manager right color of skin, right accent, right age and if you are willing to act and treat people like they do. Their favorite excuse is when they don't care about your life is "" is all about the business "" but if you're their right person they'll take care of you."
bad,While working at costco I enjoyed the work. But if you show that you can do more then your role then you will be over worked and under paid. I did 4 roles as working at my store and then shoved out the door as I having to move.
bad,"I've been working at Costco for almost 5 years now, and starting the hob was great. I had great managers and great co-workers, but now approaching my fifth year you get to a point where you have to decide if it's Costco forever or something else. Not to mention too that where I currently work now has been almost unbearable every day. Terrible management plagues me from wanting to work there any longer but that's just my building. Overall though Costco has been great for me as I said earlier you get to a point where you have to decide if Costco is for the long haul or you have other plans."
bad,Everyone had a bad attitude & micromanaging to the extreme. I couldn't even look at another coworker without a supervisor telling us to stop mingling. Worst place to work if you want to keep your sanity.
bad,"This is not a review for the retail side of the company, as that is run extremely well and proficient.  This is for the tech side, which is run by quite a few that were ""kicked out"" of the retail side.  Costco has an issue of not firing people if they can't perform, they just move them. The dress code is the same as the retail side (they ""prefer"" collared shirts and no shorts). The management for some of the groups is ridiculous.  Service Desk is a joke and the ITOC management team is worse.  So much worse, that when the team manager tried to move to another team, all members of that team threatened to quit.  So, they didn't move her.  Not sure why they don't fire her."
bad,"It’s a very physically demanding job, if you aren’t physically strong and healthy I wouldn’t recommend this. Also, this job involves a lot of kneeling, lifting of over 65lbs which can cause overuse injuries. Management, isn’t great they only listen to you if you’ve been with the company for a while. They aren’t very supportive of WSIB workers that have company injuries especially physical injuries. I worked at the 100 Line drive which is near High way 27 the Distribution centre and tbh was not impressed. I don’t recommend working here. Pay is not enough for the amount of lifting and physical work being done."
bad,"It’s not a professional setting! You want to be at the mercy of a low skilled and arrogant manger, then work there! The upper managers were great, although the the department mangers were fair at best. With all of respect to the GM, the department managers need more guidance, training, and education. They did play the role, but very self serving."
bad,"A lot of people at Costco would say they have ""Golden Handcuffs"" since the pay is high along with great benefits but they work you like a dog with little regard to your well-being. Also with high pay means no one leaves on their own accord so there is little to no movement. When there is an opening, coworkers become very cutthroat all to no avail since management will do what they want and not worry about merit. Lastly, management needs to actually educate their management on how to be a manager. A lot of Costco, from top to bottom, is learning from getting thrown into the fire and taking write-ups until you get it right. This leads to inconsistent management and overall low morale."
bad,It’s a good company to work for it’s just the manager and sups show favoritism and promote their friends before a great worker they pay good and I liked the pharmacy better than any other position I’ve had
bad,"Management’s idea of customer service is almost nonexistent. Quantity supersedes quality always. Senior employees look at seasonal,temps, or new hires as competition. Especially cashiers. Hard work goes unnoticed by supervisors and management. The cart crew, the members and some of the evening supervisors were the only pros of working at this location"
bad,"They are a poorly run organization.  Don’t really work for the best interest of their employees.  Will work you like a dog and when things aren’t done in a timely fashion have the nerve to write you up and give you a citation.  Management is unfair, they expect you to go above and beyond but won’t do the same for employees."
bad,"Ecommerce center in Monrovia Maryland is a Circus. It has been in operation for over three years and Costco still cannot get its act together. Managers do not listen to hourly employee suggestions to improve operations and Corporate does not understand the reality on the ground. Costco also does not understand the meaning of ""Part Time"" and will change your schedule at the drop of a hat. Training is non existent as is preventative maintenance of critical equipment. This review is for Ecommerce only. From what I understand Warehouse operations and Depot Wet/Dry side are much better. Stay away from Ecommerce at all costs."
bad,"Depot 725"
bad,"Fun place until you start to have issues with employees for keeping true to the company's values and morals. They punish integrity and reward brown nosers and liars. If you have issues with your co-workers and take them to management, they will not only tell said co-workers, but they will help them get you fired."
bad,"Bad work culture, low wage, lack of proper shifts, chaos, wages not paid in full, bad management. Disappointing customer service. A lot of propaganda and promises. About 700 people left or got fired in the first year after opening."
bad,"I was seasonal. They pit you against your fellow employees, like dogs fighting for a bone. They encourage backstabbing and seem to enjoy when you mess up, without offering correction."
bad,Over worked for the payment. 6-13 days without breaks always changing schedule.Veteran employees are required/asked to do a whole lot less but get paid a ton more.
bad,"Es una empresa donde se aprende mucho, excelente atención al socio, pero hay explotación laboral, las exigencias van por encima de la capacidad de los empleados, los gerentes y supervisores no están capacitados, muchos de ellos no tienen estudios y sus formas para pedir las cosas son déspotas, arrogantes y prepotentes, incluso violando las leyes laborales... Y la empresa se hace de la vista gorda, o tal vez es hasta cómplice."
bad,"New store opening. Worked 10 hour days 6 - 7 days a week. Loaded/unloaded pallets and shelves. Management always indecisive about product placement or techniques. Temp part was sudden decision, even though they were already shorthanded. A few people NOT in the cliques let go. Witnessed an employee sell a customer and another employee pills."
bad,"Fast paced, Proffesional, Good pay, Poor arrogant management stay young or die.Management is always on gaurd if you think brighter than they do. Your family until you get hurt, then you become food."
bad,"Not flexible if you are going to school. Great pay and benefits, but would not consider it a career. Many of the managers and supervisors have no idea what they are doing and are very aggressive towards hourly employees."
bad,"Costco is always rated as a top employer. In reality, it is awful. Everybody is part time and full time eligibility is practically non-existent. All costco cares about is cutting hours and give their employees terrible hours. Its too difficult to live on a career as a costco employee, but costco will NOT work with your schedule for another job, nor to help advance your education. Even under the new fair scheduling act in Oregon, they try to numerously change your schedules and work around the law to screw over its employees."
bad,At the store I was at it’s consistently hiring for this position. 24x7x365 which is unfortunate cause going into the position I knew it was high turn over. The supervisors changed twice within 3 months. They repeatedly let go of people prior to their 90 days. It’s just unfortunate cause I know people that work other positions for Costco at different stores and have completely different experiences. SADLY the lynnwood wa store is a let down in this area. Hopefully one day they will get and keep staff as worthwhile workers.
bad,The work is fairly consistent. They make most new employees push carts for the first few months. New jobs open in the company regularly. There is no consistent schedule and they do not work well with your personal schedule.
bad,"Costco is a an opportunity for a decent wage and great benefits. Let's get that out of the way. You'll get by, and be able to use the medical services that are required for a healthy life. But it will be your life. You will be comfortable with the wage and benefits, but you'll have to make some sacrifices for it. First off the table, if you want to have a healthy family, one that spends time with each other, this isn't the place. With sporadic working hours that range from 7 AM to 10 PM, you won't be able to develop healthy sleeping patterns. Also the same days off every week are not guaranteed. Need certain days off to spend time with the kids? You may get it for a few weeks, but it always changes. The common theme amongst Costco employees is a lack of kids and a general family life. You have to choose which is more important. On another note, the management is tyrannical and nonsensical. Making meaningless rules to make workers busier and writing-up employees for every offense creates an unhealthy social atmosphere. Managers are demeaning at times and constantly treat you like you are inept. Good people become bitter and distant. Marriages fail very often. "
bad,"Workplace is okay, some of the cashiers were nice, some were rude and most of the front-end managers have favouritism and are not very polite. I've gotten sworn at before."
bad,"Typical day:Answer customer phone calls for 8 hours Worked during the day so traffic was so-so"
bad,"I have been at Costco for 4 years. After you get past your first 90 days It is almost impossible to get fired unless you have excessive attendance issues. If you sandbag on your job the managers can't/won't fire you because they can't afford to. I have seen many employees who are awful at their jobs get REWARDED for their incompetence. These rewards are in the form of being moved to an easier position in the store or having people sent to help you do your job. This mentality runs all the way to the top, the managers are less intelligent than half of the hourly workers and their managers are even less intelligent. The only people who win at Costco are the people that sandbag their job. I can't bring myself to be bad at my job so I will never win here. "
bad,"The most difficult thing  was the schedule.  Every day the hours were different, and every week the days off were different. We sometimes worked 9 days in a row depending on the way the weeks fell."
bad,"This company doesn't care about you. I know you will read a lot about how they do, but don't believe the hype. You have an employee number. Memorize it because that is your new name. Managers are promoted with in. As long as your willing to suck up and throw everyone under the bus. This also creates a management team with absolutely no management training at all. This is from store manager down. Great benefits or ""golden hand cuffs"""
bad,I enjoyed my time there.  Didn't like some of the arrogance that went on with the senior employees.  Supervisor did not appear to care about his employees.  That would have been the only downfall.
bad,"5 years with company means nothing. Always lost promotions to other's seniority but when I wanted to use my seniority at the other location here in town they won't list any positions on the company intranet so employees who have only been with company 2 years or less get all the prime positions over there. I could more easily apply for a position in Japan than I could in my hometown. This is apparently ""Within policy"" according to corporate. When you call corporate they just read a script about policy, are dry cold and unconcerned. They espouse things like ""Costco cares,"" and ""We're a family,"" but when you tell them you're drowning financially and need help, they feed you a bunch of lip service and then continue to ignore you. When January arrives this is known as ""Starvation time,"" because if you don't have full time you WILL be busted down to the lowest hours they can get away with. It will be going on 4 months that I have been waiting to receive any cross training so as to bolster my hours, again management just feeds you lip service and then drops the ball. I'm not allowed to get a second job because ""Costco doesn't work with other schedules,"" effectively pigeonholing me into my poor economic situation. I don't want to leave but I am being forced out because at the end of the day the only thing the leader at my warehouse cares about is his bonus."
bad,they literally want you to work until you are covered in sweat and run all over the store for customers. This company has a high turn over rate because they cant keep people. and if you get a promotion dont get to excited youll be demoted just as easily!!!
bad,"Your average corporation that only cares about numbers.  They treat their seasonal employees badly and always remind you that you are ""just a seasonal"", creating abusive situations and a hostile workplace.  Costco puts on a wonderful orientation for new employees, and then once you you are put in your given job, you are just thown into it and expected to know what to do... very poor and inadequate training.  One of the most unprofessional places I've ever worked at.  I wouldn't recommend Costco to anyone!"
bad,"I found Costco to have a very poor working culture. Th managers and employees micro manage everything. The attitude workers  have is very abusive and condescending. The managers criticize every little thing you do. There is always someone over your back at the ready to criticize and denigrate your work.  Being a seasonal employee I got little training, and was pushed into work on a very busy day without sufficient training. As someone who has worked in various surroundings through my life, I would have to say Costco is one of the poorest working cultures I have come across. They pay you a little more; but in today's world that  bit means little and they are under-staffed and employees are over worked because of it."
bad,"The pay at the call center is great, but that’s the only positive in my experience... the management is rude. They will write you up for everything! They jam a lot of info in at training and expect you to remember it all with a timed test! You fail.. they fire you on the spot and take away the “ free membership”. New employees that get put out on floor are expected to know everything and if they ask for help are treated very badly by supervisors. There were several people crying the first day out on the floor.  Managers and supervisors walk around with a better than everyone attitude ... I had one roll eyes at me in the mirror in the bathroom.... and don’t get me started about the bathrooms lol... always a long line .. lucky to get in on a break.. and if you are late from break... careful! They will write you up! The call center is a joke.."
bad,"Gained great knowledge of many different departments which brought great amounts of stresses and tasks to deal with and learn from. Made my way through the ranks and made the most of opportunities. "
bad,"Working at Costco I was on my feet all day at work, constantly lifting heavy objects and it has caused a lot of pain in my back and shoulders. The management at the Costco I worked at was terrible. They were always looking for ways to get us in trouble or find ways to tell us we were not working hard enough, even though I was sweating and running everywhere it was never good enough. Different managers would tell you different ways they wanted something done then you would get in trouble for not doing it right. terrible communication. Most enjoyable part was my coworkers, I loved most of the people I worked with."
bad,"Costco is great if you are looking for something steady with good pay and that is about it. You are still working retail and there is a long long wait for advancement opportunities. Basically you need to wait for people to retire at this point to advance because the turnover is so low. Days are fast-paced and go by fast but it’s a very tough environment to work in, especially with the ever changing schedules. They do not value higher education in any way so you can expect your managers to literally be less educated than you if you have a degree which is always frustrating. At the end of the day it is retail with good pay, if you want a rewarding career...do yourself a favor and look elsewhere, if you need to just put food on the table, it may be for you."
bad,Food court was awful. Very hard to get a good amount of hours without having to work in every section of the store.  Management did really care about anything but themselves.
bad,Costco was a very tense and uptight place to work as expected from a retail company. You are treated like a grunt for just a bit over minimum wage an hour.
bad,Costco the company might be amazing to work for but working here in redding was awful. ive never met more rude of a managment staff than here. they treat people so poorly i would never recommend anyone to apply there.
bad,Passive aggressive people with no accountability for their mistakes. Managers need training and most people do not want to work hard because their job is like a government position.
bad,I really do not  wish to go into any kind of details on my work experience or even time spent at this place. That's all I have to say about it and that is that.
bad,wanted to work here but once i was fully hired i only wanted to do the stocking was very unhappy with how management treated me. they change my schedule last minute
bad,"It was an enriching experience, but the warehouse where I worked  for clearly needs a more standardized management type. What I mean is (for example) that you could get different ways of seeing and applying the same procedures depending on who (among assistant-managers and supervisors) you would addressed the question or concern. It was a fun workplace at the beginning, but it is an energy consuming atmosphere, both in the psychological and the physical sense. The benefits (assurances, paid membership cards, higher salary than the minimum, etc.) were satisfying. Anyway, I am grateful for what I learned and the challenges that allowed me to improve my skills such as productivity, communication and autonomy."
bad,"Management is horrible, no room for advancement. They dont treat their workers with any kind of respect. The work environment is stressful."
bad,Pays great if you can survive it. The work is not horrible but asking for any days off is like pulling teeth. Good luck having a life outside of this job. If you tell anyone about anything going on in your life or if you complain it will show up in your review. Its every employee for themselves. If you can just show up to work and keep your head down you'll do great. The only thing that keeps me going is the pay and benefits.
bad,"I use to work for Costco and it was very fun, I love meeting different people, and the pay was great. The only problem is management they didn't seem to care about their employees and communication was terrible. I tried applying there several times but no response from company when they broadcast that they are hiring. Hopefully if I keep applying I would love to work for Costco's again."
bad,"Good Part-time job.  If full time, be prepared to work hard, long hours standing, repetitive movements, heavy lifting"
bad,They ask a lot out of there employees and give very little back.
bad,Too many people that have been there along time that leaving all the work for newer employees. A lot of attitude problems.
bad,"The work itself was easy : stocking shelves in a timely manner and dealing with customers in a friendly fashion."
bad,"Employee walks through the door and says hi to everyone.  Management right away says ""Take out the trash!"" "
bad,work days are long and stressful having the gm and all the supervisors breathing down your neck complaining all the time because nothings perfect.  The gm does work that has nothing to do with costco on the clock.  She makes the entire workplace stressful and stresses people out
bad,"the management was not good, I was never taught what to do but was expected to know what to do."
bad,"It is too much of overload with disorganized work."
bad,Costco is a company where you never know exactly what your day will include.  The environment is fast paced and can be very challenging.  The hardest part of the job is managing your time effectively in meeting your daily goals and being available to help in other departments.
bad,"I treat people with respect, these don't, all they care about is pushing people to the limit of walking out. "
bad,The benefits and compensation of this job make it incredible but they are not flexible with scheduling. Could be very restrictive for those that need flexibility and more time off certain days.
bad,the benefits and pay motivate people to stay at Costco. the employers are great but management is constantly stressed resulting in every employ being stressed.
bad,"Je conseille à tous ceux qui veulent travailler chez Costco de bien vous renseigner. Cet emploi est seulement temps partiel. Il n'y a que les anciens employés qui ont la chance d'avoir un temps plein. Si vous avez moins que 20 ans, c'est parfait pour vous. Parcontre, si vous avez plus que 25 ans. C'est à vos risque et périls."
bad,"hard work and under paid, lunch and all breaks are short, by the time you walk to your car, your break is over. You are not allowed to take your phone on the floor with you, even though you have kids. This was not the place for me."
bad,"Had a lot experiences that they never give you positive feedback. certain manager are alright but most of them are for themselves and never Have employees back. other employees that transfer over said the mainland Costco’s management is better, The reason is that we are so secluded from other Costco’s, management makes up there own rules and get away with it."
bad,Some managers just have you go against policy and they don't want to take responsibility for it. There was an incident involving undercooked chickens that started an investigation in the deli where they were discovering all kinds of violations that the manager did not receive any punishment for.
bad,"I can't speak for the stores but I would say working in one of their transportation depots was easily the second worst job of my life. I guess if you're a female and the one boss likes you it's okay. If not you have to pick up the slack for the others. The building has two ""sides"" and the one side has no internal drive so that forces the end of the workday to feel rushed on the other side. Basically you get your work late because the other side is putzing around and then you have to rush. Senior employees seem to want to do bare minimum and then look for a place to hide."
bad,"Work was fun at the start of my employment as a regular employee, however, when I was promoted to a supervisor and management changed, things changed."
bad,Workplace culture is pretty relaxed. It really is a great place to start your career and end it due to no one ever getting fired. This place is in need of someone who is willing and wanting to make a difference and isn't afraid of having the popular opinion and wanting to take chances.
bad,"My biggest issue with Costco was that being hired didn't mean anything. And you will get fired for having a customer complaint even if what the customer said was a lie. The politics at this place are horrid. Thank god I found something better elsewhere."
bad,great place long hours hard to get a day off.  i was happy to be there people are great. just cant work two jobs at once. was hoping for more flexibility
bad,"Worked at Peterborough Costco for a while as Merchandise/Front End a while back ago before I was freed."
bad,"No flexibility with hours.  Costco will not help you work around personal issues.  At least in my case.   You can be the best worker or the worst worker, costco didnt care about work ethic."
bad,"Starting off at Costco was pretty great till management treats you like your nothing. Everyone seemed so nice till you walked out of the room and they start talking bad about you. Multiple times they would throw all the trash on the ground and leave a mess. No one would tell you they were leaving and leave you with the whole mess to clean up cause they think it’s funny. Also, there is people working there with serious drug problems . There is a select few worker that really put in good work though, but good people are hard to come by that work there."
bad,The culture was cutthroat. Managers didn't appreciate there people. It's all about speed. They expect you to work as fast as employees who have been there 10 years and make twice what you make. If your not fast enough they will kick you out. This place was a waste of time I regret working here.
bad,"Management is promoted from within which can be positive but may result in lack of quality personnel. "
bad,"I would get harassed by co workers and customers alike and no manager really cared to do anything about it. The customer is always right atmosphere even when the customer totally in the wrong. After I left, I still have plenty of friends who still work there, word got out that several of my female coworkers had been sexually assaulted on the job by male coworkers higher up on the food chain. And no one was doing a thing about it. "
bad,"Most Members are babied, entitled, ignorant and rude. Hours are terrible, breaks and lunches are skipped , understaffed every day. Benefits are decent and pay is ok if you’ve been there for a long time or get promoted. For the job and wear and tear on your body , salaries should be higher and hours should be less or should be properly staffed. Management has no vision for great ideas and tire shop supervisors have white uniform shirts. Makes no sense at all. I could go on and on."
bad,"The warehouse is extremely busy, short staffed for the number of members  being serviced. Staff is friendly and supportive to their members and coworkers."
bad,Costco does not care at all about your personal life. Being a mother I had to miss out on most of their lives. You must work weekends and you have absolutely no say in your schedule. The environment is terrible with no down time. They purposely stay understaffed so you are doing the work of 2 people most of the time. High stress and very cut throat if you want to advance in the company. Promotes unhealthy relationships with coworkers by pitting you against each other. Very long term employees are hard to work with and the micromanagement is to the extreme. Always under a microscope with the ability to get written up for almost everything. Fast paced to the point where you use your two days off just to recover. Costco sucks you in by their high pay and benefits which makes you stay because you can’t find the pay anywhere else. It’s a type of entrapment and it’s very sad to see. If you want to have all the money in the world but be controlled by your job then choose Costco. I would never recommend this to anyone.
bad,"Pay is great for retail, but the management and working environment is terrible.  This is coming from 9 years experience with the company at 3 different locations."
bad,I transferred from memebership to front end assistant which is a job that is hard to get out of.  I agreed to take because there was nothing open at the store I wanted. Nothing is still open and cannot see an end in site. Seniority seems to have a place inthis store.
bad,"This might be the ideal job for someone very young just starting out. Gathering shopping carts from the parking lot is not ideal for a female.  The position applied for was Member Services, but was told ""everyone"" starts with carts. The requirement was 15 maximum, AND 15 minimum."
bad,About 50% percent of the time things are crazy because of employee no shows/call-ins.
bad,"Pay is great, but management often reminds you that you are expendable. Very few kind people. Toxic masculinity runs rampant. I was hired part time and ended up working over 50 hours most weeks. This is not an issue for me, however if you took any days off you would most certainly not make it past your 90 days, which is how long they treat you like trash. I heard it is a great job after the 90 days, though."
bad,"Costco has high expectations that must be followed.  Those expectations continued to grow into increasable, overwhelming goals each year.  The work pace never stops.  I felt that my very life was being taken over by Costco.  The ""small town Company"" that Costco use to be has been taken over by Corporate Biggies that can never be satisfied.  My Regional manager was by far the worse person I have ever had to work with.  He was demeaning, belittling, and just a cold-hearted person.  You will never do your job good enough, fast enough or sale enough.  There is definitely a ""good Ol Boys"" vibe to Costco so it does depend on ""who you are.""  I will never work for Costco again."
bad,"I will start by saying that I believe Costco is an incredible place to work. My review however is of my personal experience with the company. The people I met while working there truly did become my own family after a couple years. The benefits they offered are amazing and I participated in the college retention program which I could not recommend enough for anyone who wants to work while in school. My biggest issue was with the management. Understaffed and overworked are the two words that come to my mind, and the morale of the warehouse was awful due to a lack of respect/concern from the upper level management of the warehouse. I do not believe that all warehouses are like that however, I know some of my friends who transferred stores loved their jobs more than they thought possible."
bad,you have to start as partime during seasonal and if your a dude youll be more or less forced to push carts all during the winter seasonal hiring. Could have been ok but managament def plays favorite
bad,"Costco will hire 10 - 12 people at a time for a 90 day probationary period. By the time the 90 days are up they keep 1 or 2 of those people. Some fall off shortly after starting, the rest are laid off. I was one of those laid off a week before my 90 days was up and was told I ""wasn't a good fit"", although I worked hard and was friendly to the customers and the other employees."
bad,"People in higher positions don't work with regular workers well."
bad,The pay was fantastic and some decent people to work with. but expectations for new hires were unbearable as was the training. very limited amount of people training properly and poor management.
bad,I thought would be a good place to  work and was excited about starting work there but it's was shut down by rude employees . I was put down in front od customers would not work there again.
bad,"Over critical, sneaky, picky, and no praise. It's so sad because the atmosphere is fine, the benefits are great but the management is awful.  They don't bother to praise you when you do well but they will sure as heck tell you when you've ""messed up."" And I put air quotes around messed up because they obsess over tiny small ridiculous things. It actually begins to chew away at you and I am a hard working person. "
bad,The people where fun to work with but the management was not good I made a lot of friends working there and the work there was easy I'm glad I got the experience from working there
bad,"Stay too long and you will regret it. Pay is decent.  Benefits are great.  Paid time off. One of the better wholesale companies to work for.  They are everywhere,"
bad,Costco is a tough company to work for. You give up yourself for the great wage and benefits. It's a great place to work if you do not have children or a family because you are expected to put Costco first especially if you want to move up the ranks within the company.
bad,"I moved out of my hometown for a position at the College Park, GA distribution center. The pay was great but the hours were long and hard. We worked in the freezer. I was bullied by other employees because it is all competition based to advance and stay on the job. People are terminated left and right as I was with no reason.One manager wanted to promote me to another position because he saw potential in me and liked my work ethic. However,  I worked my butt off for these people and even moved to GA for this position and they fired me for no reason within one month of starting. Not worth it. At all."
bad,"You only get ahead by being a brown nosing gossip.  Hard work and honesty are not appreciated.  Rude members are allowed to do or say anything to employees."
bad,"Costco is an alright place to work. It is a company where being an employee is just being another number. Its nothing special. You go to work, do your x amount of hours and your done. Costco is great however for allowing employees change departments more often so you get to see and work in different departments. "
bad,"un día típico con presión y bastante trabajo"
bad,tell you your doing a great job then give you a bad review. management is really nice. not a bad place to work but you wont stay there long.
bad,Costco was a very challenging job but I was able to take orders and complete them to the best of my ability in a timely manner. I worked well with my co-workers and maintained a consistent work ethic. The management was hardly tolerable and worsened as time went on but I gave them the respect that was required and didn't let their lack of professionalism get in the way of my work. The security of the job while it lasted was the motivation to uphold my performance and I reiterate that I was a good solid worker.
bad,"When I first started working there I really enjoyed it. The work was a decent pace, the supervisor always complimented my work, and everything seemed great. Randomly they fired the guy who was helping me stock the foods section. I found out from a friend they said he worked too slow. The guy wasn't exactly a fast worker, but I would've never characterized him as ""slow"". I later found out the passed three employees before me were all fired for going too ""slow"". I immediately started picking up my pace, working till I was sweating like crazy everyday, and doing everything I could to get the work done. Eventually they called me in too and claimed I was too slow. I realized they did it a week before my 90 days were up, as they did all the others before me. They do that because at the end of your 90 days they have to give you a raise, and can't randomly fire you like that. I'm sure not all Costco's are like that, but the one I was at had some issues. Aside from that, I didn't mind the work itself. I don't mind working hard, or at a fast pace. Costco just had me set up for failure. "
bad,"For a company that was just rated #1 place to work they obviously didn't talk to anyone from this location or from many of the San Diego warehouses. Management has become so oppressive!! Firing many long-term employees with false or flimsy offenses just to save payroll $$s.  Even the Union has been ineffective in stopping these from occurring because Costco is so powerful, or so they think.  Ask about the numerous worker's comp claims that are being denied or treated as fraudulent when, in fact the injuries are sustained from unrealistic production goals. No attempts are made to replace sick calls so you are expected to work harder to do the work nonetheless. It's sad to see what once was a great company allow greedy managers who are trying to get bigger bonuses through payroll reductions not address this. Some of it driven by attempts to increase the stock value on Wall Street. I say look before you leap. Good pay can be inticing but in the long run BE WARY. "
bad,The people I worked with were great and fun. I wish it was'nt a temp job would of love to work there.
bad,"Costco is great for those lucky enough to stay 5 years or more. But for those trying to break in: good luck! Starting pay is just barely above minimum wage and they usually start you off as seasonal. Basically you get no benefits, no job security, no guanteed minimum hours."
bad,Good company to work for outside the L.A. Area. Management is monopolize by curtain families and if they don't like you. Moving up in company is harder and stressful. Young and ambitious willing to suck up to management. Than you'll do just fine. The older employees are the ones that get push to the side. Great company if your a female and want to move up.
bad,Costco will never hire full-time workers If you’re looking to work at Costco full-time it will never happen they advertise full-time positions but never fill them I work there part time for many years and never advance now because I want to do and my work is excellent .  If you want to waste your time work for Costco they do pay a lot more than other people but you have to understand something you will never have a full-time position they run the stores were all part time workers smart they are paying benefits but they don’t have to pay those full-time salaries but they’ll be like one of them as soon or later it’ll catch up to them
bad,"They will make you work a lot of hours during seasonal but during the rest of the year, you get around 24 hours if you're part-time. It takes a couple of years to become full time and almost everything is based on seniority. You have to work a lot and it can be very exhausting,"
bad,Starts at 15/hr. You work when and where they tell you. Management doesn't care and plays favorites with everyone and lacks communication to other management. 401k and benefits are excellent. They dont care about you personally just that you can do what they need. You work all nights and weekends and if someone with more seniority puts in for a vacation or a position above you they will always get it.
bad,"Used to thoroughly enjoy working for Costco, but since dropping to part time I feel forgotten about. Very limiting opportunities due to company politics."
bad,It isn't a terrible place to work however one problem is that in order to move up or get descent hours you need to have seniority. Doing carts every night with being stuck as a closer makes me question management decisions at times. The hours could be better and management is overly strick. Good place to work if you like retail however it isnt for me. The starting pay for the area I live in is quite low too 14 an hour is not enough for the amount work we do a night.
bad,"Starting pay is low. How hard you work doesn't effect your salary. Great if you want a place to be lazy. Not a great place to work if you give extra effort and expect to be rewarded for it. "
bad,"Amazing company, Great views, Awesome staff, Wonderful benefits! The pay from this multi billion dollar company concerns me. Can't afford to live/survive with the wage they offer. I understand working up to a higher paying salary or pay raise but the wages given to start aren't livable but, they want you to be extremely flexible. Overtime is a must to stay a float and that's if they have any available."
bad,typically you would come  into work under staffed and over worked every single day.Managegment will typically place all  the responsiibility on to employees when things are going poorly. if you buy them coffees and work for free on your days off you might get promoted to supervisor
bad,"Costco is a good company. It's very systematic, but a lot of great people work for that company. It just was not the right place for me at that certain time."
bad,Although Costco is a fast paced environment and compensates with decent pay I don't recommend working at the sierra lakes costco food court because the manager is not professional at all and gets away with multiple things that should never be tolerated at a work environment. Even though the company doesn't tolerate such negative behavior she has managed to display an innocent act to her superiors.
bad,"the management is poorly bad, they force me to buy pants to work. and they don't really listen to you. They can care the less about where you work or your hours."
bad,"the majority of management is incompetent and tends to micromanage employees.  Atmosphere is very fast paced and stressful. Pay and benefits are decent.  In addition there is no wifi access in the warehouse, and the closest sources of food are of poor quality.  Bring your own lunch if possible."
bad,Treated people like cattle. No one supervisor for maintenance position so who had the everybody that worked there telling you what to do even though they had no right to.
bad,"Usually started by collecting shopping carts in the parking lot for a few hours followed by cashiering a few hours and then back outside collecting carts. The work was easy and the people generally friendly. I did not like some of the supervisors who were power hungry and thought they were better than people because their pay was higher. "
bad,"I would only go back If I had too. I don't plan on it. They don't communicate , They are way too overpaid in the higher up. They never know what is going on ."
bad,"Working here is great for benefits and the people are nice. To grow in advancement of positions it helps to know people, not all costcos are runned this way bit this one does have sights on the ones they like."
bad,"On Dec.21,2016 My boss told me that because the production volume is down, they are laying people off. I was one of the people that they chose to lay off. However they told me that my last day would be dec.22,2016 the day after they had informed me. My contact would have been finished Jan.01.2017. I wish they would have given me more warning so that I could have figured something out as a back up. But because they only gave me 1 day warning, I did not have a back up plan and so I was forced to borrow money from family and apply for EI. "
bad,"When I started working for Costco, I loved it.  I got to know many of my customers on a personal basis and they would always buy my products because they trusted my judgement.  I grew to dislike Costco because the manager was coddling employees that were lazy and immature.  When I went to my manager and told her what was going on behind her back she did nothing about it and allowed this behavior to continue. This made the rest of the hard working employees have to work harder to make up for the others who were lazy and derelict."
bad,"Generally the work itself was alright, loading and unloading the tables during the day was easy and handing out samples was fun. The customers would occasionally take more than they were allowed but we couldn't be rude and say anything. "
bad,"Good place to work at, can get repetitive when bagging products, everything was fine until I got fired for talking about my foot injury with manager. I thought I would get support not get fired."
bad,Costco was a demanding and busy place to work.  There was always people around who needed your help.  It was fun getting new businesses to join the company.
bad,I learned how to deal with stressful situations. It is very important the  members are satisfied to the best of your ability. Working with others is very important in this job as well so that the work can get done in a smooth and efficient manner.
bad,"Horrible management, Bosses would go out of there way to make trouble for you and make any excuse to yell at you, even if you are doing your job and working as hard as you can. I know most people take the bosses word in saying employees are horrible, but I showed up every day on time and worked as hard as I could and still was treated like garbage. Never have I had such miserable bosses, who took the pains from their personal lives out on their employees."
bad,"Costco has a great lunch room, great food court and really nice fun staff.  Great skill teachings and a very safe and clean place to work."
bad,"Ok being a food/product demonstrator sucked!!!"
bad,"Like any other job especially retail there are the good and the bad. It seems at this place there is increasingly more bad than good. The main problem seems to be expectations. We all understand cuts in payroll, what most dont understand is the chaos this brings. If youre management should you know how to deal with these situations? We underlings are constantly told to do better and work harder. And for what? To see our mistakes shown under a bright light but our successes stolen by those that lead us? I know we have to do more with less, that is the nature of the beast. We can though plan ahead. Make that person that calls in a expected cost of doing business not a bad surprise. You plan for the worst and hope for the best, not plan for ok and watch the whole plan fall apart when we get busy or people dont show. I keep thinking that if lowly me is seeing simple solutions then of course by intelligent managers are seeing it and I am simply not understanding the problem. More and more I find myself facing a realization, my managers are not smart and all knowing, in fact I may be smarter just less willing to suck up and be selfish. Oh and as for the good? There are a handful of people that I could be friends for life with, that and a good wage for what I do are the only things that keep me here. How do the rest of you do it?"
bad,"Management only cares about the numbers, never really about the employees well-being unless it hinders sales/work for that week. I’ve only experienced the business buildings, and they work differently from core Costco buildings. Didn’t have a good experience, with being there for almost a year and receive no training that’s  supposed to be given after 6 months. Also, don’t apply to one of the business buildings if you pla to go to school. They were not flexible at all with my schooling and my gm’s made such a big deal about it despite me asking for just one day for off for school. Didn’t even ask for any extra day off and said I would work the regular 5 days a week, but no it became a whole ordeal"
bad,"Always rushing"
bad,Doesn't matter how quick and good your work is. You will never be good enough for the long-term workers there. It's all politics sadly. The manager doesn't know how to handle people as well.
bad,The job is monotonous as it is but added with RUBBISH management makes is painful. Means to an end. That's all. The type of people the managers are ordinary small people with a little power. No people skills.
bad,"Average job overall. Management was subpar. The employees were good people, some weren’t. Benefits and pay were above average so that was always a driving factor to work"
bad,"They are very strict at Costco.  I did not like working here while I was going to school.  It was difficult for me to get hours that worked well with my schooling, which eventually led me to leave."
bad,"Absolutely no training, management does not care about hourly employees, tons of politics. Many people are unqualified for the positions they are in."
bad,"Costco Ecommerce is a temporary agency, Costco warehouse isn't great to work in and they will terminate you for doing your job. The other workers are great."
bad,Its not a good place to grow with in a company. I would recommed that there be more management training on how handle the employess thats under them..
bad,You will most likely start as a seasonal worker but when your time there runs out and if there are any openings you might be coming back. The atmosphere there currently is negative because of management and the shoppers can be incredibly rude and insufferable. The company is worth it but I don't recommend this location at all.
bad,washing hands before getting into the deli. taking out of date of the shelf. making food by using the speck sheet. making food of party sandwick wrap and platter. Checking temp in the deli making sure it is clean at all times
bad,"I was very happy working at Costco.  I like helping people. As a bilingual person, I had the opportunity to use this skill to serve better our multicultural customers, however, it is nothing related to my career."
bad,"i  have been working for the company  for a long time.. i would say  decent pay and benefits are what  has kept me working. In terms of work life, its not ideal"
bad,Its a good place to work if all you want is a decent paycheck and can put up with a ton of petty drama with little opportunity for advancement.Over all i'm very happy with my decision to leave.
bad,"It was alright.  The pay is cool and all, but the overall environment just wasn’t for me.  It seemed like a dead end.  Yes, you can move up in the corporate food chain but at the end of the day it’s still barely enough to live in Fairfax VA.  The salary I was making was barely enough for rent alone.  I would recommend this specific job to no one because the customers are all extremely rude when it comes to treating the food service workers.  We get no tips and we are one of then latest costco workers to leave because we have to clean up everything.  I would consistenltly stay cleaning past my shift, even though I would need to clock out right as my shift was supposed to end.  The base looks nice but there’s nothing more to it."
bad,"You could not ask for better insurance which is not heard of these days. Always getting a raise. There are a lot of cliques, including manager pets. Watch yourself, your manager may ""stab you in the back"" and then you are out the door while the manager doesn't say a word. Anything for them to keep their job, payment and benefits. WATCH YOURSELF!"
bad,It took them forever to set up a interview date and once at the interview I didn’t get seen for 5hrs. I applied to work in the Tire center but during my interview I was told I’d be better at Sales so then I had to come back to interview for Sales. Once I got “hired for Sales” for some reason they had me on the schedule as a 4am Stocker. I couldn’t work stocking hours and I wasn’t hired to be a stocker and whenever I tried to talk to management about getting moved to my actual position I got brushed off. Ended up resigning from my position.
bad,"The job is quite demanding as you are on your feet all day and have to deal with members the whole time you are there. Other than that, it would be a fun job to work at if the management wasn't idiotic. Favoritism, scheduling problems, unrealistic expectations... you name it. I felt constantly belittled and underappreciated. And not to mention all the petty gossip and drama that occurred between employees. Just toxic, toxic, toxic. STAY AWAY."
bad,"The job itself is easy to learn. "
bad,"Excellent business model when it comes to scheduling, pay and benefits, but it consists of extremely poor management and little to no team work. Like slavery."
bad,"they always required you to run all the time, always a risk of hitting or running into a member, that is not a good work environment.they need to take better care of the employees."
bad,"Très (trop) axée sur la vente (à pression) beaucoup de sollicitation. "
bad,You can learn a lot of skills and meet new people. Very busy place to work at that time flies so fast. Great benefits and fair wage for everyone. You can be trained in different departments
bad,management does not know how to balance between their employees. if you push carts they leave you outside for the full 8 hour terms. they want you to limit your time inside and go fast even in over 100 degree whether.
bad,"Good experience , could have been better if things were more organized , busy buisness so you have to make sure your moving fast at all times . Management could of been better"
bad,"I don't think my coworkers liked me so obviously that gave me a negative experience with the job. The job itself wasn't bad, it was very fast paced, and time went by very quick. Pay rate was also very good for a college student like me."

bad,"Come in 5am, found out which area you are in or you will be a floater driver. Get a list of the items that need to be drop down and stock. Make sure you check all endcaps. 10am lunch time then you're a cashier or cashier assistance for the rest of the day"
bad,"I was only seasonal, I drove forklifts, i got to go on breaks, I was constantly in danger of getting injured by incompetent workers and bosses wouldn't do anything about it."
bad,"The COSTCO Winterburn rd. location in Edmonton,Alb let over 20 employees go on Christmas eve this year 2015 (shortage of work was on our ROE), who does that !. "
bad,very member friendly place. but they let the members talk to the employees like dirt. working here was fine as long as you kept working .
bad,Costco Wholesale is an excellent company in the way they treat their employees. Great pay and great benefits. The biggest problem was the coworkers i had. There seemed to be a lot of gossip and rumors spread through the employees which reminded me of high school too much.
bad,Women folding clothing earn as much as freezer stocker. Not fair. Long time workers feel privileged and take excessive breaks. Very hard to get full time employment.
bad,It is a fast paced job. Very hard to deal with management. Co workers are very nice and friendly. Management could be better though. Wasn't a fun job.
bad,Muy bien ambiente de trabajo... excelente prestaciones
bad,Fast paced environment good for the social butterfly type person. There is room for advancement but if working as a part time student will receive minimum wage indefinitely.
bad,"I did not feel the ability to move up in the company is possible without 5+ years employment. They offer insurance which can really be helpful. No higher education is required for employment and once you're in, you're in, unless  you don't work hard."
bad,"In 2008, Costco was thee best place to work.  As a result I learned as much as I could and in my store I know 90% of the store operations.  There is very little I do not know.  Over the years the bottom line has become more and more the focus of business.  There is more and more days where you are doing three or more departments, cleaning up after the morning crew and basically doing more and more because they cut hours and everyone else went home.  In the beginning of my time it was a balance, a true balance between work and the employees life.  Since the CEO has stepped down and new leadership has emerged, it is more about the corporation than the employees."
bad,"The only good thing about Costco enployment is the pay and benefits.  They let the managers verbally abuse you, you'll work every weekend and they love seniority for everything"
bad,"it was a nice experience,I have learn a lot a diferent thing ,I didn't know"
bad,"Costco seemed like a good place to work, benefits, paid time off, structured. Both of the managers I worked for, optical and pharmacy, were very disrespectful of me and action was taken but to no avail. After 4 years and 4 months, I said no more! Who gives up a job making $25.65 per hour? One who has been mentally abused."
bad,"5 Star "
bad,"Costco does not allow you to chosose the hours you are available, you MUST be available to work at all times, including weekends. This makes it a pain to schedule anything else around it because the work hours are so strange. Customers are usually nice, but when it it busy, can be extremely grumpy. Management is understanding if you are an older employee, but students get the short end of the stick."
bad,"Very fast paced work environment."
bad,"Benefits were amazing but other then that nothing much else was. Hard to move to desired job postings. Hard to go full time unless you want to sign the postings for scrubbing toilets or other undesirable shifts. Upper management puts ridiculous standards on managers which most likely trickled down from corporate. Management will always back members over employees. Huge turnover for the their management and supervisors. You know something is wrong when a manager steps down to be a forklift driver. Not worth the hassle. Everything there is by seniority which is really bad as it creates lifers with 20+ years of working there that are lazy and full of themselves. Literally would get told to go pick up trash or clean up spills by senior employees because they didn't feel like doing it even though a manager had just told them to go do it. They also don't make people do their jobs. Had coworkers do poor jobs and management would make more reliable people do them instead of correcting the other person so that encouraged them to do even worse jobs in the positions they didn't like because they knew management would just stick someone else there. A manager told me once ""I have you sweep trash every day because I can't trust anyone else to do it correctly."" So why wouldn't you correct the poor job a bad employee was doing instead of punishing someone who does it right by making them take on the jobs no one wanted to do!?"
bad,"I sort of felt like they were being nice and cordial, because they needed to fill positions. I am absolutely a diligent worker and I believe that Costco hired me to be a Customer/Service associate, which is not the position I applied for."
bad,"Good job, great floor supervisor, culture created by  Ops manager horrible, high school locker room mentality,  Managers are over worked are stressed out. My immediate supervisor was awesome and others were horrible."
bad,"If you love beaurocracy, substandard pay, antiquated technology, incompetent management, cult-like pressure to conform, job security, capped raises, lazy ""lifer"" colleagues and minimal innovation Costco IS is your dream job."
bad,"The pay may be great, but the warehouse is run so inefficiently it hurts. Management has no common sense and wastes plenty of hours accomplishing nothing. One could argue that is job security, I would argue it's incompetence. It may be a warehouse specific problem, but my guess is that it's not. Simply remember that even with pay, benefits, paid sick and vacation time and 401k that you are still dealing with a retail job at the end of the day. Better than the low end of retail, but still frustrating to work there. As mentioned before, the pay and benefits make it more tolerable at the very minimum."
bad,"About the company Costco I can say that it is a company that works with lot of tension, has very bad Administracion and little consideration to the employee."
bad,"The manager was very unaproachable his name was Troy and his team treats CDS like we are bad people, it was a terrible experience, when you ask Troy for a meeting he does not want to be bothered at all and that made me feel very bad in Florence, Ky"
bad,Management is awful and do not care about their employees besides paying them well. They will do anything to put who they want in power even if it's not fair
bad,"A typical day at work when it comes to working at Costco is either being on carts all day whether its rain or shine although rain gear is provided, and/or being expected to run back items that shoppers didn't decide that they wanted and crushing boxes."
bad,"-Front end assistant; responsible for signing customers up for Costco memberships."
bad,"- Workloads not evenly distributed "
bad,its a good job if you're freshly out of highschool or on summer break. But if you're in the 20s and have degree you dont want to get sucked into settling for costco. management at times can be horrible at times. But try to keep a smile on everyones face.
bad,"Costco will work you to death, and even if you do exactly as they say, if they don't like you, you're gone; I'm speaking from 5 years experience. They will work you until you break physically, and then they'll take everything away from you for silly reasons. The drama is overwhelming at times, and once again if they like you, you can write your own ticket, if they dislike you, they'll write you up for complete nonsense, and when they have enough nonsense compliled, they'll cast you aside without any notice."
bad,i made food for the shoppers to try why the were shopping. it was fun promoting the food so it could sell. i learn that i like food that i thought i would never like
bad,I learned how to work in a fast paced work place. I worked with people who i typically didnt like but still went on with my day. The worplace was always packed.
bad,"I loved working there because my commute was easy and direct. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers. Management was excellent, overall good job."
bad,"Management in the need of improvement. Business Ethics come into play when the business has to make a conscious decision on its dilemmas (e.g.: harassment, employee relations, discrimination etc). Hence Business Ethics or Corporate Ethics can be quoted as the set of behaviour and disciple that a business follows in its activities."
bad,"Started as seasonal on the condition that a callback meant permanent position and benefits. Got the callback and kept working, doing the same amount of work as 2+ other employees. Find out over the course of weeks and multiple guarantees, by multiple leads,  my benefits and permanent position paperwork were coming. Never did and was finally given the line ""Some people work here for 8-10 months before they are made permanent..."" by the store manager. Even applied for multiple internal permanent positions, passed over for lazier incompetent permanent employees. Then started requesting I put school aside to work more hours. Not this guy. Other stores may be decent environments, heard good things, but Costco is good money for no required education."
bad,"I came in as a temp. I was put in the bakery to start with but my responsibilities changed to working up front. So I helped with the cashiers lines and worked as a door greeter. I'm sure it would have been a great place to work for, but there was some changes going on in management, and that did not bode well for me ."
bad,"I entered the job as an design coordinator, within two months I was told that I was a sales person."
bad,"Terrible place to work. The only reason people like it is the wage, never seen a place where management crushes the little people to make themselves look better"
bad,"So since Jim Sinigal stepped down, it seems as if the CFO has been running the company. Now they're all about their margins. So after the most recent rework of their ""excellent pay scale"" (barely $2 over minimum wage, and it takes about 5 years to get out of the rabbit starving paycheck range.) They have not been replacing the people who leave, and trying to get other to pick up the slack... Imagine coming in at 4am every day, being told to go fold clothes for an hour every morning, then by the time you can block down your 5  aisles (standard used to be 2) its lunch time, then you can do maybe half the work and its almost clean up time and the managers are yelling at you for not finishing your stocking."
bad,"-Part time worker"
bad,great place workforce love working there on assembly line being team member
bad,"I didn't have the best experience working with this company. It was very difficult to move up, to take on more hours and the overall morale of the environment was not healthy."
bad,Made hot dogs. really did not learn anything there. management sucked so did the co-workers. The hard part of the job was cleaning up tonight. the part I like the most was going home.
bad,"my typical day at work would be; communicate with customers, problem solving, getting to know the business more and more each day, cash handling, ... The co workers I worked with at Costco were interesting in a way I was not used to.... but just about everyone I worked with was decent, kind , and understanding. Problem solving had to be the hardest part of the job a lot of the time...but I always seemed to figure it out.."
bad,"Benefits of working here are great, although the hours are not. Hard to find room to grow and learn in a positive way. It is a secure job if you have a higher position and plan on staying your entire life. But if retail is for you, this company should be top of your list, has best benefits for retail."
bad,I had a hard time here because of a lot of favoritism. People were hired being related to other co-workers not because of work ethic. Those people then got special jobs and treatment. Plus if you were a but kiss you tend to get the same treatment. I did not like it here. I work hard and I'm good at what I do. It felt like pushing a big rock up a hill to try and get somewhere there.
bad,"Pay was above minimum wage, and benefits were far better than competing grocery clerk jobs due to union hiring. Surprisingly physical. They let you wear shorts."
bad,"You have to be willing to do anything that you're told at any given moment. If you are a cashier be prepared to work by yourself because they will take assistance away from you as they need them. Overall, the Issaquah location is more stressful to work at due to the cooperate office being right next door. It is a very intense place to work and you are held to a high standard."
bad,"Family like environment with lots of departments to work In, great health insurance and benefits. Sick/vacation pay and generally lenient with days off."
bad,Costco is a good seasonal job to work for. You will get more experience working in retail. it's good money for working during the holidays. Costco is a job where you have to work hard if you want a full time position.
bad,A good place for part time job. Pay more than other companies comparatively. Friendly environment and good facilities for part timers. Good for school going adults and kids
bad,"go to work and start stocking up items on different shelves, sometime i do help with the cash and also the carts outside. Job rotation is practiced a lot at Costco. Management is great, all the managers try their best to  build a relationship with the employees."
bad,I did not like the way i was treated by mangers or co-workers. It was un fair a disrespectful. The average day at work was alright.
bad,"Front-End I loved to be working there as you can communicate with the customers, and also build on your customer service skills. What I learned is that every day is different and no matter where your at personally, it challenge you how to act with customers.. I love working with fellow co- workers. hardest part of the JOB was knowing that it was seasonal position with a possibility of staying on if they liked you."
bad,nice job. Have the opportunity to work many areas within the store. it is a very fast paced store that needs to update the cashier stations to provide quick response to transactions.  should require scan codes to be all in the same location to make transactions smoother and more efficient.
bad,Costco used to be great. Costco now only cares about making money instead of the members and employees. Costco pays well and has good benefits but they suck you in and it's hard to leave. Costco also plays favorites.
bad,"Los gerentes directos, eran un tanto groseros."
bad,"I worked in food court and as a front end assistant, my day consisted of making sure food was prepped. And also to make sure members were happy. The management was alright, my co-workers were alright also. The hardest part about the job was to deal with angry members, the most enjoyable part of the job was to learn something new each day."
bad,"I ended up in the food court,  Iwould have much rather been pushing buggies around the parking lot. But it was a interesting learning experiance."
bad,A typical workday would be to cashier for about 6 hours of the shift and then for the remaining two hours you clean the store. A cashier helps anywhere from 30 to 70 people per hour. You start to feel like a robot because they track your numbers and god forbid you aren't moving as fast as you were two days ago they harrass you until you do. There are advancement opportunities and the benefits are amazing. If its a job you want to stay at and build a career out of then its the right place for you. They work with students too.
bad,"The job was fine, you get payed what you work for, I would recommend better choice of staff. A lot of people take advantage of the fact that the job is unionized."
bad,"Great place, I recommend this place. You get many benefits but sometimes work can be very physical and that can hurt you. The good thing is that they provide a great insurance"
bad,"I did not like working for Costco Wholesale. Sure the pay is great, but it didn't bother them one bit when they had to fire me after the busy season. I worked harder than ever, sweating in that bakery, all in hopes that I had the job. Guess not."
bad,"Everyone is so nice and friendly, they want you to feel at home to succeed."
bad,"I learned a lot about customer service at this job, this was also an awesome job but the short time I was there really enjoyed my manager and coworkers it was on seasonal."
bad,"I had a great job at Costco, carefree fun loving people. I couldnt ask for a better place to work. I enjoyed coming to work. I would see smiles on everyone's face, they always made you feel welcome even on a bad day."
good,didnt enjoy my short time there was proberly to young to appreciate anything they had to offer mangers were horrible got paid 6.20 an hour for night work
good,N/a i don’t have much to say about the experience because I just didn’t like the fact that it wasn’t really accommodating to new employees with the scheduling
good,"If you're going to school and don't plan to stay here very long, I'd say go for it. Otherwise, it's a trap. People that have been working there 10, 15, and 20+ years seem so miserable, but they entice you in with the benefits and the pay raises for every (x) amount of hours you work. I started in the deli and it drains the life and soul from you. If you can make it past your 90 days, just get out."
good,"I have seen the management decline rapidly over the last few years, work life balance is not as much of a concern like it used to be.  As a matter of fact, seems now that work life balance means nothing.  People get moved around regardless if they want to or don't know anything about their new area.  Change is good yes, but not in the specialized areas where experience and skills actually mean something.  If you ain't part of the upper managers clique you have no hope of a career.  I have seen favoritism like no other job ever. "
good,"honestly, the pay was very great and i enjoyed getting my paychecks but the managers at that job are confusing and i dislike that. they push you so hard it is ridiculous. they expect too much of you."
good,"The project was for a complete strip out and re-install of the bakery, butchery, deli prep, all drive in fridges and freezers, the installation of a new dairy sales fridge, a new produce floor fridge, a floor freezer unit and floor fridge unit. There was also an extension housing a new storage freezer and refridgeration unit."
good,"typical day at work was clocking in on the exact time scheduled"
good,I worked at Costco for a few months while also working another job full time. I was told being hired in that it would be part time and they would work with my schedule for my main job. They scheduled me however they saw fit for them with no regards to the availability that I gave them when they hired me.
good,If you want a full time job I would avoid this place because most of the people that work their get less than 40 hours a week. It is hard to get a full time position there. You can Actually can get fired from this place really easy.  When they schedule your hours they are different hours each day. The pay for what most people say is not that great.  the only people that make good money are the supervisors.
good,"Costco as a company is great. They offer decent benefits and nice pay. However, the store I worked for was a terrible work environment. It was a brand new store, about half of the employees were transfers and the other half were new hires. From day one there was an unusual amount of gossip, pettiness, and drama. The cashiers didn't like the new managers, the cashiers didn't like their attendants, the cashiers didn't get to take a break when they want to; most of the drama revolved around the cashiers. Who all were transfers from older stores, and also employees of Costco for at least 15+ years. You would think that someone who gets paid 21+ an hour, to stand in one place and do virtually one movement, wouldn't be so uptight. Yet through all this bickering they were never reprimanded. The only employees who were ever disciplined were the attendants. "
good,"Helping customers try on frame s, cleaning, sweeping, wiping glass,selling glasses. i learned ther computer system ,culture was different than anything i have worked for, employees marry each other there. which effected employees behavior at times,hardest part was beining next to the TV;S SALES FLOOR, extremely loud, made for a stressful day,enjoyable, not really, It was not a good fit for me."
good,Employees that have been with Costco for many years tend to be abrasive and unhelpful to new colleagues. Clique would be a good word to describe the atmosphere.
good,This location is a bad one to work for. The manager plays favorites and they are not very nice. If you are new to the company you get the worst samples to give out. You have to work your way up before you get anything good.
good,Busy fast paced environment which makes the hours pass quickly.  Need to be able to multitask.  Effective customer service skills as well. Schedules released on a Thursday reflecting the next Monday's schedule. Didn't allow for a work/life balance.
good,I didn't like the way management treated employee's or myself; No matter where I have ever worked there isn't anyone who can say I wasn't knowledgeable and didn't try and make it a better work enviroment
good,"Come in and see what I'm demoing today. Gather all my equipment and supplies. Go to my stationed spot near the product im sampling and start to set up my display. "
good,"There are no full-time positions when starting at Costco. Once you pass your 90 day probation period, you are only guaranteed 24 hours a week. Its good for college students while attending college; however your college degree will not matter once you have it. Costco does not care if you have one."
good,"Not enough opportunities, they hire colored people but they don't get to advance in time."
good,"I have worked for Costco Travel for over 3 years, and have applied over and over and over again to leadership positions within the company. Sadly after 20 attempts over the 3-year period. I still have not been promoted. Their promise of career growth is a joke. Which is why I am now looking for a new job once again. They are losing yet another experienced employee. With years (Over 12+ years) of management experience and working with both large and small teams."
good,I want to say the pay was good but other than that I wish the environment within each employee was different everyone wasnt open minded . if I had any questions some managers seemed like they didnt wanna help
good,this job is definitely not for everyone. the hours are really long and its a lot of physical labor. If you don’t mind the long hours and the one day a week off closing every single night than its a job for you.
good,"Hardest part of the job was being kept on after seasonal it is a hard job to be kept on as a full time employee. "
good,"costco hired me as a seasonal employee where i was guaranteed 3 months of work, after showing outstanding customer service and attention to detail they decided to keep me past my seasonal period and put me through a 3 month probation period in which after i would of become part of the union and receive health benefits but on my last day of probation (5 months 29 days of costco) i was let go for no reason other than i signed a contract stating i can be terminated at anytime. My advice is sae your sick days and call in on your last day so they can't let you go"
good,It ok majority of the people that have been so long they just bitter and tired and old the money is okay but that's about all it's okay I mean I don't want to say too much but I mean the pay is good but I feel like you're overworked and they don't care they beat you down real bad but the money good though
good,"Costco is a great company to work for, just don't do it in Windsor.  Head office treats Windsor like an afterthought, and the stagnant mgmt. is allowed to destroy the corporate culture through ineptitude and petty cruelty.  Saw many, many examples of bullying and sexist behaviour exhibited by mgmt.  Many excellent employees will be forever overlooked due to the ""old boys club"" in mgmt that has been allowed to thrive for more than a decade."
good,"Most people hold Costco in high regard, but in reality it isn’t all that great. The pay is good, as well as the benefits but other than that it’s mediocre. Work life balance is horrible. Loosely follow their own mission statement. As soon as I find a replacement, I am leaving."
good,The management have no idea how to run a basic day to day operation. There was little to no communication between managers causing cashiers and assistants etc. to deall with the overlap. Not to mentio that the managers are very overworked causing all these problems to begin with.
good,"Es un buen empleo q cuenta con medio tiempo y tiempo completo. Sólo q debes estar dos meses a prueba para q te contraten bn y te den plaza y las prestaciones, pero si no cumples sus expectativas te dejan fuera."
good,"I provided excellent customer service serving drinks, pizza, hot dogs.  I learned how to work the register.  Management was fair and accommodating if we needed time off.  It was a good place to work, people were friendly.  The hardest part of the job was when the lines get long, you hustle more, whuich I feel is part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving my pay."
good,"Pro: Great pay, Great benefits, Paid time off, Excellent Members."
good,"I was employed by Warehouse Demo Services and worked at the Burlington, WA COSTCO. I demonstrated COSTCO inventory (food and other consumables) to Members on scheduled days. The work environment was stressful at times. Interacting with the Costco Members was rewarding, yet challenging at times - as dealing with the Public can be."
good,"Call center position, helping Costco customers find a dealership to purchase their next new or used vehicle. Once a year promotion deals and survey's."
good,For retail could have been worse.  Compensation wasn't bad.
good,"Good upper management. A lot of favoritism within the store. A good job for after retiring, but not for someone with active kids. Overall an okay place to work"
good,"A typical shift is 8 hours with a 30 minute lunch, and two 15 minute breaks. The shifts are super fast paced, which helps the day go by fast, but your breaks also go by very fast. There was nobody assigned to train any of the new hires. They basically threw all the new employees in there, and we had to hope someone would be nice enough to actually help teach. The environment was not warm at all, and the management was unorganized and very difficult to get ahold of. The most enjoyable part was the pay."
good,"Cart pushing was all they made you do and never trained you to be a cashier, you had to manually push the carts by yourself so no machines and the carts are twice the size of any regular cart."
good,"Working in an Ancillary Department at Costco means Management is not familiar with the professional aspect. They are concerned mostly with employees punching the time clock and performing proper inventory and benchmark numbers rather than dealing with the members as patients. Most enjoyable is testing, fitting, counseling members and their families and finding proper solutions to hearing problems. Hardest part is understaffing, lack of appreciation by management, and low salary with small raises compared to outside practices."
good,"Costco pays their cashiers pretty well ($55-60k, this inc bonuses for seniority), but many corporate employees are paid on the same scale, despite doing more complex, demanding tasks. Lots of talk about taking care of employees, but leadership continues to ignore that King County is one of the most expensive areas to live in the US, but they continue to stick with their outdated hourly scales. The few limited ways to make a decent salary are through buying or IT. However, even in those groups, Costco employees are leaving in droves to join Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Boeing, etc. "
good,I worked for Costco for 10 years and watched it slowly decline. It has become a money hungry machine that has no regard for its employees lives or well being. the one thing im great full for is it got so bad that it made going back to school a easy decision.
good,"I'm a college student and there are times I need more hours and times I need less. Every time I ask for a change in hours, its always an issue. Usually you'd get stuck on register. The day goes by so slow while ringing."
good,"Very old school.  Perception is more important than your ability.  You have to be loud and noticeable to get promoted.  All depends who you know instead of what you can do.  Even though they say ""open door policy"", your direct managers want to control you.  They don't teach you.  Their expectation is very high but low pay.  There are lots of dead weight since Costco doesn't fire anybody.  Stability stand point, ti's a good company, but people who should be let go stay.  It's all about seniority."
good,"Lack of professionalism within management. Heavy and repetitive workload falls on hardest working. managers push these people day in, day out to do more with less time."
good,Like the pace. Dont feel that the company cares about anyone other than Costco. They expect that to be your life. Best for someone without a family. Some of the management targets and treats people unfair. Schedule is unsettled and all over the place.
good,"Costco was an upbeat work environment. The management was inconsistent and asked for more than what the entailed when applying for the job. I do believe management has a lot to work on as of communication and compinsation for hard workers. Every day life at costco was easy to handle, 9/10 I was outside pushing carts for eight hours a day. Which isnt safe for your body, I do suggest implementing a rotational system that helps these employess not carry so much stress throughout their bodies. Most enjoyable time I had at Costco was being surrounded by good employees while pushing carts. I've created one great friendship through pushing carts. The hardest thing about working for costco was pushing carts non stop for eight hours a day. Although it was hard I did mange to keep my section and the entire lot clean and appealing to both the customers and management."
good,Costco is a great company to work for. Benefits and wages are among best in retail. It is a very fast paced work environment. Member service is to always be put first.
good,As usual there is more focus in management than on the grunts. And the grunts get shafted. Depending on the department of course it could be better or worse
good,The permanent jobs position the supervisor unless you're not there friends they don't consider you. They don't look at you application. Costco is the only please were the management don't have any previous school or college.
good,"Poor management, no support for invention or trying to advance area of work. "
good,work as a call center support rep can be a bit overwhelming at times. Some days the calls can be too much to handle and the calls can last hours to resolve an issue.
good,to ring the members. get busy as much as we can when the store is slow. learned how to be patient. co workers are nice and built friendships. the most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone is talking to each other without bossing each other and making our job stress free and laugh with each other.
good,"Costco is alright to work for in the short term. on the ground level the folks there are decent and hard working. We all got along pretty well and some good friendships came out of that experience. However as you cast your gaze upwards there is a certain and unmistakable ""Click""  culture from about the supervisory level all the way up to upper management. An almost ""cast"" feel and culture that makes the majority of ground level personnel on the floor feel as though they do not belong and are looked down upon and made to feel they are treated differently. "
good,"Not all locations are the same, my managment team was not easy to work with there was a great amount of unprofessional behaviore, however in other locations it is greatly known that this is a great company to work for. as a morning stoker I began my day at 5:00 A.M threw fraight till opening and from opening till close I boxed groceries."
good,"As seasonal I enjoyed the job but few things did not add up with their culture: no matter how good is your feedback  from managers, you need to have customers apply either for membership upgrade or master card by Capital one.  You don't do it ( I challenge everybody to try after you ran in the store hundreds of times, packed tons of buggies, worked in bakery and helped the return on shelves) and you become almost useless. They have at least 10 people on the floor doing ONLY this: 10 cards a day maybe?"
good,"I have been working there for almost 2 years now and though there are some positive aspects to working there like the pay and flexibility with school, my experiences working for Costco have been negative and I'm not impressed with the way the company works. Yes its true that they treat their employees well, but you basically have to work there for years to get what you want. A company like this runs its ideals based on seniority, so the people who have been there the longest tend to get what they want such as vacation, certain days off and so on. The managers can be nice people, but they really need to do a better job in terms of how they run the company and pick favorites which is lame. They help you out and such by letting you know what needs to be done but communication among employees is absolutely terrible. Work life balance for a college student is better when you're going to school because you only work there weekends, but the summer is horrendous for that. I told my manager that I wanted friday, saturdays off till September and she said it was fine, but these past weeks my days off changed which just ruins your week because you have to change your plans and whatnot and I wasn't even told about it. "
good,"Great pay and benefits. "
good,help members and stocked shelfs. working with coworkers and members with there needs.
good,"I found Costco to be a very unfriendly place to work. Unfortunately I had the unlucky experience of working under a dishonest manager that was very immature and manipulative, he found it entertaining to turn co-workers against each other. My experience was that management in general was continually condescending in a sexist and racial manner without cause, and took credit for everyone elses good work when it mattered. They promoted only favored employees or relatives. The hardest part of the job was dealing with this particular manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually being able to help people and be an integral part of the community. It's just my opinion, but I believe that Costco is in dire need of revamping and/or instituting a management training course, and make it manditory for all managers. Also, any employee should be given a protected avenue for complaints and constructive criticism of store level management to higher management levels, and guaranteed a response, and corrective action taken to maintain the ethics and standards in which Costco claims to have for it's managers. Also, Costco is self-proclaimed in statements about caring about employees, but in my experience I saw just the opposite."
good,I was hired for maintenance. Turns out that’s Janitorial re-named. Treated with absolutely no respect regardless of my work. 3 - 20somethings were wanna be managers and showed no kindness to the janitors. None.
good,"For the short time that i was working at haydock costco i had problems."
good,I was made to feel stupid an was a victim of hazing from a group of friends. I was very miserable when i left. I was not given the right atmosphere to excel.
good,"Not the same company it once was.There was once promise of a career, but quickly you realize that the company culture is being depleted because of the quick expansion. You get the point."
good,this job is good for a 15 year old starting their first job with or without a work permit it teaches you the basics of working and how adult life can be sometimes
good,Advancement opportunities are held for the employees who have been with the company the longest.  This means some of the management does not belong in the rolls they serve and better suited employees are available to full such rolls.
good,"Typical work day was busy."
good,Different warehouses yet management was still intimidating all across the board. Must have a comfortable pair of shoes to help w/ the standing and walking.
good,"They force you to work 10-12 hours a day 6 days a week during ""season"" even though the majority were classified as part-time with part-time benefits they essentially make you work full-time hours without proper full-time benefits. They also make you work overtime in other departments that don't count in the hours that would bump you to full-time. Lots of politics, and BS."
good,"My typical day involves reporting sales, setting up promotions and forecasting for upcoming promotions. I've learned much about forecasting models and accounting issues as well as ways to eliminate them beforehand"
good,"I love most of my co-workers. They're like family to me. Warehouse manager has made it extremely difficult if not close to impossible for in house employees to advance because of the many transfers constantly being brought in and put it on desired positions. This leaves very limited possibilty of advancement for those employees already there. There is a lot of favoritism, politics, hidden retaliation, allowing time and time again certain employees to keep their jobs who are drunk and having to go on constant leaves to clean up. There's a lot of managers who treat the employees like they're children. A lot of over excessive micromanaging to the point of complete ridiculousness. A particular front end manager is what most refer to as a Snatzie. If you go on workman's comp, watch out....management turns on you like snakes and treat you very badly. There's a lot of phoniness from management, supervisors. Have even heard them collectively planning hidden retaliation against employees they do not like or are mad at many times. Scheduling in this warehouse is absolutely horrible! "
good,"Management unprofessional, there’s a Warehouse mentally culture at Costco. Male dominant atmosphere.  The men are lazy, ladies does all the work."
good,Rude management with little to no applicable training. VERY top heavy in terms of management- even as a supervisor you might answer to 9 managers a day who are either all repeating the same instruction or the exact opposite of what the last 8 told you.
good,"If you're a student, you won't get far and they won't take care of you. Management team pushes ridiculous things on you and blow things out of proportion. They hire you under the notion of ""part-time student and full-time during peak holidays"" but end up doing quite the opposite of that."
good,It was just another job that didn't pay enough for the things that they asked you to do. I never really approved of the supervisors and or managers that I worked with. It was a fairly chaotic and stressful run business. I feel like the company has a great reputation but it does not actually deliver on that reputation from the perspective of the people who work there.
good,"This entire company solely relies on seniority, you'll literally never advance regardless of experience or how fit you are for the position applied for; it will always go to the employee with more seniority than you because more than 60% of the company's employees are heavily saturated with 5+ year employees and automatically trump your and does not limit to: experience, quality of work, referral, current or previous position, qualification etc."
good,Extremely fast-paced environment that required an extremely high level of maintenance. Very physically intensive job with high demand for productivity.
good,"I liked my coworkers but there was never any communication when it came to serious work required intel."
good,"Company needs to be more fair in job advancement. Company needs to improve hours for part time benefits, and take complaints about staffing more seriously."
good,"Costco doesn't recognize anyone with degrees which is sad b/c I would make a great manager."
good,"Management could be a little better. Hours are short, constantly having to pick up hours working 6 days for 30 hours. Pay isn't enough for cost of living.  Get moved around a lot which isn't bad for experience."
good,Nothing out of the ordinary of the duration of my employment. Staff and customers were very friendly and easy to assist. heavy lifting was required for some shipments. Not a terrible issue for myself.
good,overall staff and employees over all awful experience. i was completely unhappy the last 6 months i worked there due to the staff and managers not making it good place to work.
good,"Customer service is paramount, When I started in 2000 the atmosphere was fun.  When I left it was a complete 180 degree turnaround.  People would come to work worried about getting replaced due to high rates of pay. (They could hire two new people for the price they were paying for you."
good,toujours incertaint car si tu fait un erreurs ils te change de contract et horaire instable
good,"If you are comparing warehouse jobs to other retailers, Costco is an excellent company to work for. But office staff are treated the same as warehouse employees. Little room for advancement due, and even less if you are not part of the select few who are favored. "
good,"The hardest part of this job is staying out of gossip, doing your job well, while being demoralized, under appreciated & over worked, feels as though you earn your raise to stay at the same take home pay!( under payed!) The work of 4 people can be the task of only two people! They only hire if its in the budget! No help! Hiring process is technical and lots of complaints of how to apply or never called back!"
good,"would not recomend working here seasonally unless you need the money it was a job and it paid the bills for the time during christmas"
good,When I applied at the New Berlin Costco and went in for an interview I noticed that everyone working there was in their twenties. When the 2 managers came out to interview me they were in their twenties too. One of them had a very arrogant attitude. I think this facility discriminates age wise which is bull. I think I can do the job at 40 as well as anyone else! I got hired at a different location but if your 30 or older don't expect this facility to hire you.
good,"Seasonal/temp job more work than compensated, but during busy seasons they provide overtime hours, new hire paid training classes are easy, fast pace work environment and very little support for seasonal employees, sitting down all of your working hours."
good,"I enjoy working with the people there, and dealing with the customers whether pleasant or not. Always have a smile on your face, in any situation. Enjoy working and listening to the radio while working because it makes the time go by fast. Only downfall is not really any chances for full time position because they give full time positions to employees based on senority. When it is slow, they send people home, and don't allow the extra hours if someone is trying to pick up an 8 hour shift"
good,"If you enjoy starting from the bottom and working your way up, as long as you know how to kiss up to the right people regardless of how hard you work...then this is the place for you!"
good,Management does not care about part-time employees. They just care about cutting hours and not giving people enough hours to they can live. That's just the beginning.
good,it pays well as a merchandising job and I appreciate the pay. The management is not the best but the experience is as far as occupation.
good,I worked as a service deli worker. They work you a lot but the pay is ok. It is really only ok if you don't have any bills. You really work by yourself just making food.
good,"good place to work, always busy, benefits available to part time employees, have nice xmas party diverse job force, enjoyed my manager and job mates, met lots of nice people,"
good,"I had a good experience when I was employed at Costco, friendly people. I learned more about how to interact with customers, and found out I was pretty good at it."
good,"Easy work and a great job for college students but must be willing to work every Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday with no guaranteed hours."
good,"No work-life balance.  Constant schedule changing, okay for college or summer job those with active or busy lifestyle."
good,"Work 4AM, extremely non-stop heavy lifting entire shift. Not a lot of help."
good,"A typical day is a blur. Rushing through phone calls, filling prescriptions, taking in new prescriptions, calling doctors, it seems there aren't enough hours in the day."
good,"Costco could use more etiquette when it comes to there employees, for instance supporting employees."
good,Meet all type of people. It just seem as though you didn't have any outside life because they have you working the oddest shifts.
good,"The salary is base on first starting to becoming a manager. The bennefits are good. There are many different shifts that can allow you to adapt to life if need. It is a very high stress job. There are a lot of expectations, without guidance. Not a lot of leading by example. Many rules and they change day to day depending on the emmotions of upper management."
good,"Stressful and with no benefit at all. Everyone works really hard in Costco especially the younger generation and they don't even get free lunch. I was working for CDS Company within the Costco and had no benefit what so ever. After a year gone by, they gave us 10 cents raise only. That was laughable!!"
good,Some employee was fun and great to work with. Learned some tricks about Costco. Would of loved more hours for seasonal time. Too many Chiefs to know which one to listen to. Not enough Indians.
good,"- You become a machine within the corporation - productivity matters more than service interaction "
good,"I was laid off after a month and a half, they misjudged a good employee. Management is suck up, TOO STRICT! They have their mind on money, not on employees."
good,"I was hired on as a part time employee (as they had told me everyone was to begin with) and would have the opportunity to advance after my initial 90 day probationary period. I was only ever given the evening/closing shift to work, and a maximum of 30 hours a week. The opportunity for advancement was notices on the board in the break room that all current employees could see and write their name down for. Seniority took precedence, as it does in every company. These ""opportunities"" were the only way to gain full-time employment."
good,The management was a joke . Treated unfairly as far as hiring details and promises . Never missed a day of work in 3 months yet let go right after Christmas due to favoritism .
good,Managers don’t back you up. Members get whatever they want. Members treat you poorly and get away with it. Poor hours including weekends and evenings.
good,I have previously worked for Costco in San Jose California which I truly loved so much even to grow with. So I decided to work at the Costco in Lacey. Benefits package is great but the hard work you put for hourly pay not good. You work your butt off to get recognition but nope lots of favoritism. They say they have an open door policy but that’s a lot of bull. You can’t get a set schedule especially If you have little ones to spend time with
good,The workplace culture is very competitive. Good overall benefits although it can become very stressful and repetitive after time. The management puts an emphasis on sales over customer needs/satisfaction and forces the Capital One Master Card/ executive membership on customers upon every entry. The most enjoyable part of the job in my experience was the staff and pay.
good,"I was so excited to receive the call to come work for Costco, however, on the first day of orientation we were all told probably half of us won't make through the first 90 days.  I thought to myself... well this is starting out positive.  I am 50 years and everyone else was maybe 25 or younger, but I was like I got this.  I have heard so many great things about Costco."
good,"It’s not a bad place to work, there are a few things that could be improved.....................:::::::::::::::......."
good,"Good benefits,  poor management. They promote their friends first and harass you if you take time off. Ok pay but after you top out you get a 50 cent annual raise."
good,"Wish upper management would accommodate to personal life needs. I asked to have a schedule changed but was told that they couldn’t do it on the front end. I even told them that I’d Do part time and move to any other department in order to get the schedule that I had asked for. But they wouldn’t allow it. I feel as if it is a very stressful work environment, and I always feel like I am being talked down too most of the time and I’m not taken seriously as I should be."
good,ware house manager sucks never work therer if shes there not a fan of them anymore they lost their costco ways employee dont come first its all about sales and the money
good,"Hard to get any advancement like full time due to seniority issues. Management varies per location so some are better than others. Slower times of the years hours get reduced so you're expected to go home early (they ask you to go, you do not have to say yes) ."
good,"Good and solid company with a lot of complacent old timers who need to leave and give space to new, well trained, experienced, and innovative professionals. Upper management is not providing any opportunities to skilled folks unless you're part of their club. If you're looking for a place to grow both personally and professionally, earn competitive salaries,  then look somewhere else."
good,"Bad workplace culture. The managers are rude and they put coworkers against each other by encouraging over the top competition. Unless you are the fastest person they've ever seen, they will find a reason to not like you."
good,"A lots , but A LOTS Gossips, superiors with no skills, they don’t respect employees, no ethics and if the seniority people don’t like you it’s a nightmare and if you are a hard-work you will work more then others  and the lazy ones don’t work hard at all; Privileges to workers with family related , punishment if you’re short with money or, there’s any complaints from customers. They are very unfair, no skills and theres a lots of mean people working there, don’t recommend!!!!!"
good,"-fun, fast pace work environment "
good,"They said it's probably going to be temporary job when they hired me. It was a short experience with little to hope for a full employment but other than that, it was a good experience.  Teaching you to urgency."
good,Decent place if you are comfortable with being undervalued. Nobody ever leaves so you will be stuck at the bottom for a long time before you're able to advance.
good,"depending on which department your working within, it can be very repetitive, friendly people to work with, but some days be very depressing. breaks are timed via a swipe card system , some managers think they own you..."
good,"Sometimes the management at Costco can be hard to deal with."
good,"management quality fluctuates from store to store. biased opportunities for job position advancement.  free membership hardly seems like enough in terms of an ""employee discount."""
good,"It's a clock in, clock out time of work. Some days are good others not so great. Depending on the person they could be totally relaxed or a complete stress case. Working at muiltple wareshouses really showed me that once you find a good warehouse, STAY, do not leave because that next  warehouse could be the worst."
good,manager mainly favored males; didn't get enough hours; very unprofessional; not much training; the best part were the co-workers; the hardest part was dealing with customers who complained about the food
good,"I worked hard, never got praised and even got bullied by my manager.  Customers had a propensity to be rude, and all around my work was never given praise, but was met with scathing critiques whenever something wasn't perfectly executed."
good,"COSTCO is a good place to work for a long term relationship, after working 1,000 hours your wage will increase 1 CAD, it´s really complicated to get a full time job."
good,"When I worked at Costco, I was working 5 days a week, almost 8 hours a day, but was classified as ""part time"". I was hired as seasonal help and was hired on after that. I was a hard worker, and would mostly close 4 out of 5 shifts. I hardly saw my kids. When I complained after a few months of working and closing all the time, I finally got one week where I only closed 2 shifts out of the five. I was treated very poorly by some of the longer time employees because I finally (for one week) wasn't closing 4 of my 5 shifts. Then rumors started to spread about me. It was horrible. I was a hard worker, and I don't think I called in sick one time, even though there were a few times I was really sick."
good,"Prior to warehouse manager leaving for a different branch, my Costco wholesale experience was great. After hiring a new warehouse manager from a different branch everything went downhill. Why change something that works perfectly for something that doesn’t? Change can be good, but not when it throws off the entire operation."
good,"A Nice place to work,very pleasant,customer friendly,product knowledge,positive feedback from the customers,helpful co workers,easy parking, merchandise reasonable, membership reasonable."
good,"Work is more physical than most retail jobs as it is a requirement to transfer transactions from one trolley to another. This is to prevent theft, and includes transferring large orders of heavy goods like soft drinks between flatbed trolleys. The pressure to process orders quickly and to sell executive memberships is stressful and permanent work at Costco would be tiring. However, the pay is slightly higher than the equivalent supermarket job. It is also worth bearing in mind that they demand a temporary worker to be totally flexible, and to work precisely the number of hours detailed in the contract, no more, no less. This makes it unsuitable to fit the job around things like university study or planned social occasions."
good,"No tienes vida personal , quieren que vivas para ellos"
good,"When I started we had a great team, management changed and it went downhill from there. It became more about stockholder money than employee welfare. Employee moral was very low."
good,"Costco is a great place, they offer many benefits that help support your life, even as a part timer, but unfirtinally i find, unless you some how become the best of buddehs with the top managers or have put in at least 10-20 years of service,  respect and freedom are very hard to come by, you are always fighting to keep your head above the water, barely being recognized  for your good deeds but always having your failures thrown at you as a reminder not to do it again... i am making it sound like an -happy place, but i do suggest to give it a shot, i have made new friends and have learned great skills i would not have learned other wise... it may be a little difficult, but what job is-int"
good,There was no structure to the development of everyday goals set for employees to accomplish everyday task. Employees are not respected by supervisors and its a you like me I like you atmosphere
good,A very unfair workplace that bases everything off seniority. They do not really give training and don't really give you time to learn. Management is never on the same accord.
good,its a place to work where you collect a check. if you only have a HS diploma this is the job for you. if you want a education than this is a decent college job.
good,The job was for the Christmas Season and it was the only open store after Hurricane Irma. It was a very busy store and I like keeping myself buys. The day goes faster and I feel more productive!
good,"I was a little disappointed by other employees at my level and not my managers or supervisor, they were really nice in fact. I just did not like the culture there, so I left."
good,"Hired as a seasonal employee with the intentions on staying employed after the holiday season. Had excellent performance reviews with several performance reports from department manager but was told at end of contract that I was hired as part time but no hours nor a position until sometime until April. Management was very inconsistant with company core values and training methods. Hours varied from four hours to six hours mostly on the weekends and were scheduled in the evenings. Associates were very friendly and good to work with but also were stressed with the pay for the amount of hours tht they had to work in order to recieve pay increase. Overall, I would not recommend them as a fair employer."
good,"its very stressful work, managers and supervisor can be really rude there's a lot favoritism. when i started working there many years ago Costco it was family oriented now is 100% corporate america. As  a Hispanic women it was hard for me to get supervisor training or to even be come a manager. It seen like they Preferred white people to be on top of management and most of the managers are men. the hardest part of the job is a lot heavy lifting and you get to stand 8 hours a day."
good,Poor salary and internal guidelines. Managers are mostly incompetent and there is no fear of being fired to the point that most employees dont do anything.
good,I like working for Costco but I disapprove of the way the management team runs the place. Costco organization image is culture and diversity but I haven't seen that yet. What I mean by that is that managers needs to give other than family related members the opportunity to advance within the company for the betterment of the company/business. AND BECAUSE THAT'S THE FAIR AND ETHNICAL THING TO DO.
good,"Everything was extremely inconsistent, hours changed all the time and I was switched from the position I was hired at to a lower position with less hours and lower opportunity to move up. Management is a muddled mess of too many leaders and no communication."
good,"Costco itself is a good company its more like the management some not all that need to work on being fair with everyone . Following the companies rules and not always pointing what we do bad and forgetting to recognize us if we do any good performance . My assistant warehouse manager would aways smoke (vape) during working hours when he when to check the lot . Is that even possible to do , during working hours ?  The chance to move up isn't equally given to everyone some had more than 4 years working while the newbies would get better positions than  some of us that had a very long time with the company or more senority . I believe that rules are meant for a reason , in my experience these rules were not use fairly for me . But its a great company I work there  for almost my  entire work career . Working in the morning  merchandise department and then switching to the night merchandise department was a great time ."
good,"The first Warehouse Manager was one of the best Managers I have ever worked under; a true Leader. The last was a Manager, only interested in the title and the prestige it brought him. "
good,"Fast paced job"
good,"Costco is a good company just not enough hours for me personally, I tried many time to get cross training in other department as they stated we would be ,but no one want wants to take time to train you unless they are in a bind ,I think they should have meeting with everyone instead of random employees so we can all be on the same page with everything"
good,Management sucks and moving up is an option but they harass the managers so it gets passed down the line. I personally wouldn't want to work 60-70 hrs a week for what the managers make... they make less per hr than the reg employees because they are  salaried
good,"Works well with school schedule, but other than that, hours suck. Advancement is difficult, and efforts often go unrecognized. Management here is not optimal. There are a couple good managers."
good,Usually worked from 3 - 11:30. You are busy all the time which is nice because your day goes by fast. most enjoyable part of the job was that there was usually food in the staff room for people to have. hardest part of the job was having to put up with the lack of logic in some tasks. workplace culture was alright. co-workers are (for the most part) awesome people to work with. Management...could use some work.
good,"It's a decent place to work and the company as a whole is very reputable. Unfortunately it's usually part-time 20-30 hours fluctuating, and the management was a clique that poorly schedules day, night, day, night in every week which was too difficult to handle. The store is massive as well so you really have to prepare for too many customers, too much walking, and dodging forklifts right away. "
good,"Besides the pay, working for Costcos  was not a place I would recommend someone to work for. They do not care about their people as much as they should."
good,"Costco is a great company that really tought me a lot about myself. It was fast paced, a very successful company, but they don't treat their employees with a whole lot of respect"
good,"No recomiendo a nadie trabajar para Costco (España)."
good,"The job I had at the gas station involved dealing with the weather, auto fumes and noise.  You had to be certified to work out there, which made it hard to get a break or lunch and there was no restroom at the gas station, only in the store.  You could not sit and standing on concrete was hard on the lower body."
good,I really wish the employees such as management would not be so one sided as in they can do what ever including breaking company policy and not face any consequences but if u do the smallest thing wrong they wanna flex there muscles and try n write you up....double standards gsrbage.
good,The job involved a high call volume. I had to utilize a variety of web sites and shipping companies to process the customers questions. I was required to work independently and diffuse upset customers.
good,"seasonal, didn't last long and the team members are lazy. "
good,While working for Costco it was a good experience. With an exception when they decide to removed the OT and everyone to leave on time. This has prevented us not to cook Rotisserie chicken after a certain time cause it takes a while to clean the ovens and not able to complete our cleaning on time.
good,Great compensation but if you get hurt they will do everything in there power to push you out the door. The management does not care about safety only profitability.
good,"I came into the meat department here at Costco with over 5 years experience running a similar department elsewhere.  Despite more experience than most already in the department, I have applied 3 times for a higher position and been overlooked."
good,"Nice place to work, employees were nice, and very clean work environment, would have been great if it was full-time position. Close to trolley station so getting to and from was easy."
good,"Worked P/T at Chantilly store, hours and days off assigned the week before. For the most part my coworkers were fun to work with.  The hardest part of the job was trying to strike a balance between corporate policies and local requirements...Interacting with our regular customers was highly enjoyable."
good,"I am a well rounded employee at Costco, switching between the bakery, cashier, and forklift driver. In the bakery I use my analytical skills to prioritize what needs to go on the floor. It is very high paced and a lot of pressure. I always stay calm and get my job done on time. As a cashier I spend most of the day cashiering because I am recognized as an fast and efficient worker. At the end of the night I operate the forklift and lead a team of co-workers in the stocking process."
good,"Hours have to be fought for, and are consistently changed. The people who work there are young and fun mostly, however, they sometimes do not focus on the customer enough, Management was poor. They constantly made scheduling mistakes and at times were incompetent."
good,"Great pay and fun work place, The hardest part is no one to help you close when someone calls out. The most enjoyable part is when all your co workers work together to get things done. Management can be a little shaky at time depending on what the reason is. You have to learn your co workers so you can have a good shift or day."
good,"Pros"
good,Working at Costco was only a seasonal position.  I didn't get to know the crew or management very well.  The hardest part of the job was not being trained the way we needed to be trained.
good,"enjoyed aspects of this job."
good,"I worked with nice and dedicated people here. But, the job is physically challenging and has no place for growth."
good,"I love the management they had a good sense of humor, and made working with them more fun but I didn't work with them all the time. I understand that all jobs have drama but I feel there was a lot at this location. I never really thought that we were co-workers, we didn't work together as a team. The hardest part of my job was the schedule that was never consistent and in the down season, it makes it almost impossible to work a second job to make ends meet."
good,"the work days at cotsco were very busy, and very demanding. In the beginning it was fun to work there and its hard to get in there as well so once you get in you your laughing (figuratively) a day is rough your either packing carts, pushing carts, your a runner of products the customer may have forgotten or no longer wants if its to be refridgerated, or you can be doing all 3. The most enjoyable"
good,was a good work place to be honest.. warehouse was well organized and ran with unity ..
good,At Aldi I was responsible for unloading the truck at 5 am and getting the store set up to be open at 9am. Customer service is number one priority followed by keeping the store in stocked and clean. I was also responsible for balancing a cash drawer every shift and keeping cash under control. Aldi is very fast paced and each employee must work independently without having to be watched constantly.
good,drove a forklift for 25
good,"ok, plays favorites, once your on the outside of the favorites you can't get on the inside"
good,I was sexually harassed by deli manager and was forced to transfer departments without notice. New department did not want to work with existing schedule.
good,"You could have the best crew in the world stocking shelves but if the manager they work for has no idea what they are doing, or abuses their position it creates a toxic work environment."
good,Never was told my position was seasonal quit my job of 24 years for a great opportunity and was surprised and disappointed. Seasonal help are degraded and treated like SCABS.
good,It is hard to succeed and feel like your work is purposeful with only negative reinforcement. Management may not be properly trained on best management styles and techniques.
good,Working hard is required.If you are not willing to put in effort you will not do well in this environment. Learning new skills and adapting is key to succeed at Costco.
good,"A great experience to have with wonderful co-workers. The most enjoyable part about working there was definitely meeting a lot of new people, considering there are over 400 employees in one warehouse. The hardest part of the job was definitely the customer service aspect. You get the good and you definitely get the bad."
good,Your live is heavily determined by your supervisor and manager. If a manager has it out for you then it is very likely your hours will change. Seasonal demands might create changes in your department or schedule.
good,"Costco has its own culture that I didn't see benefit as to the reality of life outside of Costco. The expectations of your life being second to the ""greater good"" and ""common"" goal of Costco seemed to be a bit higher than many places I have worked. I often had this question in the back of my mind when offended by managers, supervisors and some co-workers ""Are you serious?!"" It was totally ""out there"". It was a literal plantation. Except you get paid. That's the only thing that qualified it as a job. Many of the supervisors, in my opinion, carried a figurative whip in their pockets ""just in case"" someone got ""out of line"" and decided that they actually had an opinion that was important to their lives as individuals."
good,Starting pay was higher than most jobs. Health insurance was great. Even for part time employees. Schedule wasn't too bad. Hard to get a full time position because of seniorities. The warehouse I worked at in particular - the atmosphere was very toxic and very divided. Management didn't really keep this matter under control because a lot of them played favorites. I would recommend this job for students and people just looking for a better paying job than their current situation.
good,"Costco is a great place to work, but most of the employees that were either promoted to management positions or were already managers were too young, too immature, not management material. If you are age of 50+ on up, the young managers had would age discriminate and treat you much differently from their younger-aged workers - always made to work the late-shifts and weekends more than the the younger-aged workers."
good,Customer service is number 1. there is no typical day one day you could be doing your assigned job description duties the next you could be covering a sick call and helping out where needed.
good,There is a loss of what costco culture was when first beginning. Advancement opportunities are there. Depending on management some opportunities go to favorites. The ethics that used to matter are slowly being looked over. Focus is more on Member and sales then growing employee and expanding their business.
good,My school schedule was hardly ever accommodated. I had a manager scream in my face once and was using swear words. I had reported a fellow employee who sexually harassed me and it was never addressed.
good,"lots of busy days and conflicting ideas from people in management. they can be lazy, and a lot of the people are grumpy to work with, with good pay, but it is all based on time worked, not performance."
good,working at Costco is fine but if takes a long time to get fulltime. and management has terrible communication skills. at least at the location Im working at but the benefits and pay are pretty good.
good,"If you have worked anywhere in retail, you know Costco is supposed to be the best type of retail out there. In my experience it was just okay. The pay was very low and there was very little advancement opportunity."
good,willing to clean and keep food logs. also willing to help assist customers. customer service is very important when working here. also willing to work hard and long
good,"The front end is a nightmare. You are treated like you are replaceable, and the managers are constantly changing, bringing new rules you have to follow based on their own idea of how the front end SHOULD run. Employees who have worked there for upwards of 20 years are treated like they just started. Sick time is accumulated slowly, and in a place that deals with so many people there are a lot of chances to get sick. Management's way of dealing with this? ""Don't get sick"". Just don't do it. Breaks are short, you are told when you get a break by the supervisors, and always later than they tell you they will be. You get in trouble for being even a minute late back from break, doesn't matter why. If the supervisors like you, you get earlier shifts. If they don't like you, you get all the closing shifts. This is very disheartening when new employees get morning/afternoon shifts and you've been there for a long time. They won't let you request specific shifts, so say goodbye to a constant schedule. You have to be available all hours of the week in case they call you in. They give you 40 hours a week for 5 weeks in a row, but then bring you down to 35 hours just so they don't have to move you to full time."
good,I said it all up to now let me post my review before I give up... So much for the easy way out. I'm not upset with nothing but I wish I had ten years in already
good,"I worked at Costco for two years. "
good,"Costco Wholesale pretends to care about their customers or as my manager would correct me and say ""members."" I soon realized that Costco doesn't care about the customers as they do the profit of the store together. Simple things like refusing to provide certain items members asked for like the stack of zip lock bags which about five people asked for in the first six months I worked there. The level of advancement is hit or miss if you have poor relationships with your co-workers or managers you will find it hard to advance in the store; however, it takes a year or two to even switch departments or to climb the ladder a step so if you are just a college student you will find it hard to get a decent schedule and will always be stuck with poor hours. This job rewards long-term commitment and doesn't promote short-term hard work or care about your social life. My manager didn't care for college students working from 7:00 PM- 11:00 PM 5 nights in a row with one 8 hour on Saturday was not enjoyable and most the time I was able to close fast and would leave early with no extra pay or anything for the same amount of work. Almost as if I was punished for being a good worker but this is usual for most corporations. I was only getting like three hours a day plus the one 8 hour I got on the weekend. Working six days as a student was not enjoyable. However, if you are looking for a job long-term and career-wise most of the older people working at the Costco I worked at disliked their job but and the benefits were the only reason why they enjoyed working at Costco the people that didn't have"
good,"No structure in the job. No training. All taught by word of mouth do you never know if you’re actually doing your job correctly. And dont bother to tell corporate about ideas on how to improve workflow, they dont want to hear it."
good,"Management isn't that great, I found it really political. Showing up even a minute late looks very bad on you and is used against you even though there are 30 people scanning in at the same time, so you're bound to punch in late here and there. People are very nice that work there, the pay isn't as great as people make it out to be. Rises are baised on hours worked there, not by performance which I disagree with strongly. Don't work too hard as it's not recognised or appreciated."
good,"Very quick.  Working outside rain, cold and snowing.  If not outside working next to cashiers loading customers merchandise in carts.  Always being supervised."
good,I was penalized for being late multiple times after my schedule had changed and I was not notified. Managers didn't seem to care about personal issues.
good,"Restocking items , cleaning up around the store , scanning items making sure their in the right place cashier helping with customers making sure everyone is happy."
good,"If management and the amount of workers they scheduled were efficient, it would be a great place. I use to enjoy working there but now not so much. It is the lack of management."
good,I worked for the people making the samples and stuff. It was a stressful job because it was somewhat commissioned. the less we sell the less our hours were.
good,"Hours were supposedly based on seniority, however that was not how it seemed to work. I wish that my schedule could have been a little more consistent."
good,"i am part time of meat assistant in costco.They only paid us minimum pay when i employed.I am got 25 cents extra because i have been worked 1040 hrs on Oct,2018..Costco has lot of work in each dept and they will push  u work fast(they want u work like robot).Their schedule for every week   different ,u have to available from Mon to Sun 6am to 11pm at any time.They only guarantee at least 25hrs a week.Some weeks u get 30hrs,some weeks u get 28 or 35hrs.If u lucky u will get 40hrs,but no more than 40 hrs because they dont want pay overtime..........they are liar they advertisement they paid competitive wages(basic pay)."
good,"not a bad job"
good,"irrational shift times. extremely busy.  It was great for when i was wokring and doing school, untill i needed days of for school reasons but management most of the time did not let me get days off because of how busy and understaffed the place was."
good,not much room for growth in my position (special skilled maintenance) required more responsibility with same pay ... the stress levels in retail are over the top
good,"Training is sub-par, communication with management is difficult to come by, hours can be absolutely rending, and efficient use of time is valued above all else. "
good,Everything as for benefits and pay is great but the only downside would be management and supervision because it is just very corrupt and unfair how some of them would treat employees and didn't comply with some rules and i was suspicious of how some of them would be under the influence while working.
good,"Costco is a great place to start a career for those whom are fresh out of high school.  I don’t recommend starting a “career” with Costco to those with extensive management and customer service experience as your skills are overlooked.  Opportunities for advancement are given to current employees with more tenure making career growth a painstakingly, stagnant process."
good,Not a bad place to work if you get a job in the right department. Morning Merchandising was difficult with the requirement to start your day at 3am. Hard to get the easy jobs that everyone wants like standing at the door looking at receipts.
good,Tooo borint and also hours a given in a weird order. Also alot of walking and management isn't fair its basicailly if your friends with managers you will progress
good,"As starter summer jobs go, Costco was normal. However, the culture was lacking, and management somewhat lacking in their positions. I do not recommend."
good,"I worked there because I needed a source of income and the money I was making was the best I had made yet. While that was nice, I didn't enjoy the job. More quick-paced than I prefer, people didn't seem to happy that worked there, and I am not a fan of retail type jobs. When I felt like I was doing a good job and doing what I was supposed to, as soon as a manager came over all I heard is how I wasn't doing good enough which really makes you feel like you're always questioning what you're doing and not making any kind of progress regardless of how long you work there."
good,"The crew did not really get along well together, the managers didn't seem involved in their employees so no one really liked the managers. They didn't seem to get involved with the crew if they needed help."
good,"It was a decent enough job, work was good but repetitive. Management was mediocre at best, really high expectations, not much guidance."
good,I just personally feel like there needs to be constant work instead of working two days then off for 3 so not a really good pay check at the end of the week and only making 12$ an hour.!
good,"A fun environment to work in. However scheduling for part-timers I found to be impractical with little room for compromise. Good full-time wages and benefits.The physical aspect of the job is great for sprightly individuals. However, the inclement conditions can be taxing."
good,"Reginal VP's and higher are ruining this company. They demand unreachable goals, and give horrible mandatory advise. Senior management is to scared to stand up for the employees under them."
good,"wasn't the best place to work because of the management, but the company is a great company to work for. the pay is better than most part-time jobs iin the area and you get insurance. That was the best part. The job was easy and i liked it, i just hated management and how i was treated."
good,"Costco is an okay place to work. It is hard to advance without relocating and even then, it is very competitive to move up the ladder. The management is decent depending on location."
good,"Was told everyone started out as seasonal and that if you worked hard you would be called back. Was told I was a good worker but that  they were letting all seasonal employees go. I found out shortly after, that they had posted open positions for the department I worked in. Was hoping to hear back from Costco, but never did. Seems like they just want to hire seasonal and are not interested in hiring any more permanent employees."
good,"Repetitiveness , would always stay outside getting shopping carts. Never moved to assist in other departments . Would forget you were out there and think you weren't doing your job when getting water."
good,Good fast paced place to work with great employees and great benefits.   Hours are long for managers and you are required to work for 12 hours or longer and one day of the weekend.
good,"A typical day at work: Usually trying to sell our product."
good,"Typcal day at work you would "
good,"The environment is quick-paced but doesn't take long getting used to and the pay is good compared to other retails. The only problem is they will literally make anyone manager and all they do is walk around drinking coffee and talking while watch over you waiting for you to mess up. It is as if they are literally looking for any little reason to let you go. There is a lot of favoritism, with some people not having to do anything and hang out in the breakroom all day getting recognized and letting go or punishing those who are actually working hard.  Very unfair environment. Schedules are never put up on time and never secure and 9/10 times you never get the day you request off."
good,"I worked at Costco for 9 years and it is an extremely competitive place to work and people are often passed over for promotions that they are qualified for. Nepotism runs rampant in every store that I have heard of and if you aren't part of the ""in"" crowd you will likely be stuck in an entry level position until you decide to quit or are fired for some arbitrary reason."
good,"Yo la verdad consideraría entrar de nuevo a una empresa donde le dan prioridad a otras cosas antes que a los empleados. Se preocupan mas por la operación antes que al empleado. Cuando se le quiere perjudicar, se le ataca por los horarios rolados y por la disponibilidad. Pedir un fin de semana para estar con la familia era imposible. Parecía que los estabas insultando. El trabajo es bueno pero la gente tóxica que suelen contratar no tanto."
good,Costco is best place to work in retail with good benefits and salaries. Have to be flexible and can work all different hours and shifts. Costco is good to develop a career as they only promote from within the work place
good,Very fast-paced. There is always work to be done on the clock. You are always moving and talking with either co-workers or customers on a daily-basis.
good,"I thought the management wasn't that friendly. They were really strict on your breaks/lunches. When you push in carts, everyone on the front end is supposed to take turns and spend about an hour out there. They left me out there for 3 hours in the 98 degree weather. The often got mad that I would sit down and drink water because not enough carts would be getting pushed in. You were only allowed to push in 10 carts at a time. If they saw you doing more, you'd be written up and if you were still in your 3 month probation, you'd be fired for getting written up."
good,highly stressful atmosphere...management only looks at benchmarks and not the overall picture....working in a 2 million dollar optical department but management upset that benchmarks are low...the more you work the more they want....really disappointed
good,"Decent job, however after the probationary period management decided to lay off all the seasonal employees to cut costs, and without prior notice. Otherwise the managers and other employees were very helpful with training, and never made any unreasonable demands out of the seasonal (new part-time) workers."
good,"A typical day involved assisting the pharmacist in the daily operations of the retail pharmacy.  This included the intake of written, electronic and faxed prescriptions, evaluating the document to ensure it was completed correctly and processing the prescriptions.  I also retrieved drugs off the shelves to count  the dispensed quantity and return the drug to its proper place on the shelf.  An other responsibility was to receive and verify the daily order.  I also stored the filled prescription according to the appropriate method and also completed the sale of the prescription by operating the cash register and having the customer sigh the proper electronic documents."
good,"This company offers excellent medical insurance and starting salaries but shows quite a bit of favoritism and bias when promoting its employees. Not sure if this is company wide or just based on region or location but, there are a LOT of supervisor and management positions that are occupied by sons, daughters, husbands, wives, as well as boyfriends and girlfriends of upper management at different locations within our region."
good,Costco Food Service requires the ability to communicate at a high and perform with a level of precision. The culture is easy going but high stressed when planning has not taken place. Employees are expected to follow daily sanitation logs before and after business hours. During business hours emplyoess are expected to ring orders as well as complete pic-up orders for pizzas over the phone. The most challenging part about this job is maintaining pizza orders when the business is moving at a rapid pace.
good,A normal day at work is mostly centred around keeping the place clean and helping customers find what they are looking for while answering any questions they may have.-
good,"No offence to the warehouses who's management rocks, but the management my warehouse had was horrible. There was nothing but favoritism and nepatism within the warehouse. It took me 2 years to get out of the food court, even though they would always tell my team that they'd transfer one of us to the front end before hiring new people. Yet they hired new people all the time. During my supervising interview, my manager told me I was too young to be promoted and then brought up rumors within the department to see how I'd respond. He didn't listen to facts, he only listened to his favorite's opinion. He expected perfection from all of the employees, and when we messed up, we'd get a coaching immediately. All of us. Not just a single person. We had no room for error or we'd get written up. He even told me that if I failed a college course then he'd write me up for accomodating my school schedule for nothing. Yet, he required ALL school schedules and even a screenshot from my computer screen with the time and website address highlighted in order to accomodate my school schedule. And he'd still make me work on my school days because someone else already asked for that day off before I did.. even though school classes are REALLY important. It just sucked. Costco needs to hire managers from the outside and not just from the inside. Most of them run their departments through intimidation and the warehouse managers let them get away with it."
good,"I learned that retail does not fit my definition of a professional. If you never change and all you care about is money and job security, then Cost Co is a safe, repetitive, unchanging, emotionally demanding job. The problem is people do change and care about their labor. To actually become what in a capitalistic society is worth then get educated and leave Costco, otherwise lay back make an inflated amount of money, that does not obey the laws of demand and supply. Enjoy Groundhogs day Cost co employee."
good,"part time hours are anywhere from 25 hrs/week-40hrs/week.full time is 40 + hr/week. part time employees do not get benefits even working full time hours because the company doesn't want to promise the hours."
good,You can advance at Costco depending on who you know and who they know. Some people there rarely advance without that but for the part those warehouses are based off employee politics. Some of the employees have been there from 3-25 years and never get a chance to reach higher levels. Costco employment is what you make it.
good,"stock or clean to the way they wish it to be"
good,"I was told that I was hired for a cashiers assistant. Basically putting all the customers good back into their cart. But when I started, they told me that they needed me outside pushing carts. This went on for months. I was miserable walking 15-20 miles A DAY. No way I could move up, seniority is big there. I'm sure it's a great company, but it left a bad taste in my mouth."
good,Management could use improvement at St. Peters location. Some employees get away with doing nothing while others are expected to do everything. Poor morale amongst employees. Good pay for retail.
good,there are many opportunities for advancement because of growth in the area. However the opportunities are limited within each location. You may have to relocate to secure a better position.
good,not very enjoyable no movement and no big support from any managers. good for people who like an easy unproductive job was let go for doing my job. managers know nothing about loss prevention
good,The Costco in Norfolk was interesting to say at best. I was not given many opportunity's to excel for advancement due to all positions being full or having other employees there with more years of experience. Management did not treat all employees equally and often played favorites with staff that were relatives with the supervisors. Ideas and recommendations where thrown out the window. The general manager was very unprofessional and often talked bad about his employees to other employees.
good,"Pays not so good,especially for vancouver,part time employee don't get treated very good there,low pay and no hours.."
good,"Normally I would put customers' items into boxes and into their carts for them as well as assist them out if they needed it. I also would fold up the clothing area and keep it tidy as well as keep the cash register area clean and mess free."
good,"Overall satisfaction can depend heavily upon your coworkers. Having worked at two different locations, this can show extreme differences in morale. This is an excellent job, but not a good career. New job opportunities within the company are extremely limited."
good,Great work environment. Costco provides great benefits for part timers as well as accommodates for student employees. Management frequently changes so expect a lot of inconsistency.
good,"Typical work day was long and very fast paced in the food court. The pressure to work faster/harder was not condusive for a productive day. Being a union made it difficult to work hard because you were rewarded/accomodated based on seniority, not performance. Best part of the job was smelling delicious pizza all day and some of my co-workers were easy to get along with. Management was not very forgiving, so you had to really watch yourself. It was a good job to have as a young person just trying to earn a paycheck, you will work for every cent of it."
good,Working for Costco Wholesale is a great starting job for people new to the working world. Ability to learn valuable skills on the job and work with people from all different walks of life.
good,I work with hi tech beauty supplies in warehouse shipping and reviving. From 1994 to 2014. I like to find  warehouse job or. Any type of job bet I have been working for this company from long time
good,A good paying job that you need lots of energy for. A Typical day at work would be working along side cashiers and packing members carts.The hardest part of the job is that you are on tour feet a lot and and it can take a toll on your body.
good,"my typical day at costco is to show up figure out what dish im sampling to the public. get all supplies needed for that sample . set up sampling table and samples and start sampling away, telling customers the deals on each item and nutritional facts and having the customer sample one of each flavor and try to up sale the item. Then at the end of shift i gather all my left over samples and cart and wheel them away to do dishes and clean up for the next day. My most enjoyable part of the work day was trying to up sale. i love competition."
good,"Costco is a good company but could be much better. , work is hard everyday , i have learned how to mount tires on to a rim. the management is really up tight. the hardests part of the job is working with rude customers."
good,At Costco I learned to be quick and organized.  It was a pleasure to work and help out my fellow workers.  The most enjoyable part of this position was interacting with customers
good,"I spent over 13 years at this company, and learned just about every job within it. It was originally an entry-level job for me, but I quickly became a Human Resources Assistant, then a Payroll Clerk, and a Sales Auditor. Over time, I transferred to another union store, and wound up learning a whole new set of skills within that location."
good,"I have learned many skills while working at the Costco Distribution Centre. I was constantly around people, which helped me gain confidence, initiative, and the necessary social skills to move and grow throughout the company. I also learned to handle appointments with the company and was constantly thrown into a fast paced work environment."
good,"I worked front end, bakery, deli, food court. Got my Food Handlers. No set schedule or while on the job. No set hours."
good,"Very hard working fast paced environment, very little room for advancement. Management very laid back and lazy injury is high. You get what you put in good to make some short time cash."
good,"No job was secure because everyone wanted to work there for the money. The management was not understanding with employees working and going to school. That is why I had to leave this company. Veteran employees will always have the better schedule, no matter what your life needs."
good,"Working here has really taught me the value of patience, personally, professionally. At this job, they really train you in every department and allow you the ability to learn new things."
good,I have worked at Costco almost 10 years and it is good for benefits  and pay but not your soul.  Honest you have to put up with a lot to get the pay and benefits.  There is very little room to move up.  For example been part time for 9 years.  I have to put up with a lot disrespect.  It also there no work life balance since they tell you at the last minute when you are working and change it on you.  Great company to work for if your hire up and can handle the bull.
good,"a typical day at work started with grabbing a cart, some boxes, your bag with your allergy sign, table cloth, plastic table cover, hat, hairnet, and apron and putting on your hairnet and hat before heading over to the office to find out what product(s) you were demonstrating that day, retrieve all necessary paperwork, some necessary supplies such as 4-5 bags or boxes of large or small paper muffin cups or serving cups, and all of your purchased product(s) (if said product was food or drink). after everything needed from the office was in your cart you then headed to the back of the store and kitchen to grab your table or cooking cart and the rest of your supplies such as dishes before heading to set up where your product was located (or where 1 product was located if demonstrating multiple products) or before heading to cover a coworker if doing the later shift. once you arrived at your location for the day you set up your table, put the table cloth and plastic table cover on your table, put on your apron, put all needed supplies (such as 2 plastic serving trays) on the table put the boxes under the table with any supplies that wouldn't be needed immediately such as extra napkins and product, put all signs and price tags under the plastic table cover along with all paperwork and writing utensil, plugged in appliance if one was needed, prepared product by cooking it if necessary or putting it in a bowl start serving customers until your lunch break. at the time of your lunch break you either shut down your table if there was no one coming to relieve you or waited for one of your"
good,"I enjoyed working at Costco because I'm a hard worker and there was always plenty to do. The management however, wasn't good in that warehouse. They wouldnt approve transfers to another store and they get rid of all the employees who reachs higher pay to hire two more employees to replace them. I actually was surprise I lasted as long as i did there because everyone who was hired with me was let go years before me."
good,"i don't like working here... customers are idiots, management is worse and the pay is the worst.."
good,Everyday you come into work and it was the same thing. Stock and inventory pallets of groceries. That pretty much was a typical work day. Waking up at 1 in the morning to be at work by 2 was also one of the toughest things about this job.
good,Frond end is tough for assisting cashiers. Customers are grouchy and entitled often and get upset if it's just a little busy or you don't box their stuff PERFECTLY.  Even as a cashier they monitor your customers per hour and make it more stressful than it needs to be. Working outside doing carts and gas station was the best because you don't have a manager constantly breathing down your neck and being stressed out around you. I worked in the bakery a bit too. It was pretty good. Stocking is a great job as long as you like early morning hours or late night hours only.
good,"It's a job. The work isn't too hard or too overloading. The hours kinda suck. They give you a decent amount of hours but the times you work most of the time end up taking up most of the day and most places are closed before you leave work. "
good,Costco is a great place to work at if you do not go to school or have anything else that can get in the way. They pay you well but management is not well experienced.
good,Pay is good great benefits but your schedule is all over the place sometimes you only get one day off. But it is a good place to work for in the end .
good,"Feels very impersonal. This is a big company - and the job can feel very assembly-line-ish. They do watch you like a hawk. If that's not your style, this job is not for you. There is not much time for comrade-ery with other team members (in fact, it seems to be discouraged). Most supervisors and managers are great, but company-policy breaks are too short --- not even enough time to eat, and the in-store food stand wait time can eat up a lot of your break time (tip: Bring your own lunch!). Too much emphasis on shareholder profit and happiness over employee security and happiness. Great emphasis on safety, however. Not a terrible job though, tolerable."
good,I need to make time to take my child to there babysitter and they would keep uping the times we need to be at work (5am) when most place don't open that early for childcare.
good,the employees are great and very kind but the higher staff members are rude and lazy nor do they put your own personal interest first. They don't pay attention and some just sit on their phones all day
good,"Costco as a whole is a good workplace, unfortunately my warehouse was one of the worst directed. Management over the years have cared less over our companies values and more about the money they bank for themselves. Money is fair at costco allowing you to stay just far enough ahead, but the way it is run, is not enough to keep lasting employees."
good,"I started seasonally at a non-union store and ended up getting a regular part-time position at a union store.  There are several key differences in culture and management styles more reflective of the individual leadership between the two locations.  Unfortunately, I cannot disseminate whether the behavior I've observed is coming from corporate directives or only the management I directly engage with at my union store.  "
good,"Costco was a a seasonal position, common warehouse duties. Stock, replenish, clean, greet, fold clothes, plus cashier duties. Unfortunately Costco managers made a group of seasonal employees believe we would be permanent just to be rotated with a group whom was let go and brought back on board to lay off the group that was promised a permanent position.. later the second group was let go as well."
good,"The company is very friendly but lack of common IT culture due to the management non IT background. The entire management from manager to director, VP, CFO are all without much IT background which make the IT department low efficient, compare with Costco business, IT is really down."
good,"This place is great but the managers are not so helpful they need to watch and evaluate them every month, I try my best to be nice to keep the job ..."
good,"Overall, Costco is a fantastic company to work for. Towards the end of my time at Costco there became a constant cloud of heavy micromanagement over all employees. It went from a rather lax and enjoyable experience to uptight and highly annoying. But I can only speak for the location that I was at. I am not sure how other Costco's are."
good,"El ambiente dentro de la óptica no es para nada sano, aunque el sueldo es fijo y no comisionas el clima laboral está lleno de envidias, los mismos compañeros te ponen el pie. NULA posibilidad de crecimiento si no tienes conocidos o gozas de los favores de la gerente. "
good,"Good solid employer some difficulties with young unexperienced managers who take the side of customers over the truth of what occurs, even when doing my best to help customer, going above and beyond to help, then being condemned for my efforts."
good,literrally wanted me running around the store - not really sure what OSHA would think abuot this in a warehouse  environment.  double standards by some managers.
good,the work was challenging in a good way but the management was more worried about numbers and pushing people to do things they didn't want to. By time I left I was going most of the work a supervisors would do. not being paid for the extra responsibility and they would not give me a full time position. the manager of the bakery was always yelling at everyone. to the point were i would cry when i got home and I'm not a crier. I do want to note that also when i  left the store i was at was under going a change in store management so all these negative things listed above could be mute in point. like i said good company with really good benefits just a bad store with the wrong mesh of  upper management .
good,Depends on your work location.  There is good job security but as a result they keep some people who are lazy negative and contribute very little.  While they have good ethical policies they are difficult to enforce so that is all I have to say.
good,"When I was at Costco, I learned that the job can be exhausting. The typical day at work was draining because the job is mostly physical. What I learned at Costco is keep yourself up with energy as much as you can. The workplace culture can vary depending which department you are at. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day while the enjoyable part is resting up on your breaks."
good,"Overworked, under appreciated, management and union reps are working together, leaving the hourlies to fend for them selfs . i learned that no matter where you work  you will have to deal with politics, storytelling, abuse of power and lyes. The upper management doesn't talk to the hourlies. They use intimidation and fear of losing your job to pressure you not to defend yourself."
good,Costco is a company that provides a lot of jobs in multiple departments. Costco is a fast-paced work environment that is in high-demand and requires a sense of urgent from the employees. The job culture and environment is open and friendly. Job advancement completely lies within the hands of the management and managers.
good,"As all corporate business run there are biases. Management isn't interested in employees well being. (at this location) A typical day is hectic, busy and under staffed. Theres usually 3 supervisors to every 1 employee. Seniority plays a huge roll even if the person isn't a hard worker."
good,I found that at least on my location there wasn't much in regards to teamwork and a lot of the other staff in my team took a lot of shortcuts on their job. There were some opportunities for advancement but limited. I did get to help on other departments and management was okay for the most part.
good,"My role at Costco was very fast paced and labor intensive. I was responsible for the poultry production at the Seattle warehouse. I would open, close, and clean the production room. Addtionally I would work in the Service Deli as needed, and would also help other departments with their work if needed. I was also responsible for training new-hires. I learned great customer service skills, food safety, food prep, and order processing."
good,"The training is basically videos about general stuff that won't help you at all. Then, they just put you in the area you are supposed to work and the training there is was less than a minute. Then, everyday you will go to the break room leave everything there, then  punch and go to your area. You work in your area and then punch at the end of the shift. The supervisors put personal preferences over who work the hardest. Don't you dare punch earlier or later."
good,"Benefits and pay are good but to advance, it felt like you needed to be a huge brown noser. Favouritism is very obvious towards certain workers who do a lackluster job, while others who work hard get the short end of the stick. Office management is horrible, they pick and choose which rules apply to which people at their convenience.  "
good,"Costco is a large corporation specializing in wholesale of products. The shear volume of sales done on a single day requires many different departments to all run smoothly from start to finish. Sadly, communication among upper management is so poor at the moment that whole departments can be left without a single closing employee and the department manager won't be told until they go looking for said employee. This causes management to force employees from one department into another with no formal training to ""just get it done."" The better you are at adapting to this revolving door of departments, the more they will move you from day to day, and even within a single day. 6 jobs is my current record for a single 8 hour  shift. It wears down on the moral of many workers and seems completely avoidable. Costco has an employee agreement that is very good at protecting workers from having 2 shifts within 8 hours of each other and other abuses of that nature and HR is very good. But if you only work nights, you never see them. And unless you have a medical reason for not doing a certain job, nothing protects you from this kind of abuse. When your job title is a sales assistant, you should not have to prepare slip resistant, water proof boots for covering the meat department, or a heavy winter coat in summer just in case freezers need stocking. This is only a fairly recent occurrence, happening over the last 3 of the 8 years I've been with the company, so there is a chance it might just be my location, and it may get better. The pay is still good for what is usually simple retail work"
good,"They will definitely work you very hard at Costco.  You are constantly moving and the job is rather mundane and boring.  The only enjoyable part of the job is the positive interactions you get to have with the customers.  The customers are almost always friendly and enjoyable to talk to. The coworkers were ok, but the managers and leadership were about as bland as any place I've ever worked.  They showed absolutely no personality or enthusiasm what-so-ever.  Not a single one of them!!!  It's as if they hated being there just as much as I did, except for the fact that I at least tried to enjoy my time there and pretended to be happy.  I've never worked at a place where leadership tried nearly as hard to be miserable like at Costco. The only time leadership will talk to you is when they are telling you what to do.  If you want to work in a fast paced environment and don't care about liking the people you work with, Costco is probably the place for you.  Otherwise there are a million other retail jobs that are much more enjoyable.  The pay at Costco however was much better than any other retail job I've worked, and is probably one of the best pay grades in retail."
good,"The production pretty normal, maybe it's only beginning, so still need to improve . And equipment system management is quit bit normal, not training, not ...."
good,"Costco is a good place to work and learn. You can learn  and be moved around in many departments. It's a very fast paced. However, the poor management just make good people move on."
good,"The promotion from within is nice, but you get managers that dont really know what they are doing. You are constantly reminded that there is a stack of applications to fill your position if you think the expectation are too much for you. You are made to feel replaceable from the start."
good,Typical day at work consists of assisting members with all Costco needs. Costco has many opportunities with in internal job listings. Everyday can be different and members/ customers make Costco what it is.
good,"The work here was fast-paced, but nothing anyone can't handle.  The work wasn't hard either, but the management was incredibly poor and mis-handled.  Threats of job-loss were common as well as name-calling.  The actual work was ok, very involved with customers no matter what department you were in."
good,"fast paced job so you dont get well trained specially if you are seasonal, variety of things to do, it depends on what you like to do it might not be your thing"
good,Never a dull day. A typical work day was clocking in and being ready to work. Ask the bored runner what job they needed me to do for today and they assigned me to a different position depending on the day. The hardest part of a job was witnessing managers not following rules that enforce upon you.
good,Great benefits and good pay but too many managers that don't care a bit about you just what you can do for their department!  You are not the property of one department but are managed by all departments so everywhere you turn someone is telling you to do something. very frustrating.
good,"lifted heavy objects, learned responsibility by working by my self, management was ok, not the best but nowhere has great management. The workplace culture was pretty relaxed as the job was not complex at all, but people who worked there tend to complain about how ""hard"" the job was. The hardest part of the job was the amount of physical labor and having to deal with customers that just like to get in the way. the most enjoyable part of the job was when the store was closed and there were no customers so you could get the work done fast and efficiently."
good,"My shift required me to be at work and clocked in by 4am and clocked out by 10-10:30am ."
good,"I worked there for over four years. The pay was great, if you can handle dealing with all the other b.s. Always under staffed. Especially in the bakery. Managers aren't trained properly."
good,Dealing with the time clock is not fun.  Helping patients is rewarding.  The four manufacturers representatives help to train and to keep your license current.
good,"It was a good start up place for me, and very good management, and good staff relationship too, though it could be very crazy at peak hours. No regrets that I worked here."
good,we get awards depending on our work effort if we dont miss any days of the week and dont come late shows on our progress and how we doing we might be able to get a V.I.P cars for costco all paid for the year.
good,"The driving environment at Costco is one that always seems to get worse every day. The employees will usher you in early and are the only thing that keep you going until they tell you the reality of the situation at hand. Full time is very hard to get (atleast 2 years before full time) the incremental pay increases are extremely slow for part timers(1200+ hours for a small raise) and you will be given the same opportunities as people who are consistently lazy and unwilling. Above all management will seem great at first to you, but you will come to learn that managers will only do things for themselves and you are nothing but another employee. They will ask you to take on positions and jobs to help such a great manager and they could be gone next week for their own sake. The icing on the cake is the nepotism in this company, I have come to accept it in general, but this company pushes it to the max. If you have parents, relatives or a spouse that is higher or more powerful on a lateral scale, then those people connected, even if not suited will get it. Favourites and eventual bad morale boils down to the employees that are most knowledgeable not caring and getting prioritized first, which trickles down to new hires."
good,Great for seasonal work. They always hire seasonal but then they lay off everyone they hired. Job advancement is minimal and it takes forever to move up.
good,Costco hires terrible management and promote even worse management from within. The seniority system ruins all work ethic for those with higher seniority.
good,"it's a good company. "
good,"When I asked what tasks I could do next they told me just to hold tight, that they would figure something out but they never would, and they never told me what I was doing right or wrong."
good,"I enjoyed helping our customers and the physical nature of the job. My supervisors and Managers were between the ages of 18-25, they were immature, had no patience, used a lot of profanity and forgot to follow through with most tasks."
good,"Costco in it's culture is a good company to work for. They provide a secure, mostly safe work environment with good pay, and good benefits. However being an employee at Costco entails working with the public in a very crowded and fast-paced and high-stress environment. There is often a burn-out plateau that employees reach within a few years. The ability to grow with the company is largely predicated on one's relationship with management and not their skill sets, senority, or education."
good,The starting pay at Costco for Pharmacy technicians is higher than the industry standard and Costco has very good benefits. There is a strong drive to promote from within and opportunities are always posted for all employees to see.
good,The managers are poorly trained. They have a tough time being leaders and helping out when needed. Most people in power are relatives to higher up and aren't truly cut out to be in management.
good,"Started me in the meat department which I was hired for, then after 3 weeks of training thrust me into food court with about 30 minutes of training by dept manager who nonchalantly explained things then left immediately. People were great, just cannot do that to people who were hired for a specific job, especially for a certain department."
good,My time at Costco has been a good experience. I worked in few different department and it was a good learning experience. I found it difficult to balance my work and personal life due to late shifts and working over weekends.
good,"This company pays well and has great benefits. All hired staff are hired as ""part time seasonal"" and they can refuse to keep you after 90 days. If they choose to keep you on, it takes about 3 years to get a full time position. They work as a seniority company instead of going by who's more qualified for a position when considering people for employment opportunities within the company. They do not work around any outside scheduling so if you have another job, make sure they're more lenient with schedule compromising. They do have a great student program if you are a university or college student and will work around that schedule if you have proof of acceptance and a schedule."
good,"For seasonal employees, you are expected to devote your entire life to the company. You are expected to come in whenever they call you and it will be held against you on your permanent hire paperwork if you don't. Breaks are given regularly and reliably, 2 fifteen minute paid breaks and one thirty minute unpaid break, while you will be scheduled for 8.5 hours, 30 minutes of that is the unpaid break. Managers are hit and miss, some are somewhat rude and very company centric, while others are very employee centric."
good,"Being a product demonstrator at Costco is a good job for anyone who enjoys interacting with a diverse group of individuals.  Most of the "
good,"The culture of Costco was always friendly and ""Like"" family. But over the last 5 years the company as a whole has plummeted. Part of the problem is that they do not value education. They promote using favoritism and bribes. Management mentality is that of a sociopath, they have no compassion or empathy. I've heard it said that the retail corporate ladder is made by the people you step over to move up. This concept is true with Costco."
good,"Costco itself was a great company to work for. They give more opportunities than any other hourly job. Just the management had their heads screwed on off. They would find ways to make you work in departments you weren't meant to be in. Because of certain over looked 'phrasings' of certain job titles. Then next thing you know you're getting moved around because 'you're not working your best here'. The actual workers were awesome though, even though they were getting worked to the bone with little respect for it."
good,"A typical day at work is usually very stressful. Most of my personal stress if from being treated like I am deposable, which is not the way anybody should feel at their job. Costco has an environment very similar to high school,; employees, including supervisors and managers, are constantly gossiping about other employees to the point where you feel like you cannot trust anybody. I understand that you can usually find these kinds of problems in any job, but no employee should ever feel like they cannot trust their supervisors and/or managers. Costco does have its pros, I have just gotten to a point where I feel like the bad outweighs the good. The good things about Costco are the flexible hours, health benefits, opportunities to work in other departments and to transfer to other warehouses."
good,"Compared to other competitors, pay rate is really low (in optical). Very hard to manage a normal life style. We were hand to mouth every month. Benefits start after 90 days."
good,Good job if you don’t have an education. If you do have an education or are in the process then Costco is a great stepping stone to get to another job.
good,The hourly/workload ratio is absolute ludicrous at this company. Seemed to me like certain departments would clearly be doing less work and are getting paid the same (if not more than others). Very unprofessional people working there and most higher end managers seemed to be pretending to care about the work and did not take it as serious as they should have been.
good,"I worked for a company called PWD, not directly for Costco but worked inside Costco. The job was demeaning and customers were rude. Good for a first job, but not in long-term. Management was alright, although they had no say in most things (everything came from head office)."
good,"Not consistent working hours, part time flex schedule was not explained upon hiring process, advancement is difficult within the first year, other than that great place great benefits."
good,"Costco is a great place to start at a young age and work your way. If you think you can get hired with Costco and get promoted quickly you are kidding yourself. Takes years to get promoted here, no matter how hard you work. You have to sit there and watch unqualified people get promoted over you because they have been there longer. Your college degree means absolutely nothing to them. All about seniority, If you don't mind the wait, watching unqualified people get promoted over you, and work under someone who is not able to do their job professionally then this is your place."
good,"They make you run around the store like a chicken with its head cut off and they do not care about you, they only care about there bottom dollar. overall not worth it"
good,"It was OK to work, once the hours were reduced, it became increasingly harder to keep the pace.  As I got older it was harder for some of the lifting.  Some  Asst.management was good , main store manager was not and I had worked with 2 of them."
good,"Throughout the 8 months working at Costco, I've learned how to control my attitude and talk to people better. there was no enjoyable part about working at Costco. i felt unappreciated and taken advantage of pertaining to labor."
good,If you can handle other employees brown nosing and seeing favoritism to advance then you will be fine at Costco. Health benefits are a huge plus other than that it’s retail times 10
good,"It was a decent job, as seasonal employies we usualy just did whatever tasked that were asked of us. i worked in the bakary helping prep baked goods and the meat department helping package meat"
good,"Management is wolves, looking for yes-persons rather than quality employees.  Adored the company before working there. ZERO possibility of promotion for ""older"" and experienced candidates.  Be ready to sell your soul and drink the kool-aid!"
good,"Hard work is rewarded with more work- mostly from someone who wants to slack off from doing their own."
good,"The other employees were friendly and helpful but it was very busy in the pharmacy. Rarely a moment to stop and process anything; everything had to be done as quickly and efficiently as possible with two half hour breaks. Hours could be very early or late but overall not too bad. Though try to keep yourself out of the in-staff drama, if there is any."
good,Reviews given on areas not often worked. Asked/expected to do things again company's and OSH's policy. Hired on seasonal employees with less than stellar work ethic
good,work on your management teams. make the old retire if their going to discriminate. follow rules and union rules. lots of favoritism. if youre not willing to bend with time you shouldnt be managing.
good,It is a great company to work for and there are many opportunities to learn new departments. You can easily grow with the company if you work hard and can make yourself stand out. Managers do not have a very good work/life balance as they tend to work 11+ hour days.
good,"Work goes very slow, lots of red tape and bureaucracy to go through. Most of the work is done by top 5 percent of the enthusiastic people, didn't find much of talented people around. Company  is seriously failing to attract the talent."
good,"Overall, it's not a fantastic company to work for or at least the UK depot."
good,"I was hired as a full time marketer for Costco within 2 weeks of Thanksgiving holiday and following that christmas.  I experienced very limited days of marketing and instead was placed in other departments inside the store to help out during seasonal holiday weeks. In early December I had a full week of training from an outside regional marketing manager and totally enjoyed with the marketing aspect of which I was initially hired for.  However 3 days prior to my release, I had high numbers for sales within the store of membership marketing and yet on new years eve, at the close of my work shift, I was told it was my last day.  I was told I was ""seasonal"" and had to go. I felt betrayed and used for their sole purpose of the seasonal busy time of the year and was given empty promises. I think this is a poor way of managing hiring process at Costco."
good,"The pay and benefits are what kept me here. The management is lacking, favoritism is extremely prominent, and the employees love to gossip about one another and start drama. It wasn't always so bad but in recent years it seems to be in a steady decline with a relatively high turnover rate for new employees and many senior employees not wanting to be there anymore."
good,"When I interviewed for the position I was informed that I could receive at least 18 hours per week. This has not been the case. I have been on the schedule and then i""ll get a call not to come in. Getting paid every 2 weeks for 20 hours is not good."
good,Good company poor management lack of advancement.  You get great pay and great benefits. But it’s like being in high school and there is a lot of favoritism but like I said pay was great.
good,"When I first started working at Costco, I loved it. However, an extreme change in management made the culture miserable to want to work in. People who do not deserve to get promoted, do. This is not a personal opinion, since it is evident that they do not work, and instead yell and talk down to workers. Even upper management has admitted to this failure but does nothing."
good,"A typical day at work depends on your department in the Warehouse. I work in shipping so its definitely a time sensitive department. I have to load trucks before i leave, ranging between 3-10 trucks depending on how fast you can go. Its starts to become stressful when you to try and get all the things needed on the truck but cant because other employees aren't doing their job properly. Also since there are multiple different Managers each one has a way they choose to get the items to shippers. Which causes chaos and mass confusion as well as items that are mandatory to get onto the truck, never leaving the dock. Due to lack of communication with the General Managers  down to the employees."
good,"Great people to work with, great benefits. Great enviornment to work in , the friendly co-workers really helped me stay as long as i did. The reason i lwft was because of the phycial abuse from the customers"
good,"A typical day at Costco is dealing with member(s) questions, helping members when they need a hand with a large item and stocking the shelves at night time for members to shop from the next morning. I learned how to deal with members from the good and difficult times, I learned how to communicate better with my fellow co workers, and I also learned how to become a team player while working with fellow co-workers as well. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with not so nice members and learning how to deal and cope with them in a proper manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is stocking at night time and finishing your isle on a strict time limit, in a neat and clean fashion."
good,You are constantly under watch of management. There is little to no downtime for the physical strain required for the position. The first three months is a probationary period. Not many people I met there were particularly friendly.
good,enjoy working with lots of customer to be served with. A fast paste work area and lots of fun having doing the job even the salary is not really good and not full time.
good,"Lots of hard work.  Moving, lifting, constant customer service.  The pay starts out a little better than some other retailers and they have a good record for long-lasting employees.  Pay increases steadily.  The schedule is always changing and you don't get any days off.  There aren't any benefits for a full year after full time employment.  But there's not a lot of analytical thinking or genuine problem solving.  Good manual labor position.  I'd recommend avoiding the food court, but there are some employees that literally just fold clothing for 8 straight hours every day.  It's not glorious or fun.  But it's a job."
good,"*truthfully most days were boring and repetitive"
good,"decent company to work for. However, unless you know the right people, do not bother trying to move up in the company. Great benefits and good pay make it a good job if you can handle the stress and feeling unappreciated."
good,"Costco can be a great company to work for, depending on the building you work at. Some buildings are better than others, but you make the best of what you can."
good,"PWD is a separate company that worked with Costco. PWD was very disorganized, management was rude and didn't seem to care about their employees. "
good,Good place to work when young if older then treated less important to the company . More of a stepping stone company not a long term career but a good company
good,"As a seasonal employee you will get selected to work in the different areas of Coscto Wholesale, ie. Bakery, cashier, or meat department to name a few. If you get chosen as a front end assistant you will learn how to run the cash register and checkouts, as well running carts. The downside is that it can be exhausting as you will be running (literally) to each end of the store until your next break. The management was not good, as they over hired and provided little to no work for the seasonal employees."
good,"This job is similar to a standard retail store, except for the larger sizes/quantities of items. Wider range of people use the store and it can be difficult to adjust to different types of orders. Everything had to be exact and mistakes were corrected quickly."
good,"Though it is an okay place to work, the management team lacks integrity. They do not treat everyone the same. Just because you are the most qualified for a position does not mean you will be chosen. It's all about how much you are willing to brown nose."
good,"Great pay and benefits but the work environment is terrible. Management is always on your case about up selling and flow of scanned items on your till and many more. A lot of favouritism, I mean it is everywhere. As well as management does not back up their own employees and leave them paying for what happened to the customer even if its the customers fault. Will never work for them again. It is very stressful working there too, they are not considerate for their employees with health issues."
good,"The jobs themselves are easy.  However management makes it a lot more complicated then it needs to be.  Theres no planning a head of time.  Payroll is always short no matter what department.  Managers are scheduled ten hour days but stay 12, come in on their days off, and come in on holidays."
good,No hay oportunidad de progreso dure 16 años y muy apenas te toman en cuenta aparte el sueldo no es justo para todo la responsabilidad que tenía
good,the company is awesome but the management team i work for was terrible. they didn't communicate with each other and made it hard and stressfull at the work place
good,The customers were rude on some occasions.  The benefits you received was nice. If you needed a day off on one of your scheduled days off you would have to make up for time lost.
good,"From training new seasonal employees and handling members frustrations with new seasonal employees, informing members on sales, mortgage prices, insurance rates and policies, upgrading memberships. All while handling each needs of the members in a good neat organized work environment becomes the most efficient  when everyone is on the same page working cohesively. Preparation is key when avoiding time obstacles."
good,its good money but you are treated like a second class slave.. no training and there are to many people that are promoted because of friends outside of work and don't now there job or now what the job entails
good,"Working in a warehouse environment is fast paced, which I thrive off of, nothing better than always being on the go while you are helping others.  Having a company with long term employees has pros and cons, it speaks volumes for the company when they are able to keep long term employees, their wages and benefits are a huge part of that, however many of those individuals have developed a sense of entitled which can be challenging at times to coop with. Being able to listen and understand how to balance multiple personalities is one of the greatest challenges as a manager."
good,"The management at this warehouse was awful. They did not care about employee well being, customers always came first no matter what and could get away with anything, and they would throw you under the bus to save themselves. I worked there for over a year and permanently injured my shoulders. I was immediately reprimanded and blamed for my injury despite me following proper procedure and working safely. The insurance isn't all it's cracked up to be either. I had to go the ER once and for a $3,200 medical bill, I was expected to pay almost $1,000 of it as a part time employee. Multiple employees came in hungover, had fake ID's, called in sick for illegitimate  reasons."
good,fast-paced company... good benefits... not much room for growth... wage structure is nice... everyone is expected to do a little bit of everything regardless of actual position.
good,"Brilliant company pay and benefits wise but is a company that will never back a member of staff up, most of the management don't have any or very little people skills. "
good,Management was terrible. Management was extremely petty. I pointed out a corrupt manager and got burned for it. On the flip side I got along very well customers and co-workers and established very good friendships.
good,Costco was my first pharmacy technician position and it was not an appealing experience due to disorganization of the pharmacy and management.
good,"Fun environment, you get to meet new people everyday.   Work day goes pretty quickly. At Costco it's always busy, nice people."
good,I love to be in fast paced workplace with often changes to adapt. I learned customer service is number one.
good,"my coworker are great a lot of fun to work with, I was able to learn how to us the power equipment like: fork lift and the EPJ ( Electric Power Jake )"
good,In my experience it is a good and Positive workplace. Good part time job for students. Workload is manageable however very labour intensive.
good,I was excited at first to finally work for Costco. after being employed for a few months I saw a completely different job. the professionalism they presume was not the Costco I saw. im not certain if it was just the specific wherehouse I was at but I can only speak for myself. I did enjoyed what I did however and loved my job
good,it was only a seasonal position and no one was kept on for a permanent position due to budget issues for that warehouse. those I worked with were very nice and environment was busy but positive
good,"if you have limited education and don't mind being the ""Grunt"" then this is the place for you!! After 9 years of working for this company I was consistently overlooked for promotions and new positions only to have family members of management get said positions. All topped off by having racial slurs thrown around and being asked to sign paper work to assure I would be fired if I talked about such things."
good,"Job security at Costco is fantastic; most individuals are retired in place.  It is almost impossible to get fired.   If you've ever been to a DMV, that is same feeling of inefficiency and laziness you will get while working in Costco IT.  One individual said it best ""If Costco IT could spend the same amount of energy trying to block projects and playing political games, they could be the next Google"".   The new SVP/CIO is a 30 year warehouse manager who wants to run IT like another store and if it is an IBM solution, it must be good.  "
good,"I worked shift patterns covering the opening hours of the store.   served customers at the checkout, in the cigarette kiosk and faced up when filling the shelves."
good,"I like the job but it is very demanding and I feel that I would like more pay for the demands, I like learning a lot .And I like the people I work with, I don't like the hours at all in the warehouse."
good,Being promoted is only based on seniority. If someone has more seniority than you they will get promoted. Good luck if you are new
good,"Good place to work, lots of positions to move up. Benefits are good as well as raises based on hours. Good managment and time flexibility too."
good,"My job is high paced physically and mentally demanding. I have learned a lot in the last eight months as a supervisor. My job duties are cashier, assistant, Merchandise Pick-up window clerk, auditor, opener, closer, board runner, floor supervisor, cart supervisor, and any other job that I may be assigned. I am there to pick up calls for cashiers and assist members with their needs. I answer to my management about productivity and hours to be cut. Responsible for employees training and reviews. Work over time when needed and every weekend. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I help someone and they leave our store happy."
good,"Going to work, doing your job and going home is a typical work day, nothing special."
good,"I worked at 4:45 (sometimes 4:15) in the morning unloading pallets and stocking shelves. I worked in the pet food aisle, and all of the food was in bulk, so the work could become laborious, which wasn't a problem for me. Apart from my manager the managers at Costco were all friendly and helpful and polite. My manager had been transferred from a different store and had a reputation for inappropriately harassing and being rude to his employees, and he lived up to it. I enjoyed stocking my aisles with merchandise, and crushing garbage in the compactor, and even waking up at 3:30 AM to go to work, but I didn't enjoy working under such a manager. Still, if I could work at Costco under a different manager I would do so as it is a good company that seems to care about it's employees."
good,"sell products to consumers, how to successfully sell and promote products accordingly. management was well organized, co-workers were older and pleasant to be around, job is very easy, being around other people."
good,"I enjoyed the actual work, with co-workers stocking shelves could definitely be fun and rewarding but the bosses didn't seem well versed in management techniques and were not fun to work for."
good,I had great bosses they cared about you when having personal things going on  and worked well  for you when having appointments out side of work lot of fun at holiday parties
good,"If you haven't worked there for many years, then you won't ever fit in. The rate of pay needs to be re-evaluated."
good,"love helping kids, not enough hours. the owners are very nice people as well. they are genuinely concern for a child's education. i recommend this place"
good,"Costco has poor management of staff and all my co workers just thought about themselves, when we was a team which was very frustrating. I learnt a lot though, in terms of the 2 departments I worked in, 1 being front end, and the other being the rotisserie."
good,everyday trying to sell memberships and if they need you do other things they would pull you away from your job
good,"I gave out samples and encouraged people to buy the product."
good,"Decent pay with adequate benefits including sick, vacation pay, and holiday pay. Just dont expect to use up all your holiday hours in a week. Also dont expect to have many weekends off, and expect to have many schedule changes and hour changes. The saying I remember most at costco, ""We dont have to honor your requests for time off""."
good,"Costco was all over the place for me. Depending on your managers, it could either be a great work environment or a terrible one. I worked at 4 stores, of which 2 were good and 2 were terrible. Do not expect a regular shift at any time, and you will almost certainly work every weekend unless you request it off. Also be prepared for rules and standards to change with the wind, being told to do something one way on Monday, and another way on Tuesday. Good entry level job, but not one I'd want to keep doing for very long."
good,Most co workers were great and easy to work with but some management really abused their power. Busy place to work and long hours
good,"constant moving but not in a good way, rude/entitled members, coworkers for the most part are great, hardest part is dealing with the member's attitudes and the power head's struggle to maintain their power and authority. Most enjoyable is when all the members are gone and leaving at the end of the day"
good,Costco's values and mission are wonderful and even if you work part time you receive full time benefits. Working part time you are guaranteed to receive 24 hours.
good,debut 14.30 vente et service a la clentele .par la suite faire de la caisse pendant environ 2 hrs et pour terminer en pliant du linge jusqu a 23hrs ceci du mardi au samedi. travailler le samedi soir est l aspect le plus difficile et le plus agreable est la relation avec le publics
good,"degustar, demostrar, ventas, y rutina de limpieza y guardado de utencilios"
good,Went to work and moved displays around daily. Didnt really learn anything that I already didnt know. Management was ok. Very demanding and sometime belitttleing. Co-workers were ok. Hardest part of the job was trying to get things moved around in the short time frame that we had. Most enjoyable part of the job for me was dealing with the cuatomers.
good,A job the a has a saluted work environmental. INventory control work environment.
good,"Good starting pay with time and a half on Sundays. Off on Federal Holidays with pay. Management doesn't seem to communicate with each other well,  or listen to employees when issues are brought to their attention."
good,"Essentially, a good place to work if single.  The mid-day work scedule can be cumbersome for those with families or extra needs parents.  Some positions may be challenging to those not in top physical form."
good,"Working at Costco has been quite an experience, management is average and they could really careless about what the employee needs, they watch their backs and that’s it"
good,Good company good benefits somewhat decent hours somewhat decent management good entry job for entry level. Prepare to walk and lift. Seniority counts
good,I worked here solely for the fact that I was a student and needed a decent paying job with good hours that were guaranteed. It was a good place to work while in school.
good,"I was a maintenance man, did a lot of cleaning and fixing things. It's a good place to work, for the most part. If you're going to work in retail, this would be a good place to do it."
good,"Easy job to learn as you're working in a fast pace. Big lump sums of cash handling, so experience with counting cash is advised, but not needed. You need to be physically fit as there is a lot of heavy lifting, constant lifting/moving and pushing up to 10 trolleys at once."
good,Most people seem very nice but those who have been there for a while are very territorial toward new people.  Management is terrible.  Several people don't work the way they should be either.
good,"I was only there as a seasonal worker, however with my experience most of the people I worked with weren't very talkative to newcomers. The workload is fast paced and you may need to life heavy things"
good,"Be it for better or for worse, the amount of time an employee has been with the company is equivalent to their perceived value. Does not make for much upward mobility, as there is no reason for the older employees, whose wages have already ""topped out,"" to step into other positions. There is a strong culture and pride in the company, which also nurtures a slight competitiveness between employees vying to be favorites among management staff. New hires take on the toughest jobs for the least pay until they prove hungry enough to be granted challenges and responsibilities in various departments. The front-end is an incredibly political environment."
good,Over alll a good company. Great benefits and good pay for not having a skill. Opportunity for advancement or relocation if desired.  A great place to work if your going to school.
good,"My experience was good being a product demonstrator. Although the hours were long, I enjoyed the weekly pay and ability to interact consistently with a diverse population every day."
good,"The only problem was the management. They didn't care, some employees would leave in the middle of their shift and management wouldn't notice even if it was a very busy day."
good,"Company was okay hours changed and things change often at the company .they have long hours pay doesn't match the work you do for them . Hard work company "
good,"i love working at cotsco is a great place to work very fast paced and great environment i love the fast food very fresh and fatty . i like that is always busy ,that way your day goes by fast ."
good,during the weeks is pretty busy but we made sure to treat everyone very well and to make their shopping experience well. learned how to move quickly and also to pack customer items neatly. loved reorganizing merchandise and restocking to make everything look neat and clean.
good,"Met some wonderful people, still visit the location when I am able. It was a good experience. I needed to have consecutive days off to visit my elderly mother, which wasn't always possible with the schedule."
good,I was working in the Food court and it was fastpaced and they demanded a lot out of me. I injured my wrist and they did not care about it. After my injury they did not respect that I was not able to not do certain tasks. People did not respect one another and there was so much drama. The pay was great but it was not worth the stress that brought to my life.
good,"My review is only from one store. #748"
good,"The pay is fantastic and with such a big store, it’s easy to make friends. However, management places extreme expectations on you in terms of persuading/ pressuring members to sign up for more expensive cards and their credit card. They refuse to put you on cash if you don’t sell a certain number of memberships/credit cards and at my store, they even made the lowest selling people clean the bathrooms."
good,"I liked working at Costco but the management was the issue. They were so unprofessional, rude and a bunch of other negative adjectives that can be used. The job itself was fun and time flew when I was working. More of a laborer type of person's job."
good,I was in the meat department and i was always busy. There was never a time where i had nothing to do. My coworkers helped me a lot and were friendly and welcoming.
good,"Low stress job all based on tenure, your merit has nothing to do with how or if you are promoted. People are great and customers can be a challenge, but overall its a great part time job."
good,If you are looking for long term advancement; its a great company! The downside is that they have a very liberal family hiring policy which makes it harder and longer for people to move up whom parents' are not the company's executives. The reason why this company will always have a high turn over of employees.
good,the company started off great with great pay but started lowering my hours and stopped listening to me and lying about conversations we had even when written down
good,"The benefits and job security at Costco is unlike any other and the only good thing about them. Other than that you have no say over you schedule and are treated like a child until you've worked there for 10+ years. Its like a high school environment, everyone is petty, rude, and disrespectful"
good,Pleasant face paced environment with a lot of room to grow. Comfortable pay scale and great team members who work with you and teach you what is expected on a daily basis working for Costco.
good,"It is not the worst company to work for, however they dont care as much as they say. As you progress, depending on where you are in the store, dictates your future in the company overall in many ways. Upper management also tended to not actually want to work with you to help if you had a legitimat problem, they would manipulate the conversation in such a way that it sounded like your own problem, not an overall problem. My manager specifically was a micromanager and tended to play favorites."
good,"I mostly worked in the food court and didn't care for it. Manager was borderline useless, my co-workers were ok (most of them), but some of them didnt pay attention or just flat out disappeared once there was no one in line (which doesn't last very long). Food court is expected to be constantly busy, but the front end you could have people standing around doing nothing while you got a line stretching all the way to the membership desk. Am I saying not to work at Costco? No, just dont work in the food court."
good,"Depending on what you are hired for, the workplace culture across the board is actually very good, and people want to help each other out for the most part.  If this is early on in your career, a highly valued place to learn and advance."
good,"The management is horrible they don't care about your requests. If they don't like you they try to write you up all the time. Very cliquey. They don't tell you that  you have to work until 11 everyday when you first start for almost a year, if you are front end."
good,"micromanaged"
good,It pays well only when you've put in your time. You must full time for 5 years before your making enough money to live off of. It is very phsyically demanding work. You must be very aggressive to work here or your employees and managers will send you out the door.
good,"Rotating managers from other warehouses who dont even know anyone's names."
good,"We started about 6am and worked until 2:30pm, some opportunity for overtime.  I worked in the meat department at the depot,in the freezer, very cold, they did provide protective gear, being 130 lbs and 5'10"" they expected me to move 100 lb. boxes of meat all day for an 8 hour shift. It was a very fast pace environment and because of the weight it was hard to keep up.  Felt that the review process was unfair and the management did not communicate or really care about the workers.  I worked very hard got faster and made a lot of improvement and was making there quota, I past my 90 days and then on the very last day for seasonals they told me I was a seasonal even though I was hired prior to Oct. 6th and let me go without any warning.   My fellow workers were very nice but you were expected not to talk at all or listen to any type of music or anything while you worked.  I understood it was for safety reasons but it would have made the time go by faster.  I learned about my physical limitations and about the culture of a big corporation.  I did enjoy working there and learned a lot but really left with a sour taste in my mouth due to the way the management treated me."
good,"Some of the managers there were not understanding, or  compassionate. They are good to some people, but don't treat everyone equal. It is a fast paced environment."
good,"Started in the tire center and was constantly shuffled into other departments or pulled away to help in them during busy times. Managers from front end would pull us out of both the Tire Center and off maintenance to box groceries and then get offended when you try to leave to take your break. Absolutely atrocious scheduling in maintenance, at one point I started my week working close (11pm) on Tuesday and ended it opening (6am) on Saturday. In the year I was there I had a half dozen different managers, only two of which were good and suited for the job. Tire shop was alot of fun to work, but the customers were the most entitled people I've ever had the misfortune to deal with, and you were constantly understaffed from (the actual lack of staffing) and from being pulled away into other departments. Every single other employee at Costco was both cheerful and helpful with the exception of the fork lift drivers. Evening drivers were grumpy, but morning drivers were absolutely miserable human beings, zero respect for others, rude and absolutely no mind for anyones job but their own. Costco is great for advancement, but for a part time job there are better places to work. A big thing that people praise Costco on is their competitive wages; our management rep told us that 25 years ago when she started, she made 10$ an hour. The minimum wage 25 years ago was 5$ an hour. I started at minimum wage, not at double."
good,"Costco is a fast pace, intense, and a lot of physical labor. Overall, it's a good place to work. Getting along with others and working hard is the key for success in the company."
good,A Typical Day was really faced paced and stressful not only because of the sheer volume of customers and their problems; But the management cramming us to upsell down our throats.
good,day at work is a little meeting to what we are gonna move or stocked in the morning . management is awesome but very buzy hardest part is just waking up in the morning but manageable
good,"Quality of life is an overarching term for the quality of the various domains in life. It is a standard level that consists of the expectations of an individual or society for a good life. These expectations are guided by the values, goals and socio-cultural context in which an individual lives."
good,"i worked for Costco for over a year as a Cart guy, outside we had a system that worked and was flexible to outside, conditions, like customers and weather. it was only when management messed with us or diverted resources around, take our guys or add people outside when they weren't needed were there problems, but overall a decent place to work."
good,"It was easy to make friends, but the job is highly stressful and there is almost no communication. No one knows what is happening and when members call with questions we have no idea what to tell them, or whether what they say is true, We are told to ask our supervisors for further details, but they do not receive any further information. Also, the company cut hours without warning so that they could hire others at a cheaper cost at new locations across the nation, which caused a lot of our current loyal employees to have to look elsewhere because they could no longer support themselves and their families with this job. The pay and benefits are nice, but the job sucks and management has proved that they could care less about providing security for their employees and making them want to stay, which makes sense because then they no longer have to pay out those wonderful bonuses."
good,"I enjoyed working their because the pay was great, especially on sundays because you get paid time and half on time of the great pay. I liked that they moved everyone around to different areas but i didnt like that they made almost everyone do cart returns when its very physically tasking especially when its freezing cold outside and the parking lot was on a hill."
good,"Fairly good work environment except for very poor management. Benefits are great and coworkers are fairly pleasant. High turnover at warehouse, it is retail so expect working weekends. Time and a half on Sundays help and the starting wage is above competitors salaries."
good,"rampent nepotism,favortism, and racism."
good,"Typical work day is fast paced, some faster than others. Typically you work on your own or with a driver, but depending on task given you might be working with someone else."
good,"Management is extremely bias and there was a lot of nepotism going on. I was paid fairly, but had a hard time going to school while working there because my schedule wasn't prioritized over those who came after me."
good,Refused to deal with staff bully who was a rampant terror to every staff member in multiple departments in direct violation of Costco's own anti-bullying policies and Human Rights Legislation. I will not go back to Costco because of this one employee and the daily convicts they created. I am very disappointed in Costco for this failure.
good,"Working at Costco is intense to say the least. They provide good pay, and excellent benefits. When you first start at Costco, you get little to no training, and are expected to move at paces that are set to unreasonable standards for someone during their first week. Once you get the hang of it and pass your probationary period things are fine for a while. You enjoy it and it seems like a fun and relaxed atmosphere. However, that doesn’t last very long. Management is poor to say the least. So poor in fact, during my for years at Costco, I saw the building through FIVE warehouse managers, and moor assistant warehouse managers than I can count. That makes it hard to form any sort of morale with employees, and that can lead to chaos among hourly employees. That chaos generally leads to hostile work environments. I left because it was so hostile and I mentally couldn’t handle going into work anymore."
good,"Leading pay for retail, great health, dental, vision, and life insurance.  Good 401k, vacation and sick leave.  However, the environment is extremely fast paced and unrelenting."
good,"Costco wholesale was a cool job to work. a lot of cultured people to be around. a lot of new people to meet and talk to. enjoyed the days working there, but there's a lot of in-job drama and a lot of confusions at times."
good,"While if you are ready for a quick-paced environment, you may like this job, i was brought on for part-time employment and ended up working 10 hours my first day."
good,Don't work here unless you are willing to never see your family and want to always be threatened with termination. The 90 is what youll hear about the most but if you dont want to be a supervisor they dont really like you.
good,I enjoyed working for the company. Great team. flexible schedule. competitive pay. Great working environment. The hardest part was working weekends and missing lots of family events.
good,"I started costco at a delicate time in my life and i have to give them credit that costco helped me develop and growth and helping give me the time to find myself and become the hard work and confident worker i am today. The pay and the pay rises are amazing once your past the three month probation period. The holiday pay and benefits and pension plan are very generous compared to most companies with entry level basic jobs like this but honestly there was so drama. "
good,"Je n'avais pas de poste de travail fixe, pas d'horaire fixe et une moyenne d'environ 10 heures par semaines de travail alors qu'on m'en avait promis environ 30 heures par semaine."
good,"Costco has the potential to be a great place to work, it really depends on who you are working under. They change management often, so if you happen to get a good, hard working yet caring manager - then your job will be great, but when that manager gets promoted and replaced with a selfish and carless manager, your job can be awful. Unfortunately I had more experience with the second, and in combination with personal issues I had at the time, I had to leave. So under the right management, it can be great, but I feel like so much shouldn't depend on one person's position. If you have a terrible manager, and it effects your job, the company won't care and won't do much. You can only hope they get replaced soon so you can go back to enjoying your job."
good,"From the minute you punch in it is go, go, go. From start to finish. Any given day you can be assisting a cashier to selling memberships to stocking or pushing shopping carts. Really anything goes but the time does fly by."
good,"We would quote 2-3 hour wait times, the customers were very unhappy and sometimes aggressive. "
good,job is good quality of the workplace mostly depends on current management after recent min wage increases costco pay is no longer overly competitive but still slightly above min
good,"I love working at costco the only reason i left was because i didn't get the chance to move up  i started in 2014  , (3 years working for this company and during those years new hires got hire none of these new hires lasted a good time  working in carts and were put inside like the front end , cashiering , membership , meat department , others when to the morning and night merchandise group . I was three years pushing carts and didn't get the chance of management giving me the opportunity to move in a different department .  I work hard  to get cross training to other departments but never got the chance to stay in any of them . My boss would say "" until i see you dominate pushing carts ill put you inside "" three years  and nothing I would work hard and instead of getting the chance to  go inside the warehouse and working in a department or be part of the front end i would always be consider the cart guy .  I felt like my work was not apreciated . Some of these managers need to learn to stop playing favorites but this store also has good management .  Another thing i left because i felt pressure by the warehouse manager for a situation that occurred , i didn't get the chance to tell the side of my story of the occurred situation .The open door policy rule was ignored for me when i got deny from explaining my side of the story. The company is great, benefits the good pay comes when you start earning 15+ and up . It was time to take a different direction . Anyways I would recommend management has to have more communication with each other as well."
good,"Didn’t like working at Costco because of the hours, working nights until 8:30pm and weekends and wasn’t thrilled about the people I worked with. It wasn’t for me to work at Costco even though everyone who worked there never leaves."
good,"Costco is one of the most fun jobs I've ever had. There were a few managers that you knew shouldn't have been managers (hire within; mostly who you know). The people I worked with were young and some older, but we respected each other and were even friends after work. Its a good job for a high school/college kid. Other than that I think its a lot of manual labor (unless your a female; you work inside while the guys push carts or load things). I liked the fast pace and the fact that they had free food (pizza/ restaurants) on special occasions. We also were given a free turkey every Thanksgiving!"
good,"Management isnt the greatest as they are constantly moving around. very strenuous, takes a toll on the body. friendly co-workers and guests that make the job worth it."
good,you better not get caught not doing anything. keep moving never stop. if you cant handle the pressure than this job isn't for you.theres always something to be done at this company from building displays to stocking pallets.
good,"I would say you get paid fairly, but it is physically demanding for most positions. I was a seasonal employee and felt like I had decent job security (most managers said I was doing great and that they already cut employees who did not make the cut) but was still let go. I also had to work every weekend and holiday (Christmas and New Years Eve)"
good,"Multiple employees who came from other Costco Warehouses all agreed that the Merrillville, Indiana location was by far the worst due to favoritism and terrible management."
good,"The usual workday consist of serving people who cause quite a bit of trouble throughout the day. Everyday there will usually be different food items you will serve/sample to the customers."
good,It's a good place to work. Some stores you can move up or go to different departments. Others stores though have like no room to go anywhere because the people there have been there for like 500 years so their seniority trumps yours lol so you get stuck in a department. But overall it's a real cool place to work the time off is cool the sick pay is cool.
good,The tire center has its ups and downs due to the fact that it a new store. i didn't learn all that i needed to learn due to lack of electronic training. their are some issues with tire center management. it is a comfortable to work with some of the people there. The hardest part was the lack of electronic training. The most enjoyable part about working at Costco Tire Center was when we busy with work.
good,"General manager and majority of the managers are very helpful. My issue arises with direct supervisors, they can be a bit confused and overwhelmed at times causing for a less then pleasant experience."
good,"It was my first job out of high school. It pay a little above minimum wage and you do get raises, but that depends on the amount of hours you worked in a year."
good,Costco is a great company for people that wants to commit their whole life into one job I Looked to strive in this company and could not find myself to do that due to favoritism
good,"very stressful. understaffed for the volume of business, poor sanitation in food areas because employees are rushed to get out on time poor management not much support."
good,"To many people to answer to, all with different  instructions on  the same task.  Leadership  is given to people with poor leadership and people skills,"
good,A typical day at costco was arriving at 5am working a part time shift getting a pallet jack and asking your manager which isle you had to do. The hardest part of the job  just depended on the isle or what section of the wear house you would get to do. The management was very helpful. I learned that costco is a very fast paste job and that you have to be on top of your stuff or else you will fall behind.
good,If you are thinking of getting a job at Costco definitely get a job in front end. The other sections seem a bit hectic and not put together properly. Not for people who get stressed easily.
good,"While it is a good time to be at work and be surrounded by good people, the organization of the company's employee files was terrible. I lost my job because they could no longer find me in the system after clarification with manager that I was a seasonal employee. More details should be taken into consideration by company but otherwise not a bad place to work."
good,"Cutting hours without notification, no opportunities to advance. Poor communication between different levels of managers and workers. Overworked and underpaid."
good,"Expect a lot out of employees, will expect all workers to bust their backs but even it out with how well they treat their employees. Not bad if physically able to keep up."
good,"Costco Wholesale is a good job for anyone with the desire to work hard and make decent wages with benefits. No college education is required to move up the corporate ranks. Medical and dental benefits are great. The downside is that management is often inflexible with schooling, which makes it hard for individuals who plan on completing a college education. Overall, Costco is a decent company."
good,Always have to help in other departments all the time.  I believe in helping in other departments when needed.  But this was happening everyday.  Being pulled in so many departments and having to be proficient.  I was in Marketing but every week or two I was put on the cash register with no training or advance notice.  I couldn't become proficient in cashiering with no training and no notice so I could bring my notes or cheat sheet with me.
good,work starts out fast and time flies by very active and on your feet kind of job.working day to day with coworkers in great! gas station is very repetitive and fast. easy to stay focused and work hard.
good,"Costco pays well in the long run and the benefits are hard to match. If you enjoy doing the same task day in and day out, you will thrive. I worked in many different departments and all of them became dull after a short time. Good managers (ones that care) are hard to come by, but when you do its golden. Members are sometimes very difficult , but most are ok. Most departments are physical and the concrete floors do no one any good."
good,Its a good place to work only thing i didn't like as a driver was that they went by seniority. Even if you a harder/ better worker then others that been there longer you get to pick you routes and vacation time last. Other than that is a great place to work.
good,"I enjoy the work that I do at Costco, but unfortunately is viewed as trivial and unimportant. For whatever might come to pass in my career here, I have to remember to take 2-4 times longer than I'd predict. I work with a lot of good, personable, competent people in my department and other depts. I have a mix of day-to-day duties supporting warehouses and longer term reporting and project duties. This an be tricky being limited to 40 hrs/week as an hourly employee. My ranking for job security (5 starts) differs from advancement potential (2 stars)."
good,"Unfair management at bakery, Some places you are lucky to get a good manager. Other departments you might luck out and get the worst. You might apply for one position and they might just move you to the part you didn't apply for. You might do your best, but if the manager has their mind made up then there's little to no hope you'll get a fair chance."
good,"The time being while being at Costco made me realize how much they really do make and how everything is by the book. "
good,Working at Costco was one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had.  The environment is very fast paced and requires you to almost run in order to get things done on time.
good,"I love working at costco the only reason i left was because i didn't get the chance to move up  i started in 2014  , (3 years working for this company and during those years new hires got hire none of these new hires lasted a good time  working in carts and were put inside like the front end , cashiering , membership , meat department , others when to the morning and night merchandise group .

Anyways I would recommend management has to have more communication with each other as well."
good,"Jim Sinegal was the founder of Costco. He knew that if you kept your employees happy the rest would take care of its self. Since his retirement, this has changed and it shows. The employees are treated militantly now. If you are 1 minute late from your lunch, they record it. After 3 of these there is disciplinary action. WTF? Please get back to treating your employees like the assets they really are. Audit your employees happiness to the level you do everything else in your company. I was a manager for 24 years there. I  know what I'm talking about."
good,"Work was busy and stressful. "
good,Fair company. Only worked part time. Empoyees and customers are friendly. Jobs are high paced and keep you on your toes. Must have good customer service skills.
good,"a typical day as a stocker is getting the building and products showcases ready by the time doors open. I received my forklift certification at the facility but was based personal preference more the work ethic. Costco uses a micromanagement tactic which can make you uncomfortable at times. The work culture can be very cut throat when it comes to job security and the hardest part of the job is meeting unrealistic expectations at times. the most enjoyable part of the job is the food from venders, saving perks, and free membership for family members."
good,"Good pay and benefits.  Management is a little rough around the edges. You are expected stay busy for the entire day, even when there isn't much to be done."
good,In the 9 years I worked here I worked my way up to Forklift Driver. I was a very hard worker and improved many aspects of the job. I developed staff and exceeded expectations; very little recognition and positive reinforcement was given.
good,Managment needs a serious reforms. Managers are hired from within and are usually unfit for leadership roles. Since success startss from the top the rest of the employees easily take advantage of the poor leadership. Not only that but customers are very entitled and will treat employees poorly. No matter what they are always right even when they are not (and they are usually not).
good,Great pay and benefits.  Fast paced work environment. Very hard to get a stable schedule.  Good upward mobility if you're willing to move or buy management coffee everyday. Terrible management due to rapid expansion.  Selective enforcement of policies depending on how well management likes you.  Middleton store has a toxic work environment due to poor management as of Aug 2017.
good,"Costco is very busy and chaotic at times. The members are entitled and very demanding, but some of them make it worth it Lots of favoritism , family linked."
good,"I do like working with them, everything was okay but the the job is kind of physical and you must be strong at all before they let you in. It has a good environment for working with people.. Managers treat you as well with respect."
good,"I’ve expanded my skills in time management, organization, communication, and coordination.   However, the compensation before investing at least 10 years in Costco is very low."
good,A typical day at work consisted of making the store presentable to customers when the entered. This meant we had a limited time to complete our task. From this job I learned diligence and discipline and how to present a store to customers. The most difficult part of the job was working under a deadline constantly and dealing with heavy products.
good,There are a lot of physical expectations from newer employees. They value customer service above all and then how fast you do your job even if you cut corners. This puts friction between other employees that try and not cut corners.
good,"I worked at the Bellingham, Wa Costco a couple of years ago (at the old location). It is what it is...collect carts, box goods for your cashier, face store at closing.  Mgmt there was excellent. "
good,great job some of the people are great to be around. Management worked with you but in my opinion they didn't really show appreciation for the job you did they only did when it benefit them.
good,when i worked at costco i stocked the grocery aisles and helped the cashiers with packing the customers groceries. The hardest part of the job is waking up at 2 am.
good,"OK pay but good benefits.  Management very different from warehouse to warehouse.  Some are great, some are terrible.  Good opportunity to be promoted to management if you work hard.  Likes to promote from within."
good,"Worked hard, communicate,social,early person there before time sometimes. culture or the workplace i great. rude people and getting to meet new people"
good,Nice place to work. Great benefits. The management can learn to be less arrogant and more down to earth. some of the people working there are not qualified.
good,"Costco is a big place to work at. A typical day was a lot of work even if there weren't a lot of shoppers. The pay is very good, but many work you have to finish before you leave."
good,"El asistente es caprichoso y muy explotador, no respeta horarios laborales."
good,"A typical day at work for me is getting ready for work 7am everyday from Monday to Friday, sometimes weekends. i have learnt a lots of things working for Costco, for example how to manage customer service, good customer service is very important for costco, the most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid by the end of the month."
good,"Overall, an above average company to work for. In terms of it's benefits and job security, it does a good job for it's employees. However the recent policies incorporated have brought the work/life balance lower. The current management can do better than what they are doing. This company has the capability to treat it's employees much better which would raise moral, loyalty, and company pride.  "
good,"As a company Costco is awesome. The best benefits I have ever encountered and its the same for full and part timers.  Good with vacation time, giving holidays to their employees, you get a free membership along with a free household and 3 gold star memberships to give to friends or family."
good,"Great benefits, but no work life balance and difficult to advance unless your willing to sacrifice your social and family life.  Upper Management is only focused on producing numbers and making their bonus.  Not much coaching and training and most managers don't have an education in the background that they're managing."
good,"Although the beat you have to follow is very fast, it's easy to fall into a rhythm during a shift. The coworkers are all incredibly nice and helpful, while the management can seem a bit frigid and occasionally biased. Would not recommend if you're a student as the hours aren't incredibly flexible."
good,It was poorly managed hour wise and there was always more than one person doing a single task and no one was on the same page so it was always confusing
good,"- Friendly environment, a lot of different personalities"
good,Just started here in April. Getting days off is hard and sometimes co workers don't want to switch. Wish there was more flexibility with work schedule. Would be nice to have work schedule for the month instead of a week before.
good,"A lot of production, and a lot of stress. No job security since they only hire people seasonally , with no promise of any job at all. Risky. Pay is really good."
good,"Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,"Costco is a great company, but this location in particular deals with unfair treatment based on age and s e x u a l harassment."
good,My duty was to secure exit door and check out consumers. I learned the what to look for as far as those that tried to steal from the store. My co worker were great to work with and everyone had a purpose for being there. The hardest part about the job was there wasn't any trust with mgt. and being confidential.
good,"Costco is a company that does its best to make its employees happy.  It does this with great starting pay, automatic raises after a certain amount of hours worked, great benefits, paid vacation/sick leave, and paid holiday leave."
good,My typical day at work would be off loading trucks and tagging them with licenses and shipping across the dock. There would also be wrapping and banding pallets together.
good,"Lowes was an awesome place to work. Learned about different plants and industrial items. Help customers find what they're looking for, front face items, make sure all isles are picked up and nicely presented."
good,"A typical day of work would be first of all, checking with PWD Manager, getting all the stuff need for the demonstration, setting up the table for the demonstration, following clean procedures, wearing gloves, apron, hair net, and uniform, marking down information on sheets, and talking about products."
good,"hard work, I learn there how to work on line, management nice.c0-workers are very helpful, hardest part work on line with no break,"
good,"Typical day at work included restocking and maintaining the shelves. The hours for merchandising assistant were long and unsociable. There was constant use of the pump truck throughout the day and during closed hours there was the possibility of using forklifts. Gained experience in teamwork, communication with customers and time management. Management was generally friendly but firm. Slightly harsh at times and were not willing to help on busier days. Identified certain workers as favourites and treated younger workers harsher. Co-workers were fantastic. Most worked hard and maintained a friendly environment. The hardest part of the job was stocking in the evenings as it was physically demanding."
good,"Coming from a corporate structure into retail was a beast itself. I never experienced an environment of misdirection, teeny-bopper mentality from some of the supervisors, way too many chiefs who specialized in micro-managing, and allot of favoritism if you were part of the teeny-bopper clicks. If you're not part of the click, they don't care about you. Advancement only comes if a new store opens and you're able to transfer into new location as a supervisor/manager."
good,I was hired as a seasonal employee.  Having seen the inner workings of the company has fostered a deeper respect for what the founder had in mind in building up the company.  It offers a secure job opportunity with room for advancement.
good,Has all the benefits and money you could want but the happiness factor and morale is quite low. Overly aggressive and many times unprofessional supervising.
good,"Costco is a great job with good benefits, just not too much room to move up and grow. Costco is amazing for how it treats its employees, encouraging a good work environment."
good,"Retail is a very busy fast paced and demanding job. All duties are including general floor and building maintenance, worked as merchandiser stocking cleaning as per company required standards. Maintained positive attitude during stressful and constant changing environments. Provided strong customer relations in positive and negative situations. Most days maintained the floor without being supervised as a floor problem resolver from picking up garbage to arranging clothing tables. Worked support for cashier and food certified for the deli."
good,"It was a fairly fun place to work, very challenging with high demand. The management wasn't that great, but the co workers were wonderful."
good,"If you are eager to learn they are eager to teach."
good,"Provided you work at a busy location, advancement can be possible. However, you will run into unqualified middle managers, who are challenged by delegating and reaching targets. Managers are determined based on seniority, not qualifications. They are unable to manage behaviours and to motivate employee to carryout objectives. Pay structure surpass competitor by far. Management structure need an overhaul, from the top down."
good,A typical day at work was always very busy. I learned hoe to run members through my line very fast and very efficiently. I enjoyed several of my co-workers. I think the hardest part of the job was trying to maintain the number of members through the line that was required and the most ejoyable part of the job was being able to accomplish the tasks I was handed.
good,At Costco i worked in the service deli as the rotisserie operator. I learned how to prepare customers orders and to keep track and reorganize produce on hand. I also learned how to work in a fast passed setting.
good,"it was a great fun fast paced environment. great people to work with, but the management was extremely micro managed. The hardest part of the job was running everywhere you went. it was hard for the first 3 weeks but my muscles got used to it, i loved it."
good,"Costco is an average place to work, with average pay, benefits and opportunity to advance"
good,"Great Company and benefits, Poor Management. I learned a lot about customer service. I enjoyed working with the other employees. Everyone worked together. They have great teamwork."
good,"travailler sur le planché, caisse et aide-caissière,passer d'un travail à l'autre à tout moment, pas de routine."
good,"Its not uncommon knowledge that Costco pays the best in the retail business and offers great benefits as well. This alone pushes myself and others to work harder than they would for any other job. Also, most of my co-workers were great people who put forth 100% effort everyday and were friendly as well. Unfortunately, that's about the extent of the positives offered from Costco. There are simply to many supervisors and managers overlooking the employees which often leads to misinformation. I have had many co-workers who were fired because of being ""written up"" to many times, often being blamed for things that made little to no sense or did not even happen. Supervisors constantly try to show dominance and take control of what you are doing, despite another supervisor telling you to do something else, then you are scolded for not listening. The entire ordeal is a mess and management at that company seriously needs to be re-organized. I have done research online and found that the Costco I worked at was not the only one that had this same problem. But as always I try to make the best of the situation and I worked hard while keeping my mouth shut leading to a more or less enjoyable experience working. I was able to learn a great deal about the importance of teamwork and group cohesiveness. "
good,"A typical day at Costco La Habra on Cart Crew entails a very redundant routine of pushing carts toward the front of the warehouse, navigating around members cars in the parking lot, picking up trash, and loading/unloading merchandise for members.  "
good,there is lack of communication and everyone has a question mark over there heads they are cluless in coralville and there is alot of favoritism. some of the supervisors are lazy and incompetent and one manager is a total mean girl
good,"In a typical day I would empty trashcans located throughout the warehouse, clean restrooms, offices, and break rooms. I also had to be available to clean up any spills that occurred in the warehouse or answer any questions that customers might have."
good,the company itself is great but the management at DC285 cared more about the inner cliques than the whole employee group. if you werent in the inner circle you got treated like you were lower class
good,"Insurance is great. If you want to stay in retail forever, it probably doesn't get any better. If you have bigger plans... get to them."
good,It is a busy place all the time with all the customers wanting to have a fast but consistent transaction. I learned that being patient but working hard shows that customers that we are working as efficient as possible doesn't only make them happy it also show your management that u are serious and committed to your employer.
good,"fast paced, good management, great staff. hdhjhdsjhduhp9dh9hcpshdkjh hshdh ijdjsok. hskhdkjhej. jkhdnf. jkjrkakahd mn ghifu ghja;dl."
good,I enjoyed the company that I worked for but there was no sense of job security and lots of unfairness.  The work they did in the community was awesome
good,"Must be flexible, schedule changes made all the time,"
good,"I was a seasonal employee at Costco."
good,i enjoyed the fast paced mornings shifts. It was great for someone with energy first thing in the morning. Attention to detail was a must and a self motivated persona helped with getting everything done before the store opened.
good,"Good place to work if you can find a permanent position and you don't even injure yourself or get sick. Management is decent to work for, but very often you won't get credit for the work you completed and will get in trouble for what another employee has done mistakenly. Very stressful place to work"
good,"I have been around this company since 1984 and have watched them grow to the International company they are today. In the beginning the employees were taken care of and respected but since the company has gotten so big ( also the change of guard in the role of CEO ) that has changed. Most employees that I talk to feel under appreciated. It seems like things at the warehouse level are swept under the rug. Don’t get me wrong, the company has great benefits and you can transfer just about anywhere but they have lost touch with their employees."
good,"A tough but very hands on experience. Seasonal hire, that worked in the bakery during highest volume of holiday. Also as a cashier assistant, loading and unloading carts for customers. As a newbie, was constantly compared to associates who worked the company for better part of their careers. (Of course I wouldn't be on par with someone who worked there for 15+ years). A big downer was that I rarely ever felt like part of the team. Out of everyone who was hired for the holiday, only a couple people at most, were kept, everyone else was let go. Definitely a learning experience, but wouldn't wish to work there again."
good,"A review is an evaluation of a publication, service, or company such as a movie, video game, musical composition, book; a piece of hardware like a car, home appliance, or computer; or an event or performance, such as a live music concert, play, musical theater show, dance show, or art exhibition. Wikipedia"
good,"Absolutely fantastic pay and benefits if you are okay with staying at a dead end job catering to entitled customers that don't treat you like a person.  You have to have thick skin to work in retail, especially at a member's only establishment.  Make sure to become a brown-noser to upper management if you want to move up into the leadership ranks.  "
good,"FAst, intense workplace, but shifts go quickly because you are busy."
good,"Somme toute, mon expérience chez Costco en aura été une bonne. Cependant, le salaire n’est pas à la hauteur du travail accompli. La pression ainsi que la culture pyramidale et hiérarchique de l’entreprise tend à brutaliser les employés et les robotiser. Très peu de place à la prise d’initiative bien que ça fasse partie intégrante de leur programme d’embauche."
good,"Warehouses are often short-handed. People are often promoted who have no people or managerial skills. Managers are rarely held accountable for their personal behavior. Costco is no longer a family-oriented company. There are more unhappy employees than happy employees, including those who have been there many years."
good,"limited growth opportunities in certain areas, not much upward promotion unless you play politics or are a favorite. Try to look for new locations better chance of being promoted if you move"
good,"For one, Costco managers and supervisors are majority men, therefore if you are 50 or older female don’t expect to be hired permanently because they clearly only like  and hire the young pretty girls, unless you work the food court or clothing dept. They also discriminate age when promoting, they promote the young employees opposed to the older employees who have ten years of seniority or more."
good,"fast paced, seasonal part time work. would like more opportunity for full time when hired. Staff and management usually pleasant, but sometimes too stressed."
good,"I am tasked with pushing carts, stocking the empty pallets, assisting members with moving their items to their cars, cleaning the warehouse front end. I enjoy the people that I work with as they are all very genuine, but I do not like how fast incredibly fast paced the work environment is."
good,"Costco is a good, laid back company to work for with great benefits. The pharmacy staff is knowledgeable and efficient. The best part of the pharmacy is that there is no drive-thru and closed on Sundays."
good,"Working in the bakery is very physically demanding, be prepared to work hard. Practically no weekends off. Learnt a lot, how to operate heavy machinery, decorate cakes, make desserts and pack.Good pay and benefits after one year plus. Some management not the best, promoted from within but don't always have the necessary people and communication skills. Most workmates are friendly but disputes and arguments were not always resolved, resulting in frosty atmosphere. You would often only get negative feedback. Not enough staff so you often end up working longer than your rota'd hours on busy days. The company has good work ethics but isn't always put into practice. I enjoyed the creative side of my job, but the physical side was sometimes hard going."
good,In Puerto Rico its a like more hostile the environment. over all people are nice and is a peaceful workplace. the pay is good and treat employees well.
good,"Manage customer accounts, service phones, data entry, converts customers to get the best plan to save the money add  service or get new service make sure they got the right phone or service to suit their needs"
good,"This job was a bad experience working in a small town where there a clicks and favorites, you had to schmooze for your promotion or know someone so would not recommend Costco.com."
good,"Great pay for retail especially compared to similar (competitors) companies. If you show dedication and hard work, it can be quite easy to move up within the ladder, the downfall is, the more you move up the less work-life balance you will have."
good,"Had difficulty on passing the drug test. Were not working properly"
good,Hello today I will give you a review of what it is like working at Costco. It is a typical retail job with many associates all with different motives.
good,"I learned a lot on how mixes get done. For example the trail mix with all the nuts, chocolates , and raisins. I saw a new process on how employees would physically check all incoming materials. Over all it was a very good learning experience"
good,I loved to work at Costco  but I absolutely don't like  de front end management every supervision give different instruction and when I follow one instruction the other punished whyI am doing that. The other thing what I think not was fair before they re hired me after season work I let them know the first day I am purchased my airplane ticket  to travel home se my family for the hole summer they rehired then before I have to leave for my vacation they said I have to quit because they cant give me that long holiday. :(
good,"Good place to work, enjoyed working there.  Hours were flexible and manageable and staff made you feel welcome making it easier to fit in with everyone."
good,It was fine I just didn’t have the time was supposed to be part time but I worked full time and got in trouble for going the extra mile at work to get the job done
good,"Good working environment. Working as a seasonal employee i did a little bit of everything, jumping around from working carts outside, to organizing clothing or food inside. Was a good experience for the time being."
good,"I’m at two years as part-time at Costco and yes the hourly pay and benefits are great and they give us free food often. The catch is that It’s physically hard work (that’s wholesale). The managers are very strict about sanitation rules, dress code, workflow habits, and always increasing “sense of urgency”. The turnover rate is high as well because it takes years for them to give anyone full time, and they strictly don’t work around other employers."
good,"The IT department is very large and they have a problem keeping employees engaged in meaningful tasks. There is an ever-increasing list of technologies used. For example, big DB2 shop bought DB2 UDB then Netezza, etc. Management can't seem to make up their minds as to which technologies to use. No direction."
good,"The workers along side of me were cool, he management sucked!! they played favoritism!!! Not cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"It was a great experience at Costco.I would say a typical day was being a cashier assistant and stocking throughout the day when asked. Also, moving departments for a bonus for extra knowledge."
good,"It's was good to worked there because I used to like,I help lot a people because I pass really good time.when I left the jod they don't want me to help"
good,Clueless manager. Working weekends is a regular thing. Crazy hours and crazy customers who expect their butt kissed every time they walk through the door
good,"Costco is a great place to work where they take care of you to the highest extent but the job does require someone to be quick on their feet, polite to other people and to be hardworking"
good,This is a management company that runs the Costco Auto Program.  Very little tolerance for change or suggestions for change.  Upper management is very locked into old ways
good,"Note,  I can only comment on the store where I worked."
good,"To many ""managers"" and they all have a power trip problems so even if you work in one department if you do something wrong at lest 5 different manager Are going to be on your back about it. I guess thats why they give a good salary. The big boss all the do all day is sit in front of their computer and watch the security camera to watch you work !"
good,"Decent place to work. Good management, good co workers. Lots of positions to find your fit. Minimal benefits. Mostly part time hours................................"
good,Costco was able to give me one of my first jobs and allow me to experience the work field and allow me to see what I want to do in the future as well as helping me look for other jobs in the coming years
good,Fast-paced environment where management expects you to produce as much as possible to cover their quotas. This means sometimes overextending yourself during shifts to meet their demands.
good,Costco was a good place to work. Very fast paced job. We got our work done fast and on time. Everyone working there helped out to get the job done. If you weren’t sure on how to do something fellow employees didn’t hesitate to show you how to get your job done.
good,"Costco had good benefits, they have Aetna for insurance, employee stock option, and receive a membership upon request. "
good,"Would be a good job for someone with a second income. Very limited overtime and terrible shift assignments. Split days off and all different hour start times. The operations team were very pleasant and professional. the work itself was very easy, drop and hook."
good,Need a lot of physical strength and commitment. have to be up for the whole time
good,"Management cares more about members than their employees. Multiple occasions where employees were harmed or harassed and management did not care because the ""member is always right"" and they pay to be there."
good,"fun but very less hours, less job security"
good,"Very stressful. They don't fire anyone and they should. "
good,Busy during the holiday season but management in bakery always made sure we took our breaks and goals for the days were clear.  However I would say that some regular employees made seasonal employees feel unwelcome.
good,"It is ok, but you make it your life to become successful there. don't work there if you plan to just get in and go home. They want it to be your life."
good,Costco is a good company to work for as long as you can handle the physicality and mental strain from the entitled members. Managment at my store left a little to be desired.
good,great place if you're looking for a challenge.   there's a lot of customer interaction in this type of business.   If you consider  yourself a people person than this is a good fit for you
good,"Good benefits, mundane work environment. Poor communications skills from top down, leads to poor execution. If you like to repeat what you did the day before and the day after and the next day Costco is perfect for you!"
good,"fast paced and very competitive vs other locations,   there will be more than several situations where it may become stressful and it's up to you to decide which way to go about and react.   Plenty of room for growth within the company.  hardest part of the job was making sure other employees followed break schedules in order for other to take theirs.   very important to have them step off for the next break to come around.  the environment was fun, easy going and safe."
good,costco was an ok place to work. management sucks and they dont work with your schedule but the people i worked with were cool. i think if you have a lot mof personal things going on its not the best place to work.
good,Costco provides cheap and pretty good benefits. The work itself is quite easy until you have a bunch of people call out and they except you to do 3x the amount of work which happens quite often. Other than that it's a job and pays.
good,"Weekends required to work,6 hour work shifts fellow employees are very friendly. 7:15 is the latest you have to work. You work 6 hours and have a 1/2 hour lunch and 15 minute break."
good,You can work as hard as you want and you will just get the same raises as everyone else just walking around. You only need to occupy the building to get raises.
good,I love helping and solving problems for customers and answering questions.
good,I wouldn't recommend working for Costco just from my personal experiences ( mostly with poor management ) the best part was the free membership for me.
good,For a college student this job is okay to have. They take you back when school is out. It pays better than most jobs and it's all easy work. It is a good company to work for.
good,"Very hard reactionary work, it wasn't for me, I do not like being Micro Managed. The job was for the benefits which were AWESOME.  The Last manager and I did not see eye to eye at all"
good,Stocking positions are rushed for time.  Expected to get more done than given time for.  Managers are real nice and supportive.  A lot has to do with the warehouse manager - if they are nice and understanding then things run a certain way.  Others are only focused on achieving business objectives.
good,"Mixed opinion! It's an experience!"
good,cada dia se aprende algo nuevo en costco mucha motivicacion al personal
good,"Not a terrible job. I just needed Full-Time. Really hard to get Full-Time, waited 3 years. I wouldn't tell anybody looking for a FT career to apply there. Be ready for PT for a while."
good,"It was a typical job for low income. "
good,The time there was very dependent on team work and your desire to contribute to the job.  The store is always busy and you must understand that you will need to constantly be on your toes.
good,"Fast-pace, easy application process, managers are task-masters and mostly stand around barking orders. I am a people person and liked delivering a high level of member support. You have to stand, lift, clean bathrooms, mop floors and be in the maintenance department to get into any other department around the store."
good,if you you work hard you can make a lot of money and they have a lot of programs you can use to help you further your self in other aspect of life you just have to be willing to work hard you know
good,"A nice place to work, relaxed work culture, but not good if you are looking for better career growth. Compensation is another thing that management has to look for."
good,"Good ,very good and friednly environment ,staff is very helpfull, the most joyable parttime job and also a hardest part time job ,manager is ok not bad ."
good,"As a male I got to push plenty of carts. My location had a scheduler who did a terrible job and there was extreme inconsistency for all coworkers and Supervisors (close today, open tomorrow, etc) no one could predict anything on a week to week basis and it was difficult to have a social life if you worked full time."
good,"I was a part time fuel attendant that also worked front end sometimes. I never cashiered, that required you to go through a small training that got you an extra 25-50 cents an hour and I ended up taking more hours on over the summer when I was out of my probationary period."
good,"I was in charge of re stocking the seasonal items such as couches, plants, coffee, dairy, produces, clothes, all within the first 5 hours of the shift, not including taking a 30 minute lunch and a 15 minute break in order to become a cashier and preforming opening cashier duties."
good,"It is nice to work for Costco as the work life balance is good, New learning opportunities, good and knowledgeable team to work with. Good management and nice work environment."
good,"Costco is all go, go, go. there is never a dull moment. Very fast paced, whether you are prepping, helping a member, shopping or on the front end, it is a very physical job."
good,Fun work place team work. Great managers great supervisors. Would recommend this job to anybody just graduating great career opportunities. Great training
good,Costco was good at first but once I realized that nobody care. Took all the energy out of my body. It's hard being proud of work when your manager clearly doesn't.
good,Cotsco est un environnement de travail sympa et dynamique
good,"Good Job, can grow within without a problem and the job allows you to work flexible hours and learn new skills that you can apply in the workplace and in real life"
good,"fast pace but ok since it was a seaonal position, not much training you just have to be big enough and educate enough to know how to figure things out on your own cause they just put you out there.   Big challenge but if you trust in yourself it fun to know you can bet the challenge.."
good,"From the moment you enter the building, you are expected to go ""100 mph"" and if you were considered a good employee, you were abused/penalized, not praised or rewarded."
good,"I liked a lot about Costco, but the problems that they had were significant. I think that management ignored a lot of problems in the work space. Several sexists/racial comments were made by employees and customers that tge managers completley ignored."
good,"I enjoyed working at Costco. Its a very fast paced environment, which kept me busy but it was fun. The employees were friendly and outgoing, the schedule worked well during the summer."
good,"•	Played a key role in the development and maintenance of a safety culture. "
good,"j aime faire plusieurs chose a la fois êtres polyvalente.je n aime pas rester planter dans une seule place,j aime bouger,je suis très productive dans n importe quel emploi"
good,Costco strived to be neat and clean in a daily based. For a warehouse not to have a pa system is crazy. Spills or messes are made constantly so how does it take to clean up messes
good,"get carts for parking lot rain or shine, checking people at the door cashiering ever changing schedule fun place to work plenty of room to advance free membership"
good,"-stock shelves, receive trucks, clean the work area"
good,Costco has decent entry level positions with great opportunity for advancement. They promote from within and treat their employees with dignity and respect.
good,One of the only Union-based Costcos in the area.  Employees are promoted solely upon seniority.  Raises are based on pre-set scale.  Great as a startup job.
good,"me agrado bastante el trabajar en costco, es una empresa de calidad"
good,Helping flow of customers in and out. I learned that it took a large team of communicating workers to keep customer flow in and out smoothly. Management was sub par with the workers doing most of the daylily operations.
good,"Fast Paced place to work.  Rotating shifts, part time employees are not guaranteed weekly hours.  Hard to get time off.  Work in excessive heat and extreme cold if holding an outside position."
good,"Depends which store you work for. Managements not the best. Never have your back. Members always right. Dont follow policys. Hours are all over the place no set schedule unless you've worked their for 10+ years. Benefits are good"
good,none have nothing to say about Costco was let go for un wrongful reason and don't agree with it at all. don't feel like i need to comment on them. Good place to work but management sucks
good,The General Manager at this location is great. He is always looking to hire and give others jobs. Requires a lot of manual labor. The customer base is very rude. Customers have hit me or ran me aside with their carts as if im not a LIVING PERSON trying to enjoy my job. Were not even going to talk about the parking lot..
good,"Costco is a great company overall, however it was challenging to take on work loads from different departments without proper training or anticipation. Managers are arrogant and unprofessional; this has created a culture of call outs which is a big issue in many departments."
good,"It's okay but you can get sucked in. On average apparently, people who stay there over a year, work there for 17 years. Management is always on you to make sure you don't slack off."
good,"Costco had been a great place to work until the head of the company, Jim Senegal retired. Management seems to care less about the welfare and treatment of employees and more about their shareholder's bottom line. Otherwise I enjoyed working for the company, liked the job and did not mind working hard. I ran the employee club for Costco for more than 10 years which I really enjoyed because I bonded with my fellow employees, provided fun and exciting trips, parties and events for them to enjoy. I was told several times by management that I ran one of the most successful Costco Employee Clubs in the US. It was probably the most enjoyable venues I've ever experienced in a workplace environment."
good,"Shadowed by decent pay and a ""caring"" company, Costco picks you up and throws you into the chaos the first chance they get, expecting you to never stop pushing product out the door and putting money in their pockets. Honestly, the job wouldn't be that bad if it weren't for the disconnected, stick-up-the-rear management. Pushing carts is seen as a break away from them. Also, employee reviews are incredibly harsh, critiquing you on any flaw they can dig for."
good,The other workers are very friendly and nice. It is an enjoyable place to work. The work always gets done to the best of our abilities. We try our best to uphold the Costco standards.
good,"I enjoy working busy shifts there is always something to do and the time goes by fast. Few friendly staff members. Pretty boring when the day is slow, management does not allow employees to talk really while on the job which is strange."
good,"The corporation rules all. No understanding towards local employees going thru hard times (such as being drugged mugged, and then accused of the opposite, resulting in being out for 3 days waking up not knowing what happened only to find I was fired for missing work."
good,"Je n'avais pas le coeur au travail dans cette organisation, car mes études étaient plus importantes. Cependant, il est vrai que leur culture et leur traitement de leurs employés laisse à désirer. Ils ne se basent que sur le fait qu'ils les paient bien."
good,Great benefits also get paid time and a half on sundays. A lot of things can be very unprofessional such as managers pushing their own agendas. Have to pretty much have to sweet talk to move up
good,"- fast pace environment"
good,"fun work environment "
good,The best part of this job is meeting a large variety of people from various backgrounds and having stimulating conversations with them that encourage and inspire what's possible!
good,Not a great place to work if you are a family person and would like to have family time. More of a job for people that like the retail schedule. Weekends are a must every week and there is a lot of black out dates that one can not request off. Lots of rules depending on the warehouse you work at.
good,"Great workplace only if making Costco in your end goal career , due to starting put with very minimum hours . Competitive to receive more hours due to the amount of employees ."
good,"Helping out at cash, running products for customers, stocking products. Least favorite part of the job would be helping out on cash; favorite part of the job would be stocking after the store closes."
good,"Working at Costco was an enjoyable experience, however, I did not like the minimum working hours as I was a student and this was quite stressful. Money was good."
good,"The company itself is a great place, very high energy face pace environment. There is plenty of room for advancement within the company.  They offer great benefits and competitive pay."
good,"My location was in northern California."
good,"On tills you stand all day and are pressured to upgrade memberships."
good,"the benefits are great. Its like working anywhere else. management is not the greatest. they give you the idea that they care when they really don't. Advancement in this company seems to be racially charged. The employees are great, they make it hard to have a bad day."
good,"The staff you worked with were good . Management was looking to save money, by asking people to leave early before their shift ended due to the fact costco did not meet sales quota for the day"
good,"It was ok, just didn't have the room for me there. The hours were fine and the people were good.  It was very ok at best. I don't know how much more you want me to write."
good,"Costco is a very good company to work for that offers great pay, benefits and 401k. Management  could improve on solving employee issues and be respectful towards employees."
good,Good job didn't have much over time because of the manager at the time. But overall it's a good place to start off but not to make a career. It's ok place
good,"This is a fast past work environment consistent multitasking is a key skill to work here I would say. Definitely a fun work place, you will definitely make friends here  - Also this company has numerous opportunities to move up"
good,"The one solid thing about Costco is that they take care of their members. Next are their managers and supervisors and then it is the employees. Although, the offer great benefits in store treatment was not always worth it."
good,Great to work for but the management is pretty terrible. Seems like a bunch of people in a power position just bullying everyone around because they now have the authority to do so.
good,"Costco readily hired many people my age (55).  But several of us noticed that when it came to ""grooming"" management material it was all about the younger crowd.  Part of me can see their point - but another part of me says I still have a LOT of years of good service left, and a multitude of experience."
good,Adeguato ambiente lavorativo in un contesto di crescita professionale
good,"It could be better, short hours per week. The Rate per hour was good for a state like Florida. Managers can improve their abilities to engage with the other coworkers."
good,"Fast paced environment , Everyday is different so as the customers too , But employees have the same goal which is to provide a better service and affordable products with high standards"
good,"It’s cold and slow sometimes ... "
good,"Costco is a good company to work for. Great pay and benefits. However, work/life balance is horrible. No regular days off. My schedule was never the same week-to-week. You could close till 11:30pm one day and have to open early the next morning. Management was pretty good when I first started, but they often had managers/supervisors change, and the most current (and most permanent) managers are awful. So disconnected from employees and what makes the warehouse run smoothly, killed morale. Supervisors always kind of sucked too because they were all changing as well, so they were eternally new at their position and just awkward. Lots of attitude problems from them as well (just rude or inappropriate.) Work culture: Hit or miss. Majority of people are hardworking and good people. You'll have some bad apples of course. Job security is great though. For the first 90 days you are in a probation period - you can and will be let go, so work hard. But once you make it past the 90 days, you are pretty much guaranteed to keep your job as long as you don’t break the law, follow the rules, and treat members well. The longer you work there, the less likely you are to be let go. Costco is all seniority based. So advancement is kind of iffy. You can be the hardest worker there but you won’t get a promotion over the lazy person who has been there longer. Also if you apply for different positions and training, they might not let you just because they don’t want to have to replace you in your current area. The members are often demanding and rude to employees. One main reason for leaving is even"
good,"Very high paced environment. "
good,"The work is not difficult, lots of standing around or pushing a broom which is what they hire people over 50 years old for. Was told by my manager that due to my age a move to supervisor was not possible."
good,It’s a good place to work at the people that shop are friendly and the Co workers are just as friendly. Fast paste environment and have to be physically ready to work
good,Costco is a very close minded company when it comes to change and discovering new ways of doing things. Culture is very poor and most employees just complain about being stuck there. There are no extra learning opportunities.
good,"Costco is a very good company to work for that offers great benefit package. Vacation days, sick days, jury duty leave. Management is unprofessional and don’t know how to treat employees with respect."
good,It was a good place to work and be in. Well if you were fine with a fast past environment. But I didn't like how they ended my time there early due to a complaint that ended up not being true. Even tho when i was working there i got along with everyone and i was getting really known in this location just for how i was treating the costumers and getting the work done. If they needed me to go push carts i went and i had the lots clear within a hour.
good,"The store is always busy and extremely fast paced. Management upfront seemed to busy to really give training/direction. I worked in the bakery half of time, & I loved my manager. She was strict but productive and a great lead."
good,"When executing a Special Event at Costco, vendors realize great support from Costco by being prepared, punctual, and personable.  Beyond processing a sale at the cashier, there is little interaction with Costco personnel."
good,"Too much work and not enough workers. Very cold environment. If you didnt work fast enough, you got yelled at. Was 6 months pregnant at the time and had taken 2 sick days over a month and a half period and that resulted in termination. Employees are amazing but the management sucks."
good,"The company itself has really great pat and benefits, but the management staff can be rude, and nasty. They have a tendency to lie to get you in the door and will not try to help you work a decent schedule."
good,Everyone was very welcoming at first but then quickly stop talking to you except for a few. I ended up feeling like I was being pushed out and it didn't make me feel very good.
good,Overall its alot of production and can be a Very Stressful work place around the Holidays. There are some great managers and not so great managers. They have really fun holiday parties.
good,"I worked there for a season. They kept me as long as they could but ultimately management ran lean. Full-time employees always complained about them never keeping anyone. Also, keep in mind your gonna still be hit with union fees even if you are seasonal. All in all, if you don't mind pushing carts, boxing groceries, bust your hump and you might get kept."
good,"Costco is an ok company. Good pay and mostly good hours. The one major down side to working there was the abuse you would cop from the ""members"". The free membership was also good."
good,don't have enough hours not dependable and the supervisor are hard to work with  mainly it is a seasonal job as the holidays come in and out and customer are hard to work with sometime
good,Management was ok. Job was great environment was great. The only issues I had was when I asked for accomodations and none were given to me until I spoke with Human Resources.
good,Food court is really fast paced which can be either good or bad depending on what kind of worker you are. Workplace can be stressful at times but fellow coworkers are very helpful.
good,Great job if you don't already have bills and a life. Full time is nearly impossible to get and part time is too poorly scheduled to find side work. I enjoyed the people I worked with greatly but unfortunately they don't pay my bills and thus my overall vibe is that it's not great.
good,"The company is based on strong values and they truly care about employees and their customers.   Strong management and workplace culture."
good,"La production est ce qui a de plus important, mais les gens avec qui on travail sont généralement souriant."
good,The main reason I didn't enjoy the job is because it was a mindless job. The good thing is that I walked almost a marathon every day. Very strict on clock management.
good,Worked as a seasonal position. The job was great money but because i was seasonal I felt like I was pretty much used by them. If someone in the seasonal position could not over the time the schedule was said to be they were then let go. They would give us 2 hour notices so we would have to stay even if we had prior commitments or else we would be fired.
good,The amount of time actually spent in the tire shop was lower than time spent being sent up to the front end of Costco to help with stocking and bagging.
good,You really get recognized at the job for how hard you work. You can very quickly advance. The pay is very reasonable. Even if you're working in the front you still get paid well.
good,"It was an okay job it's fast pace because of it being the food court, I didn't get the hours I wanted and it seemed they chose theit favorites, but I did learn stuff from this job."
good,Your constantly changing positions and running around the store. Once you are hired you will be assigned a position but you will not only do that position.
good,"they need to be more considerate about their employees.  the scheduling was all over the place, they need to be able to manage employees with school, which I consider from my experience that they did a poor job."
good,"The seasonal employees at my location got screwed over. We all worked Christmas eve and New Year's eve and were all let go New Years eve night without any prior notice. I knew with a seasonal job position that getting a permanent position was not a definite, but initially they made it seem as though we would be there until at least late January. I definitely would not have given up so many holiday hours or weekends working here had I known they were going to do me dirty like that... If you are hired as seasonal be prepared to get let go at any moment"
good,Good place to work money is good but work is strenuous and very hectic. Favoritism is high and they don’t accommodate disabilities well. I like the pay.
good,"Although the benefits at Costco are great especially for part time employees, daily job culture is chaotic at best."
good,I was only there for a couple of months so I don't  have a lot to say about the environment at Costco.  The Optical Department is like  own little company.  I was hired by the Doctor.
good,"I'm not gonna lie, it was nice being in a very fast moving place, making friends here and there, but I didn't like the managing of things one day your working good, then the next hours are cut last minute changes here and there weren't the best."
good,"Great place to work whilst studying, people are friendly, Management mainly nice"
good,There was many different managers and each one wanted you to do something different. When you did it to the other managers epectations you got into trouble. One manager would tell you to do something one way then change her mind on the same thing the next day
good,"The morning shift was great and so was the management but the night and afternoon shift are the worst. The staff is rude and don't pay attention to your needs and the workers are competitive the give you ""tips"" to look bad."
good,A typical day consisted of myself maintaining the bakery and keeping the kitchen up to sanitation code. My position was filled with a decent amount of stress but the pay and benefits were good.
good,The job was fast paced and required attention to detail as well as the ability to be social. the job was fast paced and required many different you to perform many different tasks
good,"I really enjoyed working at Costco until I started paying more attention to management. It is really easy work, but the management make it so much harder to work at this company"
good,"Esta bien trabajar en esta empresa, tiene un buen ambiente"
good,The workplace environment was very structured and very well ran. I did not like the retail environment or the late working hours but it was a great place to work.
good,"Good company to work for, good wages for easy and friendly work environment. Good benefits, and open opportunities for moving up in the company or to different departments."
good,"Costco is overall a decent company to work with. However, the starting pay is not at all very good, it takes a while to get to a decent wage, get full-time work or benefits and the hours are pretty daunting if you work morning (you start at 4am)."
good,My first job out of the military. Management was horrible. Store manager was a slave driver. Only cared about herself and her bonuses. Always made you feel less of a person if you addressed an issue. Really made me not like coming to work. And I worked there for 4 years and was still only part time.
good,"I like my job but, I wish that I had better hours. I spoke with several managers about changing my hours and none of them were willing to work with me. I wasn't trying to be difficult but, I wanted to be able to spend time with my family instead of working late hours every night that  I was scheduled."
good,"Fast paced and rewarding work "
good,"Busy you have five hours to get the your Section stocked and showtime ready "
good,"une bonne ambiance en général , bonne entente avec la chef de rayon ."
good,Within Costco I help with the food department as well as helping with stocking of supplies. I made sure meal preparations were taken care of correctly. Also stocking items and merchandise.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es tranquilo, no buenos sueldos."
good,"was a nice place to work, pay was okay but the management was kind of out of touch with the pharmacy operations but overall it was nice to work there."
good,great place to work staff very friendly very busy warehouse but all in all good management always there to help baking days production also a lot of confectionary products to finish off
good,"Good place to work if you want benefits and you love to deal with customers that are always unhappy/taking advantage of the ""customer is always right"" policy.  Management is ok, however I worked at a union store based all on seniority, so there was little opportunity to advance.  The average day is crazy, no matter what department you work, some more than others, and they have job postings so you can decide if you want to try and learn another department or not. If you love retail and are a hard worker, then apply here, but Costco has a way to give its employees just enough to keep them there, and before you know it, you'll wonder where your life has gone."
good,It was a good job to work at while working on my degree. Flexible hours and many positions to work in that made it easy to be a part time student.  The management changes often which can be a good or bad thing depending on your position. Definitely teaches you customer service skills and how to handle people who are unhappy.
good,"Okay place to work in. I worked for a flower company in costco called bloomstar. I did 12 hours onSaturday, and 11 on Saturday. I only got a half hour break, which really sucked considering the amount of hours I worked..."
good,"My working environment is one where there's a good sense of team spirit.  A strong work ethic is obviously important but the human side is also important.  I enjoy working with people who have a decent sense of humour and who, while they might take their work very seriously, don't necessarily take themselves overly seriously!  I like people who are down to earth but who have a dynamic and progressive approach to their work.  I really enjoy working as part of a highly committed and professional team."
good,Always very busy especially during holidays if working weekends is a problem for you this is not the place for you.  You will spend your vacation time tying to get a weekend off.
good,"Overall, the Costco Optical Laboratory is a fast paced job, that will always require you to work with others. Teamwork and good time management skills will help you succeed."
good,"My typical day consisted on maintaining high productivity, ensuring employees were receiving breaks and lunches on time, registers are properly maintained, every department was well covered to meet the needs of our customers and monitored our daily revenue hourly to ensure the warehouse was reaching its financial goals."
good,"employees don't care about the company, but for their own pocket. Management does as they wish and there is a lot of favoritism, as well as no consideration to concerns raised to management awareness."
good,I am a hard working student and work hard at the position I’m in but seniority basically runs the company and makes newcomers less likely to stay it’s not somewhere I plan on staying
good,If you don't plan on being there for the rest of your life then don't bother.  You start at minimum wage and get a 50 cent raise every 800 hours worked.  On top of that those that have earned the top scale wage will continuously find ways to do less and less work making it seem like you're getting payed less to do more than other people.  Very frustrating system.
good,working at Costco was definitely a challenge in regards to the leadership and management. Unprofessional and lacking in basic skills. On the plus side my coworkers are fantastic.
good,"90% of my work involve visiting locations in several states. Large geography, "
good,"Wanted part-time work with limited hours but mandated is 6 hour shifts. Engaging with customers were required but only a limited amount of demonstrators performed this task. Never know what item would demonstrate until arrived at work. I was on-call and was supposed to be notified of work schedule the day prior to work, but management was inconsistent on delivering communication of work schedule. Not much help when it came to table demonstration preparation for the next day for whomever would at random chose the table. I was informed to communicate with customers in selling items in addition to food preparation, but other demonstrators were not expected of same tasks. Demonstrators were mandatory to stand during their entire shift, which was 6 hours, so it was a problem with most older workers."
good,"Yo estuve trabajando como auxiliar de fresh meat durante un año aproximadamente, mi experiencia fue bastante mala, algunos compañeros si eran agradables, pero habia otros que te querian pisar a toda costa, ademas el manager tenia poca personalidad y se dejaba llevar por sus "" amiguitos"" "
good,i love working there. the staff lounge was nice had a big sceen tv and a couch. the job was nice i made friends and the people were very nice. the days were long but quick.
good,It was an ok job. decent pay and decent benefits after a certain amount of time. didn't really enjoy the food court environment as well as had to many tattoos
good,Cleaned meat room and cutting utensils. Organized areas where the meats were stored. Mopped floors of the establishment. The work place was a good culture
good,"I love my job and the people that i work with but it just isnt the job for me. Being a single mom and having to work nights and weekends every weekend and they arent very lenient with working with you during the weekends. At first i wasnt a single mom but now that i am it is hard to find baby sitters and be able to afford them with only working part time,"
good,A big issue with Costco is that it's all seniority. Now that's not always bad if you've been there a while but for the new guys it can suck a whole lot and certain departments make it suck even more because you can be stuck doing the most work with the least amount of time to relax but be paid the minimum solely because you haven't been there as long as others.
good,"The best thing about working at costco are the other workers. there are so many individuals who you can work with and meet. on the other hand Costco feels like a big grocery store where you cater to people who pay for a membership so people can be very snooty and selfish. management caters to those people so you as an employee have to watch yourself constantly. management belittles you because they perceive themselves as being at a higher status then you, workers are seen as worker ants and that is all. You as a worker are an individual working alongside 300+ employees. you are easily replaceable if you are not liked. Managers cover for each and have seen it in many occations. Supervisors get promoted or demoted constantly. overall the people who work their are what keep me there. Weekends are a jungle and seem to be constantly out of control."
good,"Great staff, poor management , easy hours, one hour lunch break on a full shift, difficult to get to full time even after 3 years of part time service, decent pay if you can get the hours"
good,"This position could have been better by allowing short chair rest. Too much standing."
good,"customers felt very entitled to your hard work, yes the customer is always right but there was multiple times that the line was crossed. Management were not very good."
good,"Good a job for students or people starting out. lots of evening positions open for after classes. Decent pay for simple retail work, and movement after first year."
good,Costco's culture has remained consistent over the years. Its culture is what has driven its success. They provide excellent benefits to their employees.
good,They pay very well but a simple mistake is a huge mistake at Costco. If you are not almost sprinting to whatever it is you are doing you get yelled at.
good,"I often see posts online about how folks have been here for 10,15,20+ years and love it and yet I cannot seem to see that long term goal for myself. I recently transferred to a new store and I've been busting myself in various departments only to get passed up for full-time positions for folks who have barely been with the company half as long as I have. One or two of which seem like they chat with members more than actually do work. What's worse is that loud mouths who complain evidently get their way. Not my kinda leadership/job, folks. It seems like a pretty garbage promotional system and it's wildly inconsistent, like the hours. When they tell you Costco will give you at least 24 hours, minimum a week, then come slow season that's what you'll get. Plan accordingly or you'll end up looking for another job once the flow of seasonal folks come in and your warehouse hires them WAY too early, pushing anyone who isn't full-time to minimum hours. Honestly, I'm mentally out and it's my fault. One of my supervisors advised me to give it a shot. To attempt to move up. I should have known that Costco was just like any other retail job. Going above and beyond puts me right about the same place as someone who simply does the minimum, it seems like and frankly, it's nothing but discouraging. TL:DR - It's retail part-time, treat it as such and you'll be fine. Expect more and be severely disappointed."
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar si eres estudiante"
good,I would recommend to any of my friends to work at Costco. They provide benefits and consistent hours. Never have to worry about a check bouncing. Not a career choice if you ask me though.
good,I worked nights mostly for 13 dollars an hour and it was great because my schedule never got mixed up with my school schedule. I also liked how the employees respected each other.
good,"Once they cut all the full time people down to part time, they cleaned house.  They slashed everyone's salary and tried to make you happy to work for less."
good,I enjoyed it for the time being that I was employed at Costco. I meet new people but then as any job you run into either co-workers or customers that were not to friendly.  But overall you will be standing and walking your whole shift.
good,"Management was very helpful, patient, and welcoming. The work load was fair and manageable. The most enjoyable part of my time being a Costco was learning more about the company and building friendships."
good,"This company should have career advancement ,they should give opportunity to newly people who worked with them not just only to their long time employee."
good,It was a cool working experience. Everybody was friendly and nice. Great to see customers smile. Had a rocky start but turned out ok. Was kind of frustrating because it seemed like the bakery manager didn't know what to do or where to put me... Guess they was kind of new at that time???? So just threw me on different stations and half assed told me what to do.....
good,Was a great place to work. Management was great and they care about their employees. Need to improve better raises for long time employees. Would recommend to others
good,"Managers push employees hard, this creates a stressful and non-efficient environment. I felt over worked and underpaid when in was employed at Costco."
good,it was a good time fun people to work with hardest part was to wait for the last hour to get out. tired at the end of the day but u get to do what u get to do for your kid and show him how to take care of business
good,"I had good coworkers and the time and a half on sundays and holidays is great. Unfortunately i had to leave because of management. I would always be the first department to finish at night and even when i had the option to clock out and leave, i would stay for the extra hours and help other departments close. Even though i would do this, i would get yelled at and threatened by the back end manager. Threats of firing were almost a daily routine. As it turns out, he would do the same to every other hispanic person at my job as well. I would complain to hr about it and I was told that if i didn't want to get yelled at i should work harder because he had seniority over me. I eventually got tired of the harassment and left."
good,"The job grew exceedingly difficult to complete, management kept adding more and more responsibilities until it wasn't possible for one person to complete their tasks."
good,"its ok job to work but its retail.. looking and seeking different job experience in work place. and looking for different environment.The management team is fair daily it changes sometimes you just don't know what to expect when you get to work.. i Have leaned how to work with people from all over different parts of the world. a "
good,"COSTCO is good to their employees, however their pay is low. So, it's a little like working for the Government.  You're never going to make any money - but you won't get fired."
good,Creating a local community network for the growth of Costco memberships.  Day to day onsite meetings and non-profit events. The workplace culture is very diverse and provides a great opportunity for those who wish to have a long time career in the retail wholesale market.
good,my experience in working at Costco was very positive. I learned how to keep a balance of working multiple different positions and having the opportunity to be challenged in different environment in such a short term.
good,"cashier, stocking, assist packing customers carts, obtain items that were left behind and return them back to appropriate area, call other stores to verify if item is in stock at other costco locations."
good,"The management part is hard to deal with. It's a little like high schoool, personalities clashing, favorites getting promoted without much work, and never getting vacay requests approved."
good,"Citi Costco customer service, great place to work people are great, management always looking after employees and taking care of them. Team meetings were essential to meet months ending goals."
good,"It's basically a meat grinder during the hiring seasons. They bring in about 50 new people and keep maybe 4. Jobs are difficult, demanding, and can wear a person thin. They do have health benefits, but you'll most likely be one of the hundred or so people working part-time on paper, but full time in hours. They work you at 40hrs/week until they cut you back to keep you down. It's a great place if you're fit, young, and need a stepping stone."
good,"costco is a really great work place to work part time if youre a student "
good,"Costco is a great place to be a member & shop. "
good,"Good as a  temporary job while you finish college. However, their emphasis on seniority can lead to a complex work environment. Often times, managers were driven by their egos, which led to a poor work environment."
good,"Lots of work to keep busy."
good,"My shift was from 4am-9am."
good,"Helped customers select products that best fit their personal needs."
good,"Really depends on who your manager is etc. Some treat their employees right.  Also GM is vital, a good GM leads to good store, a poor one makes for a bad job environment."
good,Costco is a good company to work for and I enjoyed my time there. But the experiences may vary based on the competency of you mangers. I loved my job but had an awful. rude and un-organized GM.
good,Great company to work for lots of opportunity. unable to continue to work while in school though but do have a program to come back to Costco during the summers
good,"Costco Wholesale is a catering company that thrives on the best customer service and presentation within its warehouses. A lot of time and effort goes in to making sure that all customers feel they are paying the best amount of money, for the merchandise they purchase"
good,Desempeñaba labores en él área de fuentes  aprendí ha trabajar bajo presión  un ambiente laboral divertido pero no  avía respeto entre algunos colaboradores y había problemas por lo mismo.
good,"Managers/supervisors do not seem to care about your personal life only want to meet ""the needs of the business"". Depending on what GM you get, your warehouse can be great. On the flip side of that if your GM cares more about his personal bonuses then the employees then your in trouble! When the new CEO of Costco took over he gave a lot more power to the warehouse GM's, which has totally changed the culture of the company. If you really need a job with decent pay and benefits, then go for it! If you make it through your first 90 days and can put up with the attitude of the overworked managers and sups then your golden! Good Luck!"
good,travail physique et rapide. sa sent toujours bon dans le département
good,"buen ambiente laboral, solo que algunos supervisores no saben nada sobres ser un lider y tener criterio"
good,"Costco is a very work friendly environment, with many diverse staff members. Work was great until the hours got cut dramatically, and left many short of working hours. I felt like the work ethic of a few other employees were lacking in the department(s) and not much was done in that sense because management was so busy they couldn't be watching over the employees. I feel like I was not appreciated once the season was over, although I did switch departments to help out and picked up hours when employees didn't show up."
good,What can I say about Costco? You get a lot of work for a little bit of money and most of the company is run by kids or adults that are consumed by cannabis and alcohol so they think like kids.
good,Typical day was anywhere from working the till to stocking the shelves. Overall not a difficult job but on some days there were a lot of people coming in.
good,"For a retail job, it's good if you like to keep busy.  Some people work harder than others, you get paid the same.  Not allowed to stand around.  Enjoyment depends on management and those you work with, like all businesses."
good,"costco had benefits and could lead to more promising positions if you work there for long term, the team was very friendly and usually fun to work with"
good,Great retail company with decent benefits. Decent workplace. There is opportunity to move up in the company especially if you are willing to move around. Overall a decent company.
good,"The management is the worst part of the job, if you can deal with them you can make some pretty good money. The starting rate is 13 an hour beating most other places by quite a lot."
good,Costco whole sale is a good company to work for because it has good benefits. I have a derre in feild crops technology and I always knew that i wanted to have a job were i can put my degree to use .
good,There is a constant line in the food court. There is no down time so your work days fly by. The oven tends to make work very hot. Management is not the best. They get away with treating their employees unfairly.
good,"To be successful at Costco you need to ""drink the Koolaid."" While the pay is decent, if you're not ready to dedicate 100% of yourself to retail, it's not the company for you."
good,"One's work isn't based on how they actual work, but rather on how they present themselves to the higher ups.  Rewards are given only if you ""suck up"" and stay in your ""lane"" so to speak."
good,I had to start my day at 415 am i worked morning merchandising. I would stalk till 10 then would be a front end cashier. I also work in the vault and photo lab.
good,I enjoyed my time there the work could be quite physical at times.  The unloading of heavy materials was time consuming and difficult. Sometimes working outside in poor weather could also be difficult
good,residence close to work..co workers are mature individuals..they only give you hours on an on call basis but will only give you 1 day a week and sometimes none at all..the pay is very good even though you stand on your feet for 6 hours at most...
good,I liked working here but I didn't work here long because of the terrible management where I worked. I was lied to by my manager about some clocking in/out confusion and it cost me my job. I would have loved to stay at this job.
good,Attending to members and billing them goods. Attending other business needs in other departments. 24 hour shift pattern with pay progression and bonus scheme after completing minimum hours. Shifts can up 10pm at nights and from 10 overnight
good,"the company has a wonderful amount of positions to work and knowledge to be learned, but the management does not run like it is supposed to, they play favorites and dont promote people that work hard"
good,"Its nice as a base job, but the work can became stressful for a student, or a person who has other priorities. When booking time off it can be a headache because management will give you a run around"
good,"I realize it is a warehouse but they run your hours like a factory - you have to take your lunch after so much time there , or they write you up, you have to clock out on time, or they write you up.  They fail to realize that if you are in the middle of giving customer service in a pharmacy you might not be able to get out on time."
good,"Costco whole sale is full of fun employees, interesting members, and the best benefits for even part time employees. Everyone's spirit was very energetic, even though advancement is tough."
good,Costco is a good company but when working it is a lot to handle.  The expectation is quite high but able to reach. Co workers are great and till this day im still friends with a few.
good,Working at Costco wholesale was overall a good experience. The management has been trained to execute at the highest level and continues to operate the store correctly.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Costco but I felt like I did not receive enough training. when I did make a mistake I explained that I needed more training but never got it."
good,"Working for Costco has been an experience. I work sometimes as little as 29 hours to maximum 36 hours. My shifts vary from 9am to 9pm, never having consistancy. Love the people I work with, managers are great and easy to talk to. Staffing needs a lot of work."
good,Buen compañerismo y buenos jefes muy atentos con los trabajadores
good,We would be given various tasks on which we would use our skills given to us through training. Work side by side with our co-workers and management to deliver customers with a pleasant experience from the best of our abilities.
good,"Very versatile job atmosphere but I am enjoying as my focus to improve my skill."
good,If you like retail this is not a bad place to work.  Lots of opportunity for advancement and the benefits are amazing.  The main downside is never knowing what your schedule is going to be and working 24 hours a week over 5 days.  Also working every single weekend is hard.  But it's nice to have holidays off.
good,"The people were great, tasks weren't that difficult but management was sloppy.  No communication and lack of trust in employees.  Hardest part of the job was definitely the management."
good,"Lot associates are responsible for making sure their is a constant supply of shopping carts available for customers. In addition, they are also responsible for assisting customers load heavy items into their vehicles."
good,"So I went through two interviews with COSTCO here in Mobile, AL. I have a full-time job but was willing to hear them out. The people were all very nice and professional. They shared their stories with me about how they came to COSTCO as seasonal/part-time employees and worked their way up. They really liked my work experience and so they brought me in for another interview with the hiring manager for the second interview, rather than for the third interview. "
good,"A typical day at Costco is very busy and up beat, it is a very active environment. During my two years of employment within the company I have learned to work under the supervision of multiple people at the same time learning that communication is very important, my customer service skills have also improved allowing me to interact with many people in a positive and respectful manner. Management within the company is very poor and unorganized making it difficult to help run the business in a positive and efficient manner. My co-workers in Costco are very easy to work with and the communication between us is excellent especially being that we do work in a very confined space in membership. The hardest part of my job is being placed in a situation that does not allow me to give the customer what they desire. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with so many different people and being able to create relationships with frequent shoppers."
good,I began my career at Costco in 2001. Over the last 15 years I worked hard and moved my way up thought the deli to a return clerk. It was an amazing learning experience.
good,"great people to work with, great hours and fun filled days. Store is clean and neat and members are great I enjoy making new friends and learning different areas of the store"
good,Good job to have while in school. Flexible hours that work around school schedule. Great benefits and incentives from a respected company. Descent pay for a college student.
good,pharmacy is properly staffed. pharmacists spends most of their time concentrating on servicing customers. Management rules are more geared towards front tore. Front store management is supervising pharmacy operation more than their expertise would allow which sometimes cause conflicts
good,"Pushed a broom for hours, cleaned toilets, break rooms, emptied trash and trash containers, push floor scrubbers. Learned you can not leave a Department for any reason, have to apply and Interview for opening positions, not even for medical reasons."
good,"empresa ideal para aprender trato con clientes, exelente trato recibido de gerencia"
good,"Siempre tenía un maravilloso contacto con el cliente y vendía mucho todo el día."
good,"fast paced"
good,"Wonderful co-workers, very approachable management. The team was always willing to help all new members, and provide as much assistance as required."
good,"Above average pay"
good,"Very busy"
good,Poor management with this company. Was no real room for growth but the job was really easy.Employees are fun to work with but very big differences in the age groups.
good,"I was employed at Costco as a full time night merchandiser; however, once I started working there I was only provided three shifts a week and some of which did not match my job description at all. I did not mind night merchandising but other jobs where not for me."
good,Wish I a more consistent work schedule.  Co-workers are cool and so are supervisors.  Late evening schedule is good for me.
good,"Costco Peterborough is an overall decent workplace but it does have a lot of cons about it, management is not effective or reliable or even trustworthy, there is a lot of ""drama"" in Costco Peterborough, things there were not done to spec as they should have been and there seems to have been a lot of shortcuts made to make the job easier which was also not ok, even in full time positions you are not guaranteed a consistent schedule or will never know what is going to happen, they do not work with your ""life"" schedule and only want you to really show up and work and could care less about your life and how the hours could or are affecting you as a human being on your physically and emotional level!"
good,"Muy buena empresa lamentablemente no en todas las tiendas se puede decir lo mismo, ya que depende de quienes la dirigen y si los gerentes no saben manejar su poder abusan de ello."
good,"- Journées de travail épuisantes."
good,"I dealt with people on a day to day basis, my co workers made the job worth going to everyday. "
good,"Shift starts at 4:30am or 5am depending on the job, stock up merchandise, adjusting pallets, making the product look good and presentable for the members. After opening head straight to the cash to help bag members groceries."
good,my typical day at work is supervising other and overseeing the daily operation of the company. the most enjoying part is the closing procedures such as documentation
good,"If you ever have a problem with anything at costco all you have to do is complain enough for a manager to take notice and you will get what you want.  It's hard to advance your career unless someone gets promoted or leaves the company. Hardest part is dealing with unreasonable members who want outrageous request like new tires because they didn't use their tires currently on their vehicle.  The warranties are explained on a paper and even though you provide them with the correct information and show it to them and explain why you can't give them what they want, a manager can come and override any warranty.  Co-workers share the blunt of policies and sympathise with you.  Easy crew to work with. Great manager in that department."
good,Great place to work however micro management and unfair treatment are common at new Orleans Costco. When hired you are trained in different departments.
good,"This job was seasonal. It was a different experience working for Costco. Although it was fun and good, the early morning 5AM shifts were not my favorite."
good,"A lot of people who have been with the company for 20-30 years. Yes this is a good sign, however it makes it tough to deal with when you are first starting out and trying to learn the ropes. A lot of chiefs and not enough indians."
good,"Always on your feet. lots bending reaching...co workers were good. Best part was working the electronics department, relaxed environment. Good pay to start..benefits roll in a little later into your employment."
good,"I enjoy working here, but want something more steady and where I don't have to be on my feet all the time. The people are all nice at Costco"
good,"Servir le membre, donner un bon service à la clientèle, vendre des cartes de membership."
good,"I loved working with my coworkers, they were AMAZING people. I also loved the members. I had so much fun doing all sorts of different odd jobs and also enjoyed cashiering all day, something about consistency as well. I got really good at my job but I felt like my managers didnt like me. In the end I got very sick and had to leave and stop working for a while."
good,"I was a Floater throughout the store.  I started out in the bakery, membership sign ups, American Express Sign Ups, checking people out and door counts, food court, and folding clothes.  Costco is an equal opportunity employer."
good,The people I met working at Costco are quite possibly the best ever. Professional but still enjoyed having fun and making it fun for members also.  The management team while critical want to see you succeed.  The best part of Costco was the appreciation they have for their employees and incentive programs to help build teamwork.
good,"Working at Madison Grill taught me a lot of skills in the kitchen. It was high stress high energy work, but finishing a shift felt good."
good,"Ideal pour étudiant."
good,Costco great place to work at. There is no big problems with this company. the daily routines are smooth and they communicate well here.
good,"]All I can say is two years with this warehouse and I do not recommend the company. Last ditch effort for anyone hoping to have a sub par chance at life. Looking for my next step now, as Im too young to get stuck."
good,mgmt. is clueless they say one thing do another.  The promise things in the beginning and then do come through in the end don't get me wrong the bienfits are great but you only work 25 hours a week and when you are a single father trying to raise a family how can you make it.  Costco mgmt. is only worried about the business and could cre less bout there employees it shows on a regular basis and It is sad because its our swet and tears that make this company run....
good,"I initially enjoyed my job, however, after a few months I needed a change due to management changes and employee relations."
good,Room to advance. Many departments to train and learn from. Friendly people to work with and it's always good to enjoy our customers
good,"Costco absolutely lives up to its reputation when it comes to being an overall positive workplace that offers good benefits. There were no doubt days that I had fun while I was at work, and days where I wouldn't even realize my shift had begun and ended since I was so active. Members have also in my experience been generally pleasant to be around, which is more than can be said for other big-chain retailers. "
good,"•	Distributed, prepared and cooked samples."
good,"a lot of running, hustle and cart organizing but other than the pushy management its an alright place to work but I only know the extent of seasonal employment."
good,"A typical day working at Costco would consist of standing at my sample table interacting with different customers who would try my samples and decide whether they wanted to buy the product. I would stand at my table for most of the day, helping customers find my product in the store. This job has definitely taught me how to interact with customers a lot more by asking them questions about the food they have just tried, meeting different types of people and dealing with certain situations at work as well. Our management team was split up between three different woman and we usually only spoke to them when we had an issue with the products, seeing our schedule and having them order more product for us while we were on the floor sampling. The hardest part of the job would most likely be trying to sell the product if you have a product on the table that people might not like, for example; New Organic Cereal.. It was very hard to sell this because not many people were interested and then at the end of the day your sales would not be very good, so its definitely harder trying to sell something to someone when they don't like it. I really enjoyed interacting with customers, I would meet all different types, some really liked to talk to you and you would get to know people because they always cam into Costco during the week. I really like talking to people was always interested in hearing their input on what i was sampling."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,They should pay there workers better. Poverty line goes up just as quick as the there raises do. With rent and price just to live in the bay area going up they still pay their workers low but make us work really hard for small pay.
good,"Enjoyed my time working at Costco. Pays very well, plenty of hours, work load can be a bit large sometimes, but management is always willing to help out when needed."
good,Fun to work at. The people were fun and the advancement was always available for anyone. You always learned something new working there
good,There were constantly a lot of tasks to be completed daily considering the place was always busy with shoppers. There is never a dull day.
good,"Photo processing, and customer service, back up assistant, cashiering I like the members and working with the community"
good,"Stocking merchandise, cashier providing customer service with a smile. Co workers and managers were friendly and team players. Hardest part of the job was lifting heavy item's and the most enjoyable part of the job was making my customer's happy."
good,"a typical day at Costco consisted of filling prescriptions answering phones doing inventory,handling billing of insurance and and data entry. the management was ok. my co-works were not team oriented. the most enjoyable part of the job were our patients."
good,"We start at 11:00 PM and Finish at 7:00PM."
good,"Its a hard place to work"
good,"la empresa cuenta con muy buenas prestaciones, aparte tiene un clima laboran muy bueno."
good,"Working conditions very by location, however overall the company is a great company to work for with exceptional benefits and work flexibility."
good,"- Job was ok but now great"
good,It was a good place to work but not hiring full time or permanent part time it was seasonal only.  Most of the time would only get twenty hours a week.
good,"Fun work atmosphere. Set schedules, but everyone starts off as seasonal, at least that's what they say. Shifts can change from day to day."
good,"Good code of ethics and equal opportunity. Overall a decent company to work for. Good insurance coverage for free including dental , vision , drugs , life insurance and more."
good,"In a typical day I would handle cash, pack buggies and upgrade memberships, I learned a lot about merchandising and various new promotions, management was always helpful in assisting myself with customers needs and expectations, my co-workers were fun and very positive people to work with, the hardest part of the job was the fact that there was no room for advancement, the most enjoyable part of the job was the smiling faces of my wonderful customers."
good,"Informative, customer service very important, learned how to do property and water bills,"
good,what a great privilege to work with this company as members of employee are fun and loving.Its really nice working with such a company
good,"fast paced "
good,"Based on my experienced in this company, I have learned many things in life...communication, criticisms, motivation, team work, the sense of urgency, the passion, time-management, leadership, respect, management, sales, office work, the fun with co-workers despite of the busy warehouse each day and many more. Benefits are awesome."
good,"Excellent and experience related to working in fast-paced environment"
good,Costco cares alot about its employees. Sometimes the work is tedious though.
good,I worked in the meat department and it was seasonal employment.
good,I was cashier and audited the door. Got alone with all other employees. Quit to move to Wisconsin.
good,Nice company to work for and we had weekly meetings with all kinds of departments that would take up an entire day.  Did get difficult with Government Accounting department that would come in every second month require all different paper that was already boxed and misfiled that made it very hard to find.  That is why I make all my work very accurate.  I would go into a room with a list of single pages they would require to have and if it was misfiled then it sure made things interesting.
good,My manager was a pretty cool dude he was really laid back as long as we were working hard and staying on task keeping up on the orders on the screen.
good,"very fast paced work on straightening and cleaning up for the next day of shopping from the customers. What I learned is that I have sped myself up in productivity, co-workers didn't really see them very much being in a different area every night and working so fast paced no time to visit. The hardest part of the job was getting used to doing everything at such a fast paced speed, Costco is a fast paced job compared to Wal-Mart. getting to learn something new."
good,"Good staff and great employer to work for, hours and benefits were a bonus."
good,"Learn how to work as a team, in a warehouse. I had great co workers. Good benefits"
good,"A typical day at Costco when you walk in as an employee, you see a clean environment. Everyone is on there pees and q's. I have learned that being apart of such a big business is no joke. Costco is a company dedicated to its members. The co-workers that I have come across are not always the nicest people, but what can you do? But address certain situations and try to leave it behind you. The hardest part of my job was trying to please everyone, plus trying to have good time management. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the gorgeous woman coming in and out of the store."
good,Learn new things about company culture; as to be on time and time management.
good,"Costco is possibly one of the best retail work environments one will find. The pay and benefits are very good (especially compared to the industry). The shift hours are less desirable. Employees are expected to work shifts starting at 4 a.m. through 11:30 at night, and working on weekends is also part of the schedule. Holidays will see overnight shifts and long hours as well. Management will work even more. The hardest part of the job is the hours, and incompetent management."
good,The customers are most of the time very nice and i enjoy talking to them throughout my day.
good,Talked to customers on a daily basis to try and make a sale through club demonstration services.
good,"Customer Service in Photo Lab"
good,"It was Ok, but boring at times. But, I did enjoy working with friendly customers and co-workers"
good,"Members are friendly and is a place you can  enjoy meeting new and interesting people."
good,"5 hr. job working a day."
good,"As a part time merchandiser at Costco, the work usually starts mid afternoon and finishes at around 9pm over a period of 4 to 7 days (Part time hours). The"
good,"Residential rough ins, fast paced days. "
good,"It was always busy everyday I went, the only thing that sucked was the management."
good,"My review is friendly, great costumer service. A company I would like to work for."
good,Good job with great benefits but management could be much better.
good,"Overall its a nice place to work for, it has its up's and down's. My experience I took from the job was great customer service and communication. Management needs a little work on but all in all they are by the book. The co-workers are easy going and some time team players. Costco has great benefits, family oriented, and work with people who are trying to go back to school."
good,"a typical day  * I would go around the store asking those who might not have initially signed up for an American Express card and asked if they would like to do it free of cost and telling them the benefits of doing so."
good,"really enjoyed this job, until there was a change of management and it all went down the pan, there was numerous complaints made by myself and other staff i worked with, regarding the way things were ran,"
good,"Was great to work there during the Holidays, learned to bake and make brad, cookies."
good,my supervisors were very laid back but still do there work the worker are friendly
good,"I always had a lot of work to do, and a lot of places I could go to experience different departments."
good,"At this job I was cashier, but I was also responsible for stocking shelves, packing boxes for guests and keeping the store clean. At one point, I even took an over night position, prepping, baking, and labeling pies for the store."
good,Management didnt always work around your school schedule and became difficult to manage going to school and work. Workers although were very friendly and helpful to others.
good,good employment with high employee expectations. Disappointed when employees from 2007 and 2008 laid off
good,Always something to do and a variety of departments to work in. Working here you will need to have strong people skills and a lot of patience. Good management and co-workers.
good,"Hard work, lots of rewards, if you are able to perform well.  Is a always changing job, each day is different."
good,I was hired as seasonal. I was moved around from deli to bakery to rotisserie chicken. A typical days was fast paced and teamwork motivated. I learned how to bake and cook chicken. The management was different day by day. My co-workers were great people that kept a happy vibe during work. The hardest part of the job was working three different shifts each week. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning each section of the store.
good,Not the best place to work not a friendly place with the bosses
good,Costco was a good company to work for.  When I was hired I took on the shift that ran anywhere between 4:15 and 12:00pm.  It was difficult for me to get there at those times since busses were not running.  I approached my manager and she was not very helpful. The hardest part about the job was the hours.  Best part was all the great people.
good,"Was responsible for the jewelry counter. Showing jewelry to customers, greeting customers as they come in the store. This job was only a stepping stone and needed to have an income. It is a great place to work but not for someone that enjoys working in an office."
good,"Work with management, staff and customers at all times"
good,I'd put my things in my locker in the break room than clock in. i'd go to my department and walk my department and made a log of everything i needed to stock for the morning and than went to the coolers to search for necessary pallets needed. Hand my paperwork to a fork lift driver than go to my department and get ready to stock everything needed within 4hrs.
good,"while supervising at this company, it really put me in a negative head space. the managers were brutal, because the GM was a monster. the overall people were pretty great, but they choose to be mean because the GM didnt believe you can be nice and get the job done."
good,"Good place to work and learn various skills; details, organization, team work, customer service, business functions management, financial management."
good,i would show up each morning open up the shop received the daily morning shipment of tires and entered them in to inventory then i would open the sales floore after that my employees would start comeing in i would then deligate who would be working ware in the shop we would brake for lunch at 1 and then work till 9 and call it a day
good,"I worked here as a part time till operator"
good,J'ai été a cette emplois juste un été avant de faire mon retour aux études
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with clients
good,"Physically taxing."
good,Must be really good at being knowledgeable in other positions throughout the store so as to promote a more fluid working environment.
good,Work on a production line fast pase work place.  I love the work place and the people I worked with. The mangers were really helpful and took time to explain work projects. 
good,"Costco has been my first job and it is definitely not an easy place to be as someone's first job. It is fast paced and management expects a lot out of the employees. There is a lot of thinking on the fly and having to deal with pressure from both management and customers, but it has taught me how to work. Although at first I did not like how hard the work was, I have come to appreciate how I learned to deal with coworkers, the pressure of management, and the rigors of a job in a productive manner where I become a stronger individual because of the challenges I have to face on a day to day basis."
good,"Saturdays were always insane but went by fast. There are a lot of things you can learn within, and many departments to try something new. For the most part everyone was very easy to get along with. One disappointment is how this company ran.-Company before employee, had a hard time getting work off for school and utterly failed a semester of college. Not Cool! Also they wanted you to take a Winter Leave without pay when the economy hit. But they did have great health benefits. Hard to move up in the company. "
good,very fast paced working. have to be quiet while workng and focus only on your job at hand.
good,"nous avions pas le droit de nous assoir, parcontre nos pauses nous étaient bien accordées."
good,"This is a very boring routine job but if you enjoy retail then its the job for you. They pay better than majority of retailers and frequent raises. The managers at the Irvine store I work at are just awful with the exception of a few. Typical I think I am better than everyone retail managers picking favorites just to make a name for themselves. My store did a poor job following Jim Sinegals philosophy on a good work environment. Don't expect to get promoted unless you are a favorite or kiss up, its not about hard work. Managers talk down to you as if you are below them. Anything is possible for you to do with these managers because they don't have to do it. They really should require a college degree for these managers so maybe they can learn some basic problem solving skills or maybe even people skills."
good,"ongoing schedule changes, only able to offer part-time employment, decent benifits but inadiquate pay for commute."
good,"Había días en los cuales no se hacían muchas ventas al público, sin embargo, en temporada alta o fines de semana había mucho trabajo bajo presión y es donde uno adquiere más experiencia."
good,good for a student. starting pay is $10 per hour no matter what.
good,nice people to work with i worked 5 in the morning during christmas season
good,"Every one is so friendly, and nice to you. They teach you everything you need to know to get your job done. They are very understanding and patient with you as you first start learning."
good,"it was ok, honestly felt they thought I was too old. I worked extremely hard in every position they put me in"
good,"Very fast paced environment, developed my skills to work on cash. Long tiring days, unprofessional management team."
good,"They kept me busy, as it was a busy center. I was only there for a seaonsal position, which was for Christmas."
good,"While my employment at Costco Wholesale was not as long as i would have liked, I did enjoy my job. I was hired on as a sweeper in the pallet department. My first 30 days I swept from 7:30 in the morning to around 3:45 in the afternoon. My next 30 days, I would sweep for the first half of the day, and then would run the Smetco machine until we shut down for the day. Management for the most part were nice and good in communicating with the employees. My co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of the job was when the machine would jam and figuring out how to fix it. The most enjoyable part was having something to do at all times. I was not given any reason for my termination other than the new supervisor placed in the department did not care for me."
good,"8 hours days of off loading and loading products onto trucks,"
good,Costco depot is a decent place to work especially if you are just out of school.
good,The workers would unload the shipment and print out tags and I would have to wrap and tag all the product in a timely manner. This Costco depot was the food side and was very cold and I learned the faster you do stuff the faster everything gets done. I eventually learned how to drive a pallet jack and deliver the product I had just finished tagging to the shipping side. To me this job was no ordinary job. It was stressful and hard but at the same time I enjoyed parts of it.
good,nice place to work and meet new people and it works with your school schedule
good,Costco offers higher than average wages and good benefits.
good,"Albany, Or wharehouse was a good location to work at. The employees worked well together. S. Memphis had alot of politics with people not working as a team, and most working only for themselves."
good,Costco Wholsale was great excersise. You had to move very fast without looking like your hurrying. It was great working with so many people. You met so many people in a run of a day and you got to know the regulars very well. However it had shift work and you had to work all weekends and alot of nights. If you booked a day off for something special there was no guarentee that you would get that day off because weekends were when it was most busy.
good,"As long as you love your work, there is no hardest part on the job. And for me I enjoy and embrace it. Because every job I have been to and think that this job of mine feeds my family and this is for my better future too. Busy and fast-paced environment. I learned preparing foods, from raw to cooked and salads as well. I learned and enhances my ability to communicate with the members though i already had a background back in London ,UK to deal with the patients and agents in the hospital setting. I enjoy working if everybody goes in the same direction. Meaning everybody is helping each other to make things out and there is always equal opportunity and division of labor. On the management side, their good for they do possible actions right away when problems arises specially on bullying."
good,Start the morning off cleaning and clearing the shelves off for new product or putting product in its proper place. I learned how to time manage my own section. Worked with enjoyable people who always had a great out look on everything during work periods.
good,alot of culture space and time new products very friendly atmosphere
good,It is a good place for a young person who is not going to college to have a career.
good,Lambiance et les horraire de travail mon fait quitter cette emploi... Impossible davoir 2jours de congé qui se suivent meme en millieu de semaine et on parle ici d'un poste a temps partiel etudiant 25h/sem. Lavancement profesionel est bon mais cest aussi un désavantage car la pluspart des superviaeur son incompétent mais on assez d'ancienneté
good,It’s an ok job. You got to work standing up all the time and it’s a very fast working environment. After a while working there you will get used to it.
good,Solid job for retail/wholesale.  Great bonuses.  Overall it was a good place to work.  Worked in many departments and made many friendships.  You are just a number at the end of the day in a huge corporation.  Everyone is replaceable.
good,"Costco was a good place to work, but the management would not hear you out regarding issues between employees, or disputes between employees and management."
good,Some great managers and some that should have proper management training. Communication is lacking. Rigid structure to inefficient company policies and procedures.
good,Fast paced and some heavy lifting. Overall my seasonal position was pleasant. Would work for Costco again if given the opportunity. Not much room for advancement. Very slow in the new year.
good,"The good things about working at costco wholesale, the full-time hours and benefits. Many positions and opportunities. The bad, it's very draining shifts. Although I'm very energized and it worked for me, it was mentally and physically draining."
good,"It was a great job, I just couldn’t be in the freezer, i didn’t mind lifting 60 to 80 lbs but they would sometimes put us in the below temperatures freezer"
good,It is a fast paced work place. At the store I was at most people are nice and friendly and give it a family vibe. However certain managers will take out their frustrations on you so you will have to develop a thick skin and bite your tongue sometimes.
good,"MOVE WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY!! The benefits, pay, and hours are good! I got 40hrs per week and $15 per hour. You get time and a half on Sunday's too. The only downfall is management. One manager in specific who made me hate showing up to work. She specifically targeted me and constantly put me down. Always had something negative to say about me to the point I went home crying a lot because of her. If I wasn't moving fast enough, she would say ""my 90 year old grandma can move faster."" Instead of giving constructive criticism, she would belittle me and be very unprofessional. Half the time she wouldn't acknowledge my existence. I left work early one day because I was throwing up and almost fainted, so what did she do? Yell at me in front of people. This company and certain managers will drain you mentally, so be careful."
good,Its less about what you know and how you work and more about who can stroke managements ego more. I feel favoritism is a huge problem at my warehouse.
good,"It's retail, and the company has changed considerably within the past 10+ years, since the founder retired. It's still a strong company. Costco has great workplace culture and most employees are helpful and dedicated. Warehouse level management leaves something to be desired, but it has been mostly a positive experience."
good,"Management would belittle, curse, and yell at employees because that is how they were taught to manage.  Employee reviews and advancement was a popularity contest."
good,Overall great company to work with for with amazing benefits.  With the right mindset you can find advancement.  Hard to get full time employee status for the first year.
good,People are friendly but sometime they forget that we do have life and all they will do is kept ask us if we want more hour even we say no and they kept ask again and again but people are great :)
good,.My spouse was moving their job to Atlanta. Once I was firm on leaving all the support i was getting that the location disappeared. I don't know what happened.
good,"The main office management was not great. But, it was a fun place to work an d the benefits were awesome!! As long as you don't have a life the work hours are great. If you are a student they will give you time to go to school but not for studying and succeeding."
good,Costco is a great company however it is extremely difficult to move up or even obtain full time employement without having to put in several years of service.
good,I enjoy working with other employees. There exists a good employee team spirit. Other employees are willing to help and employees are very willing to accept knowledge and ideas from my skill sets. Management treat you fairly and they are willing to accept ideas to help enhance sales and customer satisfaction.
good,"Its a good job, good pay, and decent benefits but there is no good reward system for good workers who work smart and hard. But bad workers will do less because they know you have to help them after you finish your job so it’s kinda like the bad workers get rewarded. And Food court employees are almost like 2nd class. rules that only food court has to abide by but not the warehouse."
good,"good place to work"
good,"Should you enjoy retail and all it entails then costco is definitely a great place to work; benefits are phenomenal, however management is not always that great as they lack the skills to communicate effectively s well as they lack teamwork."
good,Je trouve se travaille intéressant il a toujours du travaille
good,I loved the members and experience. The company reset my hours twice that cost me advancing to the next steps of pay and pushed back my top scale. That was a slap in the face.
good,"No matter how hard you work, promotion is earned after time not effort. In the pharmacy, new hires carry the heaviest burden when it comes to answering the phone, intake and pickup with little to no training."
good,"While at Costco, there was a feel to get the job done and look for more things to keep the operation moving.  However, when they took breaks, they liked to involve everyone and ensure that everyone participated or enjoyed the rewards.  From give aways to get togethers to parties, everyone was involved."
good,"Great communication skills and a lot of patience is needed for this job. Sometimes it’s difficult to juggle dealing with more than 200 people passing by, usually with their children. It does allow individuals to meet interesting folks. It’s a job with its ups and downs, really just depending on how you look at the experience."
good,"Management was difficult, did not support employees, I learned I was able to create a positive work environment despite management.  Many Costco workers do not speak up d/t concerns and reactions from management."
good,"Very clean environment! Friendly co workers, and food benefits! Management was ok!  Demonstrating department was a separate entity, warehouse demo services, which had their own management! I liked working here!"
good,"There is no room to move up the career path, this is just a job. If you do not fit into the ""in"" crowd you will be overlooked for promotion, Leeds Costco has a rule of no family members can be employed, yet there is an entire family from aunties, unlces, grandmas etc all working in the same Costco."
good,Currently employed since 9/18/99. Good pay and benefits. If your not part of the clique you will never get promoted. You can work harder and better than most of your fellow employees but if you’re not a yes man your doomed. The only consistency is the inconsistency of management. Guidelines and policy only applies when it goes along with managements personal agendas. Unfortunately you can’t trust anyone because they are all looking to stab you in the back to cover for their own inabilities.
good,"the team was always willing to go the extra mile. safety was key, and communication was always important for us, so we know scheduling and who was doing what."
good,"My number one issue with working for Costco are the hours that you must work to work in retail. Never having weekends off means basically never having a ""normal"" social life, especially if you're a closer. "
good,Peux attendre 3h parfois 4h avant d'avoir une pause.
good,"Costco has more part-time employees, than full-time employees. It is very difficult to get a full time position, however as part time employee, you receive full benefit package, including but not limited to 401k, medical and stock options."
good,Good place to get promoted from within. Costco was my first job out of high school and they treated me very well. Easy to work as a college student with their College Retention Program.
good,"Good benefits, 401k program that company matches. Costco has a PPO health care program with dental. Flexible scheduling with ability to move up the company ladder within."
good,"its an ok company to work for I was just stuck with a hypocritical manager, its a fast paced environment and it's easy to move up, downside thing is that most supervisors I've dealt with will talk smack behind your back and act fake towards youth next day. but that my personal experience."
good,"As I stated in the title, the managers we terrible and I eventually dreaded coming into work every day. The shifts were very difficult, both mentally and physically demanding. You cannot be more than 3 minutes late, or it counts as a tardy; if you get 2 or 3 tardies during your probationary period (3 months) they will not keep you on. The pay is excellent, however."
good,I liked the hours of Costco for me. I worked the 6 am to store open shift. I tried my best to remember the stock and inventory items as to where to position them daily for the fork lift operators in the general sales floor. I had just completed my 6 months of probation and had a hard pass with my supervisor and within a week I was pulled into the store managers office and told I just wasn't getting it about placement and the ins and out of stock receiving. Needless to say within a week of this incident I was given a full time opportunity to a job I loved and took the opportunity.
good,Excellent place to work if all you care about is making money. You will make money and get great overtime but in return you will have to lose your self respect and dignity.
good,"The Company was great, the management not so much. Every manager played favorites, no one liked to go above and beyond their job title, and the management wanted your whole life to be dedicated to Costco."
good,"Ive been to 3 Costco warehouse, this one is a mess, the schedule is never correct., management is always worried and confused, lack if communication, no meetings with employees, we’re never on the same page due to lack of communication."
good,"overall, if your management is good, you will have no problem working here. If not, working here can be pretty depressing and frustrating. free membership is cool though"
good,"If you love doing the same thing over and over with the same people who call you their friend one day but forget about you the next, then this is the job for you. It a typical retail experience with its up days and dry days. All you can do is smile and be positive, but eventually, you deserve more than just some job at Costco."
good,"A busy work environment. Late nights early mornings shifts.I have b been here for three years now and have become a well rounded employee. I have learned tire center, supervisor, cashier,morining and night merch"
good,"Job could have been great. Had management creating problems just to see how supervisors would handle it. Overall company culture is great, I just happened to work at a very poorly managed warehouse."
good,"Management isn’t the greatest. "
good,I always took responsibility if I did anything wrong. Some Managers (not all) couldn't accept responsibility for their actions and just looked to put the blame elsewhere.
good,Costco Wholesale is a fast-paced work environment. The best part to working there is is the coworkers and the members. The worst part is the physical toll on your body and the corporate aspect. Management will screw you over if you are not careful. I highly advise a comfortable pair of work boots and a well-fitting pair of work gloves.
good,"I boxed groceries, helped customers put groceries in car, collected carts, helped cashiers count money. Very organzied but not attentive since they locked me in there after closing time. I had to call the head manager's kids to call their dad to call a manager to come back and open the door."
good,"Overall, my experience working at Costco was decent. Generally speaking, the work was difficult at first to complete in the given time, but got better with time. Job security is great, hours are very consistent (31 hours every single week for me as a part-timer). The management at my location was easily the worst part of the job. Most of the managers had very little clue as to what they were doing, rarely ever praised employees for excellent work but were quick to talk down whenever the job wasnt done properly/on time. In conclusion, definitely a good job if you need something very consistent (i wouldnt recommend the Central Mississauga location, however)."
good,"I worked extremely hard and had a great review but at the end of the day they let go over 290 people on the seasonal job.  I didn't want to leave and I don't get it when I was actually told to slow down because i was making the regular employees look bad which means I was going above and beyond to prove myself and yet I was let go. "
good,"Upper Management and Supervisors make work more difficult than it has to be, however, overall great company with great intentions I believe .  Employees love Costco and it should all be teamwork not managers eating on the Frontend nor assisting when packed house. Managers often talking and eating on the clock and in the office in huddles but employees that work hard are struggling to keep up business flow especially on a Saturday or Sunday!"
good,"No benefits for the first 90 days, sick time can be accrued, 2hrs every 2 weeks with no vacation or personal days until a year of employment. If you or a loved one gets sick within the first 90 days it will be counted against you in the form of a write up or possible termination. "
good,"Costco has the best pay and benefits you will ever find as a pharmacy technician. The schedule isn't bad and the pharmacy itself isn't terribly busy. Management is completely awful, and is the reason for the poor rating. The Pharmacy Manager not in charge of the Pharmacy the front house manager is. This completely throws off flow of the pharmacy to have a Manager dictate certain aspects of Pharmacy functions especially since they have no experience in a pharmacy setting. Other than terrible management, the job itself isn't too terrible."
good,"overall Costco is a great company to work for, however there is room for improvement on many levels. I've learned at lot working at Costco. management could be improve in the areas of communication."
good,"-A typical day was spent learning how retail worked as well as helping members by packaging their purchases. "
good,Would work at costco again but on a long term basis. good pay and the staff was helpful for me at the time it was just the location that became difficult but didn't stop me walking 7-8 miles to get to Costco for my temporary job.
good,"Typical day of work is really busy every day. If you're not doing anything, Supervisor or mangers will find something for you to do. You can learn many things at Costco. The hardest part about Costco are the costumers."
good,"provides a great income to provide for family, great benefit packages and incentive  for advancement within. Holiday benefits and vacation excels yearly."
good,"Honestly great job for retail, however there is room for improvement. Not a fan of dealing with retail hours and dealing with members.."
good,Stocking the fridge is extremely hard and the managers can have unreasonable expectations at times. I was covering 3 departments when cooler is one of the most labor intensive.
good,"The day starts:"
good,"Overall culture was not pleasant. Although I learned a lot about people skills, patience, efficiency, organization, book keeping, and much more! Great for temporary work."
good,"Great pay, great benefits. A lot of opportunities. A lot of physical work. Must have open availability or flexibility when you are first hired. They will schedule you all kinds of different shifts. Seniorities usually get the better shifts and higher chance in moving up within company but don't let that discourage you because sometimes you just may be picked over seniority."
good,"can advance quickly if you work hard enough, but it is usually first come first serve with a lot of stuff, and seniority in others. being a packer is a nightmare."
good,"Working for Costco is like going back in time 20 years. They are starting to modernize but its difficult as there isn't much knowledge at the top. To many management folks were moved up from managing warehouse's to managing IT groups. "
good,"Costco was a great company but was very fast paced. You really have to know how to stack the groceries in a good way or the customer walks out with a million things hanging out of the cart and the staff/cashier get really mad. Management was alright, could be nicer."
good,"Good Job, but hard to match Life balance. It depends on people's life goals"
good,Costco is a fast-pace hectic environment. Quality is important and it takes an out going personality to work there. There is a sense of team spirit. Costco benefits are excellent as well as the products provided to it's members. The most enjoyable part of working at Costco is the positive interact ions with the members.
good,"they prefer to have bad people and bad workers there. "
good,"It's a great place if you want to be a merchant, in operations, or like the retail industry. In those aspects they stack up to the best. In other areas if there is an opportunity for promotion, it usually is due to turnover. Tired of hearing how things ""used to be"". There is an unfortunate punch-in punch-out culture where many just wait to be done working for the day."
good,great company to work for but management has poor lack of communication with their employees. fun place to meet close friends. hardest task is being in carts for more than 5 hours without rotating.
good,"Many coworkers gave poor instructions, some would slack off and push their work on me. Pay was good at the time, although the job was relatively labour intensive, and the environment was hot due to the ovens."
good,"Very faced paced, learned a lot about stocking, tempura of foods&what there suppose to be. you get to meet all kinds of people,from every cultue. day goes by quick"
good,Had the opportunity to rotate through the different departments and I learned a lot.  Very efficient processes and sound business practices. Decent pay and good benefits.
good,Completely average retail place to work. Work every holiday and weekend. You become an indentured servant to the company due to a pay that is just high enough you can't leave.
good,"I am older and foresaw bad things happening to my body.  As  I have other projects in the pipeline, it was best that I moved along.  I do wish them the best."
good,"Travail rude mais agréable malgré le personnel, et une équipe de travail décevante"
good,"now im so frustrated with having to do this and its such an irritation towards indeed"
good,Costco is a great place to work if you are still in school but is more difficult when you have a family. Its all about the company and everything else comes second.
good,"Easy to work for but management was more a popularity contest. Good pay, decent hours and good bond between staff. Would recommend others to not hesitate applying for others."
good,"Great Company for hard workers, They do not here from outside. Talent pool gets a little thin making it harder on senior managers. pay is good and benefits are better."
good,"Great job wrong managers. Too many family members in charge allows for favoritism. Lots of politics.  They promote based on attendance, not on qualifications."
good,Working at Costco was great I learned how this side of customer service operates the management appeared to care for your well being and listened to suggestions great place to work.
good,"Great place to work, great team and friendly environment. Daily rolls would start the day consits of  with a talk from a manager to out lay the days work load. my rolls include the use of various machines to move stock to correct locations using Rf scanning to print tags and also check correct stock has been received.Things learnt are different uses for fork lifts the use of an rf gun. and an a ability to work in a fast paced environment."
good,"Overall, a good company to work for.  Everyone starts part time with low wages but raises are guaranteed with hours and the benefits are good too.  Can pick up extra hours easily.  Very organized.  Expect to work hard."
good,Warehouses can be fun and productive if the right management is in place. Though it can become stressful and unproductive with terrible managers. Have seen a warehouse go from good to bad when general managers are moved/switched.
good,"While they have great benefits and starting pay, as well as friendly relations, there is little upwards movement and you will not be hired full-time unless you are a specialist or management. You are not compensated for extra work done. You will be asked to take on extra responsibilities, depending on your department, and expected to fill them. The Food Court in particular was often high stress and on it's worst days, hostile. Very hard, physical work. Be wary of injuring yourself."
good,"Good place to work however career advancements are determined by your ability to socialise with management during and out of work hours. There is never a typical day at work as I constantly work with different types of people from calm to irate. I have learned many skill sets i.e negotiation skills, marketing, communicating, incident management. It is a very relaxed environment for the most times. Hardest part of my job is my having to sell people something that is not a tangible and nor a service that they can see taking place. most enjoyable part of my job is getting to visit many restricted sites that are open to very few I.E. Harrods private airport and their private jets."
good,"It's a good place to work, good job security, pay and benefits are also good. Like with any retail, you will get 40 hours only during holidays. Any chances to move up are based on your seniority, merits and qualifications are not the main criteria. Lifting heavy products is expected. Warehouse environment."
good,"Given ours do not support a balanced life style, however a lot are given. Hourly salary was fair. A typical day was busy but not stressful. I have become stringer at working under a high-pressure situation. Management is really fair, as they consider your outside life schedule for schedule building. Hardest part of the job would be the heavy lifting required for loading assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet and interact with new people, such as customers and employees."
good,My bakery manager was awesome as well as the supervisor and experienced employees there. Bakery was a blast only for that reason. Front End was detestable due to the unpleasant attitude that cashiers have and the somewhat disorganized representation that board runners give. Very few supervisors in Front End were respectful and kind or even easy to get along with. Working carts for a long time or too many days was a very troubling experience because that position is physically stressful. Rotation for carts and cahsier assistants should be implemented. Over all an Ok experience but supervisors and organization need to be worked on.
good,Not recommended for those with professional experience.  Everything is based on seniority.  It is an ok place to work if you have another source of income.
good,"Always a busy day, Learned till. Getting carts/buggies are hard."
good,Good work enviornment. Coworkers become family after working there for so long. Management can be understanding yet forget where they came from sometimes.
good,"Yes Costco has a good starting wage. The money is what keeps people here. The management had all been with the company 10+ years and were making good salaries - but this did not produce happy people. The culture was aggressive, pessimistic, and overly demanding. Because all the management worked together so long, and had all their friends hired in - it was very much like high school with the in crowd and the not in ""clique""."
good,It was a very fast paced environment but It made me learn to multitask and do many things at once. It helped me as a person to be patient. The customer is always right.
good,Good place to work if you are in school or have another job. Difficult to get full time hours. pay is decent. Busy rush. Friendly upper-management. Free membership.
good,"There was nice breaks but it was very crazy inside all the time the customers are very demanding and expect more then they should. The management was half good half bad, but when it was bad it was terrible they didn't listen to what you had to say and forced you to do jobs you didn't sign up for. When it was good they helped you and listen to your ideas"
good,"Its a fast paced workplace, with good benefits and a decent atmosphere. Good company to advance in, lots of opportunity and different positions to experience."
good,"excelente ambiente de trabajo y una empresa muy buena para empezar a agarrar experiencia, los sueldos no son muy competitivos aunque para trabajar de medio tiempo es muy bueno."
good,"I like to work im costco amd it also give me much gcilities butmy schedule don’t match with the job. So, I am looking for a new job. I am very happy and also give my best if you give me an opportunity."
good,es un empleo que te exige tener un buen trato con las personas escuchar para poder atender siempre de la mejor manera
good,It was a great job when it came to benefits and a retirement savings plan. but I did not like how as a tire tech I needed to do a bunch of other departments jobs as well. I did not realize this applying for the job
good,"Let's just say it's not my cup of tea. I worked seasonal part/time during the holidays and usually work at an office job, so maybe I just wasn't used to it, but they work you so hard with little to no appreciation by most superiors, at least for a seasonal employee. I can't speak for permanent employees. If you are used to retail floor work, it would be a great job with great benefits."
good,"Le salaire et les avantages sociaux sont excellents dans cette entreprise et il y a beaucoup de défis et de possibilité d'avancement."
good,"I liked the fact that the schedule was fixed. I was able to plan my personal life knowing my schedule was always the same. "
good,"- While store hours are open, it can be quite boring with repetitive cleaning tasks. After closing hours stocking picks up and is done all at once since not much can be done during open hours. "
good,"Working for Costco has been an experience to say the least. I believe that I was paid fairly for a front end retail job. Many of the people that I worked with were people who were there for around, or over, 20 years. I understand why as they offer great benefits, the opportunity to work up, and competitive pay. However as a part time worker, I was subject to constant schedule changes and inept management for most of my employment."
good,Typical work day would greeting the members as the appear to the registrar and providing excellent customer service. Assist them with what ever they need and insuring that they are satisfied. Keeping my work are clean. And be consistent with member service.I enjoy working with different people from all over.Maintain my cash draw.
good,The CEO has the right idea. The workers are awesome but the old Manager had a very sterile and unapproach. The store is a great store with the new management.
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers, lots of different types of people.  Enjoyed being social and outgoing.  Liked to explore what the store had to offer that I may want to buy. "
good,"good environment, very fast paced and good employees, however much training and constant training of employees can be challenging."
good,"The pay scale and the benefits at Costco are great.  The managers and supervisors however make it a tense work environment and demand a lot of their employees, sometimes fair sometimes not."
good,"The work load can be a lot because the managers will have you doing just about everything in the warehouse. You will most likely not be limited to just one department. The pay is great and so are the benefits. However, there is a serious management problem which will cause a stressful day and possible conflict. There is also a high turn over for employees, which is not good."
good,Costco has given me a chance to learn several different departments within the store. They will happily let you train in a new department if you are interested. The benefits and compensation are great!
good,"Costco is a good place to work for people who want a decent salary, but can also put up with the customers that come in, and the unhealthy competition standards that come with co-workers."
good,Learned to be better with customer service. Enjoyed the people I worked around and learned how warehouse/ retail jobs work. Hardest part was the early/ late hours.
good,"Nice ambience, good team, work and duties variants. Different pattern shifts sometimes useful. Long days at work but always different and interesting. Learning the customers and the environment of a retail house."
good,The workplace culture was really nice everyone had each other back and if we had questions there was always someone there to help you .i learned a lot about time management and how to use all of your resources to be the best employee you can be.
good,Even though I started off in cart crew in the middle of summer it was still an great job. I quickly learned the ropes of how the warehouse worked and was able to move up within the company. Supervisors and Mangers very approachable when ever there was any misunderstanding. Really enjoyed working with customers.
good,"it had a lot of good things going for it but like most places, management is a little beast of certain things and very hard on their people but for the most part, its an okay job. You deal  with more than 300 people every half hour and the place is a bit hectic."
good,The job overall was a learning curve. Learning how to deal with customers who are not always nice and with shifts that varied from day to day. I have to say it was never a dull moment but it definitely opened my eyes to the fact that no job is perfect.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo deben contratar gente que en verdad le eche ganas para trabajar
good,Great if you're looking for a summer job or if you're out of school. Management did't show enough employee appreciation at this location.
good,"Learned cashier skills, losts of customer service, enjoyable to work at. Usually a busy place. Upbeat environment with great employees"
good,"considero que es una buena empresa para trabajar, aprendes mucho, solo que son diez horas laborales diarias."
good,Costco Wholesale offers a very disciplined retail workplace.  The goal each day is to please members (customers) while being as productive as possible
good,"up early"
good,"A typical day at Costco would be making hamburger consistently, and making sure our services run smooth. The thing I enjoy most about this job is the communication between associates, and learning new and more productive ways to clean, these aspects are important in keeping the meat department running efficiently. I know it was nothing personal, but the management had a tendency to be hard on the staff, and their work. The hardest part of this job would likely be the weakly case cleaning.( It's hard on the back) I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my co-workers, they have taught me the ins and outs of the meat department, and they are a very friendly group individuals.."
good,Great company to work for however I decided I wanted to do more with my life so I returned to school and got a degree in engineering. Corporate cares about the employees however at the store level experiences may vary.
good,I enjoyed this job I continually exceeded sales expectations. Poor management resulted in demos being cancelled which created a lack of hours.
good,"No room for errors here, 3 strikes and you are suspended. AS400 is the company's computer system, archaic and like I mentioned, no room for errors."
good,"Clock in start at your assigned station. Teamwork on what needs to be put on display, manage timing and products. I learned how to assemble cakes. The job was fast past but not hard. Enjoyed working with others."
good,it is a fun place to work but management need to watch over there staff more ... beside that it is a good place to work... it a good place to keep in shape when working
good,"A lot is asked of managers for this company, as more aspects of the business need managed.  With razor-thin margins to meet, extra oversight is given on top of existing duties, making a typical week become 5 1/2 to 6 days and 65 hours in the non-holiday season.  The pay is good and the benefits are outstanding for the market.  The work/life balance is not what it could be."
good,Work was typically very busy. I learned many different skills including freight and inventory management. Social environment was somewhat limited due to my shift times. Co-workers were generally engaged in work and worked together. The hardest part of my job was managing the incoming shipments and organizing the inventory. I did not enjoy this job.
good,"Service Deli Clerks are responsible for preparing, slicing, wrapping, weighing, pricing, and merchandising the department’s deli products. "
good,"A typical day at work would be running the carts in from outside and cleaning them off. Tending to any tasks that need to be completed such as cleaning the front of the store, checking receipts of customers, making sure everything is in an organized and cleanly order."
good,"Working for Costco has its ups and downs, the majority of the work is straight forward and easy for anyone to get the hang of. The pay is alright, the benefits are amazing and very affordable. The management team is the biggest problem with Costco, they never listen to the hourly employees, they take credit for their employees work, throw those employees under the bus at the first sign of trouble, as well as put too much work on their plates in order for them to fail. The managements form of asking their employees to do something is by threatening them with a loss of job or taking them out of the department. As far as working for Costco the work is fine, benefits are amazing, but the management team needs a lot of work."
good,The company is great to work for because they offer many incentives such as health care for both full-time and part-time employees. The pay rate is much higher than minimum wage. However advancement can sometimes seem hard to accomplish and tenure is not always welcomed. It is likely widely variable depending on store location and job culture.
good,Fun place to work.  You work very hard. Good compensation for Retail. I did not like punching a time clock.  You can get written up if you are early or late by a couple of minutes.  Good management and training.
good,"Good place to work, pays well, excellent benefits. Very busy,sometimes chaotic with customers. Hardest part was retreiving shopping carts at -30 degrees. Don't like that Costco hires workers for seasonal then let them go, don't call them back so they don't have to pay them any benefits and therefore the staff is always changing.Therefore I feel there is no employee/customer relationship."
good,"I worked part time on the weekends, every time I would go there it was always a relaxed environment, nobody had drama, everyone would just make jokes through out the day. Very simple for the most part, although there are a few costumers that are not have the best day, but with joking co-workers it makes one more reluctant to charm the costumer to a more positive interaction."
good,"Great service, prices, quality products. busy environment poor management from the top. Low stress job. Health benefits inexpensive."
good,"Overall Costco is as advertised. However, as a college student I don't think Costco is as conducive to college students as they like to say. It seems to be disconnect between management and myself on my career goals. My efforts to advance in the company after receiving my degree weren't reciprocated. I sometimes feel they want me to stock forever."
good,Not a career I would want to have for a lifetime. Need a change and a great career as a pharmacy assistant. Long and stressful days.
good,"The job was alright, the money and hours were great. But the way that management was and the way that communication was made it almost impossible or very irritable to do basically anything within the store. "
good,"Working for Costco was very beneficial. On a day to day basis workers there all strive to provide more than customer service, they provide member service! Meaning since people pay to have a membership there, they deserve twice the amount of care."
good,"Co-workers are very nice. Always have someone there to assist you if needed. Great supervisors and great wages. The most enjoyable part of the job is the time goes by quick when you're working hard. I've learned how to stock produce and load items in boxes fast, for customers satisfactions."
good,"I loved this job till my location changed mangers. Also hurt myself on the job and management starting pick on me after, wasn't a fun place after that."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Costco. I think with such an expansive team you get managers and supervisors you genuinely like and some you don't. "
good,"When I worked at Costco it was fun and good energy , Even though I had morning shift. My day started by getting a cart and a jack and going to my area (Dry foods) and go through the isles and make sure there were no garbage left from the night before and straighten any food products that were not presented nicely.  "
good,"Fast pace, physical."
good,"I started of as a fuel dock attendant, then became a fishing guide in the peek season. Then became a second key holder, with involved filling of contracts, end of day deposits, all the locking and securing of the building at the end of day."
good,"Greet co-workers and members, I try to create a friendly relationship with everyone, and co-workers come from all different backgrounds of ages 18 and older."
good,"A typical day at work would be we would usually have a meeting with all scheduled employees  about any major changes occurring during that day. I would access the needs in my given area and create an action plan with stockers. I would discuss any changes and action plans. "
good,"The place have a lot of different culture people come in to the store"
good,"The hardest part of the job is the members (customers). The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with. A typical day would involve helping members, stocking, and cleaning up. It is a good job all in all, with great coworkers and good benefits."
good,i did my job well had really good reviews and enjoyed my co-workers
good,"Set up to clean up other people's mistakes.I learned if you work as a team more can get .Management can learn much from the real worker's they only need to ask ? I would liked to have stayed longer, had to relocate that terminated my relationship with this company.Being around good people of all races."
good,most of the employees and superiors are great to work with but some of the mangers are lacking common sense in providing a positive customer experience and more of following strict rules that the Costco wear house outlined. Hours that you ask for are never given they will example you ask for mornings hours they give you that for 3 days then put you back into a graveyard shift and your schedule is all over the place sometimes you have different working hours and days off
good,"Es una empresa con excelentes prestaciones, oportunidad de crecimiento, gente mu amable y educada."
good,"their trainging is good, starting wage is higher then most places and even on part time im getting a lot of hours.they promote from within mostly so getting higher up in the company is easy. they do not give out enough vacation time though and most of the management at the one i work at does not care about whats going on in your personal life. i actually had an incident at work where i was unable to work for a while aand got written up while dealing with it. the manager was very insensitive and rude to me."
good,"A Lot Of work on a day to day I am running the Business in all areas of a Business. As a Retail Manager you are not just over One area you will and always are over the whole business itself, many hates you wear and long hours which come with late nights. But its retail and that is what it is."
good,"During my first few weeks at Costco, my co workers were very helpful in answering all of my questions and brought me along the Costco team with open arms. I learned how to look up item inventory in the computer system, how to input new or existing membership information, and how to apply for the American Express Costco had to offer its members. Sometimes the challenging part of my position was to multitask, dealing with members one-on-one while also answering the telephones. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to answer any and all questions the members would come up with, the satisfaction of knowing I made that person's mission a little more easy makes me feel accomplished."
good,wish i could have stayed there.  would have enjoyed becoming a manager there
good,"Benefits at the company were great and they pride themselves on working around school schedules for students. Have to work holidays and weekends, but that's just the nature of retail. Management is terrible, but fellow employees are great. Company monitors payroll closely so overtime is not allowed."
good,you would never get enough hours. you could bust your butt and not get any recognition
good,"Dont agree with some of the policies and they tend to condone lacking management. I had to work with some of the worst management in the food court. I had a Manager that was very unconfrontational when it came to solving issues and tried too hard to be everones friend instead of the boss. He also wouldnt follow seniority with scheduling, which cause a lot of conflict. Also, delt with a supervisor who made serveral women staff cry with his approach to conflict. He would enter the kitchen daily with an attitude and wouldnt even talk to the staff till he decided he wasnt in a mood anymore. His attitude was very counter productive. Upper mamangement was informed of this behavior constantly, and to the day i decided to leave the company, he was still being called a supservisor in the food court. Benefits were awsome. Learned i was very versatile, as i was thrown into pretty much everything and adapted quickly. My main problem was that I was culinary trained in pastry and expressed the interests in working in the bakery, and for three years only was only able to pick up shifts around the holidays. Finally I had to muscle my way into the deli so i could at least work with some kind of real food prep.Sometimes it was about who you knew (aunt, uncle. family friend) to advance with that kind of stuff."
good,Great job if you can get it. Not going to happen. They only really consider persons who have previous warehouse experience and get a quality recommendation from their higher ups. Once there you will most  likely never get promoted. Buyers die they don't quit or move up very often. Occasionally with growth a new position will open up but this is very limited in scope. Most people are friendly and there are a few perks associated with it. Great Mon-Fri gig if you finally get there. Lots of competition for the few that open up.
good,working in the afternoon we would start with a merch meeting and start work right after 
good,"A very long day of doing the same thing."
good,"Provide excellent customer services, help and all I can, be a part of a team work, be a part of increase results"
good,"Costco is a fast paced work environment with high expectations for all of its employees. The flexible hours and health benefits for part time employees made it a great place for a full time student to work part time. The fast pace of work helped develop a great work ethic along with time management skills. The hardest part of the job was the division of work and communication between employees and management. At times, customer service would suffer based on the lack of communication. The best part of this job was the flexible hours and fairly young staff. Having a majority of the staff working students made it easy for everyone to get along because of the similar age groups."
good,Work duties challenging but fun to find new ways to defeat the challenges.
good,"Good overall experience learning team work from the ""buddy system""(being placed with a different staff member each day). It was a very safe work environment, plenty of safety training, and safety conscious management. The hardest part of the job was the waiting time between training to move forward with more job responsibilities."
good,A great place to move up and make a great salary but at times the days can be extremely long and can take a toll on you mentally and physically.
good,"Good Pay, Management doesn't Communicate well. Was seasonal, Costco.com. Appears they don't take Good Customer service over stats."
good,It's a good place for summer jobs or steady work if you live in the city. Be careful that you actually get a schedule to get regular hours and pay. Costco members can be entitled but you learn a lot while there. Management is fine (depending on the department you are in).
good,Great work experience with good  benefits would definitely recommend to people searching for employment better chance if you turn in a resume in person
good,hardest part is some interactions with members or fellow employees.Constantly on your feet and things are a bit different but a lot of the same everyday. You get paid well and treated fairly but in the end it is still a retail job
good,"My typical day at work consists of me saying good morning to everyone I walk by and greet with a smile because I love the morning. My supervisor tells me where I need to be. Management tends to stay in the office most days and the hardest part of the job is definitely dealing with unhappy members, but the wonderful thing about that is when you can change somebody's perspective and experience by simply being myself and changing their day and opinion of Manassas Costco. The most gratifying experience is when members specifically come through my line because they enjoy my company and my service to them. I learn something everyday working this job because I deal with all different spectrums of human behavior and I feel like it prepares me to handle uncomfortable situations or soothe a hard moment of time."
good,"great place to work for , must be a hard worker , I was only a seasonal employee but enjoyed being on the front end also worked in the deli VERY hard work ."
good,"I got cheated  twice from getting fulltime position that's why im no longer there, but good company to work with...……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….unfair managers"
good,"High workload and high stress, you succeed or you fail with little assistance from management. Pay and benefits are good. Your manager and coworkers will make or break the job."
good,Lots of crowds and chaos. In management the hours are very inconsistent and do not expect to get weekends or consecutive days off. But the pay is good.
good,"Trabajo estable y monotono"
good,"A normal working day at Costco consisted of clocking in, running up to your designated work area or to supervisor (if appropriate) to find out your assigned tasks. Very busy work days and nights running around the warehouse cleaning, running go backs, retrieving items customers forgot at checkout and ending the day fixing up the clothing tables."
good,"When you work there, you sign a contract to never speak poorly about your experience at Costco in any way, shape or form that may form a negative view on costco, therefore I can not share my experience."
good,"While most of my work was quite arduous at Costco, I at least managed to learn new things and get new ways of productivity out of it. I do hope I can available to come back again, and give it my all once more."
good,"While Costco is indeed one of the best retail jobs out there, in terms of earning potential, benefits, and advancement opportunity, day-to-day work is often harrowing if management is not focused on providing sufficient manpower. Each warehouse is constantly busy, from the AM stocking shifts to PM closing crew, in every department. When there are enough people, the warehouse functions like a well-oiled machine. If management drags their feet hiring, however, productivity drops, employee morale and well-being drops, and consequently members are not always given the service that Costco builds its reputation on."
good,This job is very time consuming even for a part time worker. Ive learned that working here you would have to be committed to this job. They expect so much in so little time with not very many employees.
good,"a typical shift you would clock in, be assigned your isle to stock and you would have to complete them in an amount of time. managers would usually ask very often to help other co workers complete there task."
good,"I have been at this job now for almost 2 years and have learned a lot, good and bad about this company. I absolutely love my coworkers and working with them, it's probably one of the only reasons why I can stand coming into work everyday. Upper management is great and some of our supervisors are great too, but when it comes to trying to get days off and more hours if you are part time, it is literally like pulling teeth. "
good,"Retail environment, good pay, excellent benefits, would strongly recommend. Be persistant when applying there is a high volume of interest. Stand out as much as possible"
good,"It was a decent place to work for. Good pay, benefits and other employees where good. The management was terrible though, didn't allow you to work with freedom. Constantly checking up and very rude."
good,"great pay, however if you are are a new employee they don't have any flexible schedules you get the late shifts, they don't have a set schedules to give you, they go based of seniority."
good,"Management was very good to everyone besides the head lead manager for the crew. It was always enjoyable going into work to see the picking family everyday. I would say the hardest part was making sure your pallets wouldn’t fall over sometimes pulling the jacks cause the order was heavy. I learned after I left that there’s certain times to talk and not, to be more of a team player and making sure I’m contributing."
good,"Work had its challenges but overall fairly easy. Some of the worst managers I have ever worked for. Atmosphere was constantly stressful  and negative due to overbearing GM and Floor Managers. Due to frustrating conditions, high turnover and a culture of pessimism. At least coworkers were miserable together."
good,"Very fast Paced"
good,"Costco is great for anyone wanting security above all else. Basically, you make a little less money than the market but you never have to worry about losing your job. Inside the company, they say its easier to get a felony than get fired."
good,Not a bad place to work if the money is needed but not what i would choose for a career. Managers are not as helpful as they should be and there is little to no training
good,"Poor management in my personal experience, lack of communication. Series of events, that cause personal and professional inconvenient, initial seasonal position of early morning crew, was perfect."
good,It's hard to get your foot in the door and then hard to move from there. I put in eleven years at one warehouse and saw managers consistently burn out. They won't accommodate schedule requests unless it's convenient for them.
good,i left because of being unfairly treated by management. they have favorites and if your not one of them then your gone. the hardest part of the job was dealing with members attitudes!!
good,"Costco is a very fast paced always busy place to work at, members flood in at a rate faster than most associates can handle at some points. Which can overwhelm some departments rather easily due to the lack of coverage with staffing and scheduling."
good,"I've worked at Costco for 2 years now as a morning merchandiser. I really needed the healthcare which is why I started. The health benefits are very good and the pay is above average for the work."
good,"People who do demonstrations in stores are not treated as employees by the corporation, but are made to appear to be Costco employees to customers leaving them often underpaid, with less hours, and no benefits."
good,"All the managers seemed to really like me. I was a cashier assistant so I was put in a lot of places. They always asked me if I wanted to be trained on something else, and I always said yes, but then they never trained me on a different position. So it really stung when I wasn't asked to stay at the end of seasonal. So I think it's a very nice job if you don't get hired during the holidays."
good,"They pay well and give good benefits. But the problem is some of the long term employees are not mentally stable. Coming to work every day and working with these people, you never know what would happen next. Sometimes managers would try to stir the pot against employees that are doing nothing wrong. There is way too much drama, in my opinion, to stay at a company like this for the rest of my life. Not a lot of career advancement unless you suck up to management. Rewards were not based on actual work done or having a good ethic. People that didn't deserve praise were given praise. Meanwhile the ones who mind their own business get treated awful. The only way out of this cycle is to get a degree and move on. Will not recommend when I leave."
good,"Standing for almost 8 hours straight and dealing with customers isn't the easiest, but some days you get to meet very interesting people with wonderful stories to tell. Restocking and setting up your own work station is a bit difficult at the start, especially if you don't know any of your co-workers and have no assistance, but you learn to deal with it and also expand your social network."
good,c'est souvent les mêmes taches. le nombre de personne qui se presente au Costco est hallucinant.
good,"Employees are awesome, a little bit of miscommunication when it comes to management and supervisors. Lost of different areas to work in so you won't really get bored."
good,"There was a lot of expectation for assistance in all areas of the workplace. You were not limited to explicitly your department. As far as management and supervisor positions go, they are a bottom-up approach in that it is reliant upon seniority. It does not matter if you walk in with a college degree and are extremely overqualified for the position you are applying for. I think in consideration of this, the company functions are a bit outdated. Specifically in the databases that employees use for training and item related searches. There is a lot of room for Costco to grow in the technology department that would improve efficiency in the work place. Despite the work being menial customer service, the culture that they offer and extend to their club members was what I appreciated the most out of working there."
good,A lack of help makes this job difficult. Not really flexible.Not ideal for a uni student or someone who wants to work less than 25 hours. Offers a competitive rate and decent benefits.
good,"retail is retail. i worked there for a year and it was the same stuff everyday, was fine until new management, great pay and benefits but only some of the jobs there are worth it."
good,"Working for costco gave  me wonderful benefits and I earned a decent living. However, they refused to work with my schedule even though I explained during my interview that I’m a single mom. They said the scheduling was based by seniority and it wouldn’t be fair to the other employees to get the schedule I needed. My coworkers were great but management could’ve been better."
good,"Honestly speaking, Costco has been a wonderful part time job, though it's stressful and tiring. Workers are treated fairly and just. The hours of working in a day are too much."
good,"Quick paced environment, I learned how to interact with others and stay positive while on my feet got long hours . I enjoyed the managers energy and attitude the most"
good,"The managers would get mad when I needed help closing the Deli but would also get mad when I would run late closing the Deli. There was a lot to do and I wanted to do it right which resulted in me being ""too slow"" in their eyes. I wish I would have stayed in Membership, I would probably still be there if I hadn't switched departments."
good,"Typical day of work come in and receive all trucks planned out for the day, management will be looking over your work but, if you miss spell something on what is called a PMR even if its just a difference of a r and R you have to redo it."
good,"As my job consisted of only 2-3months, it was a fast-paced, but enjoyable experience. Working with multiple customers as well as employees as a dual experience. You tend to expand your horizons in understanding others cultures and communicating much better."
good,"worked at costco wholesale as a seasonal employee. experienced were fine, very busy place and it's a fast-paced environment. Management were fine and treated employees fair"
good,it was an okay job. Management wasn't that friendly to new comers. but for the pay i guess it was a decent job. other workers were cool but a lot of stuck up people.
good,"The overall ambiance of working at Costco is fun and face paced, however, it is competitive so it's important to stay on top of your work. Also, it takes time to really gain benefits of scheduling unless you've been there for years. A lot of things are based off seniority."
good,"Costco is a basically a job where if you didn't really want to do anything else and just have a job with decent pay, tons of benefits, paid vacation/sick time and 401k, this job is for you. Career advancement can be done if you are looking for that, but usually not that often. it is also a great beginner job."
good,I really liked to work at Costco. The only problems were the organisation of the schedual and the salary. iIve learned the optical world and a awsome team to work whit!
good,"J'ai aimé travailler chez Costco parce que c'est un endroit ou il y a toujours du service a faire. Tu ne peux pas passer quelque minutes sans rien faire et c'est vraiment ce que j'aimais ne jamais regarder le temps."
good,"My work experience at Costco was good. There is always something to do, never boring, and the managers make sure of it. It is very physical and it is important to use proper body mechanics when lifting and moving things."
good,"Costco is one of the best companies to work for, but your experience is going to vary depending on your warehouse.  My warehouse regularly did not comply with company policy and put employees at risk with insufficient training.  Depending on the position, you would be expected to finish the work for your position and performed the duties and tasks not assigned to your role.  This was done at my warehouse to limit overhead cost so the manager could receive a larger year-end bonus.  Managers were indifferent, often left work on the shift for coffee and food.  My experience is not like most, but you should be prepared for anything when going to work in the warehouses."
good,"The work itself isn't good for your health. It becomes stressful and one might start to experience anxiety. I've spoken to coworkers who only stay cause they have bills to pay but if that wasn't the case they would've been long gone. Some choose not to work full time either as Costco becomes your life and you don't have a social life, too tired to do anything after work. Its only good for the benefits and pay, but it's not worth your mental and physical health. You work to live, not live to work."
good,"A good place to work, very fast paced. The very early morning hours are tough, still trying to adjust. Not getting the hours I would like , but taking what I can get. Pharmacy manager is great and co-workers are very nice."
good,"Early mornings and long hours. "
good,What I have realized is that Costco expects you to work really hard. They are EOE so anyone can do any job. Transitioning from part time to full time is competitive. I can say there is room for growth in the company. it does get depressing being there for a while.
good,"If you're able to stick it through longer than 5 years, you'll start to see the benefits of the job. The management team needs to care more for the employees and members and less about money."
good,It was a neutral experience. Can not complain about management or work environment. A typical day is was you would expect for working in customer service and the management usually tried to make the experience enjoyable
good,Worked hard and got my breaks.  Never had an issue with raises or other employees.  Atmosphere was polite and friendly.  Made it worth working day to day.
good,Almost two years that I have been working there. I always felt working there like groundhog day movie. Almost everything was the same. If you like that and don't change at all. Costco is for you. Very repetitive. Only things that changes is moving items in different locations or be deleted or out of stock. Drives the costumers crazy or even employees like me since some assistant mangers don't wont tell you at all.  Always see regular customers coming but most of them nice but few think they own you. My opinion I stood up for myself because I don't like being treated differently and had some interesting conversations. What I'm trying to say some mangers let customers run you over and I don't see that being healthy. I understand customers being right but everybody has a life that doesn't mean you treat people differently.
good,"A typical day is to get up between 5 and 6am. Walk into the truck stop and do the morning rituals. Get some coffee, walk around and inspect the truck and trailer and then check messages, do the logs; perhaps check weather and any safety conditions on the Qualcomm regarding route of travel and get rolling."
good,"Its a seniority, so if you are looking for fulltime job, it will take you years for that... but good for part timer. Its really about seniority and if you know someone in upper management"
good,I enjoyed working with the people there. Management seemed to change frequently and not always for the better. Working retail is difficult when you have a family.
good,"started the day in the break room, then went directly outside to push carts for 6-8 hours, I had 3 breaks through out the day, management sucked. the most enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,"Like any job, it can be great on any given day, or be very stressful. There is always a lot to do, and you need to be prepared to make choices on what gets done, and what gets put aside for the next day."
good,"It was a fun job that required a lot of hard work but as the day went on it got easier. In the morning you would come in early, rush around for three hours getting as much done as possible, then have a 15 minute break. around that time was when i would notice there would be less work to complete and as long as you dont have a problem carrying boxes of up to 50lbs then you should have no trouble with this job. the only cons i have to add is that the management was horrendous and they dont care about anyone who hasn't already been there for 5 years."
good,I enjoyed this job because I could set my own hours.  I also liked working in the local Costco.  My favorite was when we had a special event.  I would go in early and set-up the displayed of window blinds.
good,costco is a great place to work if you are starting out. great staff !! great experience just the pay was a little low but overall i liked it there. :)
good,"Stocking was very fast paced, often time first break would be delayed until last possible second. There was always ""more"" that could be done even if the requirements were met. There were too many employees for the supervisors on hand, honestly I think with a little more management there wouldn't have been any issues. Too much responsibility was put on one supervisor at a time and it made a mess of breaks and work efficiency. If you can manage your own time and don't mind haggling supervisors for your proper breaks/assistants when needed, then you'll do fine here. The pay is decent and there are plenty of opportunities to move forward. It is a company with great benefits and opportunity despite the management issues. I would recommend giving it a try at least."
good,"The employees have a hard time opening up to new people and treating them kindly, and the customers blame you for something being out of stock. I really enjoyed the managers, but the other employees weren't friendly."
good,"This is a great place to work if you really need medical dental and vision benefits. Once you pass the 90 day eval period, the rest is a cake walk. It's an easy place to get comfortable and end up working there for 10+years. The managers tend to be a bit power-trippy and the members can act a bit entitled. But overall I wouldn't say it's a bad place to work if you're looking for a place to punch in and punch out."
good,"I applied for a cashier position but was only grand the position of cashier assistant. At Costco, everyone does everything, except the cashiers. Then I was moved to folding clothes; checking memberships at the door; checking members receipts; returning merchandise to the correct departments."
good,it was okay i had to stay focused because  everything was so fast pace and they wouldn't allow any slacking on the job. It taught me a lot and gave me insight what kind of job I wanted
good,I liked this job and would have liked to continue after my internship was over.  I often worked before the store was open and did not really have the chance to interact with customers like I wanted to.
good,"Costco, in short, is a great place to work. The systems and priorities put in place by upper management establish an energetic and ""all together"" atmosphere filled with awesome benefits, frequent wage raises, and a regular focus on cooperation and Teamwork. These are areas that Costco excels at. To be totally fair there are certain blemishes one can expect working in any retail environment and Costco is unfortunately not immune to them. Expect a tense environment during holiday seasons, expect some grumpy coworkers from time to time, expect some questionable decisions from leadership, expect what you would normally get working with human beings. But with that said, Costco does an impressive job at resolving conflict and recognizing this human element of the modern workplace. Often management will follow up a mistake with six or seven good decisions to follow it. So for every blemish, Costco may have, you can expect the Integrity to recognize and smooth over those blemishes."
good,"Le service à la clientèle représente un élément crucial de la réussite de l'entreprise. Dans le cadre du commerce aux détails, le fait d'offrir un service à la clientèle de niveau supérieur nécessite souvent qu'il  faut découvrir ce que veulent nos membres.Toujours conserver la confiance de nos membres en leur vendant quelque chose qui correspond clairement à leurs besoins. Soutenir les meilleurs produits ainsi que le prix en tout temps. Voilà ce que j'ai pu pratiquer et évoluer pendants mes années au sein de cette entreprise."
good,"They're great and by the book when it comes to California's labor laws. Costco's path to perfection and doing whats right is almost to a ""T"". Moving up to supervisor positions from a warehouse clerk can possibly be stressfull depending on personality of that locations G.M., can significantly effect their lower management and how they treat their employess."
good,I learned alot of new things. the hardest was to clean the bakery was fun to do but it was to hard to work by your self. and the enjoyable was working be your self
good,"Not all managers are bad there but the ones that are definitely stand out. Since the old tire center manager left and they got a new one the whole shop went down hill. Send him back, please."
good,"Muy buena empresa, solo que sus puestos son muy operativos."
good,warehouse can sometimes get out of order leaving way to much work on the stockers. hard to become full time employee and take a long time to recieve raise.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Costco, the staff and managers were good. The hours were ok, but sometimes scheduling was a bit off. Hard to work 5hour shifts , 5 days a week especially with 3 young children at home ."
good,The managers play favoritism and it shows. They don't believe in teamwork all the time. Most of the time they send you to do tasks that they don't want to do.
good,"Learned how to handle almost any situation being usually only person on site and having to deal with and have duty of care over at some moments 100+ customers, how to problem solve and resolve extreme situations."
good,Great job for those without college degrees i.e. HS diploma/ GED. If you have a Bachelors or Masters seek other options in your field first unless you are desperate for work and health insurance. Outside of that good company to work for as far as opportunities to learn and grow.
good,It was very friendly place to work with good co-workers. Management was a bit hard to work with. They had a lot going on and sometimes would become to much for one person.
good,"While the culture is somewhat relaxed, their is a survival mode ongoing. You could go at any moment. Granted, I was a seasonal employee, however, I sensed stress in those who were their  awhile."
good,"Costco is not a terrible place to work but it can be better. The wages are good, very fair. The benefits however make the job worth it, with full coverage even as a part time worker."
good,"The work environment is generally good , however there are long work hours.  The benefit package was exceptional.  It does take along time to resolve issues involving other staff members. The management does try to relate with the employees but can seem to be ""out of touch"" with the hourly employees"
good,"My typical day at work was cleaning the products, making sure everything is in place and looking good and also making the changes that they asked on the floor. I learned a lot about customer service."
good,"I started my day typically at 4 or 5 AM, occasionally at 2, depending on the work load or lack of other employees. Since Costco is a warehouse, my main job was stocking and moving pallets around according to a logical order or selection. I also was the stocker for the freezer section later on. Costco is a good place to learn workplace safety, what to do and not to do around operating forklifts and other various machines."
good,"I'm really torn with CostCo, the work itself was fine, the benefits and pay scale was very generous however for me there was a noticeable labor disparity depending on rank and seniority. OF COURSE thats how it is everywhere, but before joining and even during training they really drove home their goal to make everything equal and approachable, that was not the case."
good,"Go work there you can find out the pros and cons that you think are suited for you. Mine was going well, but as a military spouse at the time with three kids, single at that time as well because wife was overseas. I had requested a certain job position and was granted it but then later put in a position that was exactly the opposite of what I had asked for. Like I said go work there and see the pros and cons for yourself."
good,This place has a good culture and good opportunities for advancement. Great pay and benefits as well. But the work is difficult and tedious. The schedule is also slightly inflexible
good,Flexible Schedule hours. Friendly people. Ability to move up in positions and training in all areas of the warehouse. very good pay and benefits. Learned more skills and acquired ore experience in the retail field.
good,"get to work very early in the Am. have a meeting with the whole team right away about what we will be doing today and what is most important things we must get done that day. i learned how to work the customer service phones and greet people with the utmost respect, i also learned how to manage a team, how to take the front lines and be productive throughout the day. the hardest part of the day was getting up early in the mornings; other than that they had great staff that taught us how to manage and take control of each situation. the most enjoyable part was working with the customers, and making them laugh and brightening their day, always was a joy to see the customers smile."
good,"A great job to have while in school or shooting for another career. Benefits are good, and you can work various positions. Pay is nice but hours do get cut a majority of the time, it depends on the store you work at. You have to work 5 days minimum at part time rather you get 40 hours or 24. The management can be very difficult depending on the experience of the person or the people skills they have. There were some great supervisors and managers but a lot of them could be very rude and condescending to employees. No one in my store was ever on the same page. One manager could come in and have your case set up a particuluar way and someone else could come in the next day and have it the complete opposite but you would get chewed out for it. Overall, if you do not mind repetitive work and retail is something you can do, you can definitely make it a career depending on the person you are. I would say the average person get's full time around the 5 year mark."
good,"it was a good job from work for Costco they did work with me when i need them at the end of the day. "
good,"Costco is a very busy store, constantly working to cater to customer's needs. Very rarely could take breaks, definitely overwhelming at times. Overall good for a summer job."
good,"Typical day would include managing sales floor, creating floor plans, interacting with members, driving sales and communicating with buying. "
good,"Overall experience of working at Costco was not bad when it came to the finances, but the amount of hours a week made it a lifestyle. With most jobs I plan to work hard but eventually evolve to something better, while the management made me feel like I was doing something wrong by thinking about moving on."
good,Je n'a pas beaucoup aimé mon poste d'été chez Costco à cause du niveau de stress et d'action très élevé. Je préférai travaillé aux postes extérieurs.
good,"Decent place to work, great benefits, with advancement opportunities. They are a very efficient company and expect their employees to work with the same work ethic."
good,"Hard work, but generally good people. Management was generally there for you when you needed there help. The early hour shift can be killer though (3/4 Am start time)"
good,"8.5 hour shifts"
good,"Costco is a great opportunity for all, particularly a great option for those with minimal education who intend to work retail till retirement because of the great benefits packages."
good,Great place to work if you want to work there long-term. They promote from within and everyone starts out at the entry level floor assistant. Requires patience and a positive attitude constantly throughout the day.
good,"The co-workers are great. It can be hard working with the members at times, because you are treated less than friendly and cannot say anything to them. Management is not held accountable for anything, and knowing the right people will go along way for you in this company. But the benefits alone are amazing."
good,Les employés sont agréables ! Les avantages sociaux et le salaire est très intéressant !
good,"I was in Costco for about two years, and in those two years I worked in every department except for meat, lot, and membership. I was moved around many times it was difficult for me to advance in any way."
good,"it's good place to be if you enjoy, your dept. being blamed for all the problems in the world. its got good pay and great benefits, but the management is pretty terrible. that's all i have to say"
good,"There was always a constant flow of people, "
good,Costco is full of great people. The pay structure is great. It's always fun at work. You constantly stay busy. The schedules can be very inconsistent.
good,"Wages are low initially, but hard work and drive will show in advancement to higher levels.  Must be ready for change with time sensitivity"
good,"Great benefits and pay"
good,Costco was a decent place to work but I felt that I was not able to move up into a supervisor/ management position due to favoritism. I am looking for a job that best matches my skill set which is driving for a living.
good,"A typical day at work would be working on what they call the FRONT END. I assist members with their flat beds or baskets and help with any questions or complaints they might have."
good,"Costco is a great place to work if you are young. If your parents or grandparents work for Costco, then you are pretty much guaranteed a promotion in a very short period of time. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working the cashier, providing excellent costumer service, and assist with stocking merchandise at the end of the night. Often drove the forklift and electric double pallet jack. I learned how to operate heavy machinery, operate the cash register, and provide excellent costumer service. Management was supportive in certain situations. Coworkers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was stocking heavy items. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with costumers."
good,"A typical day is serving the Members on the sales floor. "
good,Unique company with high-end wholesale inventory. I helped run the front-end operations to make sure members checkout smoothly. I ensure members are renewed on-time and that everyone is taken care of.
good,"work keeps you busy but isnt exactly rewarding, advancement opportunities exist but take too long to achieve for the compensation."
good,"It is not in the field that I wish to be working in; as I just completed my MBA in accounting and wish to be working in an environment that utilizes my knowledge and my full potential.  My position at Costco is a cashier; it is simple which makes work very monotonous, however, the people I work with and the company's culture make work both enjoyable and productive.  Company promotions and pay raises are based solely on seniority.  This is great for those who wish to work at Costco for the majority of their lives and to those who have already been employed for years.  However, for myself this is extremely inconvenient.  There are no rewards for my hard work and the posibility of promotion is slim considering I have only been there over a year (most employees have been there anywhere from 15-30 years)."
good,"Hours are usually unsteady. But the pay is nice. The people are easy to get along with, members, and coworkers."
good,A typical day at costco was either i was on the register taking customers orders or either i was preparing food to be sold.
good,"A fun working environment"
good,"It is a policy driven workplace"
good,"Apertrura de bodega 5:00 am recorrido de puntos de seguridad, entrada de personal, verificacion de areas de produccion, chequeo de recepcion de producto importado, reporte de ventas."
good,"BENEFITS, are really good, the MEMBERS, that shop that this store are really Great, the MANAGEMENT TEAM needs WORK, on  what and how to talk to their Employees, They need to start a class, and have more training for NEW EMPLOYEES.  BEFORE THEY PUT THEM WITH MEMBERS. HOW TO TREAT, WHAT TO SAY AND HOW, TO SAY IT, , ALSO TO MANY FAMILY MEMBERS ARE THERE, THAT REALLY DONT KNOW ANY THING ABOUT THE COMPANY, YOUR SUPERVIOR NEED MORE TRAINING, TO HELP, MEMBERS,COWORKERS, YOUR MANAGERS, NEED MORE   UNDERSTANDING IN WHAT GOES ON THE THEIRE STORE, WHEN YOU HAVE 480, EMPLOYEES, JUST DONT COUNT ON ONE PERSON TO DO EVERTHING, SHARE,, ITS SUPOSE TO BE A FAMILY, ALWAYS BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND DONT COUNT ON ANYONE ,,,,,, IF THEIRE IS A OPENDOOR  POLICY WHERE YOU CAN TALK TO SOMEONE. DONT     DONT  BELIEVE IT. COUNT ON  YOURSELF ..."
good,Working at Costco is a pleasure.  The only problem is they don't give me enough hours or communicate efficiently.
good,"It is a fast paced busy environment to work in. As a cashier you have to be work quickly and be as efficient as possible. You must have good communication and customer service skills when dealing with customers. The coworkers are great to work with and everyone is friendly and optimistic, which makes the job enjoyable. Managers are understanding and easy to talk to if you need any assistance. Hours are quite flexible and very week to week."
good,"All in all, Costco Wholesale isn't a bad place to work as far as retail places go.  Their baseline salary is significantly higher for new employees, and they have a graduated wage program that's based purely on total hours worked.  Show up, do your job, and your pay goes up on its own.  Costco (like most companies) can definitely get rid of you if your performance doesn't meet its standards, but it can't/won't withhold an hours-based wage increase, which is 100% automatic.  "
good,The atmosphere was nice and they offered great benefits and pay. The work was nice and kept me busy.
good,"Costco provides a labor-intensive work day, but it's very rewarding."
good,"I was a cashier assistant and It was okay. You were constantly being hassled by management to do your job better and told stupid things to do like get boxes while you should've been helping the customer. The people there were crazy as far as drama goes, People slept around with one another which made working there awkward. They talked about one another which I found pathetic. There's not much room for advancement unless you've been there for awhile and most people work part time, unless your married to someone or your one of the manager's favorites. Overall it's a good job to have for someone in college. If you want to be a manager there you have to stay there for awhile and kiss alot of butt. This was my experience at the one I worked at, maybe some are different."
good,Warehouse associates are typically focussed on helping the customer.
good,"I assist our members in choosing the best tires for their driving needs. I also oversee other tire center employees to ensure that all work is being done efficiently and correctly. I must do a 10 point release procedure on every vehicle, which includes making sure everything is safe for member pick up. I have learned the ins and outs of the tire industry. I have attended classes on tire construction and performance. I have attended events to test drive cars with the tires we sell on them. "
good,"A typical day at work can differ depending on who the lead supervisor is. As a Cashier on the front end you are always in motion and the number of people  can grow fast. To being outside on cart duty. The management was decent, I would have liked it to be more orgranized and clear about what they want instead of going back and forth between certain situations. Co workers were great and there were many good personalities. The hardest part of the job would be the physical needs. The most enjoyable part would be getting to know different people and also work along side them in a fast pace environment"
good,"The owner is an awesome guy, but it's a family run business so not much opportunity to advance. The hours and benefits are good, but overtime is required. Overall a good place to work (except for being around the chemicals all day.)"
good,"doing local marketing, training of staff, hiring and firing of staff. scheduling hours for staff. giving feed back to buyers about products wanted."
good,Working at Costco teaches you a lot about customer service and going the extra mile in achieving that service
good,work is very repetitive under normal circumstances.
good,Productive workplace where you meet new customers & are able to help tend to their needs
good,Costco is a very fast paced environment. Your on the go and moving like a chicken with no head. For some this may sound exciting and thrilling. It really depends on where you work. No bad feedback on this job just know that its a workout and you MUST have patience.
good,"Great people to work for, just didn't like the 4am-10am shift. Also the days off were annoying and sporadic. Overall the pay was alright, and they have benefits which is nice."
good,"My job is physically demanding now.I started at Costco in the sales department as a telemarketer /scheduler for 3 employees. I booked appointments 3 months in advance and they then started using me out on the floor in different departments.I worked as a greeter taking count and checking membership cards. I also helped in clothing and sold the american express cards to members too. I really liked my original position best,in sales.I;am still currently employed I need full time employment."
good,"A typical work day is making sure all members are taken care of with excellent service. The Management team makes sure that they maintain a fair working environment. My co-workers make costco what it is today. Together we work at a top level to keep costcos reputation higher than other warehouses. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep all of our members happy, which also makes it enjoyable when we see that we do."
good,"Great for young man or woman looking for work while attending school or after grad. there is room for advancement but your personal time will have to be a sacrifice. promote from within for the hungry hard working never say no type., you will be rewarded."
good,It was a very good company to work for.  All the coworkers were supportive and nice.  The environment was ever changing so it kept things interesting and the benefits were awesome.
good,"I was assigned an assignment to do pick up cleaning for a stipulated minute of time, and exceeded by an extra 8min because I was passionate to wanting to do a thorough cleaning job, but was queried for it, So I learnt a lesson on drawing the line between being passionate and doing as instructed.  I also observed that the management wants instruction followed.  With the work culture, its friendly but not everyone is, for personal opinions and ideology I suppose. Hardest part of the job is having to stay out under the sun for too long a time picking and pushing  carts manually, and then standing long and running around. And the most enjoyable part of the job for me was assisting cashier at the counter table and helping customers to sort out and arrange their purchases"
good,"A good place to work. Management was typically good. Some supervisors had no respect for others and no worries about their workers, others did. Good hours."
good,"Each location is different,  but most are in a high paced environment with, mostly, capable employees. Great pay and benefits, but not everyone receives fair treatment for their work. Management often values short term solutions over long term growth."
good,Great pay and benefits but you will be targeted if speak up for yourself. Once that happens theres mo wsy yo come back from it. Management does what they want and treats you however they want with no repercussions
good,"Very physical work. Long term employers do not leave so there is no room for advancement. Everyone starts at minimum wage, you can work anywhere for $15.00 an hour and not have to push in carts, lift boxes and stand for 8 hours straight."
good,"I worked in the tire shop; loved it! Great people, fun work, good pay, good benefits. "
good,I loved helping people and the people I worked with! But some of the manager's power went to their head. But the Job is pretty easy on the mind and body. Just pushing cart's takes some extra effort!
good,"Costco provides paid vacation, insurance, and premium pay on Sundays  for part time workers. The two downsides are the physical labor and late shifts."
good,"Very fast pace, with no down time. The management isn't very helpful and the environment is very serious. They also don't care about customer satisfaction."
good,"An average day consists of faced paced movement, dealing 800+ members in an average 5 hour work day. 9 times out of 10 you will be working with hard working individuals who want to to their best, but some supervisors can be a bit abrasive and attempt to micromanage. It is a nice casual environment, with a simple dress code of appropriate work wear, no uniforms. If you can't handle standing on a hard concrete floor all day then this might not be the place for you. The most rewarding part for me was knowing you helped someone and they genuinely thank you for your help, be it finding an item for them or helping load a heavy item into their cart or vehicle."
good,"The first year was good until I switched to the tire shop. all the supervisors, managers would make fun of me and make my ego go down. it was depress."
good,Very hard to balance life and work. They want you to work 24/7. Great benefits but you're working a lot of hours even as a part- timer you will work full time hours.
good,"A good company, strict on days off. Good employees and coworkers. Members are allowed to get away with a lot. Management is pretty good but some are a bit too strict."
good,"The job was nice, relaxing , and calm. The air condition backrooms were very nice to have during the hot summers. However the managers were very angry and unreasonable when I was caught trying to hide the bodies of three customers that I had murdered while working the night shift. I was immediately fired for simply trying to clean up the mess I had created. I should have hid them in the dumpster out back instead of the plastic barrels but that's all in the past, I was supposed to face a sentence of 50 years but I've managed to escape the confines of my holding cell and am now laying low in a crack house. Good job, great pay, poor management, and very unlikable customers."
good,Needed more specific information about the physical duties on the job. very hard for older people with bad backs/medical histories. Management was good and easy to convey discomfort or problems with the staff.
good,it is fun to work at costco but its also really tiring after a while. I really like working at costco but it was not a good fir for me because i'm in school and the schedule are not always flexible.
good,Costco has a great starting hourly rate for anyone who doesn't need to pay bills and such. If you're a teenager this job is great for you. Management is frantic and sometimes very unfriendly.
good,Most stressful job ever. Management don’t do nothing but watch  chaos happen and making supervisors fix problems when easily a manager could handle it becaus e they don’t do nothing but watch and hope someone mess up to write them up they use you till they done with you
good,"Costco travel has great opportunity for growth. However, how it is currently being run is not okay. If the members saw how the agents are running things I'm sure they would not spend their money there. My manager was wonderful however my supervisor was terrible. I told her multiple times I was not happy and was thinking of leaving and all she would do was ask when I was leaving. She never once asked how she could make it better. She often missed planned meeting that she made with me. Or she would wait until the absolute last minute to have a meeting (where as other supervisors were making these meetings weeks ahead). "
good,"Great benefits, pay is good. However management has a lot to be desired. It seems like everything changes every two minutes and you hear different things from different managers about the same thing."
good,Could be boring at some times towards the end of the day. Fast paced environment during the day. Not too much room for advancement and working as a night merchandiser you will be working overtime quite often
good,"strongly customer service based environment with a hostile work atmosphere. the manager at this location was very much a micromanager. I have worked in pharmacy for 10 years, yet this manager believed I and many of the other technicians had no idea what we were talking about. Other techs had the same amount of experience and were treated the same way. I am not sure if it was just this location or if most managers were this way throughout the company."
good,Show time ready all day every day. A need to make sure your going as fast as you can .Get them in get them out . Make sure you greet the members smiling
good,Do your 8 hours and leave. a typical 9-5 job. Pretty standard.  No really room for advancement.  Employees are just trying to do the minimum and go home to their families.
good,I like how Costco keeps their work space clean at all times! Other jobs ive had I had to deal with that one lazy person but at Costco everyone has to be moving you cant be slacking. Costco gets really busy and supervisors have their eyes on you.
good,"Cotsco is a good place to work if you dont plan to do college (depends career too) and it is a place where you can make a career if that is your intention. However, even though its a good place to work, there is lot of favoritism, and lack of work of many workers that have seniority. Many people will say it is the best place because of that and the time they have been working there. Managers are cool (no all of them) but id like to see them do the job of the cashiers, stokerrs, food court deli, meat and bakery departments since many dont do their job in supervising on many workers that dont do theor job. i really enjoy workrking there but reality is important too. I wont lie that you can have fun too and enjoy but usually is hard because of time and amount of work. If you decided to dont do a career in college, then this is your place!"
good,It's a good place to work if you are okay with retail environment. Extremely fast-paced and laborious . This job also requires late work schedules and inconsistent scheduling. There is opportunity to move up and sideways if interested.
good,The day to day shifts were never the same and staff were always happy to work with.  Did not always feel though management listened to concerns and issues when they were brought to their attention.
good,"Costco is a good company to work for if you don't know what you'd like to do for a career or if you're a school student. It's a retail job, so unless you're full time your hours will get cut."
good,Typical work days at this store started busy and ended busy. There was never really a time to slow down until the doors closed. The work environment was very friendly and energetic so it made up for the lack of time on kunch breaks.
good,"I liked it for the first few yeats, then became upset by favoritism. Management is not very well as they would sit in the office most of day and only come out to find something that wasn't perfect."
good,"Costco was an overall great place to work with a diverse collection of peoples and many different department opportunities. The specific department I was extremely corporate, had poor work life balance, and not a lot of room for growth."
good,The problems i had with costco are the tedious and repetitive work but that doesnt matter much when you have fun people to work with/around. Its a good place for high school students to get some nice cash for a seasonal hire
good,401K is only $500/annual match regardless of full time or part time.  Benefits at the corporate level are no different than the average warehouse employee.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo conflictivo, No re conocen tus esfuerzos."
good,"This place is a great place to work, if you don't have education or the ambition to go anywhere else. I must say though they go out of their way to be diverse in a cultural aspect which is great! management can be a pain to deal with unfortunately. they can be very unforgiving at times and make you feel like a bottom link on the chain."
good,"Great benefits. Learned customer retention and a higher level of customer service. Culture was generally good depending on store managers. Hardest part of job was hitting membership numbers with no incentive other than keeping your current position."
good,I commend Costco for being such a good provider to their employees and employees families. I am also impressed with the 401k. I think Costco is a great company that takes care of its people.
good,"great environmentfor someone thats looking for a job out of highschool,fun,easy going,teaches you value at the work place,management is impressive and so are the majority of employees."
good,"Nice work environment, the work load was easy enough to accomplish, however, the management team could have been better as well as the ideals that was had and shared among them."
good,The management team at Costco Wholesale is somewhat fair but they do show favoritism within the employee staff. However the work environment is a happy environment.
good,"I work in the optical lab located in Auburn, WA and it's very simple work. The staffing are pretty reasonable and understanding when you need to change your schedule (especially in school) and majority of the people are willing to help you succeed. Great place to grow and obtain different skills if you consider working in the lab."
good,"I had a family emergency that took me away, otherwise I would still be there. I could not get back on. Fast paced, work hard, but the people are great and the customers are great."
good,"You will receive good pay and benefits better than any other companies like them, but the management in this company or maybe just in the store I am at 246 is just terrible because my current manager can not do anything correct in the department and the General Manager knows it but is not doing anything about it."
good,"Repetitive work! "
good,"Overall, Costco is a good company to work for. They pay well, respect their employees, and provide a good work environment. You are able to build a career with the company if you would like to; if not, it's a good place to get by while you are finding the right career for you."
good,"I worked in several different departments.  The last department I worked in was membership/returns.  I would sign up new members, upgrade members and renew members memberships. I issued new membership cards. I also did returns and sorted items so that they could be thrown away, returned to manufacturer or returned to the shelf."
good,"Nothing special here, just work and when you hit brackets of hours complete you get raises. The ceiling for pay is rather high as a basic employee if you're there long enough so that more often than not enticed people to stay while I worked there."
good,"Costco Travel was an excellent place to work, at first.  They offered multiple Familiarization trips, weekly trainings on certain properties, excellent pay and benefit package."
good,"We start at 5 am stocking products.  Heavy lifting, on time constraints.  Work gets left undone.  Expectations are very high and demanding.  The longer you have been there the high their expectations become.  no formal training and a lot of favoritism.  Seniority counts for nothing.  Managers take no blame for their actions it trickles down the ladder and the hourly employees get the heat.  You deal with the members on an everyday basis."
good,"You can only start as 3 positions, then work your way up. I enjoyed the amount of exercise I was able to do on the clock. In the parking lots, I would typically walk 13 miles a day."
good,I would clock in and mostly go outside to push shopping carts. The other days I would bag groceries for the customers and help them to their cars. I learned how to treat customers so they would always be happy. The manager was very involved and knew how to treat the employees with respect.  The hardest part of the job was having very short lunch breaks and the most enjoyable part was dealing with so many customers and personalities on a daily basis.
good,"Costco was a good company to work for. I learned a lot when I was there and was used in many different departments. Both my co-workers and management were overall solid in their performance and dedication to the company. The hardest part of the job was balancing school, work, and life. I made the choice to leave Costco, giving me more time to focus on school, and then graduate. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things daily and interacting with others. I love a healthy challenge, constant growth, and making a positive impact wherever I am."
good,This was a college job and it was a good opportunity for me. I liked the people the management was alright. I would recommend this job for college students.
good,"Costco is a really great employer to work for and they have so many different opportunities for growth in their company."
good,"Working for Costco is a fun experience. While working there, you get a free membership to shop. The pay is decent and the environment is fun and relaxed."
good,"Costco Wholesale is a very busy place. I learned quite a bit in the short time I've spent in Costco. Interacting with customers was probably one of the best and most enjoyable experiences I've had thus far. From selling warranty to providing recommendations and even assisting members with certain products to their vehicles would always put a smile to my face. My co-workers were great. They always had a sense of urgency which in turn lead to a comfortable working environment. The hardest part of the job would definitely have to be during winter. Costco during the winter can get really busy. For example, lines to the cashier are sometimes several aisles long. Can you picture 4-5 cashier lines being 4 aisles long? Yes? Alright, great. Now picture 20 cashier lines being that long. It's quite the sight to see. Controlling the ""traffic"" was fun in a way."
good,"This company is a great work environment. There are great benefits. There are a variety of different cultures which is a nice change from all my other work environments. The members and the co-workers are the reason I walk in to work every morning. I can smile and have a good day because of them. The hardest part about the job would be being a front-end assistant like me. Pack members items into boxes, and if you do not have any boxes you would have to go find some. Management is really well and organized. Some managers may be too strict but they do not let you get away. They keep a close eye on everybody."
good,"Costco corporate was a nice place to work, specifically in their Internet Services group. However Costco wouldn't be described as an industry leader or pioneer when it comes to their IS services, and often times it seems like the truly talented employees do the majority of the work while others that obviously don't care about IS check Facebook and play Clicker Heroes."
good,"Costco is a great place to work if you're looking for a college job or a job with really good benefits. Costco as a whole is like a big family. They pay surprisingly well and its a great learning environment. In this environment you learn how to be accountable for your department. This includes how much labor your spending on a weekly basis,inventory and keeping track of the departments D&D. You learn communication skills to build  a rapport with customers leaving them wanting to come back for more. Management is a different beast altogether. Many managers are usually promoted on a ""It's not what you know, its who you know"" method and their goals are usually not in line with the companies. This does not include all managers. There are plenty of managers that are willing to go that extra mile to help customers or employees resolve issues or even teach employees how to resolve issues on their own without the need of a manager. I've had a great experience with the diverse coworkers of Costco. While working with them you develop great long lasting bonds which may help you to overcome a difficult day in the workplace. The hardest part of the job while you're at Costco is usually dealing with members. There are occasions where you have to deal with irate members but usually that is the same with any retail job.After a while the job does get tedious and starts to lose its challenge. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is achieving customer satisfaction. Knowing that you did everything you could to help a customer and having them show their appreciation is one of the most rewarding"
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers unload they items onto the belt, and encourage them to upgrade their membership."
good,"Organized, replenished, provided layout for media, domestics, and basics departments.  It was vital to our work day that as a team we worked together to be""showtime"" ready (open doors).  I learned the importance of communication and customer service since it was a must to be very clear and precise when working with the forklift drivers, as well as, the customers. The most difficult was the physical aspect of the job. There were times when a job required at least two people and there just was not enough people to spare. And the most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers.  It was a small group so we all knew each other well.  Everyone had great attitudes and made the atmosphere fun and relaxed; but when needed everyone buckled down and got the work done.  Just like my co-workers the management team, I worked directly under, were professional but also made the day-to-day grind enjoyable and relaxed.  They offered constructive criticism and allowed the employees to have a say when making certain decisions."
good,"I was the lead at Costco. I drove the forklift, I worked in shipping and receiving talked to truck driver's to see what company they were coming from. I learned how to work at a fast pace and keep a consistent pace, I've taught people how to make there job easier by simple little insructions."
good,"Costco was a great place to work, they were helpful with working around my schedule, giving me reasonable hours and job security was good.  I decided to leave so I could start looking for work in the Electrical field."
good,"first of all. i work at the bakery, people in their are nice and cool. you can learn a lot of stuff back their. and the manager in bakery, she's awesome! but go back to two for the store manager...well if you want to work their you better work your butt off to drag their attention. some of the manager doesn't even know what they're doing. people have to stay longer at night to finish the job that could be done if the management were right. and the job culture is not that good... some cashier and manager just seems like they are pretty unfriendly. anyway, overall a good place to stay, ONLY if you can get used to those ""unfriendly"" look and attitude."
good,"The hardest part of the job of a food-stocker is working the 4am shift. Which in turn, makes it difficult to foster a normal personal life. However, it lends well to free time in the middle day with more light and sunshine access than a desk job with more normal working hours."
good,"Fast paced environment, team work driven, obsessively clean. Supportive co-workers"
good,This job was good but just wasn't for me as I like to use and take advantage of my intelligence and competences. I quit that job because I need a change of career.
good,"It is like living in the current America. It is a very nice place to be and you can see yourself staying for a while but the higher ups might screw you at a moments notice. I know it is different in other warehouses. I for example, work in the Lancaster warehouse and the managers in some of the departments are trying too hard. there are clear errors that can be fixed that they claim it is the only way when it has been proven otherwise. There is the good manager here and there and good supervisors but the ones running the show more or less don't let them do what they are suppose to do. The people you work with are great and the benefits are second to none when it comes to retail."
good,"A typical day at work starts with me arriving to start at 4am, which is a bit rough. I start stocking and moving products around as well as throwing away all the extra cardboard, for the first 5 hours of my shift. Once it hits 9am, all of the employees start cleaning up and sweeping to be able to open the store at 9:45am. Ive learned that nothing about working is easy. If you want other co-workers and managers to respect you and treat you correctly, some serious work needs to be done and you need to earn every bit of that respect that is given to you. The management is tough, They do not tolerate laziness and any sort of slacking or side talk. If something is done incorrectly and its considered a big deal, a corrective consultation is given almost immediately. All of my co-workers are awesome. Everyone is so nice and everyone you walk past says hello as well as good morning, even if they've never seen you before. If there is something you need help with, you can ask anyone and they will drop everything they're doing for you. The hardest parts of my job is all the heavy lifting as well as the waking up and needing to clock in at 4am. The most enjoyable part of my job is being around such kind, happy people everyday."
good,"Ce que j'ai vraiment aimé est le contact avec les membres. L'ambiance de travail et la bonne entente entre collegue de travail et les suppérieurs hiérarchique"
good,"lowes was a lot of fun. hours were good, people were good and the customers were usually fun. I learnedalot about customer service and the management were pretty cool and fair. hardest part of the job was nothing really. I enjoyed the atmosphere"
good,Première expérience professionnelle au Québec.
good,I enjoyed my time the hours can be a little goofy. Great and fun way to make mad money.
good,"i worked 3rd shift, for almost 13 years. very busy, i enjoyed my job but need to grow in my career"
good,"Very busy place to work, learned customer service skills, time management skills, organization skills, Social organizing skills,co-workers fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was to have hands with the public. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the fantastic staff and the pay."
good,"work was always different everyday, i learned that customer service is huge. management was never on the same page. co-workers were set in groups to who they liked and didnt like. the hardest part of the job was always getting those customers that always knew they could get away with free stuff by complaining. best part about it was seeing what you can buy at wholesale and in bulk"
good,Good place to know about the retail environment. Good benefits. A great place for a young person who is now starting off to work after high school.
good,"Come in, work your shift whenever it is and get out. Pretty simple but harsh deadlines and workload is on par with the pay. In essence, working at Costco for a career may benefit you in the long run."
good,Good paying job and great job overall great experience there and would highly recommend applying and taking any position given to you and work your way to management
good,"Although I was allotted time to take off ti take my children to meet thier father 2 xs a month out of state, my boss was on an ego trip because she was the type of person who rubbed it in your face she was your boss and you were going to do as she wanted. She'd would yell and cuss me and my co workers out for nothing. I reported her behavior  and nothing was ever done."
good,This is an upbeat & fast pasted working environment. With great benefits. If you work well under pressure this is a great opportunity for you. Management and staff were awesome at my location.
good,Productive workplace with room for growth. Multiple locations with opportunities for new store openings. Potential for advancement. Benefits offered to part and full time employees.
good,"Be ready to work for your money. They pay great, for that reason. ALWAYS busy, you will ALWAYS work weekends. Members feel entitled since they pay for a membership. Very competitive."
good,"I worked at Costco food court, which is the hardest department, but it's not bad at all. It's fun, 10 hours feels like 4 hours. Only thing that bothered me was I felt like many of my cowokers did not take me serious because I was much younger than them."
good,"Working in the food court was extremely fast paced, a lot of work with short staff half the time one person closing doing the work of 3 or more people. Management at the time was horrific, verbally abusive and would go out of their way to make your work life unbearable. The job itself was easy, just got to be very stressful being short staffed or lacking of decent working employees. The company as a whole is a great place to work for, great benefits!"
good,"good company to work for, management not so lax and do not care about exhaustion and workloads. Benefits and job security are amazing. No need to worry as Costco is within the union."
good,"need I say more? The company is great to work for, my particular management team were not. My immediate managers are pretty great, but the upper levels seem to lean on them too much, and if nothing they do is right, then it soon became that nothing I did was right. It was time to go."
good,"Good place to work if you plan on making a career out of it, otherwise it's hard to move up. Raises and advances pretty much depend solely on seniority and don't take skill or ability into account. As nice as it is to know your loyalty will be appreciated, it's unfortunate that hard work and quality performance isn't valued as much as simply staying with the company for a longer time."
good,"If you enjoy the public and interaction with people, this is a good place to work. Never a dull or boring and very challenging. I enhanced my people experience, understanding why people need certain products for everyday living and just be able to apply myself to helping the public."
good,"I have learned lots of different skills at costco. A typical day would include serving customers with their goods and providing excellent customer service. Management here are good and have a vast knowledge of the retail world. Everyone at costco is from all different backgrounds and cultures and this is what make the business special. The hardest part of the job would be that you cant always make everyone happy, but you can certainly try your very best to. the most enjoyable thing is making customers happy and to see them smile at you for the hard work you've put in trying to help them."
good,"I loved working for this company.Just like all other companies it has its politics and not so nice individuals.But overall it was a pleasure to work there,and the environment is positive.Ofcourse as the company has grown a lot has changed but I still love working for Costco.The hardest part of the job was dealing with overly aggressive managers ,and the best part was feeling satisfied about ur work ."
good,"Staff and management were all very friendly and helpful, however hours were not guaranteed for my position. Other than the lack of hours, it was an enjoyable job."
good,Costco optical was a fun and productive environment. One of the best things they offered was an employee association package which allowed us to interact in activities that created a family environment
good,"Working at Costco is a great opportunity. You learn new skills that are unexpected, ex:even as a grocery packer,  critical thinking skills are a must in this line of work, you will learn quickly!"
good,l'aspect le plus agréable de mon post était les personnes avec qui j'étais en contact tous les jours. L'aspect négatif résidait dans le travail répétitifs et la fatigue musculaire/ douleurs aux endroits qui sont sollicités le plus.
good,"I hate this place but gotta do it for school, people are like high school drama but keep your circle small otherwise people will squash you with their rumors about you"
good,"For the lack of education needed to work here, it pays great and has a good benefits package. Part time workers are not treated as well or fairly as the full timers."
good,"Friendly staff, kind local customers, fast pace work, always busy however, always talk about how much heavy income they receive each week but cant afford to give part time employees a minimum of 25 hours a week (which was promise among joining the team) Lack of extra shifts. Hard to get a second job with unstable hours"
good,Working for Costco was quite an experience.  I assisted the front end cashiers on a typical day.  the hardest part about working here was learning where every item in the store was located.  I enjoyed the friendly people and customer interactions.
good,Very fast paced. Customer friendly. Diverse culture. It is a good place to work. If you become a permanent employee the benefits are good. Management was ok.
good,"If there was a costco near me, i would work there again due to the competitive pay and nice benefits. The employees are nice but the manager for the recieving side was kind of rude and softspoken."
good,my coworkers were soo amazing best people to work with the members not so much and also management wasnt the best but overall amazing place to work in.
good,"Working here for me has been an experience coming from Wash,Dc as an African American . It takes a great deal of humbleness in the south."
good,"Friendly, personable environment, management need to pay more attention to department efficiency, overall a good place to call a long term career as long as cronyism doesn't hold back good talent."
good,I was seasonal employee. I worked whatever they asked and whatever hours were assigned to me. I was on time and did productive work. Co-workers are very friendly and managers were satisfied with my work.
good,"Needs of the day constantly change, depending on who was there.  Typically you come in with a small group of three or maybe a couple more.  One person provides a sheet of new product coming in and helps make a plan for what we can use that day.  Everybody else will assist members on the floor by providing them with a clean, safe and friendly environment.  We assist one another with plans for the day and uplift one another.  A goal is set each day, one which everyone agrees to, and we work to accomplish the set goal.  Everyone works with what they are comfortable and able to do and we accomplish the goals set for the day and get things ready for the next day and the next employee to come into the next work day."
good,"The pay never met up with the responsibilities of the job.  Poor management, but great benefits.  The potential for moving up is not great but the potential for more work is great."
good,"Costco takes care of their employees. Great pay scale with guaranteed raises and health and dental benefits for even the part time employees. Lack of variety day-to-day can and will get stale, but such is life. My biggest issues are the lack of comradery and somewhat incompetent management. It may just be my introverted personality, but I don't feel as welcomed in the warehouse. It has never been too much of an issue anywhere else. Management also lacks communication skills. Many times, lines have been crossed  and orders are issued too late. There also is a lack of respect between departments. It's frustrating for the labor to try and compensate for their shortcomings."
good,llegar acomodar de mercancia y ayudar al cliente a que tenga una buena experiencia en la tienda para que vuelva se le apoya en cualquier momento y no se deja hasta que este sastisfecho
good,Always be happy keep a smile on your face for members members are always right helping members with loading merchandise and finding merchandise and each day u going to learn something new
good,"Assist members in the warehouse and over the phone with the purchase and return of tires. Answer questions, makes recommendations, and writes tire purchase and service invoices. Communicates with Tire Shop Manager, buyers, Receiving department, and inventory auditors regarding special orders, quantities, status, prices, deliveries, and promotions of merchandise. Stock tires in the service area. Follows proper safety procedures and standards. Maintains courteous member service at all times while contributing to a smooth flow of members through the tire shop."
good,"A typical day at Costco is always a busy day. I learned as much as I could within a given day, being sent from department to department, tackling different tasks pertaining to customer service. Management varies upon the specific Manager that's being worked with/for at the moment. Co-workers and customers/members was the best part of working for Costco. The hardest part of the job was working with difficult Managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and my co-workers."
good,"When you arrive you are to punch in and go to the supervisor to ask as to what you would be doing for that day ( unless specified in your timetable). The few things that I did learn is that patience, hard work are excellent virtues to have. The management team is very good with delegating and even helping the employees when help is needed. The hardest part of the job would be when the managers asked me to go outside and push carts."
good,easy simple work just cooked burgers and chips I didn't have to work tills or do drive through health and safety easy to follow
good,"Un buen ambiente de trabajo que ofrece oportunidades a todo tipo de personas, aunque el sueldo no es muy alto se tiene la oportunidad de crecer en el."
good,A hard working company with no sense of priorities. Everyone must work on the Front End regardless of job position with no concern with weather or not the job you were hired for gets done.
good,"I enjoy all my co-workers and the members I serve. My typical day at work, I stand at the entrance or exit doors and greet the members, the hardest part of my job is standing the entire time. I enjoy my co-workers the most and helping the members."
good,"Always make us work hard, have learned how to make various types of food. The management is ok but can be better. The team I work with are nice people we all get on along together help each other to complete tasks. The hardest part of the job is when there is not enough staff in my department. I enjoy working there as we all get along with each other as well as we get our work done."
good,"I worked from 5pm-10pm Monday through Friday and got paid 12.50, this was a very simple yet hard working job as I cleaned out empty boxes and organized the products in a certain area. After the store closed at 8pm, we would restock all the products and clean/organize our areas. Sunday's were even better as we got paid time and a half and the store was only open to 5pm."
good,"On a normal day I packed out products, cleaned machinery and floors. I helped customers find meat and answered questions."
good,When I clock in at Costco I have to report to my area. Our duties of every work shift are to check all the tags to make sure they are correct and up to date and assist any members needing help.
good,Benefits wonderful. Location horrible. Enjoyed working w/clients and learning more about HAs but not for retail.
good,Great place to work that is able to teach you the integrated skills needed for jobs in other companies.
good,"Costco is very fast paced and you're working around a lot of people. You should be ready to interact with many people in a day and be confident in yourself. Customers will usually ask for something and don't like to hear the word 'no' when you don't have it. Not giving a confident answer leads to more work, and more dissatisfaction from the customer proving to them you don't have what they want."
good,Costco wholesale has a lot to offer with many opportunities to get trained within each department within the job. Competitive salary as you work your way up and work more hours as well. Overall great experience!
good,"Treated employees well. Worked well with work-life balance. The hours of the store were not very early or very late like most retail. Plus, they closed on most major holidays."
good,"It's a good place to work, although you don't get a set schedule every week. This makes it tough for part time associates to get more than one job. The people are friendly and the management does a great job."
good,"It was the kind of job to keep you on your feet, constantly moving and helping someone. Management was always there to help, very strict policies that they enforce"
good,I really don't have much to say just be the best at everything you do I love working with different people and explore the different department Costco has
good,"Pack a bag, you're literally be moving in lol. Long hours and they expect you to work. Hard. But they make it worth your while. Best benefits package I have ever had."
good,It's very true what people say. Your boss is what makes or breaks the job. I worked at 2 locations and one I loved because of management and the other was horrible. So it is what you make of it.
good,"Not a place for advancement, did not feel the environment was good for new associates . Felt like being used for seasonal help and then discarded like trash"
good,"Good job, pays well and learn to cook chicken in a large quantity and maintain throughtout the day. Along with helping the coworkers prepare for the day."
good,"I liked the the people and the environment, but I just couldn't do the hours I wasn't making enough for the hours I was giving. I do recommend people to try it for themselves though."
good,"A typical day of work there is non stop. Even if things are slow there is plenty of stuff to do, Management is great and willing to work and teach you how to succeed. Obviously the hardest part of the job is the members. Some members can be very rude and will say mean things. Being able to not let what someone say to you bother your or make you upset is key. The best part of the job is the people who you work with! My coworkers were amazing and I meet some great people while working for Costco."
good,a typical day at work means dealing with a lot of customers. it is a busy and fast paced environment with a lot of opportunity to move up if you work hard enough
good,If all the employees did their jobs the right way and not the lazy way the store would not be such a mess.  We need employees that actually care about their jobs and doing them right.
good,"Management always gets the job done but that doesn't mean they do it correctly, they also never take the time to properly show you how they want things done, they just ask for it and complain why you don't do it the way they want. Its a lot of repetitive work and getting promoted is difficult because they decide to promote on seniority instead of hard workers. The benefits are awesome and the pay is decent but definitely goes up over the years."
good,Good company overall.  But IT staff (such as software developers) my find it challenging to stick around because compensation over all isn't as competitive.  But then again its retail.
good,"Solid job to get you through school, and even a great career option."
good,"I sold TV's as well as being cross trained by helping the cashiers, stocking product, and pushed shopping carts. My coworkers were very informative and helpful ."
good,Great position for anyone that is looking for job with great benefits and or students that need a part time position. Many individuals make Costco as a career job due to the raises and surprisingly above average they provide after 6 months.
good,"Great Place. Work was steady people were great."
good,"i was hired and then after the store opened they let half of us go,so i cant really say much."
good,Good place to work I did my 2 co-op work term from same place. I enjoyed working there because staff was friendly and helping.
good,"horaire variable, travail la fin de semaine difficile de devenir temps plein"
good,selling computer equipment clothes helping others navigate their way through the store testing food products management well ok sometimes their can be on a ego trip. the hardest part of the job is at the end of the day the shelves have to be restocked the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and testing the various products.
good,"Well what can I say, I worked for Costco for almost 9 years. I started from the bottom as a asphalt technician AKA pulling shopping carts, to performing just about every position in the warehouse. I spent most of my Costco career in administration and accounting. I was successful in all my promotions and positions."
good,"it was a lot of physical work , but once I learned how to correctly go about preparing for the business day, from stocking and setting up the proper displays , and more responsibility was granted to me , and it taught me to be a team player , and I could always be counted on to get the job done ."
good,Some policies not good for the employe very restriction for employees All the time they expect more from us I love Costco’s customer  service If anything happen we cannot get chance Just there to terminate
good,"Working at Costco is pretty easy. A typical day at work for me consisted of either cashiering on a busy day, or loading members items into their carts when I wasn't cashiering."
good,"The company itself is a good one to work for. The atmosphere among employees is friendly resulting in good friendships. Management can be unfair and micro-manage more than often making it sometimes difficult to get through the day. Members can range from being very polite and nice to you to be extremely rude, racist, condensing to the point of them cursing you out du to them being impatient. The pay is well and the time and a half Sunday is a nice bonus."
good,Costco was great to work for 3rd shift the work I did as a sanitation worker was awesome there was a balance  of the job being challengeing and easy at the same time I quit the job but wish I could go back left on good terms
good,As far as a retail job goes it's probably the best it gets. Once you get a job it's hard to get fired.  Just don't do anything stupid and you can work their forever.  Raises are based on hours worked so most employees just show up to work and do the bare minimum.
good,"Belle ambiance de travail, possibilité d'avancement, demande une bonne tête sur les épaules."
good,"People are very different there than normal. Everyone is focused on their job like anywhere else, the environment is just a little different. Met a lot of strange people."
good,"Le service doit être rapide, souvent pas assez d'employés pour fournir à la demande, car le payroll est géré de près pour offrir aux membres les prix les plus bas. "
good,A typical day at work is that I always got a smile on my face because I loved my job. I learned by how to take your time to listen to members and employees more than I ever did. I think that the management needs to be honest to their employees. My co-workers will say that I am a work horse. the hardest part of my job was to slow down sometimes. the most enjoyable part of the day was knowing that I did the best that I could do and that always makes me fell good inside.
good,"Costco hires young, strong backs for decent wages under strict management and discipline processes. They offer much incentive and benefits for staying with the company for a substantial amount of time, but you better toe the line. Costco runs things by the book! Management hovers over employees on the floor, and goes by a 1-strike-you're-out system. Those who do not like to lift heavy things and practice good health by stretching and staying fit need not apply! This is not only a job, this is a work out!"
good,The whole day was scheduled around making things easy and accessible for the consumers. Moving stock from the holding areas to the isles in bulk was a daily task. The important of proper pricing and signage were a skill that will always be with me.
good,"The supervisors were very pleasant to work for, they made working in the warehouse very satisfying.  Enjoyed working their even though it was only for a few weeks it was a great experience."
good,"If you like being busy your entire day, Costco is a good place to work. They offer great benefits but have a lot of employees, so hours are limited for work."
good,learned great customer service meet great people earned great speed in cake decorating holidays were a zoo but made me fast
good,Good Employer with good benifits and programs for employees.  Decent opertunities for advancement.  Understanding managers.  Equal opertunity employer.
good,"Back-breaking work. Everyone is really nice, really helpful, and the pay is good, but I feel like I am literally breaking my back with this work."
good,Costco was a very thoughtful company to it's employees and provided many opportunities to move up and advance your position. I would recommend this job to any friend or colleague searching for employment
good,"Costco was an overall great place to work with a diverse collection of peoples and many different department opportunities. The specific department I was extremely corporate, had poor work life balance, however great growth opportunities."
good,Costco Wholesale is a retail business that can be overwhelming for its members. I do a great job making it easier for their shopping experience. It is fast pace & I excel at that pace because I'm a hard worker.
good,"un endroit grand, joyeux, demandant, les journées passe vite"
good,Hi I have good experience butchers I work nawo in sobeys I’m meat manager and I like Costco  and I like meat department Costco  and every thing in Costco is very nice and good service  I have member in Costco
good,"Se agradece la oportunidad de trabajo a gente sin experiencia, lo que mas me gusto del trabajo fue la dinámica y el horario de estudiante."
good,"I work 5 days a week and work for 5 hours. Start time is 5am and finish at 10am. I learn that working as a team is the best way to improve the work to the next level. I manage to help my teams member to show them how to do it probably. "
good,must have complete flexibility and getting a promotion to full time is almost impossible.  you may remain part time for many years and even then its no gaurantee
good,The seasonal help are only called back after 90 days so they can never acure benifits. Unless you are hired on full time this job is not worth keeping.
good,"la parte mas dificil del trabajo son los administrativos."
good,good job great pay some store have better management then other. great for a second job and you can learn a lot
good,"You will be stuck working part-time for several years (less then 30 hrs a week) unless you have a ""friend"" that can grease the wheels for you. I want so badly to state that it is a non bias company but when people are applying themselves and demonstrated there qualifications beyond a piece of paper but still getting passed over by a new hire with lack of experience is a bad sign. Too much ""buddy"" or ""good ol boy"" ""pal"" hiring and promoting in this company"
good,"At the time I was there, management literally spied on employees and often scolded. Employees who acquired full-time status were often lazy. Costco follows a union mentality with management and workers opposed. However, they have since gone through management changes and former co-workers say it's been a great improvement."
good,"Management was all over the place. I was not a bad place to work. Perfect as a seasonal job. On busy weekends the place seems like a crazy show, no management can be found if needed."
good,a typical day at work would included sorting boxes onto various sikds. it was a pleasure working with some and a nightmare working with many
good,too much favoritism it was like high school the seniors vs freshmen
good,I thought it was a good seasonal  job with a good salary I wouldn’t want to work there full time though. The management wasn’t the best with communication. Everyone was friendly and welcoming.
good,Competitividad y pocas oportunidades de crecimiento
good,"Typical day at work is mainly verifying and filling prescriptions, calling doctors for clarifications. Computer system is dated So it takes longer to process scripts than it really should."
good,It Help me develop strong communication and leadership skills. The ability to learn exceptional time management with out supervision. Very demanding work environment.
good,"Costco is an amazing company to work for, great benefits, very understanding and works with employees. The management that I was working for, however, could definitely stand for some improvements."
good,"Costco is a company that you can grow in and is willing to help you grow along with promotions from inside the business. However, the management within higher power as well as inside the warehouse is chaotic. The biggest problem is lack of communication."
good,There was a lot of foot traffic but Sweeping the store cleaning up spills and making sure the restrooms were cleaned and fully stocked made the day go by slower.
good,"Great part time for school or retired old folks. Comply with the Food Safety Regulations set by the DOH, and be nice to people walking trying snacks. "
good,The job itself is gruelling. But the employees are fun to work with. There is very little scope to move forward. Hardly any career opportunities. Pay increment is too less
good,"Great company to work for, although it been hard to advance and grow within the company; bad hours if your not favored and less hours. good benefits, eye, health, and dental are decent."
good,"the pay is great but what will get you is the customers or as Costco calls them ""members"". They are rude, ignorant, and uptight. That's not all of them off course but just a good percentage of them"
good,Can be a great job depending on the management at the warehouse. Working for a cold-hearted boss and not being part of the bosses clique or one of the bosses buddies made it miserable to work there. This is the only job I have ever had where I dreaded going to work every day and was treated so hateful and rude.
good,"great place to work & greet customers"
good,"The overall learning experience was good. Co-workers were very dramatic. Management didn't protect employees from customers..all they cared about was earning money. The hours were great, along with the pay and benefits."
good,The leadership at Costco is not what I thought it would be.  The managers can be very unprofessional in the fact of playing favorites and picking people they want to see advance and choosing to ignore the others who make work harder and been with the company longer.
good,"They work with your schedule, but you do want to be available on weekends. Coworkers are all typically kind and the workload is tolerable. Be ready to communicate daily with members and make sales."
good,"Costco is a great company to work for, my biggest issue was that management was for the most part lazy and didn’t have realistic expectations for their employees. It also bugged me that I had to work 5 days a week and that only amounted to 25 hours a week. Staying later for more hours was a hit or miss, I couldn’t count on it. Some of the older employees needed to be fired for the lack of productivity, but managers let them skate by and made the good employees pick up their slack."
good,"This was a seasonal position, but the work wasn't too hard and it was easy to learn the role. The management are present on all shifts, and the team is easy to get along with."
good,"Not a recommended 40 hour job. Management seemed to CONSTANTLY change and along with them the protocol and family oriented environment. Its obvious membership needs to be maintained, but picking the right individuals to recruit and retain membership is key success with that mission. You must play on strengths, not stop whining employees by amplifying their weaknesses. And if you (even management) don't know the answer to a question, PLEASE JUST SAY YOU DONT KNOW. Then go find someone who does. That's customer service."
good,"Great pay, benefits but bad workplace balance, managers who play favorites and have no idea what they are doing. There is a workplace culture that is toxic with those in higher positions without the correct skills or interpersonal skills"
good,"the workplace is okay."
good,"A typical day in the life of a Cashier Assistant would include unloading/loading carts, grabbing an item for a member, cashier duties (if you're cash trained), boxing member's items, and providing great customer service. "
good,"I would have enjoyed staying on. I enjoyed the fast pace hard physical labor involved in the job. It was a challenge to learn the position but once I was able to make a rhythm of the back and forth routine between freezer, Raw Room and the Hot rotisserie area things went smoothly. I felt accomplished when I didn't have to ask for extra assistance from the Deli Prep area so more production could be accomplished."
good,"Worked as a front end assistant at Costco for 3 months. Duties ranged from loading and unloading carts at the register, helping the cashiers, pushing carts, picking up trash, maintaining cleanliness of product displays, disposing of garbage and cardboard, assisting customers with information about the store and products, and more. "
good,Intense place to work as it is very fast paced and management is very strict. They will always have eyes on you and tends to monitor you as if you were a child. Great pay and benefits if you're willing to put up with sometimes indecent customers and management.
good,"Overall a fair workplace. Staff were always friendly, positive and polite. Very sociable culture. Rostering flexibility would have been advantageous in order to get a good work/ life balance."
good,"very repetitive work place, good hours, great pay, not very enjoyable. the rest of this space is filled because the website keeps telling me to write more but my mom said if you cant say something nice, dont say it at all."
good,"Learn a lot about : "
good,"they train new workers well.I work as  maintenance offfice,we clean all the wholesale warehouse.We fix all broken machines and fix the lightening system"
good,"The staff is really cohesive, friendly. The managers are strict but also friendly. Very enjoyable work environment for anybody, but you have to work hard."
good,"Fast paced environment, hard for women to move up, no work life balance. Good company to work for but be prepared to be married to the job. Pays well definitely earn pay."
good,"Typical day was like the rest always had a check list on what needed to be down! This job was seasonal so getting that check list done was huge through the holidays! It got hectic at times but patience and positive vibes gave me capacity to accept delay, trouble, without getting upset. Management was on track, just wish they smiled a little more, to serious of an environment for me. Hardest part working for this company was the dress code, the way I dress is a way that I express myself! Costco always listened to ideas for the company from the employees! Costco was NOTHING BUT TEAM WORK!!!"
good,"I completely enjoy working at Costco. People are great, my manager is also a helpful and great person."
good,great short term place to work but as far as advancing unless you know someone in the company it is pretty hard to advance regardless of how hard you work.
good,Worked out with shopping carts. Very hard and the managers were mean.
good,The job was a very good job good paying but there was no advancement. I would prefer a job with more advancement and better managers and supervisors..
good,Only worked till Christmas season over doing maintenance of the store. Cleaning up spills and stacking goods back up. Helping up front as needed. Running machinery to clean
good,"Management at the Service Desk does not know what an industry standard is, how to schedule their desk, or care about work life balance if you don't have seniority within the company."
good,Be prepared for a lot of hard work and time management skills. Pressure filled atmosphere and everything is either organized or not. Good pay and benefits.
good,"At busy time, being short staff. Work can be hectic. Costco pays good pay and has good benefits. Hopefully they can have better programs for promotable employees. Have a better system at disciplinary process. Overall Costco is a good place for a starting job that can turn into a career but your job or title is never a guaranteed."
good,My warehouse manager  didn't like women in charge! And you had to be on the friends & family list to be a part of a promotion or upgrade with the company.
good,"Costco is Retail on Steroids or Speed. But it does pay 2-3-4 times better than most retailers.  It may not use one at their strengths but does overplay weaknesses and can be both physically difficult and mentally abusive at times.  Especially from their membership base. While most are good there is an element of abuse and belittling. If you have tough skin you may last and promote up. If you are kind, sensitive, dedicated, and have a good work ethic there will come points in every shift when you wished you worked somewhere else. l Its like an addiction where you earn a great wage but no guarantee of hours or work days or work life balance. You may never see your kids or family but you are able most times to earn more than anywhere else.  Its a trade off that most professionals wind up leaving for a benevolent more caring employer or burn out from sometimes through work related injuries (physical) or mental.  Its high stress and constant movement. No ADA assistance or accommodations at all. Great insurance if and when you get hurt and everyone gets hurt at some point.   Its all up to your stamina and durability.  Its napoleanic as in paperwork and not a place for creative people. If you can run with the herd, not get trampled, check your brain at the timeclock and thrive in chaos and rude behavior then this is the place for you.  If not then weigh the options."
good,"Pay is fine , a little Stressful,  fast pace .Management needs training. "
good,Manager wasent really a big coach My days felt like I had too stay looking for another job. From the first day I was supposed to be trained. Left me for 5 whole months without a trainer buddy. I knew what I had to do I just wasnt no veteran either
good,"It is a fun job, as long as you did not really talk to the customers. The position I held was not supposed to great or speak to the customers. I was told it was the cashiers job to great the customers in there line."
good,"Great benefits and salary, still feel underpaid for what I do but it’s well above what you hear other places pay. The way the warehouse is run, can remind you of elementary school. A lot of favoritism and brown nosing."
good,Working on multiple pc screens. Makes it easy to navigate and locate information for the members quickly. Team members are available on chat to assist each other daily.
good,"A typical day at work was cashiering, packing orders, interacting with customers and answering questions/solving issues. I learned teamwork, professionalism, customer service, time management and cash handling skills. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. Most enjoyable was most of my coworkers."
good,"- You stand and walk around most of your work day (other than on your lunch time obviously)"
good,Started off as a wonderful place to work. Business is steady for the most part. As you get to working there longer you realize it's like any other job. The people are like family.
good,"Low hours"
good,"Fast Paced , Young Management, no consistent time scheduling. Work environment can be stressful and Management can be intimidating.  Overall if you are willing to work hard you will do just fine."
good,"Costco is a fantastic company to be employed by, however, unless you have 10+ years, and are full time, you cant make a living working there. In order to move up in this company you have to be alright with being passed over even though you're the most qualified for the job. And hope, that maybe after 5 years, you finally get a chance to move up. But even then, don't hold your breath."
good,"fue mi primer empleo formal, el tiempo completo es excesivo y tiende a desgastar en un rango reducido de tiempo. lo que más me gustaba era entrar temprano y era nula la posibilidad de una retroalimentación de tu gerente por tu trabajo, el gerente general no saluda a los empleados en piso de venta, únicamente saluda empleadas."
good,"Short term seasonal position that was not continued after the Christmas rush.  Hours were inconsistent every week, but as a seasonal employee, I was to be the one to fill in during thin times during the week."
good,"Working at Costco Wholesale changed my life for the better during my time of working there. My job as a Cashier Assistant demanded me to provide hard and efficient labor throughout my hours, whether it was pushing carts all day or assisting cashiers. At first, it seemed like a piece of cake to push carts around all day, but then you realize they expect the most, if not every bit of effort you can give in cart pushing because even if it so little seems like your not giving it all you got, then its a problem and they will address it! My own personal experience with pushing carts religiously for a whole week was that I could barely drive home after work without my feet being in such pain from pushing the gas pedal that I kid you not would take turns using either foot just to use the gas, but what did I expect, this place is paying me $13 an hour, so I wasn't complaining. The Costco company is very keen in how you carry yourself as a person in the way you act and in how you appear yourself. Needless to say, if you don't act or look professional, then your most likely not going to make it that far. All the employees were very nice and polite in the workplace as if they were programmed robots, but knew when the appropriate time was to joke around and have fun which was how it was suppose to be considering managers were lurking around and studying your every move like hawks awaiting for they're prey to make one screw-up. From my own personal opinion, I feel as if the managers ignore the good in the employees like how well they work with others and how much effort they put in everyday"
good,show up and clean assigned department stock throughout shift if levels are low. Once closed then proceed to stock needed product and clean up trash left from stocking.
good,"i was only there for a seasonal position. The job was fast paced. In the bakery there is a high level of energy. There was room to advance only if other positions where available, which was not often."
good,I never enjoyed working there but many people love It! It does pay excellent and gives benefits which is great. The environment was not for me and I never became friends with anyone there which could have affected by liking to work there.
good,I met a lot of diverse groups of people and enjoyed sharing my interests with others as i enjoyed their interests as well. Greeting and meeting alot of people.
good,"The only way to move up is if you're LOVED by manageent. Excellent pay and a sunday bonus which few of the big retailers do. Overall, do NOT trust anyone as they're just trying to get promoted. "
good,"was a team leader then became manager ."
good,It was a fast paced position as a cashier assistant especially during the holidays. My job required a great deal of outdoor work during cold weather pushing the shopping carts. If you want to lose a few pounds this is an excellent way to do it!
good,"Was very petty and to many clicks going on like you scratch my back I will scratch yours atmosphere . Did not care if you had plans on your day off and was treated differently if you could not come in on your day off when asked to have a day off more often than not you wouldn't get it .   Things happened in your personal life  that you cannot see coming ,but they don't care."
good,"Costco is a great place to work for pay and benefits. Jobs can be extremely stressful, especially around the holidays. Customers are entitled and managers usually micromanage everything."
good,"Costco is a good company. Unfortunately some Costcos, like Baxter Costco, are ran differently than others. The warehouse manager makes up his own rules, and the management itself is very clicky, therefore making it difficult to be promoted. "
good,"Most days were great. Interaction with members and other employees was usually very positive."
good,"late and unfair shifts."
good,Calls. Assisting members selling Costco this is retail environment and have to be able to multi task at any given moment. You have to prioritize all the time.
good,I was only a seasonal employee and I was not pleased with the overall culture of the workplace and their hiring practices involved nepotism!
good,"Costco is a great place to work for someone that just likes a regular job, I am looking to building a career and I feel accomplished making people feel good and Im passionate about it/"
good,"good pay, great benefits, depending on your location it can be hard to get full time or move up in the company"
good,It was fun but don't know what else to say. I wish I could still work there but they had no opens after the holiday's. I was excited to work here after the season ended.
good,"everyday is a busy day, the members(customers) are not the difficult part.  Navigating your coworkers and multiple bosses make this a challenging place to work."
good,"I loved working here, but I wanted to pursue a degree and shift my skills toward a different direction.  Unfortunately, management was unwilling to negotiate with me time off for school, so I decided to leave.  I loved the people who I was working along side, I loved interacting with the people shopping."
good,This job sucked. The management was not on top of their stuff.
good,The company is great but the poor choice in management is what make the job more difficult. I have been there 13 years now and I absolutely love the company but if they hired or promoted people with at least an AS in business management or some type of management certification then maybe they would know how to treat their workers.
good,"I liked working at Costco. Its a fast pace environment where your always going to be busy. You have many opportunities to switch between departments and learn different job skill. You also have progressive annual raises depending on how many hours you work. The down side for me was the management. I did not have a good experience with my supervisors or managers. Often they don't communicate with each other and contradict each others orders. Often they tell us to not do certain things, example don't talk on the phone, or stand around looking bored, but they always set a bad example by doing what they told us not to do.The over-all job was good. management bad..."
good,"Good pay but they base your performance not on how much you sell but what items you sell "
good,"Every day was like the last, very fast and exciting. Costco would welcome thousands of guests daily and would bring positive energy every single day. The employees treated you with kindness and the management was serious about the business and made sure you was exceeding goals."
good,"Fast pace environment, friendly co-workers, and great teamwork. "
good,"Worked for Costco in the late 1990's and  on.It was different place. There was profit-sharing, company baseball, casino trips, etc.  Now, the pay isn't as competitive, it's VERY physically and emotionally demanding and VERY corporate. "
good,The job was very convenient and the pay was fairly nice . It can hold you back from other factor such as school or other jobs though because of the demanding hours
good,"people working around are generally nice and helpful, but pay and jo security is not that good. They generally hire part time and seasonal employees with little to no benefits for them."
good,Costco is a great place to work for. There are no set hours. Ive worked for the company since 2014 and still haven't received full time benefits yet. Laid back job though.
good,"It's not a bad place to work per se, it's as good as retail gets. With that being said, my store has the worst management I have ever seen in my 8 years of retail work. With the exception of a couple of sane managers, the entirety of upper management seems like a giant chest puffing contest to look good in front of corporate in hopes to be promoted. It's pathetic, really. They try to nit-pick and punish every little thing possible in order to bolster their 'accomplishments', when in actuality it just kills employee morale."
good,"The manager at my location was very uptight. He would constantly get after me for not being quick enough assisting at the cash register. The only problem is that he never let me work more in other responsibilities in my job to make up for my hardship at the register. I moved carts and restocked items during the day and after closing really well, but I  never seemed to get any credit for that. He only focused on the one thing that I was worse at."
good,the money was good. but the fact that work starts at 4 in the morning and the management is not flexible with situations such as parents having children. strong hierarchy between managers and workers.
good,Hours are great no chance of moving up at this location not enough appreciation for the workload that is handed to us no communication till it's to late all I all there is no planning wait till the last minute to make adjustments no help from upper management stand around with hands in there pockets complaining
good,"I enjoyed it for the most part but when i showed proficiency in sales i was pigeon holed , the better i did the more they expected the pressure was ultimately too much for me."
good,There’s a ridiculous amount of favoritism at this company to the point where they have amazing workers but will let them go because of their own personal agenda and it won’t make sense to anyone else. Physically this is a demanding job and you do not get paid enough for what you go through on a day to day basis. Costco is not the company it used to be and it’s not the company i thought it was to work for. Supervisors are just given positions even if they’re not qualified and they never get consequences for anything. I had a supervisor with a horrible temper due to home life and everyone refused to say anything about it to him. Honestly it was a waste of my time working so hard to get treated like i did.
good,Great pay but the people working there are very snobby and judgemental. There manangement are not understanding about personal issues and expect costco to come before anything in your life. If your not willing to put them first then bad place to work. Also they dont like outsiders. They are all dating or in some kind of relationship they appreciate the ones who work less and under appreciate the real hard workers
good,Varies from so slow that you will be wiping baseboards to so fast you get your lunch an hour late and have to change your undershirt. Good for people who are bored easily
good,A typical day is very structured when it doesn't spiral out of control.  The customer base can fluctuate very easily and some days can easily be seen as understaffed.  I have learned that hard work and effort with a positive mindset can get you through almost any situation.  The management started off very relaxed but stern and then shifted to a new almost perfect only effort required.  Everyone is very nice overall and many love to tell you their day to days.  The hardest part of the job is having to pick up the effort in the department for a team member that does not believe in going a certain pace or trying to extend their hours for their own benefit.  Its the biggest issue I have as I always skip my paid breaks to just get out at my scheduled time or as soon as possible after depending the night and amount of work that needs to be done.  The best part is the time and a half pay that is every Sunday unless its a holiday which is also nice as most major holidays give the entire store a paid day off.
good,"Costco is amongst the tops for pays and has some of the best benefits packages out there.  They definitely promote from within for the warehouse and most of the ancillary departments.  People stay there for their entire working careers, and for good reason."
good,"the job was not the problem it was the management"
good,"Steady job, good benefits, Kind co-worker, It was my first job in Canada and it was so convenient  for me. I am grateful for this opportunity and the treatment I received"
good,"My payment check was botched by my manager who reported less  hrs. and I had to have a video review to proof my actual number of hours at work.  He ignored employee misconduct around food as it was being eaten by his appointed employee in-charge in his absence.  That employee was also very callous, uneducated, unnecessarily loud and untactful."
good,"great place if you just want to clock in, not receive praise when its due, clock out and be done. supervisors in roles that have no justification, unfairness with how certain people are treated, obvious favoritism"
good,Overall Costco is a good business to work for.  There are many different areas of the warehouse that an employee can train in and they offer advancement opportunities.
good,Pay and benefits are very competitive so it’s easy to get stuck at Costco. The management at my building is the worst I’ve seen in 17 years. They only care about themselves and their own career advancement.
good,"Biggest thing about working for Costco, is it depends on the region,. The store location I worked at hired very young students, and the management treated them poorly. Girls and boys were disciplined if they were even seen speaking to one another. FORMALLY disciplined. Not violating any policies and still written up for simply talking to the coworker while you were working the same till or passing by one another in the aisle. "
good,I enjoyed the work because I enjoyed the work but as a manager you are required to work a lot.  But I like working on cars so it was ok for me.  Went through a lot of employee's because its hard work.
good,Kind of leaves you empty if you don't have ways to escape. Retail is not for everyone. But if you are looking for security and a chance to move up with hard work and alot of time Costco is a great place for you
good,"I started out at Costco as a part-time Foodservice Worker. It was a very intense position physically. It built a lot of character and determination within me. Six months after being in this position their was opportunity to apply for other departments in which I took advantage of. I applied for a full-time position and was promoted to being a Front in Assistant. Six months after being an assistant I applied for a Cashier position which would also be another promotion and was grated this position in which I am now in. "
good,"It was great in the beginning but it felt a little like competition constantly. Not just working with the other employees, but the customers as well were always such in a hurry, not very considerate and just overall not the best experience. They do pay well, for it being the seasonal job it was. But, in the end, I probably would never try to work there again."
good,"Loved getting to meet different families and members that came into the store.  Helping members if they needed assistance finding something. Never pointed a member at a location where the iteam they are looking for is at. Jack one of the store managers is rude, he can talk to you as if you are nobody important and didnt not like being told no when he would ask if you could work overtime."
good,Great Company.  Some people in upper management do not conduct business with transparency and in an ethical manner.  Mid level management will not have a consistent schedule.
good,Little hours need more money to provide don’t see my self growing here . Distance is too far for the hours I work I probably waste more gas than what I make every two weeks .
good,"You earn raises by how many hours you work,  more hours worked, the more often you get raises, up to $22 an hour usually."
good,The job was stressful at times because it was really hot and pushing carts up a hill. but for the most part it was okay the workers there were really nice.
good,"I was hired as a contact center agent under a seasonal contract. The management and other team members told us (about 40 got hired around the same time) to not worry and we would most likely to get our contracts extended. Time passed, and after the holiday season passed, we were all told our contracts would not be extended, which was a let down after others told us not to worry. I don't have a problem with a seasonal contract ending, just don't give the false hope."
good,I never got a full time pay check even after working almost two years. I worked in the bakery. I would have to clean all dish a mop floors all by myself. It’s very intimidating. Great atmosphere to work in. Tougher job in some positions.
good,This was a great job until the end. I liked the fast pace. The benefits were excellent . My original manager was excellent. They unfortunately didn't properly investigate an incident and terminated me for it.
good,"The typical day at Costco Wholesale is fast-paced customer centered service that requires any employee to be relatively competent in interpersonal communication and time-management. Costco Wholesale offers the opportunity for individuals to understand the ground game that is required for retail operations to succeed and develop their own customer service skills. "
good,"A new career with limited advancement potential has me looking for other more productive, satisfying employment. The workforce in my current position consists of many younger employees who lack the drive and and team atmosphere that I prefer and are not held accountable by managers to be productive. In this type of environment, those of us who are productive and have a more developed sense of responsibility and accountability work harder than necessary to pick up the pieces and ensure the job gets done well."
good,"Large corporations loose sight with their employees easily.The over time available is nice when the pay checks come in , however they work you hard. Have to be willing to sweat with a smile."
good,Nice environment great work place enjoy meeting and working with others very well place assistant others some days the store is busy mostly Friday but it get hectic some days but very good place to work
good,"I started working at Costco when I was 18 and it is labor intensive for the majority of the job titles they offer. I worked as a Front End Assistant as well as a Meat Clerk. Both were labor intense especially the meat department. Any ancillary department will be very stressful physically and mentally. As long as the rules are followed, Costco is a great way for young adults to learn discipline and what it means to work. Management varies from warehouse to warehouse."
good,A typical work day would be fast and you would have to adapt to customers needs all the time. Extremely busy during the holidays. Management was helpful to all employees most of the time.
good,"Most employees do not have a life outside of Costco. Do NOT work there if you are a student, they give no time for homework or studying. You can close one day off at 11pm and open the next only 8 hours later."
good,"Definitely one of the better corporations to work lots of room for advancement.  Was not a huge fan of two managers, but the other managers were awesome."
good,"I managed at least 50 employees per day, ran the flow of business and had to make judgment calls and adjustments to accomodate the needs of the business. Management put a lot of pressure to meet or exceed standards and goals between warehouse competition. Very stressful environment and member service is the number one goal. Hardest part of this job was lack of positive re-enforcement and lack of value out of your work."
good,It was an over all okay place to work. The work was fine it was not anything that was to hard to handle. They only thing i did not like was the fact that they did not relocate the employees if their was any difficulties.
good,"It was a good starting job, the work gets monotonous. Benefits are nice but recent changes in management have made it harder to advance in company. You must be flexible with the type of job you do"
good,I loved working for Costco. I advanced three positions within my probation period. At the end of my probation period I was offered a supervisor position that I accepted. I was then fired by an over zealous supervisor who was harassing me with phone calls when I called out for a shift because I was with my new born son in the NICU. She lacked empathy or compassion because she believed my job should come before my family.
good,typical day at work was just always making sure to have store neat and clean for members who will be shopping in the store that day.stocking shelves and cleaning restrooms was what we had to do on a day to day base.
good,"Costco is a very physical job. I actually don't mind the physical jobs as most of my jobs have been very physical. The managers can tend to pick favorites, but other then that it's not that bad."
good,"I've worked at Costco for 2 years. Definitely not my favorite job ever, but they pay well and if you have good co-workers, it is bearable. It is highly competitive in regards to moving up in the company, and the corporate rules are strict and ever changing, but the pay is nice so the employees put up with it."
good,"Everyone knows the benefits here are great and they're not wrong. The other employees are generally super nice, hardworking, and fun (most of the time). Some management is cool but some of it just makes you feel suffocated. There's an endless list of rules and no two people will tell you the same thing. You get plenty of breaks but sometimes I felt as though a lot was expected of me but I was not treated as important as they made my job seem."
good,Great experience for multi tasking. Work environment is awfully inbred. Room for advancement. Great benefits. Opportunity for advancement relocation. Free membership.
good,"The place is a great place to work if you are willing to put in the hours and years. However, if you don't wish to climb the ladder then its also a good place for an entry part time."
good,Busy and challenging meet and talk to a lot of people.  Customer Service is a plus when dealing with the public. I learned a lot of new skills and boundaries working at Costco.
good,"uploading and packing groceries, cash duties.  many unusal hours of work.  cleaning, tiding warehouse, very low pay, have to work weekends and evenings."
good,Everyone tries to help one another. Somewhat flexible hours. Everything goes by seniority there. Management would panic easily under pressure. Days off request are a little difficult to fill out
good,I enjoy working for costco but the lack of hours and lack of benefits are exactly why I am looking elsewhere. This job can be fun and if you can't make it to work they are very understanding. I would rate this 7/10.
good,Inside work. Presenting product samples to customers. I learned product presentation. Good co-workers. Decent management. Dealing with customers was hardest part. Most enjoyable part was the presentation of products.
good,I have to much fun this job and work all employee work  together help Each other no separation. To work and my manager is nice women
good,Extremely  busy environment.  Co-workers are friendly.  Management supports staff.  Communication could improve in regards to management roles and  job functions within the warehouse.
good,"Store Executive Managers do not care about their employees.  They are all concerned with bottom line.  The supervisors are generally great and make sure that everyone gets their breaks and lunches on time.  The pay and benefits are fabulous, but the scruples of management and the rules for some departments (optical) are in direct violation of state laws in Calif."
good,"My day started off with preparing the front end of the warehouse, by cleaning, counting money for tills and just the over prepare for members"
good,"Great environment, Continuously moving and learning new aspects. I enjoyed the people I worked with but they hours were not optimal. Also there is minimal opportunity for advancement even with a college degree"
good,"Being a flower vendor at costco is one of the best jobs to have. I get to mingle with everyone. I have a lot of freedom with my schedule. But on the other hand, unless I hire out it is a 7 day a week job."
good,A typical day involves sorting costumers items into boxes and maintain a clean working area. I learned that not all customers are the same and that I must be efficient with my time. The management team was supportive of my working skill when working busy hours. The co-workers were extremely friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude costumers. The most enjoyable part of my job were the co-workers and unique costumers.
good,"The only bad thing I can honestly say about costco is the fact that this was only a temporary position for me. I loved the work enviroment the pay rate started at 12 dollars an hour which was great! the compensation met the responsibility and the work load. costco is a great place to work, I just wished they called me back after the season for a permanent position."
good,I learned a lot working here. Also gained a lot of work experience. I started in the front end pulling carts and ended in the meat department as a wrapper.
good,"A typical day involve loading ten to twelve trucks. That was stage to go the airport for shipping before twelve o'clock at night. After loading those trucks, had to stage and prep the next trucks for day runs to local destinations. This was a 2 person operation in my co worker was a great person to work with."
good,Its a place where you work really hard to get good pay. nothing is easy and it is very demanding at times
good,"Always busy, all different kinds of clients, you need excellent customer service skills. I enjoyed the fast pace and meeting new people every day. the hardest part of the was standing on concrete for eight hours, and heavy lifting"
good,this job gave me the opportunity to meet people from different cultures which made me gain more experience in understanding others
good,"One of the best jobs that I've ever had , the people are what make that place a great success."
good,"Most managers maintain distance with the employees, they have the potential to foster growth and skills within their subordinates. Employees are selected seasonally and top performers remain within the company. Most daily tasks must be executed with a sense of urgency and must also remain vigilant in providing excellent customer service. I learned the business aspect and company social responsibility. Co-workers foster a great environment, which takes other away from stressful endeavors. The biggest difficulties experienced was time constraints, as there is a lot of work that needed to be done in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience that I provided with customers."
good,love it but the travel is extreme and am looking to replace it
good,A typical day at work would be mounting and balancing tires in a very fast paced stressful enviorment. I learned how to manage people and workflow to optimize efficeincy. The hardest part of the job was telling the members they could not get a warranty for whatever the reason was. I enjoyed working on cars and managing co workers.
good,Costco has a good pay and benefits but you have to deal with a lot..
good,"I suppose the work environment is all dependent on the particular Costco that you are applying to, but my experience at Costco Wholesale has gone quite well. "
good,"Costco pays great but Like every retail company, you have long hours and very busy shopping days. Had to have a set schedule because retail is very fast moving. Costco is a great company."
good,"fast pace. A good place to work if you are full time if you are hired on as seasonal you will work 40 hours, even though the job is part-time. a good place you never know what you will work on through out the day"
good,"I liked working at Costco however some of the management is not supportive or helpful. They tend to pick favourites and stick to them. They back their members more than their staff. If you have a dispute with a member even as much as that member calling you a racist for during your job, management will side with the member. There is maybe 2 managers that will have your back and maybe 3 supervisors"
good,"Fast pace work environment with supervision, full time positions are offered once recognize for work ethic. Opportunity for growth and working in different departments are offered."
good,"This is a great company. The one bad part is that they require you to work every weekend. That sucks, some of us have lives outside of work. They also are very slow at letting you move up in any way"
good,"Costco was a good work experience and had great benefits, but is difficult to support a family on part-time hours. New manager came into my warehouse and cut all part-time employees hours back to 26 to 30 hours a week. This made meeting financial obligations difficult."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Costco, would work there again. maybe in a different location. when i had issues with a manager i felt like nothing was done to fix the problem."
good,Good company overall. People are great and helpful. The work always changes so you dont get bored. The benefits are amazing and stock options are always a plus.
good,As a stocker Ive learned to fold clothes as their code.
good,Good team ethos with great discount for staff. Good place to make friends and suitable for younger people to work. The hours can be unsociable but rewarding
good,It is really quite fun and sociable but also quite stressful if personalities clash. Constantly being pulled from your department to help in the food court or front end.
good,start at part time. hard to get full time which is 38 hours per week. hours and days of your work shift vary on a weekly basis. friendly employees. not enough employees during shift to get proper work done.
good,"A typical work day began with clocking and counting down your register to make sure that the person before counted correctly. Opened up the lane and began ringing members up generally quite busy. Generally for 8 hour shifts we received two 15 minute breaks which were included and a 30 minute lunch break that was not included. Occasionally we were asked to put items that had been returned back in their places and occasionally help members who needed assistance. If at the cashier position at the end of the day one would conduct a count down and deposit the money earned in a machine. Management generally was there to help with problems that may arise and told others where they should be during the shift as well as control break times. Learned multiple things mainly how to work with others as well as deal with difficult members and sometimes upper management. The most difficult part of the job was long hours, heavy lifting and an inconstant schedule. The most enjoyable part was interacting with members and coworkers from all over."
good,"There is always a negative social aspect to retail stores, but this is the best retail store to settle on. If you're going to make yourself be a retail person, Costco is the way to go."
good,"Pros: -Opportunity for job advancement "
good,"Buggy lot duty"
good,it is an exciting and very quick paced job. It can also be a bit challenging as well. It helps you multitask and teaches you how to deal with clients.
good,They are positive people. They will help with almost any problems you have. Job related tasks are simple but not easy. Maintain a positive attitude. The food is great .
good,"Great Pay and Benefits "
good,It was a good place to work just very crowded. The hustle and bustle of Costco mixed with the overwhelming amount of people crammed into a small area has a large amount stress on customers which make them extremely irritable and in bad moods towards employees so that is one of the hardest things about working there.
good,Many positives about this Company. Benefits are unmatched and pay is good. Many locations help with those seeking a variety of experiences and areas of the country to work from.
good,Working at Costco was a great experience I learned a lot and was able to cross train in different departments. I like the flexibility and atmosphere of the job.
good,workplace culture is number one. Great place to work. must be a people person. very fast paced retail job that comes with great benefits. pays well and you can go from a regular employee to management with a great work ethic.
good,"I worked in the morning crew, so I arrived at 4 AM five times a week, but very much enjoyed my co-workers. Time management was key in ensuring the store was stocked and ready for opening. The environment was enjoyable as long as you got your work done."
good,"Everyone starts off pt, all ft positions are based on seniority it can take forever to land ft."
good,Nice place to work. Fast pace. Great co-workers who were helpful if needed. lunchtime and breaks were all reasonable. Training for the position hired was good.
good,"Fast paced environment. Very flexible hours but inconsistent at times. Everything goes by seniority. It can be very completive place to work sometimes when you are trying to move up, apply for a new department or get more hours when everything goes by seniority."
good,"Costco is one of the leading grocery chains alive today with many opportunities to learn from a ton of great people. It is very fast-paced and you are ""watched"" by every member of management. The workplace culture is quite fun and friendly, but the scrutiny and rigidity in your position is the greatest group of cons for most jobs there. Once you get into a position, you are practically stuck in that tier of employment unless a miracle dawns on you or you stick around for well over 5-7 years. The best part of the job was definitely the multitude of exceptionally charismatic people to work with."
good,Good company to work for. Fast paced environment. The longer you stay the better your handed of being promoted. Managers and staff are responsive and supportive.
good,Great place to work for. If you're a student Costco has a great student retention program. Most students stays with Costco after graduation. Some nepotism but new warehouse manager is working on regulating that issue.
good,"I worked as a seasonal employee and I work in the bakery, pushing carts, being a cashier's assistant and I work in the deli. I'm sure it was a good job but I was not a good fit for me."
good,There were many complaints about the seniority and how new employees were getting better hours  made new employees feel miserable. Managers joined together and didn’t really assist
good,For the most part everyone at costco liked working hard and wouldn't slack of and its nice to know that the people you are working with are putting in the same amount of effort as you
good,I only worked for Costco for a few months due to family obligations. My short time there was pleasant and enjoyable. The management there was great and offered support and help when needed.
good,The interview process is easy. My advice get in during the holidays. Bust your butt and we will keep you. My experience with upper management was were I had difficulties. I had to direct managers that couldn't run the bakery when I wasn't there. I had to step down to work closer to home. Work life balance was out of wack.
good,Awesome place to work at. Everyone is friendly to work with. Management are always busy but always make time for your needs. Very fast paced and can be challenging.
good,Costco is a fun place to work with a great culture.  They take care of their employees with pay and benefits.  The hours and schedules are difficult for someone with a family.
good,"its costco. general retail job but working in the bakery there was less customer interaction which was nice. benefits were good, pay was good, coworkers were nice"
good,"I was a sales rep so I wasn't technically working for Costco but it was fine except when we were talked to by Costco managers. Other than that, It was easy to work with customers."
good,"My day starts off with clocking in, and heading to my manager to find out what section I am in for the day. I usually help clean up the aisle and we make them look more presentable for the day. After closing time, we stock and refill on the products."
good,Es verdad que pagan muy bien y tiene un ambiente de trabajo agradable pero en mi experiencia se da mucho la preferencia a ciertas personas o ciertas áreas de trabajo en dónde hasta les pagan más realizando casi las mismas actividades.
good,Costco Wholesale is very organized and collaborative in every department. The company is very competitive in their field and in turn ask it's employees to be the same.
good,"I only worked Christmas rush, "
good,Strenuous work however it was great to stay in shape. As long as you worked hard and did not complain about anything being too heavy management was quite good.
good,Great company to work for. After working there for a few years it was still difficult to get regular shift every week. The more seniority you have the more likely you are to get the exact schedule you want.
good,"Good salary, great benefits, nice atmosphere to work in, never a day that I don't want to go to work! Being a small team means that each person must take on a certain amount of resposibility for their own work, and with that comes pride of ones own work."
good,Costco is a great work place that values their employees and pays well. A good first job. The other staff are friendly and their open door policy is appreciated.
good,"My experience working at Costco was a learning experience dealing with different customers and different situations and how handle them. Would recommend to work there, its just hours are sometimes random."
good,Mientras trabaje como auxiliar en centro llantero tuve un excelente experiencia con mis compañeros de equipo ya que sabíamos despeñarnos en conjunto para mejorar el trabajo
good,"Stock Inventories"
good,Nothing compares if you are working in retail. No one even comes close. The pay is great which makes it difficult to leave if you want to branch out of the retail world.
good,An excellent place to work with really good benefits. Upper management was fair and good to get along with pretty much all situations. I really enjoyed my time there.
good,"The scheduler does not listen to any requests at all, seniority isn't a thing unless you've been working there for decades. Management doesn't listen to your complaints. Tukwila Costco really needs an improvement. They don't care about their employees as well as they say they do."
good,"Great Pay and Benefits.  Management could be better.  Over the three years I have worked at this company, it seems as though the management has slowly gotten worse."
good,"I learned a lot about merchandising in terms of flow, management. I also got a good taste for learning their systems. Got to work all over the warehouse. I would recoomend this company to any who are interested. When I left, I wanted to expand my skill set and pursue other opportunities."
good,"The management is very incompetent,and just delegates,a the culture has changed markedly over the years, positions are not filled upon merit, rather through friends, spouses,nepotism and the like.the people who are  honest hard working and have integrity,just are in a sense punished and have more work and responsibilities delegated to them and they are held to different standards of accountability.when speaking to the vice President of the southeast region which I have not met ,made a despariging remark about my character obviously malicious gossip he heard from someone, you would think that someone in that position would be more professional to say the least....to say the"
good,Demasiada exigencia física pero por un buen sueldo y prestaciones
good,"Great money, bad people, a lot of work. No room for time off or flexible schedule. When you're new or seasonal they don't even treat you like a person, but that could totally just be the location I was at."
good,"I had the opportunity to work at every department (inside and out of the buiding) aside from bakery and food court. The people I worked with were relatively friendly. I did the work required of me and was actually offered a supervisory position a number of times, which I turned down because the job was seasonal and temporary because I'd only intended to work there until I graduated college."
good,"I spent the time at costco as a seasonal worker with a potential chance of getting a full or part-time job after. After grinding for the 3 months I worked there with no problems and only good feedback from my customers and area of sales, I was given my laid off meeting where they told me I was inadequate for the work and wasn't keeping up with their standards when I was the only one running back and forth to assist customers. None the less I had a good experience with them overall other then that experience. They told me I could come back next season but I decided to pursue my education full time."
good,Sometimes whenever there are big heavy items you really need to be cautious. They show you how to lift but they also don't show you how to actually push carts and it leaves some employees with back pain. Managers can very unapproachable and expect you to be perfect. Other than that I think Costco is a great place to work out of 5 different jobs I've worked for before.
good,I enjoyed working at costco for the most part at that time in my life. I would not want to work for costco in the same way again. I think costco is a great company and if they had the career opportunity I wanted I might consider.
good,Costco is a great company to work for but the biggest issue was managers playing favorites and the consistent amount of pushing to be the fastest cashier.
good,"Costco was and still is a great first job you can get: great pay, benefits, nothing too demanding, and depending on your manager and team, a fun place to work."
good,"it was cool for the time being, great benefits and hours. a typical day goes by pretty fast due to the fast pace in the building. Management is cool just stay within the guidelines."
good,"a productive and fun workplace which had friendly coworkers who were always ready to help, teach and promote employee well being and integration. Would recommend it to anyone"
good,The job is great. The only downside to it was the amount of customers you had to deal with. Management was okay but you had to wait a really long time to move up to another position.
good,People on top of people I get it it's box retail people need things but wow members co workers Supervisors management gm ceo driving that corporate system train the locomotive that spins in life it is what it is better could be in all phases of life.
good,"Typical day at work was average. Consisted of busy work and repetitive tasks, but non of it was hard. Training lacked in many aspects and management was often hard to seek if you needed assistance. Most enjoyable part of the job was fellow employees."
good,Very busy place with so many members in store. The coworkers around you help to make it through the hectic days. Typically 2 coffee breaks and 1 30min lunch break for a normal 8hr shift.
good,"It was food prep all day, every day. It was non stop fast paced service. Around non cooked and cooked products. Cleanliness is a must. Work in and out of refrigeration."
good,"People are fun to work with, with plenty of work to do, always keeping you busy. Managers of the front end are respectable and knowledgeable about the company"
good,"Great coworkers and environment"
good,"Boxing items, bringing in shopping carts and cleaning, with Costco and the amount of thru traffic there is always something or someone to keep you busy"
good,"Everything is great except for the time. May be it's just me, but I like to work the same time period everyday. I don't like it when one day I have to work morning then night time the next."
good,"aprendi hacer Quality control, una muy buena empresa"
good,There isnt much of a review. It was a good place to work. To be perfectly honest. Im trying to get another job right now. Im broke and times are tough for me. No disrespect but I dont see how writing a review for costco has anything to do with my job searching
good,"Good job for the most part, very busy and action packed. Working weekends and  during the holidays gets old and as with any corporate retail giant, we are all replaceable as soon as tomorrow."
good,"hard work, fast paced, learn good work ethic. managers are willing to work around personal problems. Team work makes the dream work here. co-workers make the job a little more bearable"
good,the best people you could think of work here. management gets a little confused sometimes but it happens to everyone. lots of opportunities to learn new skills and advance within the company.
good,"It was a fine job, it paid well and I have no issues with anyone who worked there. Overall it was very enjoyable time, and my coworkers were always nice."
good,"good vacation after few years service, good bonus. nothing else really to say good or bad about it. this should have nothing to do with a current job??"
good,"Entreprise avec beaucoup de potentiel, mais la gestion reste à désiré"
good,"Great job with good pay, but no advancement unless you put many years of work in. Because we live in a small town it’s almost impossible to get into Costco and staying in is also a challenge."
good,"Very stressful job that demanded a lot of patience. "
good,"In this workplace you are always moving, however, this movement allows you to always ensure you are contributing to the impact of the team. Alongside this Members are often polite and respectful when interacting with employees"
good,Good company. It had a good work culture and people caring company. It had excellent recruitment process and was a fair organization for workers and I learned a lot during my work there.
good,"I love Costco as an employee so I see the value firsthand that it brings to its' members. Customer Service is the most important thing we believe in, and employee benefits are hard to pass up as well. Having time and a half on Sundays and holidays was a great way to motivate employees to work hard around the clock. I have immense love for this company, but there is a huge difference when management can't function it its' full potential. Be careful which warehouse you apply for as you will notice favoritism especially with the employees who have been there the longest."
good,"Costco needs attention in the management staff. There are many flaws in this area where it requires serious attention to address performance and authority balancing. Management is limited to the GM decision making for all areas and issues that arise at any given time. Not enough employee development, training and concerns in coaching, promotions and job skill requirements. Job experience and placement assessments to allow employees to succeed in expertise or demonstrated qualities."
good,"Most people who work there are fun & enjoy their jobs.  Others are judgemental and homophobic.  You don't always get to choose who you work with . . . "
good,i not cut out for the harshness of costco. i also think its stupid that i have to do a review and i dont have time for this. if i wanted to talk about costco i would have stayed working there.
good,Work schedule was set and rarely changed which was really convenient. Really great place to have as a first job to develop skills. Fun young environment to be around.
good,Great place to work for pay and benefits. Pay increases set at amount of hours worked. Time and a half on Sundays. Quick paced work environment. Some flexibility in schedule.
good,"Love the company! But working with a couple of bad apples for management. They never tell you, you’ve did a good job for the shift you worked. Always hanging out with each other in there own little click. And there big on micromanageing"
good,"the job itself and the people you work with make it a super place to work. like in every job, its not all rainbows. management was not properly trained due to the fact that advancement was sometimes decided based on favoritism and not because of the actual work you put in. besides that i loved working there for 3 years, good energy and a united team."
good,typical work day at the Costco location i work at is pretty busy and chaotic. we are one of the busiest locations in north america and therefore the work pace is very fast and it can get pretty stressful but the benefits and starting salary is fair.
good,My Co-workers were great but the management was just inconsistent and constantly changing. Too many chiefs and not enough (well you know the saying)  But overall the most I liked about the job was the friendly customers that I was able to service and visit with week after week. Good Company and I do miss my co-workers.
good,"You can apply for different jobs in the warehouse and overtime work and become a supervisor or manager. The pay rate increases overtime and you receive a yearly bonus of £4,000 each year."
good,Costco is very different from other jobs in the idea of making sure there is a conductive team experience and working efficiently within a role. Costco also is a great place to move up and pursue career advancement in multiple departments.
good,"I was a dependable, hard worker and valuable worker. The management team was very helpful, Fun and family orientated company, "
good,The warehouses are very cliquy and rules between two people are never the same. You in one day can be told 10 different things by various supervisors and managers and all of them can swear they are de facto. Besides this it is a simple job.
good,Great people and company to work for. Nothing unexpected will happen in an average work day however my department (special Orders) is very monotonous unfortunately.
good,"Typical day running the hearing aid center involves testing hearing, selling and fitting hearing aids. The problem is you're in thrall to people who don't know your industry. In the end, for most dispensers, the struggle is interfacing with Costco Corporate, not with the fitting and dispensing of hearing aids."
good,The non management people work very hard. Do a great job and are very good at what they do. Poor upper management.  I was on 90 day probation. Came in when called to work and my supervisor was very happy with my work. My manager would kept telling me to work faster and never gave me the tools to succeed at Costco. Got me fired for something she asked me to do then blamed me for not finishing the task after pulling me off of the task
good,"Working at the rotisserie chicken area is pretty hard to be honest, get ready for labor. Management was pretty cool, co-workers are friendly but it still has a little bit of favoritism going on in there."
good,"Working at Costco Wholesale is a very engaging, comfortable and friendly place to go work at. Every day is a new experience with plenty of obstacles to overcome and solve especially when working during the morning before the warehouse opens to the public."
good,Hard to say much as I was a part time working. The management would not allow you to get 40 hours a week if you were part time to avoid having to pay for your benefits.
good,"Costco is a good company to work for because of good benefits, fair pay, and mostly great people to work with."
good,Costco was a good company good pay good hours and benefits friendly environment helping managers and associate good customers no holidays and good bonuses pay.
good,"it is a great place to work that ensures that you have benefits of the help you need. the members are a little much but you learn to roll with it, a great place to work during school"
good,"Es el único trabajo que he tenido, pero aprendí lo mas importante para un ser humano y son los valores y el servicio."
good,Costco is an ideal company to work for for young individuals and most individuals. My role was more tailored to men. As men are usually more apt to lift heavy loads required to stock the shelves and reach high into the rafters. Pay is good enough to make a decent chunk of change. Also if you would like to stick long term with a company and are ready to make that kind of commitment in ones life. I think Costco is just the place to make that commitment. Friendly and like minded staff make it an enjoyable team atmosphere to work in where your coworkers support you to get the job done in the store and off work life also.
good,"Learned many skills in customer service. Typical day included greeting customers as they entered store, cashier, stocker, and customer service. Great people to work with and good management."
good,"Day shift job consisted of customer service, food prep, baking, wrapping product and placing product on shelves for sale. Evening shift consisted of customer service, wrapping product and cleanup.  I thoroughly enjoyed working with my coworkers and customers. "
good,"Costco has a great team of people working for them.. lots of room for growth in the company, excellent benefits. Fast paced environment, lots of heavy lifting."
good,"Working for Costco is very competitive. Almost every position begins during seasonal work. They will hire 80ish seasonal workers and only keep 3-4 if that. You have to work your butt off, but if you're kept its worth it. The benefits are amazing and you can make a career out of that job."
good,"They were decent to begin with, then management shifted and then became more laxadazy. the hardest part is dealing with the members because some can get really angry."
good,Great  to work for. Excellent for training in skills to take with you. Good benefits. 401k matching.  Opportunity for advancement  however it is a warehouse and does tend to have a big box feel.
good,in muy buen lugar para trabajar cuando eres estudiante
good,"It was a good temporary job while in college! They worked with my schedule whenever they could. My manager was amazing. The HR department was also amazing, very great place to work."
good,"Great place to work if you have been there for 20+ years. Management is constantly changing, they often play favorites and it can be difficult to advance. Can be a fun workplace, but they often change the rules depending on the warehouse manager."
good,Did not enjoy working here not my fortay but the managers did care and the communication was decent here. I did enjoy being out on the floor and working with others.
good,It's a fun place to work at. Colleagues are fun and gain friendships within. Overall the environment is quick-paced but there is no advancement in the company.
good,Costco is a great place to work for the rate of pay. Many opportunities available for career advancement or just to learn different aspects of the business.
good,"Great experience overall, typical day at Costco Whole Sale was very busy and stressful due to the lack of organization by Management despite the hard work of the GM. The work place culture is like that of family and staff often works well together. The hardest part of the job is getting sufficient amounts of breaks and the fact that any company only give you an half hour to partake in lunch and reboot is inhuman and does not contribute to improved work performance. Otherwise on a scale of 1-5 rating I give Costco a 3.5"
good,"If you're good worker, you will be recognized. However, if you're not in with the ""In"" crowd you will not be given potential growth opportunities....."
good,good place to work.  value emplyees.  I would do it again if the burnout from pharmacy had not occurred.  recommend to everyone.  or anyone.  give it a try.
good,Good temporary job for younger people looking for more than minimum wage. No advancments unless you go to school or work there several years... Good for retired workers looking for a job as well.
good,"Could have decided to stay longer , but the time I was there was a very good idea for myself and I learn a lot about working with different type of people"
good,"filled prescriptions, checked prescription,dr calls,supervise techs, helped to maintain inventory. Department worked well together. Our manager ran the pharmacy well,"
good,"It is a fast paced environment with hard physical labor. Huge corporation that promotes from within. Not enough hours in the day to get the job done, which puts a lot of stress on the laborers. If you excel at pushing yourself, this is the job for you."
good,"Overall solid job. Managers are usually fine. The aspect of teamwork does create a degree of solidarity among co-workers. For a student, the hours are very flexible to allow one to maintain their studies."
good,"They take good care of employees, and have great benefits, but be prepared to work. Also, they are strict on being on time. Very customer service oriented."
good,working whole day is fine as they pay better than other retail pharmacy with proper breaks and good benefits coverage include dental and optical. Some politics due to manager being biased
good,"My coworkers were kind and thoughtful were quick to assist you if you had any problems or you requested assistance, it was a very likeable and pleasurable  environment ."
good,Très bonne compagnie avec de bons avantages. J'ai apprécié travailler pour Costco Wholesale.
good,"Great job to grow into new opportunities and developing yourself. Must be self-disciplined to really excel, as with any job. Very formidable times and competitive pay."
good,"Costco is a good place to work.  They look after the staff and try and accommodate them where possible."
good,"From the get go on the job it was very fast paced and you were expected to keep up with all experienced employees and go above and beyond. There were 2 separate 15 minute breaks throughout the 10 hour shifts. During my time working here I never saw one moment of downtime, there was always something to be done. Packages were heavy overtime and the warehouse was the temperature of a freezer. The conveyor belts move very fast and everyone in the warehouse moved at the fastest humanly possible speed to reach our quotas/goals for each day. Hours were not good, but the pay was good. I was hired on to this job through a temp agency and worked through weekly to monthly contracts on and off for around a year. Overall this job is good for people are used to the work speed and environment and are a very quick study."
good,"Other than my direct manager, Working at Costco was great. I met a lot of good people and the environment was good as well. My direct manager showed me how to manually clock in. I did it one day and got in trouble for it."
good,"Great place to work--if the manager likes you. Looks down on you if you aren't a favorite or a friend of someone.  Helps to be a fake, bubbly,  suck up,  20 year old, laughing and flirting, with no job ethics."
good,"-Full, hot lunch meals for $4 or $5. "
good,"There were a few managers there that were awesome and really cared.  But in the end there were 3 of them that constantly instigated and fueled problems between employees in such a underhanded way it was really hard to expose them. One of them was fired shortly after I left, but the worst one was upper management and regional thinks he's great, but really he is very hurtful to the moral of the entire store. Some of the numbers and results may look good but it is NOT due to him but due to the few good lower management and some very dedicated employees. I promoted quickly and had some of the best numbers seen at membership, but I struggled with learning my promotion and instead of becoming teachers like my first manager, two of them began to get me for every tiny little thing, sending me home crying for mistakes other's (favorites) were making as well and even more so. Very sad situation for me because I truly loved the company and the job."
good,"Good Place to work. Consist of greeting customers and ringing up purchases. Other duties include stocking products, answering phones, and completing other administrative requirements."
good,"They will get their money's worth out of you in a typical day at work"
good,"Received hardly any training lost my job in three months after the Christmas rush. Was bullied by a vile womanising old dirty man, tried to move departments but couldn’t to get away from him."
good,"Its a place where you work really hard for a good pay, gave me a lot of experience in different areas of the store. Great people."
good,"Poor management styles. Broken promises and no real opportunities for advancement. Started everyone at full time and then slowly dropped everyone to part  time, not cool."
good,"This was my first job, I was very excited to work! the work was very manageable and fairly easy, I enjoyed helping customers and assisting with there needs. I learned a good amount of knowledge from working here. Never had any complications, my co workers, and supervisors really helped with any questions that I had. Working there has molded me into a hard worker."
good,I have not met a single coworker that was difficult to work with.  Management is willing to work with your scheduling needs.  I recommend trying them out for a season to start.
good,"Seasonal Job- It was a really good experience. "
good,"This company awards loyalty, hard work and seniority. Good benefits, decent pay, and good management. Hours are not ideal as all day shifts are given to those with seniority."
good,Fast pace job that teaches a lot about how meat products are made and sold. The management is a little unorganized. The hardest part of the job is working in the freezer areas. The enjoyable part is down sizing boxes.
good,Bonne ambiance de travail entre les collèges de travail.
good,Great place to work. Need to have an excellent amount of energy and stamina. Physically demanding. 
good,"I greeted members and prospective members. I answered questions and explained benefits of having a membership. I entered the customer's information into the computer, collected membership fees and processed their member card."
good,"at this job I learnt that not all people are ready to be in management, and it seems like the warehouse that I was clearly had a great job at finding those people. Costco likes to say that they protect their employee ,but in all actuality they will throw you under the but so to speak in a heart beat."
good,"Fast paced environment, learned detailing and customer service skills, great benefits and usually great people you work with--it's a hit or miss with any job, but overall I enjoyed working there."
good,i loved working at costco when i wasnt completely exhausted. its a wonderful competetive work envirement. the managers are friendly and they have tons of incentives for the employees.
good,"Employees were really good to work with, and managers were helpful and really friendly. The gave safety rewards, like fresh fruit and steak dinners. The store manager was really cool and super nice."
good,Keep and good attitude at all times. No matter the situation or problem that’s put in front of you always approach it with a smile. Be honest and integral towards your peers.
good,"wage was good, and guaranteed hours.  However managemnent at the NL location made me want to quite.  Hated that location, but enjoyed my work at the surrey BC location"
good,"The job itself, though labor intensive, is not difficult. You have to move quickly and be aware of your surroundings. I had very little experience with my managers. They might check up on me, but I never was able to receive much advice or assistance from them. Other people would frequently mention how the poor management was unique to the specific location I worked at. despite that, I would have liked to stay with Costco, but I was only hired for a seasonal position."
good,"I don't want to give a review. thank you. I'll pass on this section."
good,"The hours were very accommodating. The employees weren't always the nicest or fairest. The wages were above average, highly recommend as a place to work."
good,Great place to work! Extremely nice people and great atmosphere the best time to work is seasonal. Pay is really good starting off and it’s a good learning experience
good,"Costco had some nice benefits, people, and the pay was nice. The only flaw was some areas were harder than others. This was very true about the bakery."
good,Work is simple but physically straining and difficult at times. Early hours but decent pay especially for someone right out of highschool with little experience.
good,"Always doing something, never busy, good pay, sometimes will be stuck with many different things to do, sometimes under staffed, room for growth in the company"
good,"Good place to work, staff at the pharmacy  is very nice. They are always willing to help me. Hard to get a position as full time.Good benefits. Respectful"
good,"Good organisation, Fair Pay, Hard Work.  It is a good starter position, flexible hours and generally over the minimum rate of pay.  Somewhere between $12 and $14 per hour to start."
good,I liked working at Costco.  I left due to a career change.  I was attempting to get a trade under my belt and the training at RK was free.  It was a good move for me.
good,Working at costco made me realize that always being good to your paid members has its benifits and that learning to work in a fast pace comminuty has its perks
good,"Fast paced organization.  You often wear many hats. A day may consist of collecting carts to working in the clothing department.  Management is fare and promote production. Every job has their little clicks but you learn to get along. To me there was no hardest part of the job, The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,the staff are very kind and understanding. it is hard work but you make decent money and you get to learn a lot. There are great benefits and people who work at costco usually stay at costco for a long time.
good,"I learned that Costco is a very diverse, social work environment.  I The harder part depends on which department and position of the worker, in regards to shift start and or end.  Morning Merchandiser start as early as 05:00,  as does high season in Tire Centre.  Evening Merchandising can end as late as 23:30."
good,"Costco was a great place to work as a student during the summers. Fast-paced environment with lots of exercise running around the warehouse getting/returning product, helping the cashiers, packing merchandise at the till."
good,"Enjoyed interacting with the people and stocking while helping people find what they are looking for."
good,Costco starts you off part-time. So it is hard to maintain a good work schedule where you can get close to 40 hours per week. Benefits are amazing. Work environment is stress free and clean. Management can be concerned only about themselves.
good,Nice job but unfortunately they hired people they already new going in. Got on seasonally and they where going to keep 3 people out of the 100+ hired. Alot of people hid during work hours trying to avoid working but got kept on because of connections with upper management that they hung around.
good,Relocated with spouse but loved the job.  Received commendations from management for doing well on roadshows that were provided for the members.  Overall nice place to work
good,"I don't work at Costco, but at CDS which is a good company but they don't have benefits. they provide a good work place but no job flexibility. The management is friendly."
good,"Fast moving Environment"
good,"The pay is good, and on Sunday's it is moved to 19.50. Management could be a little harsh, but most managers/supervisors are very understanding. They work with school schedules but hardly any time off on the weekends."
good,"This was an independent contract position, which meant I had constant work hours, both in the costco location, and at home. Flowers needed to be counted every morning before 8am, and stocked in the display through the  day, which meant no more than 2 hours at a time for personal errands and downtime. Really it was recommended to stay at location until close of business, which meant 12 hour days."
good,A very family friendly workplace. Costco treats its employees well along with paying a good appropriate wage. Physically and mentally demanding with possible long hours.
good,"I preferred non supervisory skills at Costco.Raises were regular.Health Insurance Plan was good.The work was fast paced and demanding.Working at Costco allowed me to take my wife to a trip to France,and I appreciated that."
good,"If you are an introvert, the call center is the place to go. You do not have to interact with people face to face. It is great, you also get a space to relax."
good,"A typical day at work included keeping the merchandise area clean, helping customers locate merchandise, loading items into vehicles, etc... It was very much a team oriented company which gave me the opportunity to exercise working as part of a team."
good,"A typical day at work is productive and fast paced, we had to reach a quota each work day. I learned how to defect lenses, cure/coat lenses, special lenses such as S70, YG, SH, GE and P, work as a group/team, pay attention to detail. If I had the will to learn, they'll teach you. Management had supervisors assigned to each department, they were to always be around. They allowed us to socialize while working as long as we stayed productive and management was involved with the workers personal lives such as allowing parties/company parties every now and then and celebrating birthdays. The hardest part of the job, I can't really say there was anything that was difficult to handle other than having to be extra careful with the lenses, but if there was one thing I could say that was a deal breaker for me was that there was too much gossip within the facilities. The most enjoyable part of working there was that we were allowed to listen to music."
good,working at a  very fast pace i learned a lot i had a great manager the hardest part of the jobs was to do 7 lanes in less then an hour also u had to help others as well so u barely had time to get ur palets done
good,Good work load. Human Resources are very helpful. The only discount is free memberships. Sunday the wage is increased to an additional 4 dollars a hours.
good,"Great environment to work in, managers are easy to work with and efficient. Flexible scheduling. Great group of employees. They are all about trying to promote within the company."
good,Friendly co-workers and always a productive atmosphere. Always willing to assist in different departments if needed. Costco would pay time and a half on Sunday's which I thought was phenomenal.
good,Staff are very friendly and helpful. Customers can feel quite entitled because they pay for a membership but Costco policy generally keeps them happy enough to avoid causing too much trouble.
good,Hard to get a permanant job there. But good place to work. I learned a lot about baking. The managers were very nice. It was a great enviroment to work in.
good,The company he has great benefits and your job is secure after 2 years a being there they pay very high money in return for you to keep coming back and giving it your all this company is really good to work for the only downfall is management is very poor and I suggest you keep your personal life to yourself the rules are very strict and if you upset them you can be terminated very quickly
good,"Costco is a great start up job, while working through college or part time. They have great benefits and give you all major holidays off. I good place to work."
good,Costco is a very good place to work for because of all the various departments you can work under and learn new skills from them. All the staff are nice and friendly and take the new staff under their wing.
good,The company was a good learning experience. I definitely was able to learn great customer service and was able to work in different departments which made me a better person and coworker.
good,i liked this place alot. this is a great job. i would work here again. Great seasonal positions. nice place to work. I would work here again. nice managers.
good,"Costco is a good employer, especially if you are a college student or never went to college. Unlike competing retail or grocery stores, Costco pays employees above the market rate while also guaranteeing pay raises--based on hours accumulated at work--up to a more than reasonable level."
good,"It can be quite tough at the beginning but it is a very good njob with good management, i would recomend this job to anyone who wants to grow with the company and receive full time benefits which are pretty good"
good,"Good place to work, the employees treat each other like Family. They have good benefits, also working for Costco gets you other benefits as well. fun place to work. Pay Raises are based on Hrs, not performance."
good,"Working for Costco was one of, if not, the best job iv'e ever had. Only downside was you have to know the right people and make the right friends in order to advance. Make sure your in the right dept...."
good,"Costco is a great place where multitasking is key. "
good,"Good benefits and high salary. Good work environment, good co workers. Good retirement funds. Fun place to work. Don't want to do this."
good,Working in the food court at Costco was a very high paced but rewarding job. The lines at Costco never seem to end so be prepared to be on the go from the moment you clock in.
good,"This company allows you to grow throughout the years being there. It all depends of the warehouse you are in. Most cases your experiences will be different because of management. In the begining i was happy to work at costco but I didnt recieve much growth because of the location was full of topped out employees and full timers. I waited to stick it out for the 4 years I was there. I achieve the rate of 14.50 per hour, but after these years the new people are now starting at 13 per hour. "
good,"The company is a great company with great benefits, however Managment at the location i worked in was not of the highest caliber or most ethical, its not garanteed you will have a job becouse you'll be brought in as a seasenal employe."
good,"I would definitely go back, fun, fast paced, never the same thing over again. Unfortunately it is very hard to get a permanent job at Costco. I find they only hire people permanently if you have a family member who works for the company."
good,Fast pace job teaches you how to conduct your self in an appropriate manor while dealing with inpatient rude customers.I learned how to kill a mean person with smiles and kindness.Management ok for the most part when favoritism is not involved.I enjoyed working with most of the co-workers they made the hardest wok days easy and fun.The hardest part of this job would be sundays busy none stop would ware you out.I enjoyed the different events sponsored and sundays time and half.
good,"Fun and productive place to work. Some room for advancement, management often turn a blind eye to the employees that they favor. Other than that it is good."
good,Costco est une entreprise très sérieuse qui offre de belles opportunités a ses employés.
good,costco is a great place to work you learn alot of things while still having fun and enjoying your time at work. the workers there are awesome to work with
good,Costco takes care of their employees. They offer great starting pay and great benefits. Everyday is different and exciting in the warehouse.
good,"Over all is good. A lots of fun with extra curricular activity. Good work environment. everybody very cooperative, helpful and sincere."
good,No siguen protocolos de operación como lo dictan sus manuales y códigos de ética que ellos manejan
good,"The position entailed working diverse shifts as part of a team and dealing with members on a daily basis; Dealing with the security of the building and general health and safety issues; Managing the team shift rotas and leave applications and general administrative duties."
good,My experience with working at Costco Wholesale has been a customer service whirlwind. The customer volume that Costco intakes on a daily basis is far greater than any other retailer I've worked. You learn a lot with how to deal with customers and how to handle a lot of different scenarios that play out.
good,"Good place to work but will try to take over your life. Great benefits, you can make good money, and a good sick/vacation packages too."
good,Costco is one of the best places to work. The people are nicer to work with. Management team are the best. Employees are treated as family. The guest really do have the best experience
good,"I hate to say it, but I have never experienced a more Micro Managed facility were the management is so under water in their skill set, tools and ability to do their job or interact with the employees. There are a handful of managers who can actually do far more than their job and have a very resourceful toolbox filled with interpersonal communication and the willingness to coach and encourage their teams to grow in their skill-set. However, only a hand full. the actions of the majority will not be mentioned here."
good,"love working there the people i work with are great, the pay isn't that great unless you have been there for 5 years... "
good,Team work is what makes the dream work. Team work is what makes Costco the well oiled machine that members see from day to day.
good,"The work atmosphere was great, and the coworkers as well as management are all nice people, adding to the enjoyable atmosphere when working there.  The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the enthusiasm of the employees have at times, as constantly talking to the hundreds of customers that pass through is very tiring, but at the same time, is the most enjoyable part of the job as well. Being able to communicate to all kinds of different people i otherwise would not have the chance to is something i greatly appreciate."
good,Every day while stocking the merchandises I feel great because I'm surrounded by great people so it makes my day at work go by fast and I'm also able to finish the job on time by the great team work we have to help each other.
good,"We have three different times that we can work. Early, mid. and late."
good,"everything was good, the work was fun and challenging. we baked most of the stuff from scratch. the pay was really generous for a starting wage."
good,Costco is a place where you need to be focused and like to work. Need to be able to talk to a lot of people. Hardest part of job is working for different managers at different times.
good,Very hard work in all the elements. Learned time management and responsibility. The supervisors were not always close by making the crew more responsible for decision making. Hardest part of the job is getting used to the physical nature of the job while also dealing with the weather.
good,"It was nice while it lasted. start early, end early. co workers were awesome. one supervisor didn't do his job very well."
good,"Working at front-end in Costco Wholesale, allowed me to be gain valuable experience. I learned how to work efficiently in a fast-paced environment, alone and with a team. As well as, better my communication skills that provided me to achieve good relations with everyone, including customers, employees and managers."
good,"Costco is easily the most challenging retail store to work for, but with that, you also get best pay out of all the retail stores."
good,"Same day to day task, and management needs some work. But pay is well for a retail store that doesn't require a degree. Everything is built on seniority, therefore new hires have no way to move up in the company unless they relocate or stay with the company for years."
good,The typical day at Costco involves member service. I have learned how to deal with people which has greatly improved my communication skills. It has also helped me to critically think through tough situations and how to deal with upset members. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team of co-workers. We have a good time while pushing each other to work harder.
good,Easy place to work as long as you are doing your job. Management does not put up with people who do not go out of their way for their fellow employees and members of the club.
good,"While working at Costco, I learned how to deal with a variety of types of members in a face & efficient manner. It allowed me to get the job done in a more satisfied manner for the member since my excellent inter personal skills allowed me to gain their trust. Costco is always busy, so efficiency along with speed were key for a successful employment which made me a very quick learner & worker."
good,A typical day would be assisting customers with their needs and wants. It can be a fun work environment with your co-workers.
good,"Well paid and good environment for personal development.Breaks and lunches are respected , good activities for workers helping the cohesion of the teams."
good,"Easy job to work your way in to and to get comfortable with. Large variety of career paths to follow and different jobs to do."
good,"If you work hard you can get far here, if you're patient and are able to work 24 hours a week and live off that great but unfortunately its hard to get in and even harder to get a decent amount of hours. Even when you do get hours they schedule. you all over the place so its hard to make future plans considering"
good,Costco is a place where you work very hard and can move into management positions. The employees at Costco take pride in there jobs as they are members too.
good,"Working at Costco as a seasonal employee, I wished I could've fully stayed on as a part/full-time associate. The people I work with are generally all nice people, really easy to talk to, and make the workday a little better. Typically, I would start by organizing and condensing the meat counters, and running to the coolers to see what I can bring out to the main floor. And then asking if there's anything needed to be completed afterwards. I learned how to package meat, work with the machines, learning to label the different kinds of product, and basic sanitation skills. The management in my department are nothing short of amazing. They always gave me something to do, knew how to keep me busy, and overall they're nice people who are easy to come to if I ever needed help. To me, every thing is hard before it gets easy. I guess that the hardest thing was making new adjustments to different situations."
good,"very cute farm & nursery, family owned. its a local plant shop as well where prices are always negotiable. best summer job ever."
good,"Every night after the store closes we go throughout the warehouse to pick orders that customers submit online. Collecting the items and stacking them neatly on a pallet, we wrapped it after the order is complete and put it on the truck to be delivered the next day."
good,Costco Wholesale is a great place to work as far as retail goes. They start their employees at 11$ per hour and have a graduated wage program that is based purely on the number of hours worked. A typical day as a cashier includes counting the cash drawer and ringing members through the lines in a fast and accurate manner. You also need to help members find items and answer any questions they may have. Then at the end of the night make cash and check drops and count the drawer again. The hardest part of this job is standing in the same spot for 8 hours and sometimes having to lift heavy items because of the large quantities that Costco sells. The most enjoyable part is getting to interact with so many people throughout the day and knowing that at Costco you have the option to move around departments if interested.
good,"Buying products of every category in an office of approximately 200 buying staff made for a very busy, bustling energetic office environment.  Enjoyed my time there on the whole and left to pursue my own business with dogs. Responsibilities include:"
good,I enjoyed working at Costco and working with a very diverse group of co-workers. It was a friendly environment that was also fun to work in a very fast paced environment. I enjoyed staying very busy at each and every shift.
good,Typical day depends on your department.  I learned they are extremely serious about their sanitation.  Management is always available. My Co workers were smart and funny.  The hardest part of the job is time management.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to shop after your shift is over.
good,"A normal day would consist of facing shelves and making sure the aisles are clear of clutter. Once the store closes my duties would include re-stocking the shelves, moving around pallets and cleaning the aisles."
good,"Costco provides employees with opportunities to move into other positions of progressively increasing responsibilities.  Excellent benefits both in terms of pay, benefits and bonus."
good,"m'assurer qu""il n'y ai pas de degats que ce sois dans les allées ,dans les toilettes ou dans la cafeteria et me charger de la maintenance du magasin."
good,"Great work environment. "
good,"Great pay very busy enviroment."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits and environment, just had to take time away to further my education in school. I would recommend the company, however, I am looking to obtain a job in the medical field to enhance my training and skills ability."
good,"I would retrieve items from members, help pack shopping carts, package and wrap food and stock up. The mangers made sure they helped us when needed and my co-workers got along with each other well."
good,As a morning stocker my duties were to ensure that all of dates on the products are up to date and that nothing is bad or is going to be bad. Along with that I would also have to assist members with finding the products that they are currently looking for
good,"The deli department is a family willing to accept anyone in their midst. Within the fast paced need to achieve certain ratios, this is a unique job experience that allows you the fun of interacting with customers, using different equipment provided, and learning how to make numerous salads and foods in a short time frame while keeping to health and safety standards. I recommend this position to those that like good pay for a hard days work and enjoy being able to grow in the field."
good,"great environment that fosters team work. if you want to learn more about the company or do more in your job, management is willing to teach and train."
good,"Costco is a great company to work for. It is a high paced environment that keeps you on your toes. I've learned how to multi-task, as well as to deal with difficult members. The hardest part of the job is when there isn't enough staff scheduled and we get swamped with members. We definitely work hard for our paychecks. I love most of my co-workers, we get along great and they definitely make my day go by faster. The hardest part of the job is having to stand on my feet for my whole shift. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers. I have learned several departments while working for the company and i love it."
good,"my day starts with greeting members, answering questions like locating items in the warehouse, assisting handicapped members in shopping, working alongside co-workers, helping each other out with issues. Working full shifts, two breaks and a lunch were great. The greatest part of my job was the satisfaction I received for making our members have a better experience."
good,"-supplying customers with carts in bad weather"
good,Fun place to work people always had a smile. Working there was like working with family. I never had any issues. Good job training.
good,COSTCO provides an environment where you can grow and it also provides the support you need (eg. enough staff and many different databases) to do you job on a daily basis.
good,Excellent company blueprint. Unparalleled customer service. Quality products at great prices.I learned to do 7 different positions so as to make myself more valuable to the company.
good,My typical day at work included assisting customers in purchasing Costco memberships. I learned how to be a great sales woman and gained experience in various departments. My co-workers were great and everyone got along fine. I never really encountered any difficulties during my tenure and only had good times.
good,"Very Productive workplace"
good,"Costco Wholesale es una empresa que la mayor parte de sus trabajadores son estudiantes, tiene un buen equipo de trabajo y las realciones laborales son muy buenas, tiene horarios flexibles. "
good,"Working in Costco Wholesale required hard work and was very fast paced. The easiest ways to succeed always is to work hard and be polite and helpful to fellow employees and shoppers. The work day usually demanded being able to switch between different tasks fluidly at the request of the managers and being able to perform such task efficiently. While working for Costco some of the the things I learned was efficient multitasking, customer service, and how to take negative criticism and turn it into a strength."
good,It is a great place to work where you are have family feel with your coworkers. Makes you feel like you are not just a worker.
good,"Beaucoup de travail et tout le monde est en mode de production intense. Oui, il y a des opportunités de développement mais au sacrifice de votre vie personnel. Le management est tres bien organisé. L'aspect le plus difficile du poste de boulanger etait de s'assurer que tout le monde suive le meme rythme puisque c'était du travail d'équipe et l'aspect le plus agréable est de revoir la clientele semaine apres semaine revenir car ils apprécient ce qu'on leur prépare."
good,Was a good learning experience for Retail able to learn many different departments.Over seeing The Big Picture this means running the Business.I recieved respect form all the co-workers I over saw.Driving the forklift.
good,nice place to work  good pay  but very hard to get permanent position there. working in the deli requires preparing foods at a fast pace. merchandising is a heavier job  but  the supervisors in that dept dont push you as much. . they do expect you to follow the rules closely but  they let you do your work when they see your a good worker
good,"Very difficult to move up within the company. Safety protocols not followed. Ethics need to be improved upon. Work/Life is non existent. The salary is very good and benefits as well. However, there is much needed improvement in communication and consistency across the board in behaving professionally. There seems to be a lot of competition created from upper level management as entertainment to grade on personal performance reviews."
good,great management that allows you to find your own routine. Other than the obvious drawbacks of custodial work it was a great place to work.
good,Costco is a wonderful place to work for. All the employees are very energetic and know what needs to be done to make things run smooth.
good,"Setting up the bowling lanes and making sure the place was clean ready for the customer."
good,"Work started at 4am, we had assigned aisle to restock food in a timely manor.  Sometimes work got hectic but the job got done. My coworkers were very helpful if I needed help stocking products.  The hardest part was waking up, other than that it wasn't to hard."
good,This is the fast fast employment and lots of interaction with customers. I worked only for seasonal period.
good,Costco has been a great job for me while I was in college. Benefits are excellent and employees are treated fairly.
good,overall great company to work for.  Easygoing atmosphere.  Coworkers are nice
good,"worked full-time up front by the cash. i sold guest memberships, executive memberships and american express cards. wasn't always the easiest job but it was fun."
good,"Put groceries in boxes into customers carts, take back all the groceries not wanted at the till, round up all the carts in the parking lot."
good,"Work is a lot of the same working at the front end. There are a variety of things that you can be doing at any given time. You will most likely be loading and unloading carts while talking to the customer and making sure that they have everything. If they forgot something or they need something it is my responsible for fetching the item and bringing it back for the customer. You can also be grabbing boxes from different areas in the store to bring back to the front in case a customer wants one to carry their groceries in. Some days you will be put on cart duty which means that you will be returning carts from the different cart return areas around the lot. Co-workers are friendly and overall you are just working with them. On breaks you have time to talk, but you are generally paying attention to the customer and what they need because it is a very fast paced environment. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, who either don't like something you are doing or are just having a bad day and tend to have a bad attitude with it. But that is a minor detail. It really isn't a ""hard"" part to that job. The most enjoyable part of that job is being able to see satisfied customers and being able to help people as often as I can."
good,I would come to work on time and ready to go at my start time.  I would have to keep up with the speed that is happening that day.  I have learned how to commutate better with everyone around me.  My co-workers and I have a relationship that is friendly and can make each other have a good time at work.  The hardest part of the job was learning that not everybody is going to like me but I proved myself to them through out the years I have worked there.  Honestly the most enjoying part about working at Costco is everybody seems to know you.  The co-workers knew my name before I knew theirs and that made me feel more welcomed when I started.
good,always had a smile on my face everyone was awesome to work with as a team.
good,Good company to begin with.  Never got promised training to advance.
good,"Very busy store"
good,I met a lot of people from different states that work there. it wasn't a job for me to much cause it really wasn't anything to do
good,A well-managed company that pays its employees well and treats them with respect.
good,"Costco is know for the quality of its product, the quality of its services and especially for the way they treat their employees. I worked as a merchandiser and at the front of the store at the customer service."
good,Good company with great benefits and good team environment but the pay was almost minimal with raises coming at long intervals.
good,"Bonne flexibilité d'horaire, excellent salaire, très bons avantages sociaux. Personnel amical et professionnel"
good,"Great company ethics and standards, but very much lacking good leadership and management."
good,"greet customers as they come in"
good,Management and staff are always willing to lend a helping hand and are very friendly. Excellent experience.
good,"- cashier"
good,"Costco is a good place to work as far as retail goes. They offer benefits including health, vision and dental. Great for part time work."
good,Stocking the shelves in the store was physically demanding but that made it more enjoyable.  The coworkers were friendly and very open to switching shifts.  The worst part was waking up at 3 AM to go to work. Best part was probably the pay.
good,"I work in the tire center mostly. I have learned a lot about tires, cars, and what it means to work hard"
good,Costco is great!  They taught me how to be a leader and gave me a great foundation to build on.
good,It was a good job to have. The customers and employees were always friendly and nice.
good,"busy preparing and packaging food,inventory, helping customers and cleaning"
good,Responsible for merchandising the warehouse.  Hardest part of the job was the early morning hours and working every weekend.
good,"Mon premier emploi, celui qui ma donné ma chance de travail, depuis presque 5ans maintenant"
good,"My day at a Costco pharmacy as a pharmacy technician starts with  entering and filling prescriptions, verifying and billing patients insurance, answering phones, assisting patients, stocking medications and supplies and assisting the pharmacist as needed."
good,"I learned that Costco employees work their butts off from open to close. I was able to gain new skills in safety, temp, and steel walks and the purpose for them."
good,"•	Exceeded the new business target during probationary period thus offered the full time position after 3 months."
good,"Costco Great Place to work. The management team was great,I just moved from the Bay Area"
good,"good pay, overall great company. Some members of management set unrealistic goals. Long hours as a department manager."
good,"Very routine in the daily tasks."
good,It was a good place to work.  I definitely think we could use more training. Overall it was a good experience.   Very nice coworkers.  Helping customers is the best part of the day
good,"I'm a morning Stocker, so basically I go in and stock whatever needs to get stocked at work. Being there for 1 year and 8 months has been interesting. Its nice that they care about their employees and pay you well and stuff, but I'm 21 and tend to work harder than a lot of people who have been there for years and are lazy by over-relying on you, and I'm one of few people there going to school. Management is alright, but could use some work. It took them 2 months to replace someone from our department which just means more work especially since its physically demanding. Plus you basically have to give your life to them if you want to move up. For me, they never give you weekends off unless you book it off, which i understand is their policy but at the same time doesn't seem just if they can't ""hire"" people at times. "
good,"days was unloading trucks, receiving product, sorting and getting to shipping lanes."
good,"Everyone is friendly "
good,its was great working as a eco drink promoter at costco superstore.
good,"Every day was different depending on the season, regardless everyone who worked there was up beat and eager to help. I worked with seven other guys in the meat department and they were all great we got along well and were very productive. The hardest part of woking for Costco was trying to keep track of where the product was because they are so keen on moving product around. I enjoyed all the members and being able to help them have a great shopping experience."
good,Greeting customers as they enter & leave the store. Meeting new people daily. Co-workers are always friendly & helpful. Hradest part is dealing with difficult people. When they don't want to be bothered. You just put a smile on your face and do the best you can.
good,"I've managed a number of supply chain and ecommerce projects for Costco Wholesales.  The teams vary in sizes from under twenty-five members to more than seventy-five.  The most impactful project at Costco was the CTS (cigarette tiering systems) project.  We pulled together more than 20 years of non-documented functional specifications in order to properly document the current state of a $5B top in revenue making department for Costco.   Those revenues are generated via retailing and wholesaling cigarettes along with other tobacco products."
good,"It's Costco !! what more can I say ...AMAZING !"
good,"Pousser des paniers, emballer pour les membres, stocker le soir."
good,"Come in to work get table and everything i need to set up and start serving customers."
good,"The Costco in Bellingham is definitely the busiest one I've seen. It forces you to make quick decisions, and learn quickly."
good,"Chez Costco, j'ai appris énormément et je suis devenue très versatile. Les possibilités d'avancements sont intéressantes ainsi que les conditions de travaille. Je travaille avec des personnes très sympathiques et souriantes. L'ambiance y est très agréable. J'aime pouvoir être autonome et en apprendre davantage à chaque jour. Par contre, j'aime beaucoup les gens et mon travail chez Costco ne me permet pas le contact humain dont j'espère d'un emploi."
good,The company is organized and keeps its employees apprised of any and all new procedures.
good,"A typical day for me is working on the sales floor face to face with my customers,  constantly running around and reorganizing my list of tasks.  Customer service is truly my main objective.  The hardest part of the job is realizing that as much as you'd like to, you can not do it all. You have to prioritize your workload, and be able to do this efficiently. "
good,"stocked, customer service. fast paced atmosphere. management was nice and willing to work with the employees. the hardest part of the job was working inside of a freezer"
good,"A high volume retail environment where member service is priority and your job responsibility can change from day to day and your schedule from week to week."
good,I held multiple positions there and enjoyed the work greatly.
good,I have been a employee of Costco for 5 years and have been learning new things ever since the beginning.
good,"Everyone within Costco quickly becomes your family. It is a fun, fast-paced environment that makes the time there pass quickly."
good,"A typical day at work for me at Costco was more like a typical night. I was part-time, and I took whatever hours I could get to pay the rent. My job was in Member Services, providing security and loss prevention and customer service at the front doors. Most of the members were excellent people, but a few, maybe five percent, were on a power trip and would complain to our bosses if we even blinked. The hardest part of the job was trying to fulfill Costco's policies with regard to checking member cards at the entrance, and examining member receipts at the exit. A lot of people resented having to show their cards, and some resented having to wait while we checked receipts. We bore the brunt of their dissatisfaction, and, if you generated enough complaints, you could be fired, as I was."
good,être capable d'approcher les clients pour montrer notre produit
good,"On a typical day at work during open hours I would either cashier, help members load their items into their cars and push carts, or assist the cashiers and help with member needs. After hours i would stock and clean the store. By working at Costco Wholesale, I have learned better customer service and communication skills. The teamwork concept and the friendly co-workers were the most enjoyable part about working at Costco. The hardest part of the job was not having enough workers on the weekends when the door count every hour was around 400. So as a team we had to learn how to adapt."
good,This is a great Company that you can count to grow as a professional/career in retail group.
good,Great people and good work. enjoyed the hours and worked in many departments
good,"This is a very informative job to be in, you learn something new about food and other products everyday, you always have something new to work on everyday"
good,"I enjoy working at Costco. I have learned alot of new things in the bakery. It's a fast paced job. I've been there for three months now and I picked up the speed that I'm suppose to be at. Now I'm currently stocking items for Costco. I learned everything is timed, and you have to work really fast. We only have four hours to put out stock and put it away."
good,"working at costco was very fun, i learned a lot from the staff. We would clock in, and grab a broom to do a floor sweep. Our job was to keep the floors and restroom clean. The most enjoyable part of the job were the friendly customers."
good,"I walked around the warehouse picking up boxes and cleaning up during the day, at night I drove a forklift in numerous sections."
good,"Costco was a great part time job for me going through college. Even as a part time employee I was provided with insurance, 401k, health, dental, and paid sick/holiday hours. Cooperate has a simple structure. Management typically follows protocol. People of all departments are friendly and coerce with one another. Work hard and you will always have a job here. Turnover is small, many lifers working here."
good,"It was a very busy environment, unloading the trucks and separating the merchandise to their designated areas and checking invoices."
good,"Staff is all very freindly and wages are very worth it. Good hours, and lots of room for advancement."

good,A Speedy yet relaxed environment allowed myself to make a living and relationship without building stress.
good,unstocking merchandise & getting them ready b4 the store opens
good,Working with Costco you meet a lot of different people & are able to learn their stories. Its always an enjoyable shift when you are able to see the reaction on a customers face when you show them actions they can do on their new phone that they couldn't do on their old phone.
good,"Its a very difficult job physically, but it is a lot of fun especially with the employees they have. They are extremely strict and wont take any accidents lightly"
good,"A typical day at work for me included starting by cleaning the earlier shifts mess, helping out customers with their needs, and having to cover for others. I learned just how hard I was willing to work in order to make management impressed. The hardest part of the job was the lack of movement in position. Once you were in a position that you did really good in, management wanted you to stay there even if you were ready for other positions like supervisor."
good,Good pay good job prospects you make great friends you have to work your way up to be on top money they have plenty of different jobs bakery front end back shift optical
good,"Show up and do your job. Great people to work for. Very understanding. Stressful at times. Able to leave if not busy, and still keep your job. Hours can be there if needed."
good,"Good retail experience. The staff was great and obviously cared about their jobs and patients. It was nice having cashier help, and the techs were very well-trained."
good,"Job is very tedious, and mentally/physically difficult in certain departments i.e. Foodcourt. Starting pay is a lot higher than minimum wage. You'll definitely have to work hard, and long hours. At the end of the day, this is still retail."
good,Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and should I have started there at a younger age would of stayed.  Demands with family resulted in my having to look elsewhere
good,"Daily work load varies depending on department. Advancement goes to seniority not who's better suited for the job. Great people to work around. But gossip travels quick, feels like high-school and i hated high-school"
good,"A typical work place is normal, and it gets hectic with time depends how much work we had done before opening the whole shift we try to run against the clock the entire time."
good,"Costco’s is a good work environment to be in and earn you way to better benefits and work, but the job location at the Costco’s I was at was to far for me to commute"
good,"Management priorities differ from warehouse to warehouse, depending on GM. Costco offers every tool to help you grow and promote, but once you promote to salary you are expected to be available at every beck and call. 60+ hours is a minimum expectation, and you are looked down on and get slighted if you dont work more."
good,"It’s hard to find a position with normal work hours, and the company runs completely on seniority. Great if you like a fast paced environment, and are patient while looking for advancement."
good,Daily tasks included signing new members up for our memberships averaging at least 10 daily. Promoted the Citi Visa Credit card as well as the Executive membership. Responsible for overseeing department success and pushing upgrades to make us #1 in district.
good,Il était très peu accepté de parler avec un autre employer lors du travaille.
good,was a great night out of the day I gotta go home and I will bring you home tomorrow wtf this is pointless like seriously. I am annoyed with this survey as it is wasting my time.
good,Fast paced and there is always something to do.  Very high pressure.  Benefits are great even for part time.  Job requires multi tasking.  The bad thing is the customers they feel they are entitled to certain things which can add unwanted pressure.
good,It Depends on what your job is and what do you want to accomplish. No all jobs have a career path there. Just make sure that whatever you want to do has a clear career path
good,"Costco is a fun place to be. Teams in this compagny are professionals but you will be obligated to work every weekends and on a part time schedule to begin. It's payfull to be there for more tant five years, below that, it's only a normal client services compagny with a salary just above the minimum range"
good,"A typical day is entirely dependent on where you work in the store. That could include multiple departments in a day. There is always something that needs done and that can certianly leave management in a bind more often than not. On days where you're short handed, it can be exceedingly challenging to hit benchmarks and maintain the standard of excellence of Costco. Regardless, it is very challenging work and becoming a proficient employee is a reward for the empoyee who enjoys challenges and new ones every day."
good,"Standard retail industry. Unfortunately can't have a normal schedule. Employees are great, benefits are amazing, overall a good company to work for! It is a physical job in almost every role."
good,Employee compensation is the most attractive part of working at Costco. You never have to ask for a raise. Raises are based on hours work ie first raise was $1 at 1000 hours worked.
good,"-easy access to start and end the day"
good,"I want to start this off by saying that this was my experience at the Covington Costco, it may be different for others but for me i didn't really get the best impressions. i said in the interview that i wanted to do my two weeks at my previous job and they scheduled me for the day after orientation, which was four days after the interview. During orientation they said I would get benefits and the executive membership but didn't mention that you would get them after a three month probation period, or the probation period in general. They also didn't exactly train me. they use the shadow/buddy system for a week and that's supposed to help you understand what to do and how to basically do the tasks required. for me the guy i was shadowing didn't show up on the first two days because those were his days off, only showed me what to do and how to do once, then told me to come to him if i had questions. i was swamped with responsibilities and not enough time to do them alone, leading to them constantly telling me I wasn't a good worker. there was a moment where for two days a different guy came in and helped me, leading me to get my job done on time. This helped me discover that the only thing the guy he was filling in for did was set up machines, which took about thirty minutes, while I had to check the temperature for said machines, set up the tables for the food court, run throughout the store to get the food for the cooler and dry goods, and stock said cooler and the freezer, marking everything along the way, all in about two and a half hours which doesn't seem so bad until you"
good,"It was alright, just alot of physical work and the breaks were not long enough, the working hours for people who were just PT were not set, i would had to come in one day in the early morning and then one day late afternoon and it just didnt fit with my schedule. Also, the front end does alot of the physical work there where the dress code would be uncomfortable. working outside pushing carts in slacks and a dress up shirt is something i never imagined but to each its own."
good,"The Oshawa branch is a good place to work as they have a very friendly staff. The manager was easy to communicate with, and the benefit plan is very good. However, the hours for part-time staff are not the greatest as hours during the day are scarce, and you never get weekends off."
good,"Costco was awesome to work for. Awesome people! Great pay and benefits. Decent time off. The only bad thing was to many managers telling you what to do, so lack of communication. Also maintaining a normal life is hard due to the schedule."
good,Good pay place to work at. some managers are too demanding and rude to employees. Others are great people in and outside of work. Great coworkers and a big family.
good,Some buildings are better than others. It all depends on how good managers are and how much they care about their employees. If management care about there employees then the comfortable feeling flows through the supervisors then the employees.
good,"I worked following instructions by my lead and supervisors I was always on time took my breaks at the appropriate times and returned to work ready to do my job, the employees were all very nice and got along great the managers respond to what the customers remarks were whether positive or negative."
good,"Its retail so its busy, alot of work, can be stressful at times. Definitely the best place to be for retail if you don't mind working hard. Work hard, be friendly with upper management and you can move up. Opportunities to become a supervisor, manager, or work in the bakery/deli/meat dept, or office!"
good,"Great place to work, good benefits, but the hours for me were too late and they would not work with my schedule even though I have children and other obligations. They said those that have been working there the longest take precedence when it comes to better hours."
good,Everyone at my workplace is very friendly and outgoing. Although it is very hard to get a break because of the lack of organizational skills they have. I do love going to work every day and seeing the people I work with and hearing about everyone's day and how it is going for them.
good,"You start as a cart crew and end up as a cart crew if you do not apply for a position inside after a year has gone by, sometimes they will deny you still and make you wait an entire year before another job posting becomes available. "
good,"They are very accommodating to students when it comes to helping you keep a very good study, work, and life balance."
good,Some days are slow others a tornado busted down your door. Its a good job but it depends more on which department your in. If your a basic seasonal worker strap in because its going to be something.
good,"Excelente empresa para laborar, con muy buenas prestaciones."
good,"The order filler position in the business center is intense and long hard days of work. Not required but expected to work past your scheduled shift. Have to meet certain numerical ratios to maintain good standing with GM and immediate management.  Hard work.  My experience was good in the beginning but poor towards the end.  Overall, Costco is a great company for those that work for them.  They take care of employees but expect a lot in return."
good,"Everyday there were opportunities to learn something new. Everyone had a job to do and we worked in an orderly manner. Everybody worked as a team to complete our goal by inspecting, sorting, packing, and palletizing meat to be sent off."
good,"Costco is good company if you are just starting off as a student, stay at home parent or retired."
good,It was an easy job I just wasn’t able to switch or they wouldn’t flex my hours. They also would not train me to work on the register with the transaction processing.
good,"Working conditions are great, as the staff is friendly and helpful."
good,"Costco is a really good company to work for. Pay is good and benefits are good once you start getting them. In my opinion, the management is not good. I have worked there over 6 years and have had a lot of managers. Most all managers are nothing but bosses, and not leaders. I am a supervisor and hardly ever do  feel appreciated by my bosses. There is a lot of favoritism and they will not fire bad employees with a bad work ethic simply because they aren't in their 90 day ""probationary period."""
good,You have a  lot of opportunities if you want it however  management can be very difficult sometimes even unprofessional. It's about who you know.The pay and benefits are great . Overall  they are a good company that treats their employees  fair.
good,I worked allover lots of different opportunities bakery photo cashier vault stocking food court meat department supervisor rules encouraged great benefits for part and fulltime
good,"Working at Costco was a very fast paced job, especially as a seasonal cashier’s assistant. The job was honestly too fast paced for me, but it wasn’t a difficult job to work."
good,Not a bad place to work would recommend. No overtime. No discounts only a free membership. Fast paced most of the time depending on where you are. When open it’s usually busy
good,Costco was an ideal workplace for a person that only has a High School diploma or GED. The starting pay now is $15/hr and they give flexible hours.  Costco biggest flaw was that at times there was unfair treatment with their employees. Certain employees got treated better than others depending on how well you got along with the managers.
good,"In Costco there is really no way to go but up. You do need to have a stomach for not being trained in the job you're doing, not knowing what job you're doing (and not knowing which one to dress for), and miscommunication. Keep in mind this is a Costco less than three years old at the time, so certain things are bound to be out of order, or in general difficult to manage."
good,"I was employed to start at 6am and finish at 2pm this quickly disappeared and was replaced with daily shift changes ranging from 10pm to 8am starts, no daily shift was the same."
good,Costco was a good company to work for however the management is poor. Stress levels are high working there but they offer great incentives! Working for Costco is great for hard workers.
good,"I had a good time in costco i loved working there it was fun and easy."
good,"The job itself is fast paced and a fun environment. All the long timers are very very nice and help you out wherever you need it. The trouble is time off. They aren’t willing to give you any weekends off, so if you need a weekend off try to switch it yourself or as the long timers say.... call in sick."
good,"In my opinion, this place is very good to start in customer service, to understand the work culture of a multinational company, namely to relate and work as a team."
good,"Very fast-paced environment, you will learn to move with a sense of urgency. Many are hired seasonally and unfortunately let go. Also as a seasonal worker you will most likely get less than desirable shifts."
good,"Day to day tasks were achievable and engaging and coworkers made it fun. Getting to see stock before it was available to the customers gave us a heads up for what to recommend. "
good,Still currently work at Costco! Overall it’s a great company to work for as I’ve worked here 3 years and still work here. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great overall job! I have family in the company and who have worked 25 years and over and they have great retirement for when they retire
good,Great place to work as a first job or post-career. The work can be enjoyable depending on the warehouse manager. Pay raises are guaranteed and based on hours and the benefits are great.
good,"Poor management and stagnancy are my main concerns with Costco; it takes a long time to actually cap out in terms of pay scale and being a part-timer means you're subject to hour cuts at the leisure of the company's needs. Costco boasts customer-friendly service in its mission statement but no concern for the employee, not to mention part-timers; we are replaceable yet work the hardest because of the complacency of the 10+ year workers that don't have the drive to work at their best due to capping out pay-wise. The main reason I stay at Costco is the benefits, even as a part-timer I get fairly decent coverage on all fronts, but to obtain full time status is a difficult, ""first come, first serve"" basis that is biased towards seniority rather than effort."
good,"Great place to start any career. You get an opportunity to meet all types of people. Great starting pay and advancement opportunities. The only downside is that management can be a nuisance. Your human relation skills are tested daily/hourly with workers, members, and management."
good,"I wouldve like to grown with costco as an employee, but didnt have the opportunity to. I had a good experience and was able to learn a few more things. People had a good attitude most of the time."
good,Worked here seasonal for a couple months. The hours varied greatly but they were willing to work with my school schedule. The workday itself was very fast paced and both physically and mentally demanding as costco is a very busy place. Most of my coworkers and managers were very nice and helpful. Unfortunately the job most likely wont lead to a permanent position as they hire on almost none of the seasonal employees to full or part time. Overall good seasonal job for students around the holidays but nothing more.
good,"Costco is a fast paced environment, the offered great benefits for full and part time employees. The staff are team players and hard working. They strive for customer satisfaction."
good,Typical day of working isn't too stressful but what i learned was that moving up or going for promotions is next to impossible if you are applying to a different building. The  hardest part about the job was that it was horrible when it came to help balance work and life. They will not accommodate or help anyone's situation to make it easier on them. They will only care about costco and costco only.
good,"Depending on your warehouse and Manager, life at Costco can either be wonderful or not. The company as a whole is great and offers outstanding benefits and the pay is good."
good,Great place to work. Coworkers are excellent. Management is good as well. They have many benefits and also help with school funds. Very professional managers.
good,"Nice place to work. Good, fun employees. A ton of different departments to work in and get good experience from. Good benefits and paid time off. They pay holiday pay and premium pay on Sunday’s."
good,"Fast-paced environment. I learned a lot in the different departments I worked in. Management has their favorites of who they want to promote. There is no value on higher education, so it has no merit on getting promoted. Hardest part of the job is the ever-changing schedule, no set days off, and you work many nights and weekends. Most enjoyable part of the job is very  good benefits. Pay starts $14 with automatic raises, 401k with 50% company match, medical and dental benefits, and 1 week vacation after first year of employment and one week added for every year of service up to 4 weeks and one week of sick/personal time."
good,I only worked at COSTCO for a short amount of time but i did enjoy my time spent in helping bring in new members and educating them on the memberships.
good,Great company with benefits. Flexible with school schedules & opportunities for different positions. Keeping to yourself and doing your job there are no problems.
good,"costco is a great place to work if you don;t have any goals of advancement coupled with a thriving famuly environment, it is stressful to your ohysical health, and not a good fit for broad thinkers,"
good,"As far as Costco Wholesale goes, it has a great company philosophy with great pay and benefits.  However, the culture there was fairly hostile from other employees and management.  The scheduling was solely made for the business.  If you are willing to work and have a schedule that varies, Costco might be a great place for you."
good,"If someone is employed at Costco longer than 3 years, it is easy to get burned out. In other words, an individual will lose interest in their job, they become alienated from their work."
good,Typically very busy and often thrown into situations with little clarification. There is a large diversity of people who work at costco. People from all different backgrounds.
good,Very good workplace and good consistent hours and expectations. Was willing to work with a school schedule and loves its employees. If you want to work in an environment that pushes you this is a good place.
good,"Overall, Costco was a very good company to work for. It just takes a long time to get a full-time position, which I needed. I found a better opportunity which led up to me leaving the company."
good,packing all produce and cleaning the department on a daily basis whilst helping customers with any problems they may have with orders or finding a product
good,"If you like fast paced work, this is the place for you. If you have ever shopped at costco, expect your day to look exactly the way you see. There really isn't time for bathroom breaks, but you'll fit it in. It's fun once you get the hang of everything, it's kind of a flow but it all depends on the type of person."
good,Good benefits and pay for the type of work. There is definitely  teamwork mentality and positive atmosphere most of the time. The hours are a bit rough though with no weekly consistency making it hard to have a personal life and they do not want full time employees.
good,"Very fast paced and always busy. Management made sure you were prepared before sending you out on your own. Most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits, hourly pay and other co-workers always willing to help. Management was sometimes biased and not understanding of severe personal issues affecting attendance."
good,"I enjoyed all of the opportunities that I was  given over the years"
good,"Benefits really add up if you stay long enough, but how effectively and efficiently your department works rest depends on your manager and the warehouse as a whole works the same way. Good managers and everything is great but there is no one warehouse with all good managers. They all have people that will make you wonder how they ever became managers and they will all have managers who pick up the slack for the others."
good,"Over all it is a stable work environment, but like any company, it had its flaws in management. Also, starting employees were held to a very strict code of conduct for a three month period, which made it very hard to stay motivated."
good,I would have to say the management was not all that caring about medical problems. The company is good but the management is not. Some of the supervisors leave the workers outside for 3 or more hours in the hot sun in either 105 degrees or 100 and forgetting they are out there.
good,Great place to work if you want a stable job with great income. Hard to move up in the company as many people have worked there for so long. Hard place to get into.
good,"It is very fast paced and you are kind of thrown on the job and learn on the job from day one.  Everyone starts as part time and gets paid $13 an hour. Depending on how many hours you are there and how long you stay you will start getting raised every 1000. hours.  It is a good place to work if you can put in 3 to 4 years.  It is physical and there is no work life balance.  You work afternoons, evenings and weekends. Your hours can get better if hired full time and by seniority."
good,"Depending on the day of the week, work was manageable. I learned most days at times I would be behind and had to manage my time better for members, managers and as well as myself. "
good,"Dont work for this company, it is not worth the time or effort needed to grow with this company, to much effort is needed to become a manager. Its not what you know but who you know."
good,"Costco is an excellent career if you plan to work multiple jobs or plan to sit in the same position for years, but for those with motivation you will be stuck at a dead end fighting seniority until you have enough to be able to move within the company. Ambition and hard work are appreciated but not rewarded, and as often as not those with enough seniority not to get touched abuse this untouchability on a store level"
good,"Good for College Students."
good,"I started off in clothes, folding, got moved to the bakery and then got moved to the hot dog stand. The moving around in departments was not at my request but I was flexible and able to do it."
good,"I applied for the position in October and was quickly hired. I stayed until mid-January. This was a fun, fast-paced job helping customers at the front-end of the store, as well as in the parking lot. I had hoped that it would turn into a full-time permanent position, but I was laid off in mid-January. I enjoyed working with the people (customers and fellow employees). This is a good job for people who like to stay busy and are primarily young and healthy."
good,Great Company BUT everyone start off as seasonal and even if you work hard there a possibility that they will not keep you after seasonal is over. So if you have a second job dont leave it until you know they are going to keep you after seasonal is over!!! Very busy place to work.
good,"Costco is a good job if you are looking to be anywhere but their meat department. Highly stressful, bad hours, management lies about conditions, low pay for the work done, constant smell of death at work, kills sense of smell, and understaffed department to maintain high profitability."
good,"Not a bad place to work. The manager was quite new, so things were a little chaotic at first. The patients were sometimes quite aggressive as well, but nothing out of the ordinary."
good,"Costco is a great first job if you can get in. Once there, if you work extremely well AND can play the politics game, you can advance somewhat quickly. You can mostly expect to work your hours until you reach top level pay for a clerk which is like $23 per hour. This takes approximately 6-7 years of full time, 40 hours per week. You can continue applying for available supervisor positions, but you must ultimately wait in line for your chance to be promoted."
good,Workplace culture is great. Everyone who works here are very friendly and helpful. Hours are very flexible. Management is also friendly and makes sure new employees are trained to their best ability.
good,"Great Company to work for, amazing benefits and pension plans, good amount of sick days, family days etc. Only complainant is management at the warehouse level."
good,"I hired into this organization because of the flight department.  As a major company, I expected to grow with the growth of the department.  This has not proven to be possible, and there is not an obvious path to continue.  At no point, even with my urging, has management been willing to progress my career.  I have heard from other employees of the same problem, and many people have left.  I think I could handle the lack of career advancement if the pay were improving.  The forces of government are keeping the pay unaffordable, and the company has no intentions of compensating for the increasing cost of living."
good,"Costco is a great company to work for as they take care of their employees, and they hire/ promote from within. The employees and managers are very friendly and you can tell they care"
good,"The only complaint I have about working at Costco wholesale is that, when we couldn't keep any seasonal staff on for the spring, they required me to work full time hours, despite the fact that I was a full time student at the time. However, they were very understanding when I told them I had to quit"
good,"No matter what section you work in it will be hard work because of how understaffed most locations are. Deli and front end are both extremely fast paced! Benefits are good for a reason and pay is alright, but could be better considering all the labor."
good,Problem is they are more focused on personal gains( management). Then helping others make the company more successful. There is room for growth but its who you likes you not based on your work ethic.
good,Costco Canada is a good place to work if you are looking for an entry level position that has a lot of room for potential advancement as well as fairly significant benefits.
good,I thought Costco was a good place to work. While going to school they provided a great benefits package and helped me get thru school. The benefits were great and provided a lot of mental comfort.
good,Good place to work for students. It's a phisical work. Flexible schedule. Obligations to work every weekend. Often evening shifts. Good insurance and benefits.
good,The time I worked with this company I think I learned a lot about customer service and how the culture of the company impacts members in such a positive way. The most enjoyable part of this job was building professional relationships with my team members.
good,It was a seasonal employment position. A lot of the regular employees were wonderful to work with a few were not and the same went with the supervisors.
good,"In working at Costco, I learned several things which consisted of management, leadership, and training skills. The workplace culture is highly competitive and at times can be quite overwhelming. Unfortunately, I don't feel that education is valued in the workplace and it has no influence on advancement. This being the case if you are educated corporate is the way to go. The warehouse atmosphere has changed dramatically over that last 10 years and is becoming slightly oversaturated causing a bottle neck in advancement. As a result, it is a great place to work however, once you hit the ceiling if you are looking to grow, I suggest looking elsewhere."
good,"Costco warehouse is a great company for someone who does not intend on moving higher in there education thus, only going so far in there careers. At Costco you will work weekends no matter what. Only the people that have seniority over 4years or more well have morning/afternoon shifts. But there benefits are amazing, and workman's comp. is even better (the turn around for an injury is less then 6 months) its awesome. The people that work there are average people and no one thinks there better then anyone else, so all the supervisors and managers are very approachable. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a members (customer) if there not happy they will make sure you will have a bad day just like them. I think the best part about the job would be the employees that I'm surrounded by, they make the job more bearable and sometimes fun."
good,"Fast paced, constantly interacting with people, providing the best service you can find in retail business. I learned that you should by all means continue your education and get a degree because otherwise you advancement in the company is going to be based 90% of the time on how much favor or charm you imposed on upper management. Some people are naturally gifted to do that so get a degree it secures your opportunities for the better. Culture is cool as long as you do your job you will have a paycheck to survive. hardest part is being on your feet all day and dealing with all kinds of characters. Most enjoyable part is having a real sense of job security."
good,"Unfortunately there is no discount, we just get a free 2% costco wholesale membership card while we work there and can put up to 3 more people on our account."
good,"I worked for the food court, but was train in all of the departments, where I would sometimes help out. I would be the food maker and would make the pizzas, salads, etc. Take breaks every two hours of working and a lunch every 4 hours. It would be busy some days and other days it would be a super busy. We took phone orders and would have to make sure food is cook properly and given out to our customers as soon as possible."
good,You become family with everyone. Unfortunately they have poor management. Starting pay is great with awesome benefits. You do have a couple of rude customers you have to put up with.
good,The job is not exciting at all. A lot of time is spent standing in one place doing repetitive activites. Job is very fast paced and very demanding and the breaks are short
good,Costco is a relaxing place to work and they stand behind the employees.  Job security is very big at the Costco.  Since they are globally located you have many opportunities for moving around within the company.
good,speedy flow of customers through a fast paced work place. meeting the needs of the members while being flexible and able to complete a multitude of tasks
good,"management made workers work harder then they would as you would bust your butt to serve food and give customers great service they would stand on their phones or tell you how poorly you are working, on the up side your coworkers made i worth being there all day."
good,"Unfortunately, at the warehouse that I worked at, the management was horrible at warehouse #670! They valued profits over their own employees. You had to do things a certain way and couldn't express your creativity to get a job done. The job is stressful while working under lots of pressure. If you get into an argument with a member, best of luck trying to walk away without a write up."
good,I used to love Costco but I would love a change I want to move up and have a change I am not happy there no more speciallly with the new management  we are getting in the company
good,Managment don't listen to suggestions when brought the facts. Rather stick to old ways then with new better ways. Which would help increase business and profit.
good,"I was the guy pushing carts in the parking lot and loading people bags. I also was kind of the every ones assistant in the store, if some one needed help, i was there."
good,"I worked at costco for the 2017 summer seasonal position. It was a good place to work for the summer as a student because of the good pay ($13 an hour and $17 on Sundays), but going back to school i would never be able to handle it. They give long hours even to seasonal employees who are expected to get the least amount, and it is so hard trying to get days off. I had to miss out on family weddings and trips because my time off wasn't approved."
good,Customer Focused and presentation and product know how is a must.All employees are willing to help out each other depending on the need of services required in each of the customer or the department at any given time of the day.
good,The job is very quick paced. You must remain professional at all times and greet the customer with a smile. You work in many departments within the store.
good,"Sitting all day between gray spaces. Not enough movement and a lot of repetitive tasks."
good,"Very fast paced"
good,"the most enjoyable part of this job was also the most difficult part, the 100% customer service policy. They have an excellent public relations and customer service to their creed. I believe that all companies should be based on a customer first set of values."
good,"Main task; Sales, product descriptions, assisting members (loading up), Housekeeping, Cash register operation, telephone queries. minimising shrinkage. Reporting any arising issues to supervisors/managers."
good,"Was stuck in an early shift 4am till 10am. Not given many hours at all and could not switch to a different shift or move to full time. Some of the new managers were good, but some of the higher up managers you had to walk on egg shells in front of."
good,"This is a fun, fast pace job but the hours are firm and they are not flexible. If daycare isn't an issue this place is great!!! There are great opportunities to those who are able to relocate to Washington!!"
good,"Good place to work for but the ware house closed down after 5 years. Moved to Columbus Indiana. To far for me to drive to keep my job, not enough money to relocate."
good,"advancement opportunities are good since they only hire within the company. takes a while to top out on pay, but once that happens you are making a decent living at 23+/ hr"
good,Great place. hours are like retail so you will work weekends but have holidays off. Management lazy. customers are either amazing or snobby. great for part time.
good,"As my first job, Costco was a positive experience. Initially I had expected a more rigid and a very labor-work orientated job, but my manager and supervisors always ensured my well-being and welcomed me into the work force at Costco."
good,"Great place to work exceptional health benefits. Great co workers. "
good,"Simply put, standing at a cash register, assembly line service is neither challenging or rewarding. "
good,"Very fast paced, always a task to do or Members to help. Great people kept the work fun and dynamic. Sometimes free food is brought for the employees for events or birthdays."
good,I love my fellow employees at Costco 249 but the management could use some restructuring for sure.  The Store manager is the best manager i have ever worked for but the department managers are some of the worst I've worked under.
good,muy buena empresa para laborar muy buenas pretaciones muy buen ambiente de trabajo pero aveces son muy negreros
good,"it was a nice place to work, it made me work hard and learn how to problem solve. The management was amazing and very flexible."
good,Very good place of employment. Co workers were excellent. The management was very unprofessional which led to my untimely firing. The overall experience was good one though.
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in and going straight to the back where all the coworkers meet and get prepared for their demos and where the breakers get their needed supply for the work day. And then the manager usually talks to all the employees and tells them either new changes or if he has to leave before we close for the night. Then we would gather all of our items we need for that demo and we would go out onto the floor to our designated work space, and then we would set up our station and start preparing what ever it is that we were assigned to sell and advertise to the people. We would then start putting out samples for the customers and giving them a small description about the product and what it goes best with and its benefits."
good,"Starting at 4:30am, until 1:30 pm , shift my responsibilities were to stock the merchandise in every department in the warehouse besides the kitchen. This was a physically demanding job which I enjoyed"
good,I have worked at Costco for 2 years now. The job is fast past and keeps you of a chair for as long as possible. Managers aren't the best but that is what happenes when management hires friends and family that don't have management skills.
good,"Costco is very good company to work. They have good employee benefits but really hard to get full time position. Lots to learn , I learned more about customer service and different rotating department schedule will thought me lot. Good team work. Hardest part of job is Food court department and most enjoyable is front end."
good,It Is A Great Place For Kids Going To College or If You pacticane to wait to Climb the ladder and You Pay Union Dues Are A lot So You Need To Climb the ladder.
good,"Costco can be a great place to work, compensating its employees well for the tasks they ask of you. The work requires little to no thought which left me longing for more."
good,"I loved working at Costco, one of the most fun jobs ever, very fast paced. You stay busy, people are friendly, and start up pay and benefits are good. If you can get in , try to be as flexible as possible, they loooove that and it will get you far with them!"
good,"Es una  buena empresa, amigable y responsable con sus trabajadores. Compañeros amigables y buena gerencia."
good,"C'est un bon travail pour ceux qui sont rentrer jeune et on réussis à rester assez longtemps pour atteindre de bons salaires. L'entreprise n'est pas mauvaise , cela doit dépendre du style de gestion des  cadres, mais ceux-ci sont souvent tous recruter a l'interne et malhreusement semble manquer d'ouverture ."
good,"Starting at 5am, getting together with my team going over moves and things like that. After the store opens i normally cashier."
good,Always busy! Excellent member service skills and adaptability are a must to thrive in this work environment. Good benefits package.
good,The job’s starting pay is great and after 90 days you get great benefits like paid vacation and sick time as well as a 401K. The job is very redundant and not exciting. It was a great job while I was in college. The scheduling every week changes and it is hard to ever get the same days off every week so you can plan stuff with friends and family. You have to know a year advanced when you want to go on vacation or you won’t get the time off.
good,"A typical morning includes: setting up room and putting machines together then bringing in the daily shipment. Then cutting and trimming product, packing, wrapping and stocking case. Nights include taking room apart and cleaining and sanitizing. All along with maintaining case to be showtime ready."
good,"bon tremplin pour planifier votre avenir."
good,"Very fast paced busy place to work, you never run out of things to do. If you are not up to speed things can get quite confusing due to changing placement of products almost ever week and it is a huge warehouse. Great company to work for although some employees thrive on gossip and rumors.For the most part management was pretty fair, they did have their favorites and it showed. There were a few times that I found out personal information related to my job from employees instead of management. The hardest parts about working there is just keeping up with knowledge on products that are in rotation and in stock."
good,I stayed here to save up to go travelling. Retail is always a challenging environment but one where customer service is learnt and taken with me ever since.
good,"This was an interesting job, never the same thing, but enjoyed the environment. Most of the people were very professional and very decent. Very good place to work and the customers are awesome!"
good,Aprendí a usar una caja pues fue uno de mis primeros trabajos en Costco. El ambiente laboral es bueno y exigente lo que ayuda a que las auditorias sean mucho más fáciles.
good,Costco overall is a great company. management is good but its easy to feel unappreciated. they constantly tell you that this is a great job that everyone would love to have.
good,"High volume of customers, crazy conditions. Great place to work through college. Tough to advance through politics and managers keeping their bubbles intact."
good,The level of physical activity takes a toll on your body long term. The company itself is a great company. A typical day at work is very busy and fast paced environment. I really enjoy my co-workers there is allot of unity among us.
good,"Hardest part about dealing with the job was having to deal with tough weather or bad drivers in the parking lot."
good,"the job place was a good place to be, never a had any regret working with them. our supervisors are quite understanding, such that they give workers time to work independent thereby ."
good,"Costco was a very energetic and fast paced work place, management was not very good but over all a great place to work."
good,"I worked in the deli as a deli clerk. I answered phones, placed orders, made product for the department, put away product when it came in. I would be there early to set up and make sure everything was ready to go when it was time for Costco to open."
good,Spend most of the shift operating the forklift in the designated areas at Costco. When i'm not on the forklift i am re-stocking areas needed.
good,A typical day would include stocking products making sure the warehouse was ready for members.  Them helping members once the warehouse was open.  I learned a lot in the optical area.  Management was understanding.  Co-workers were great and friendly.  The hardest part was lifting heavy merchandise.  The best was the benefits.
good,"•	Working with marketing manager on targeted customer acquisition plans and lead execution of customer events."
good,Costco paid very well.  the insentives were amazing.  an example of these iinsentives was bonuses in our pay.
good,walk in building and print out count sheets and truck loads that are coming in.  walk the department to see whats sold and what need to be dropped or moved. walk building to find product and drop it. stock and build products and get ready for opening.
good,"Fast pace work environment. Daily task included running front-end cashiers and assistants, monitoring coverage needs for multiple departments and performing daily sales audits."
good,"The benefits and pay are well exceeding that of other jobs in this field and one can make a good living simply by being a cashier with the company. My main issue with the company is that while attending college I was told that the primary hiring is within the company and that with a degree in any field I would be looking at advancement in the future, however once I graduated with honors I was laughed at and told that I have the same chances as any other employee at advancing and that I would not receive special treatment simply because of my education. My other issue with the company is how I have seen the treatment of people who are hurt on the job. I have noticed that even if you are hurt in a work accident you are treated as a liability and no longer of use to the warehouse."
good,This is a company that allows you to start as temp and work your way into a full time position fairly quickly. They do have a busy season in which they are demanding as far as the hours you are expected to work but it's not unreasonable or a surprise. The supervisors and management are visible on a daily basis and will listen to employees if they come to them with an issue. They offer an above average benefits package and the only con to this job was a relatively low starting rate.
good,Una gran experiencia en la que tengo grandes recuerdos y me llena de satisfacción el poder recordarlos.
good,once highered oganization will not release you unless you deserve it
good,"lots of hard work, management will play favorites, so kiss butt every chance you get. did not like the union. Good benefits."
good,"packed grocery carts, ran cash tills, ran for products for clients, helped clients load their purchases, product knowledge a must."
good,A typical day at work i usually stayed calm and do what my managers told me to do
good,Horaire de jour car j'étudie encore du lundi au jeudi de 15:30 à 21:00
good,"Costco is a wholesale club that is extremely customer oriented. In order to maximize the value we provide to our members, we constantly move product and change the merchandise on our sales floor. A typical day includes a first shift that moves product based on sales and promotions to primary or secondary sales locations. 2nd shifts handle sales floor recovery, inventory ""drop lists"" for restocking, and member service, and a third shift handles member service, closing, and floor recovery. "
good,"Costco already has it benefits of just being a member (customer), but being a Costco employee has its own perks! Provides Great benefits and 401K plans.  Management is great to work with. Paid Holidays, and there is room to move up! "
good,"Each Costco is ran differently, no consistency  within company."
good,"Started at 3:00 am. Picked up work route from dispatch and did my pre-trip on equipment. Delivered to Stores driving thru Bay Area traffic. Sometimes pickup back hauls from Venders and deliver to warehouse. Most of the drivers were great to work with. Like me, they were always willing to help others and do what it took to get the job done."
good,Up and coming force in the hearing industry creating a paradigm shift that will impact the way hearing instruments are sold and serviced.
good,"Began as cashier, quickly promoted to working in food service as menu planner and development. Trained new employees."
good,"Great benefits, great co-workers. must work weekends and retail schedules.Discount on membership card."
good,Normal full time and part time working hours. They adjust to your school schedule. Great benefits. Need work on training there people on training others and cross training to become a better team.
good,"Shipping and receiving , loading and unloading trucks.Management was hard working and easy to get along with. Also my co-workers were good workers and also easily to get along with.The hardest part of the job was stocking the warehouse.I enjoyed working on the docks."
good,I would assist customers in their transactions. I greeted customers when they arrived at my cash and assited them in loading their items on the belt as well as into their buggys. If they requested additional merchandise I would do a run and retrieve the item. I also occasionally performed cash register duties such as transactions and counting of the till. Management was always willing to help in times of need. I got along greatly with my co-workers. They always helped me when i needed assistance as I did with them. They made my enjoy my job that much more. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items into the buggys. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different people everyday
good,"I can honestly say that i love the people that i work with at Costco, and i have a lot of fun working for and with each of them, i get along well with everyone, even the customers. But as with any job things can weigh on you and begin to take a toll. A typical day at work for me is folding 35 tables of clothing that gets messed up in a matter of seconds after finishing. I am off late hours closing shift every day of the week. even thoug i can request for time off i cant have every weekend off so it takes a lot of time from me to be able to hang out with my family or even church events at times, wich mean a lot to me. I would say the closing late each night and not having weekends off is the hardest part of the job for me, also folding clothes really is and endless job. What i like most is that just about everyone managers and supervisors are pretty down to earth each having their own sense of humor but also knowing how to get the job done. :)"
good,"awesome company. very low employee turn over rate, great benefits."
good,"Came in at 4am till 1:30pm Helped on the Rec Dock then stocked ailses prior to the store opening, once the store opened we were to b the opening cashier till 1:30pm"
good,managment could be more put together and a bit more considerate to employees needs
good,"Review SSOP sanitation logs for previous night's cleanup. Receive meat delivery for accuracy. Computer time to check sales, print new signs, check company email, and produce production plan for the meatcutters. Help cutters with re-works and go over cutting list with them. I will wrap, set up the meat case, and stock merchandise, to be ready for opening. Throughout the remainder of the day, I will work in the department, doing what is needed, while making time to do the meat order, work schedules, comp shops, safety training, performance evaluations, etc."
good,Was challanging demanding but exiting position. Management was horrible though. coworkers were nice and cooperative towards teamwork in taking care of assignment.
good,"Although it was a fast paced environment, it was well managed except for often being under staffed.  Costco is a great company for the customer and when working on a Sunday, they did offer a differential that many retailers don't."
good,"The work hours vary and promotion decisions are based on seniority, unless management want to base them on skill and ability. Very hard to tell if you have a shot."
good,While working at Costco I learned how to work well with other people and under pressure. A typical day at work was packing people's groceries and restocking the shelves.
good,Perfect good management great workers work well with others flexible schedule times and dates holidays good pay no problems just a great experience overall
good,"They don't give much training, you learn from watching and asking questions. A very busy store which is great because time goes by very quickly. Fast paced so be ready to work. Hard on the body. Seasonal hiring is just that, not sure if they will keep you or not. Have a back up ready."
good,"on ce sent bien au travail, il y a une bonne entente avec les membres de l'équipe"
good,The pay is better and the organization of operations is incredible but generally speaking their seems to be an heir of classism and some racism involved in the upper management
good,Very fair pay and guaranteed raises every so many hours worked. They pay well and expect hard work from their employees. Good staff room for breaks. Management staff was mostly good.
good,"Good experience working there, good balanced work, good amount of pay, peers were nice people. Poor management towards the end of my time there as a new manager came in."
good,Good company to start not bad if you like dealing with people overall good company with great benefits Senior friendly as well . Decent pay and has temporary positions for seasonal to be able to make decent money
good,Costco is a fast paced work environment with aspects that are labor intensive but great exercise as well. You work as a team to get the store ready for open on time.
good,Its a nice clean and organized environment to work at. Everything's divides equally. Everyone knows what their doing its a perfect opportunity and gain experience workplace to apply for
good,A typical day at Costco was opening the gas station and helping all the members with any questions or technicalities. Its a quick pace job that requires training in more than one department.
good,"Spent 9 years with the company. Great benefits and pay is consistent and fair for hourly employees. As you move into management, especially upper management pay doesn't align with expectations. Work life balance can be a struggle across the board from hourly employees to salary management. Management work life balance can become a huge struggle especially if you have a family."
good,"There were a lot of things that they were promising and it made you excited to come to work each day but this job brought on so much unnecessary stress. Yes, I completely understand wanting everything to be perfect for your customers but screaming at your employees when something wasn't 'just so' is unacceptable as well. I think what makes this job worth it is they pay well but that probably it. They also constantly remind you that you could lose your job at any point and are 100% replaceable without notice."
good,"It is a very busy, hustle and bustle working environment. Workload is heavy and rewarding. Benefits are really good compared to most companies. Overall I enjoy the work and the people."
good,"Very demanding physically. Very competitive with seasonal hiring they only keep 3 out of 10 candidates usually"
good,"Some people love to work there, but it is not for everyone.  Personally I like to shop there more. For the most part the staff there are friendly, but there are many people and you can get lost in the shuffle"
good,"Costco Wholesale as a business treats its employees fairly, and pays very well comparable to other businesses of similarity. In the first years there are chances to advance and become promoted. I believe where it really shined as an employer was the benefits they provided; healthcare, 401K and even dental. Advancement did become a problem when workers were maxed out (reached highest pay level) where promotional opportunities start to become a little elusive. I would risk to say that an issue I and many coworkers felt and feared w/Costco was a lack of protection and communication. It is extremely customer based, which is a wonderful tool in developing stronger skills with the public, but depending on management any complaint from anyone about anything, whether serious or quite trivial, seemed met w/lack of belief in its own employees. Now this is a serious, prestigious customer service warehouse known for its expertise, conflicts like customer relations going wrong happen and Costco does go through lengths to teach by example how to avoid issues and how to solve them. But also w/in a customer service based employment, there should be a certain amount of protection or belief towards its own employees that go to great lengths for them, and as stated depending on management this seemed lacking. Other than that being said, Costco Wholesale is definitely an employer that will teach several useful skills in the business world, it expects only the best from its employees as it should, and offers several various departments in which to learn assets."
good,"working at costco is really new experiance for me,  after immigrating iam learning almost every day in costco working with different community people and learned how our smile and great to others had the impact which can change even the first meeting into long life relations as customers,  moreover working in costco as team member is really positive."
good,"A typical day goes by real fast. There is always something to do and something to clean. The hardest part of the job is that it can get monotonous. Management can be a little frustrating at times with so many different people telling you what to do. the social aspect of this job is really nice tho, being able to interact with so many people every day is nice."
good,"Costco tends to value seniority over experience. I knew a guy who had prior experience working on cars, but when he tried to get transferred to tire center, they chose someone who had been working there longer than him despite the experience disparity between the two."
good,I do enjoy my time at Costco but unfortunately they very rarely give full-time to cafe assistants like my self. due to this i am looking for another workplace that gives fulltime.
good,"Coworkers are AWESOME, Costco knows how to hire. P.G. Costco "
good,Great place with good people. Lower starting wage but if you stay you are treated well and there are many chances for advancement. Shifts in seasonal sales can cause hour shortage.
good,"Costco will always hold a place in my heart but ever since the CEO changed. The culture has too. They are slowly becoming like every other retailer. Money first, then quality,  then employees. Miss the good ol days. Lots of opportunity if you are willing to give your life over to Costco."
good,"Fast pace, help the members and understand some behaviors are not pleasant, coworkers are awesome majority of the time, they are willing to help you and teach you, my direct management has been awesome literally during my time. Communication can use work and is an ongoing process.  Advancement is interestingly ambiguous."
good,"Management was accommodating for days off needed.  No down time during the holiday season.   On your feet all day, except for your mandatory breaks/lunch.  If you like being up and moving this is a great job."
good,"great place to work sometimes super hard to get the days off you want, don't have a set schedule, to plan your days off are random. you learned a lot and enjoy meeting nice people there."
good,"Good place to work for very fast pace., management is very strict , lack of direction,  as long as your doing your work your fine. Pay is good but lack of information if your are kept from seasonal."
good,"Costco has great benefits and an amazing culture....on the business side of the house. The benefits are the same on the IT side, but the culture is different. It is not ""Costco""."
good,"I work for a child company of Costco Wholesale, that is, Costco Travel. It's a good place to work but things move quite slowly. If you like fast pace, it may not be for you."
good,I overall had a good experience there and they gave me skills I need for other jobs. The management also was very understanding about a lot of things I would recommend it to a friend looking for a job
good,Costco is a great company. I would say they Over pay most of the employees and I'm not complaining. However Costco is a very seniority based employee system and usually once hired your not leaving. I would also say nepotism is pretty rampant.
good,"exelente empleo para medios tiempos , y ya no tanto para tiempos completos es demasiada presión"
good,"Costco over all was a great company to do seasonal work with. The Sunday time & 1/2 pay for all working employees, was a great bonus. Some of the Supervisors (red vest) were cool and down to earth."
good,The work environment was positive yet fast paced. I learned customer service skills and supervision skills as well. Hard part was the hours being changed often. The best part was the people I worked with
good,"Nice to work as a team player, good pay for physical work and god benefits. I learn to maximize my time when performing an activity. Also, the workplace culture is fun."
good,"If your looking for advancement this is not the place, opportunities are rarely available. If your looking for a great place with decent benefits and you are not looking to move up."
good,"great work place good benefits. fast past work place "
good,"The job is based on seniority and favorites. Unfortunately, working hard does not get you to far and its more of a waiting game to get promoted. Promotions are given based on not having write ups and seniority. The work schedule is not steady for part timers and its rough on a work/life balance. The company tends to put the company needs before employee needs."
good,If I was younger when I was first hired I might have had more opportunities for advancement and full time work. I did enjoy my time there and the people were great.
good,Costco needs work with management but otherwise is decent. There were chances of moving up. I was able to train in different areas in the store. Benefits were great.
good,"It was good job but it can be stressful and had to work every weekend. The benefits were very good."
good,I worked for the Optometrist in the optical department helping to schedule appointments and helping the patients. The patients and regular Costco employees were very friendly and I enjoyed going to work.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy pesado, mucha rivalidad entre compañeros, humillaciones y malos tratos de superiores, no se reconocen los logros pero se castigan mucho los errores."
good,"Costco does a great job taking care of their hourly employees. If you are a person whom is good with doing your job and going home, this is the place for you"
good,"Has been a good experience for the most part, my only criticism is that there is room for more management and leadership training for supervisory staff.  Seems like most of them got ""grandfather claused"" into management/supervisory roles without adequate leadership training"
good,Costco is a great company to work for. it's definitely a company that invests in its associates. I had to relocate and started my family.  People are the best part of the job. You get meet all kinds of people
good,I mean it's Costco. I think we all have heard the stories and know what to expect. I worked there for 2 years and got trained in a lot of different departments.
good,A company which has great benefits pays well and is flexible. The most enjoyable part of my jobs is caring for my patients and exceeding their expectations.
good,"Good Pay, several areas of work to choose from and several avenues for employment advancement.  Managers very depending which area of country you work."
good,There was plenty to do to stay busy. Worked with moving around pallets of products with pallet jacks. There wasn't much interaction with other workers most days. everyone was pretty spread out through the warehouse.
good,I get the store prepped and ready for the day. Sometimes its stocking the sales floor or unloading trucks of merchandise.  Sometimes I work in recieving and shipping.
good,"fun place, not as bad as amazon or so I have been told, still very constant 1,000 people in qu. waiting at times 45 minutes.  They need a online chat which is instant people hate waiting 45 minutes so they are angry and then the wait makes it worse."
good,"Fast paced work environment, could be very rewarding helping customers with their shopping experience making it a smooth and efficient process. As with most retail the weekends could get quite busy and fast paced turned could turn into outright hectic at times but being able to navigate through that was an excellent learning experience in patience. Costco pays well if one desires to move forward with the company and they do offer benefits to those who are part time which is rare. I do recommend Costco as an employer for most people but those who do want to work their must understand that it can definitely be fast paced and to be prepared for that."
good,"I love working at Cosctco. Problems occur with management at times, but over all the work environment is a great place to start a career and or continue schooling."
good,early mornings are always busy specially as a merchandiser. There is a bit of politics when it comes to management. Not enough hours for seasonal employees.
good,"I would get to work about fifteen minutes before my shift started to just relax and be ready. During the busy season I'd make sure to leave myself 30 to 40 minutes to look for a parking spot. I never wanted to show up late because I couldn't find a place to park. Once I clocked in I'd be assigned a 2 cashier lines to assist. The work started immediately. That was one thing I liked about the job, there's no sitting around. I was constantly moving. The hardest part of the job was looking up and not seeing an end to the customers in line, at times it felt relentless but I still managed to get through it. All the cashiers have different work routines, so it was a little tricky trying to learn how they needed the assistant to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some great people and interacting with the customers. If given the opportunity I'd work for them again, maybe find a different location."
good,"a fast paced, labor intensive, fun place to work with lots of collaboration with supervisors, co workers and registers managing members requests warehouse operations."
good,Food and safety handling.  Sold Costco products and sampled products to customers.  Document customer feedback and sales. Stock products. Document customers feedback and daily goal of product assigned. Set up and prepare work area for the day throughout Costco store. Worked with the demo staff not with Costco.
good,"I was only there for seasonal work, 3 months. Fun place to work. I was surprised that I was not called back to work when the holiday season was over. Oh well."
good,"I was a holiday seasonal employee.  I enjoyed working there.  I wish I could get a permanent position.  Job was fast paced, so you won't be bored.  There are a variety of jobs, so there is opportunity if you get hired."
good,"les tâches effectuées varient selon le nombre de client, selon les journées, il n'y a jamais de routine, le travail en équipe est très agréable…"
good,It is a great place to work. Most locations have good managers yet the one I was promoted into had terrible managers which creates a horrible morale. Lots of politics and favoritism.
good,"Costco is a great place for anyone who wants a stable life and knows what they can receive out of this job. Employees are treated well but sometimes getting into management can be a little stressful because it can be a long an on going process that might not even see you get the results you wanted, even if you put the work in for that position. Another complaint I have is that you're just a number in this giant company, just like any other massive company. They do treat employees very well with pay and benefits."
good,I actually assisted in the grand opening for this location in coal Springs for cosco it was very fun to start off it also was very fast paced as time went along we actually signed  new members
good,"Starting off at Costco was pretty great till management treats you like your nothing. Everyone seemed so nice till you walked out of the room and they start talking bad about you. Multiple times they would throw all the trash on the ground and leave a mess. No one would tell you they were leaving and leave you with the whole mess to clean up cause they think it’s funny. Also, there is people working there with serious drug problems . There is a select few worker that really put in good work though, but good people are hard to come by that work there"
good,"Overall it was good, but I was not hired for the position that I applied for which was cashier. I was put into maintenance! Then I had to fight to get that job! Calling for two weeks straight to get the job. So you tell me? Yes I got more experience, but definitely, not what I anticipated."
good,Go co workers but need better management . Great teaching skills when available. Hours are good and members can be rude but still a great company to work for.
good,"Costco is a great company.  I was lucky to be in outside sales, representing the company at community events, employee benefit fairs and participating in new location grand openings. I met many great people and had a lot of fun doing outside events.  Having to sell hard within the warehouse was draining though.  They promote from within but the field is very competitive and not based on merit but upon time served.  You had to wait your turn.  The best way to obtaining a promotion is to move to a new warehouse.  Regardless, you will work hard, but the benefits are really good."
good,"Check with our lead for news updates.. Go to pur work station and begin our process from washing lenses to scraping, edging, and or bevel. Last process would be to mound the lenses. Picking orders wpuld also be a job function. Very fast paced but steady work taht very rewarding. My favorate part of my job was the cutting and shaping of the lenses. I learned do much about making eye glasses and how to fix any glitches with the machines. I enjoyed going to work"
good,Your overall experience depends on your location. Some stores are under great management. Others not so much. They work with your schedule for the most part if you are going to school.
good,"- Process and manage after hour inventory shipments for the meat department and deli "
good,"Good work place, seasonal competitiveness within company, management and below have tough time communicating. Good breaks and decent hours but tough to gain permanency"
good,I would work again at Costco.  Great people and busy days. Job security concerns me in regards to the outside marketing position but other then that it was a good experience.
good,Great place to work if you don't have much experience in other fields. If management decides they don't like you you'll constantly be torn down whenever they feel the opportunity.
good,"As a seasonal between jobs job it was good. The pay is very good  and potential benefits are a huge bonus. A permanent positions would be worth working. Managers are good overall, can be strict and focused on the wrong things. Very few hours or positions are available though. Even permanent employees said hours were low in slow seasons."
good,"They were very competitive and friendly here.  As an employee, you wanted to run and work as quick as possible for this company.  I hope to stay along with Costco as long as I can."
good,If you're only looking for part time this is a good job with great benefits. Be prepared to have a frustrating schedule and to work a lot of nights when you first start. Lots of people think they're the boss. Gets frustrating after a while but overall a good job once you're settled in.
good,"As a seasonal employee, i was forced to run from the checkout stands to different aisle locations and either get products or put them back for customers."
good,It’s a really good place to work but it’s easy to get stuck here and hard to advance unless you devote all your time. Favoritism is also a problem depending on management. Otherwise if you do well you can earn a very good career here but be prepared to work. When it’s busy things can get very stressful.
good,"Typical day consists of department meetings to review previous days sales/volume.  What went right, what processes could run better.  Today’s plan, volume, available staff, current promotions, etc."
good,Management wasn’t the best and hours always varied. Depends o t he department you we’re placed in from the start. Okay as a part time job but hard to get in as full time.
good,It’s ok for a part time job but it’s not a career I want to progress in. Some of the managers and supervisors lack the skills and knowledge. Almost all the employees are unhappy.
good,The best part of the job was the fantastic people I worked with. The biggest struggle was the amount of customers our department had each day. I learned to work effectively in a team and play to each members strengths and assist them with their weaknesses.
good,"It can be very hectic because corporate limits our labor, yet so much needs to get done. You can only do your part but sometimes it feels like you can never do enough for it to run smoothly."
good,"It’s a very fast paced environment. A lot of lifting, running, large volume organizing/merchandising. Could be great advancement within 4 years or less but I didn’t see it to be very beneficial or gainful for an individual like myself. Would greatly benefit anyone that is fit, high energy, has organizational and time management skills. Management was tough but straight to the point. Customers are obnoxious here, gotta be able to do some regular crowd control during the holidays.  Must be warehouse computer literate - basic but definitely not for the not so tech savvy."
good,Favorstism and click environment plus micro manegement schedules are made to accomdate others and once made changes are rarely made causing stress over all the job that I had was under paid and had to pick up the slack for others. Busting out pans and dishes shouldn’t be part of a cashier or cook.
good,"A typical day working at Costco consists of the same routine mostly but varies when you can work in multiple departments. It is a fast paced environment where you learn to work with a sense of urgency. The thing about the management where I was employed, is that they promoted according to favoritism and don't have many other standards then that.  The most difficult part of the job is learning that patience is a virtue that is necessary when working a retail job, which holds truth at Costco because their number one priority is member service. The most enjoyable part about working at Costco is the bond that you build with your team members and co workers, and is what I miss most."
good,"Costco is a great company to work for and offer great benefits and opportunities for promotion."
good,Positive environment and friendly workers. The management and supervisors were very nice people. The work was not too hard and coworkers were ready to assist whenever needed.
good,Hard to get full time and not consistent schedule. Must be open to work at all hours. Hard to balance work and life. Management focused only on staff hours and making them as minimal as possible.
good,I loved working there. They were great at training you to take calls and service accounts. I just didn't like working nights and weekends. I also did not like working holidays.
good,"Friendly work environment with a fair balance of work. The physical aspects of the job took a bit of adjustment, but were not particularly challenging."
good,"La formation à l'arrivée fut très efficace et clair"
good,"As seasonal your ability to stay with company is very little. Managers walked around like chickens with their head cut off. Not the greatest for a new hire, would recommend getting hired before holiday craziness."
good,"Hard work but great benefits,  Lots to learn by working in different departments.  Management was ok.  Great co-workers, family atmosphere.  Good pay, great benefits!"
good,"Great quickpaced work place. The pay is fantastic for the work done, there are plenty of opportunities to move up within the company and the people who work here and generally fantastic to work with. The only downsides are poor management in various departments."
good,"driving the equipment. the hours were great. from 6.30am to 3pm. the hardest part was the arrogance in the leadership and the lazy people that continued to miss work. the best part was the benefits. the paid holidays off. the annual paid warehouse membership. free eyeglasses and contacts once a year as well as the $5,000 bonus once a year. their is a lot to like about Costco but sometimes certain mishaps can cause things to get a little stickey, but that's with any company."
good,"Hourly positions are well compensated once you've put in enough time. Once you've achieved a salaried status, the demands and work hours increase exponentially. A typical day for management involves wearing many hats, sometimes to an overwhelming degree. The biggest risk once you've reached management status is burning out."
good,Management played favorites at our building but the atmosphere was okay otherwise. The scheduling most of the time lacked common sense. The need to save payroll also didn't help.
good,Good location site and random free lunches but benefits and managers are not good and unprofessional. Meet new people who are helpful and nice. no job security
good,"Une très belle ambiance, des gens fabuleux avec une bonne esprit d'équipe!"
good,"For the most part was a good place to work.  Some of the people I worked with were hard to get along with, but management was great to deal with. Did not like having to cover front end"
good,"An average day of working passes by when the days are busy, unfortunately moving up is very competitive and often requires relocation. A lot of moving up in the company requires you to commit your life to it."
good,"While they are very accommodating it's difficult to get even part-time employment here. And they will work you hard in the time you are there. Seasonal is great for students, Costco is hard to get into if you want a career however."
good,"Title says it all. The pay was good for the one and a half months that I worked, every manager was either disorganized, rude, or both. Dont work here if you dont like idiots."
good,"Costco takes care of their employees very well. They have great food, a lot of members, and awesome products! Loved working there and interacting and helping happy customers! It's organized and everyone stays busy."
good,"You must be able to work quickly here. Management is okay if you're a permanent employee but if you're temporary or seasonal, it's pretty cutthroat. Store manager makes it a point to know your name, which is nice in a large store with lots of employees."
good,Costco is a great place to work and the pay and benefits are fantastic. Management sucks they have Their favorites that they are willing to promote. Hard workers are stuck at the bottom and laziness is rewarded with promotions.
good,"This is one of the many jobs I acquired at Costco.  Would start up the computer with my number, go through routine things, then help the customer however I could, by opening a new membership, directing them to the right location, answering their questions, processing their payment for an existing card and helping in returns.    Then if it was slow would go out and sell credit card services, do some stocking, and do whatever was necessary in membership."
good,Typical day at Costco will depend on what attitude you choose to have when you walk through the doors. Also you have to be mentally prepared to deal with people but mostly your co-workers. Staying positive and having patience.
good,I found myself not able to get with more than a couple coworkers at a time. My hours were either off at 11pm or start at 4 am and I didnt like my options there. A lot of employees aren't held accountable for the jobs they do as well as coworkers that intentionally slack
good,"Great place to work, it's a growing company so plenty of room for advancement in many fields. Must be a multitasker. Great place for training and learning"
good,I am involuntarily writing because this is a requirement. I don't have anything specific to say about the job. I mainly just encouraged passerby's to try out the available product and inform them on the product.
good,"Its a fun time when you walk into work and the staff is friendly. to much fun gets the managements attention and they dont like that. Other than that the environment is safe and most of the members are happy to be there and can help brighten your day,"
good,"Overall, Costco was a great place to work at. However, management was poor and never wanted to fix the problems going on. This company goes above and beyond for their customers"
good,"I worked in refrigerated distribution. A typical work day would to breakdown incoming orders, separate, and pack them for shipments to the stores. This was all done in below 50 degree temps."
good,I loved working for Costco! Job was offered as temporary but I was informed ahead of time that the opportunity was available for full time employment. Costco is a company that takes care of its employees. I have not complaints in regards to the position I held at Costco
good,I enjoyed working at Costco. The one thing I did not like was the high school mentality. The upper management and supervisors treating their favorites better then others. The other thing I did not like was no room for growth.
good,Good place to work. Staff was friendly and worked well as a team. Didn't enjoy the lighting inside the building as I found my eyes were effected by it
good,"you go inside with a positive attitude, your always going to meet new  people, Costco has a set culture for employees to show up and do what""s required  of them to do so. the hardest part about Costco is  putting in the work that's required of you, the best part is just knowing you have a job with benefits but now you can get their main benefits almost at any good job that offers a 401K"
good,Un empleo con buen ambiente de trabajo. Dan apoyo a estudiantes con horarios.
good,"Jobs are good in all departments, management favoritism and having relatives working togheter is bad and sad. New people don't have credibility. Policies aren't follow as it said as new you have to follow it. I seein how my co workers treat new people is sad. If I said something is problems against me even i have 23 years working here. Hope this would help."
good,"Very fast paced environment .Always learning new things throught out the day. The warehouse, is very diverse and fun to work at. Very friendly people as well."
good,"Costco was a good place to work. Extremely strict, a 30 minute lunch means a 30 minute lunch, etc. Which is not always a bad thing. Your days are structured enough and it helps the time fly. The job just didn't work for me, I was young and a freshmen in college and became overwhelmed."
good,I really do not have much to say but I did enjoy my time there. The atmosphere was a good one created by the incoming store manager. He really pushed all employees to be their best.
good,The fact that the members of management were like Notzis makes the job environment VERY stressful! That's why the company has such good benefits. Because the job SUCKS!
good,"Shifts can vary. learned to give excellent member service, good work ethic. Co-workers do get a little too friendly with each other, even the managers and supervisors. Too much inter mingling and favoritism; it affected management objectiveness."
good,A good place to work! They take very good care of their employees! You can transfer within the the company to other stores or depots! Room for advancement!
good,"Customer service and communication skills."
good,"I enjoyed my time working with Costco, it was very fast paced and upbeat! Everyone you work with is very motivated and friendly, the management if very helpful and informative."
good,The store was very well organized like an organized machine. I like the fact that you have opportunity to much and learn different work duties of the strore.
good,"Very fast pace environment, receiving merchandise an stocking shelves, with strick deadlines. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with ,They were really laid back an friendly an easy to get along with."
good,"Awesome place to work! Awesome benefits,"
good,"It was fun working at costco, people were nice although management can do a little better on handling their employees. I was able to move around different departments and was able to learn different skills as well."
good,Great place to work if you want to grow with a company. Friendly and fun co workers but a lot of hours required and its too far from my house with the core hours being 8-5
good,"Costco has great benefits, opportunities to move up and around, and an air of positivity. There's not a lot of help with inflexible schedules and management can at times step on their own toes. Fixed time schedules can be frustrating at times but overall, a good working experience with a great company culture that promotes efficiency, and teamwork."
good,"The benefits were great and there are a lot of good people there, but management has lost sight in what Costco is.  There was a time where being rude as a guest would get your membership revoked, but they just play in to rude customers get what they want no matter what.  Management doesn't care about you as an employee, you're just a pawn."
good,"Everyday at Costco you meet many different people and serve them samples of different types of foods. You have to talk and engage with the customers to sell the product you have that day. The hardest part about the job is getting the customer to buy the product, and the most enjoyable part is putting a smile on the customers face. The workplace is good and they always there to help you when needed."
good,Costco is an interesting company as it compensates the employees well for the work they are doing but if you want to make a life at there you will find yourself to regret that decision. The money offered is worth while to as a temporary job but the level of stress that comes from the job overtime makes the money less worth while.
good,I worked seasonally so it was very competitive to learn everything quickly and do your job as efficiently and quickly as possible if you want to hopefully keep the job afterward if offered.
good,I was a seasonal AM Stocker. I could start as early as 2:00 am or 4:00 am. I helped out in the clothing department. I learned how to print signs and rearrange clothing for sale. The other employees were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was having to make changes last minute before Warehouse opened. The most enjoyable part was helping Members.
good,"good job for short term. don't get trapped in, better opportunities out there if you have the drive. pay is good with benefits, management pending on locations is a joke."
good,Staff and management are friendly. Most departments are great to work in. The work day usually went by super quick because everyone   is fun to work with. The work there isn't hard.
good,Typical warehouse work. Worked in the freezer side of the warehouse. Used electric pallet jacks to move merchandise around the warehouse. Costco cares about its employees.
good,this was an OK place to work this was the warehouse not store environment and this worked with my life at the time and allowed me to have my evenings to work a second job
good,A typical day at work was clocking in and going to a cashier i was assigned too and assist them. Through out the day I would get sent outside to bring back carts or i would get sent into the clothing area and fold the clothes.
good,"Good pay, great hours, and has a strong union. The weekends can be very fast paced and may get stressful at times. The store is never open on holidays so thats another positive."
good,"Hard to get full time position, and always busy. Other than that great place to work at and has a good work environment and friendly people to work alongside with."
good,"It was a fun job with great products. Unfortunately, Costco decided to get out of the furniture business for a variety of reasons and eventually everyone either left or was moved to a warehouse."
good,Environement de travail agréable. Par contre la compagnie a fermer ces portes. Acheter par une autre entreprise.
good,"Worked for Costco Wholesale for 8 years in 3 different stores. Depending on which warehouse you work in, management can either be good or bad. There's always hours which is a plus and benefits."
good,"You have to work hard, smart, and for have the day if not the whole. Great pay for a retail job. My location was whack - other locations knew it too - cut throat and toxic."
good,"Good job experience to have, always moving. There are lots of opportunity for people who are very motivated alongside great health and dental benefits."
good,"Great place to work, pays great, people are great. To advance requires quite a bit of seniority which is hard since a lot of people have been working there for 10+ years. At times there can be too many managers that you might not know who is above who."
good,It was a great place to work with a great people. The day would start with me walking in the building and being greeted by the worker at the door. Then off to the back to pick up my pallet jack and start picking up boxes.
good,Top management engaged with staff and were very accessible.  All employees were friendly and helpful.  Great atmosphere.  Everyone was treated with respect and dignity.  Long hours.
good,"Good place to work , management could be tricky but most of the time you work with great people and it helps make the day go by fast and less stressful sometimes."
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the time spent at Costco. I wish there was room for advancement for employees but sadly there is not. This is a dissatifier for the employees at Costco. I would have liked to have gone into a management position but was overlooked several times even though I will I have the skill set to achieve. Maybe in the future Costco will consider part time employee as value contributers to the organization. "
good,"Je suis personne toujours de bonheur souriante"
good,Great place and very competitive. If you want a place where your on your feet and like to always have someone to assist in customer service then the position is great for you. It gets very busy at times and you may have to help the cashiers.
good,Good company to work for great benefits for your little ones great competitive wages. Overtime on weekends ceo did a great job creating a company like Costco to go against it’s competitors
good,"*Answer calls-take messages or forward calls"
good,hard-working fast paced atmosphere. Must be detailed oriented and have the the ability to change pace quickly and keep a positive attitude. Must stand for multiple hours at a time and adapt to new responsibilities and new areas of work.
good,"The company policy is promotion based on seniority, which i understand. I just prefer a merit based system. Otherwise the company is loyal to its employees and has unmatched benefits."
good,"Pretty good compensation for the work that is required. At the time I was there, the management was very poor. Extremely bias and two-faced. Costco as a whole is a great company to work for but the management that ran my store was beyond terrible."
good,"I've been dealing with a target on my back and harassed. I can't grow here and I am not assisted in my growth. I just want full time and they won't give it to me, I've earned it. I've been here a long time. I lost faith in my managers."
good,"If you can appease management you will do well. If you are flexible in terms of working in different locations, the rate at which you advance is greatly effected."
good,The job was great with Costco Travel but my drive from home to Costco travel was long and I deiced to go back to school to get my Medical Assistants Certificate. Working along with the drive to work and try to go to classes would be to hard.
good,"Working at costco, is very fast paced every single day.  There's lots of foot traffic everywhere in the warehouse.  The biggest reason I left was all the drama between coworkers and management.  Since you're spending so much time with all your coworkers, they kind of turn into your life and it's easy to get roped into all the drama.  As far as management goes, I didn't like the way they acted when I was seriously injured.  I think Costco is a great place to work, for some people.  It just wasn't a great fit for me and my life style."
good,Great job for person who likes to move all day.  Policies in place to protect the employee.  Advancement is from within the warehouse and several departments to choose from.
good,"If you work at Costco you can handle eyverywhere in the world,,,,,,,,it was a very good experience and I have learn a lot, but the hours is so tough especially the managers mostly give the better schedules by seniority of employees.and rates of payments in compare to the volume of the job is so so low."
good,It was a great job. It was very busy and the store is always packed. The meat department was extremely busy especially when it came down to the holiday season.
good,working at costco you have to be pretty efficient and quick on your feet. there are so many customers they don't like having people to wait in line. great community with the employees and definitely awesome benefits
good,"Very busy days."
good,"Managed the front to make sure we met our productivity numbers and keep the flow of traffic running smooth. "
good,"Variety of tasks and training make your day go by faster than sitting at a desk. You don't need to pay for a gym membership as you do a lot of standing, walking, lifting, etc. Many coworkers are students that have upbeat, fun personalities. I just don't care for the nights, holiday seasons and weekend work or a changing schedule. You can't plan ahead without requesting that particular time off."
good,"I worked mainly on the Organic line, which is a slower paced side of the Plant. I really liked working there and with the people. Great atmosphere. "
good,Steady work with helping members with their groceries. Be friendly by greeting the members while scanning and collecting their monnies. Steady cash register job
good,I think Costco offers a lot of different kinds of experience that you couldn't find anywhere else. I believe the team and the employees at Costco really make you feel part of their own family. It's a lot of hard work but at the same time it feels rewarding at the end of the day.
good,"Costco is an amazing company to work for with part time benefits, a luxurious break room, and plenty of hours. There are some drawbacks considering that gossiping is an ongoing issue at the store I worked for and some of the more easily influenced Managers had favorite employees that wouldn't be held accountable for unprofessional behavior."
good,"High paced working environment, very competitive but fun spirited."
good,"Great company, great benefits, fair and just. Hours are not the greatest especially for part time employees. Takes years to attain day shifts. mostly afternoon / late evening shifts."
good,"Typical day at Costco requires lifting and organizing material, making sure it looks presentable and neat for the members everyday. my day consists of working on my feet on the floor, to driving a forklift pulling items out of the steel to stock. I've learned to put attention into detail, use time management more effectively,and have bettered my forklift operation skills. Management is not bad, although the desire for more organization or direction is left wanted at times. Often left to problem solve when I don't have the experience required. This problem aside the atmosphere is very fun, people work hard right next to you while having fun and laughing. Hardest part of the job is probably finding materials for the detail stuff. Tape for signs, pens to record numbers, pallet jack to move items, these things can be hard to come by sometimes. the most enjoyable part of the job is watching the transformation of a messed up store turn into a clean, straight, and orderly warehouse."
good,Buen trabajo para empezar y aprender del servicio al cliente
good,MAny opportunities to do multiple things. Good pay and benefits. MAnagment was good at my store but supervisors and assistant managers could be a pain
good,"Family oriented company. Everyone knows each other. Great once you get your foot in the door. Lots of growth opportunities in different areas, lots of mentorship opportunities."
good,"Good people to work with and a lot of opportunities to move up. Even though the energetic mood of the work place is good, the amount of verbal communication and repetitiveness can be draining. I enjoy improving in my duties and the people who work at Costco, along with my benefits. What I do not like is the pain I get in some parts of my body physically from the labor intensive requests of certain things."
good,Costco is a great company to work for. The benefits are good even for part time employees. The pay increases with the amount of time you work there. I think its a good job.
good,"It really depends on what you want out of a job. It has great job security, benefits, bonuses once topped out. But its not for everyone so you need to know what you want."
good,"Overall, my time with Costco Wholesale was largely pleasant. I was hired on at a brand new warehouse, however, and because of that there were quite a few kinks to iron out. The schedule would be posted late, sometimes up to three or four days past the required time, I would be asked to come in early to open at 8 am at 9pm the night previous, and I didn't hold the warehouse director in very high regard due to her short temper and rather cold demeanor, thus defeating the purpose of Costco's 'open door' policy."
good,Costco takes care of its employees if your there for longer than 10 years basically. Managment is very demanding and not very understanding. Very busy everyday with lack of remorse.
good,It is constantly busy and fast paced but the work is simple. The managers are rude and expect you to work as hard as humanly possible. Co-workers are good.
good,Worked there as a student. Pay was average. Management was great. They were extremely helpful and I got a chance to meet some wonderful people there!!
good,a typical day is a busy day with lines of plus 10 members at all times. management can expect too much from employees and not be considerate of hard labor.
good,"A typical day at work (Food Court) would be very busy from the time I walked in till the time I walked out. Most of the time, things were very efficient and structured. You never know what tasks you would be doing that day. It would just be wherever they needed you. I learned great customer service skills, as well as multiple-tasking, patience, team building skills and other things. I had great management when I started, but towards the end the management contributed to my decision of leaving Costco. It is hard to keep motivated in such a monotonous environment, but the time flies by. The most challenging part of the job was being patient with members, taking criticism from management and members, working as hard as you can and still coming short with your efforts, and being efficient. The most enjoyable part of the job was having consistent hours, benefits, making friends, increasing my skills, and consistency."
good,Fun job. All managers were all over the place and there were too many. Good job. Typical day at work was always hectic. Always low on employees but they never wanna hire more people. No overtime kinda' stingy
good,"Most days were fast paced. Scheduling was frequently inflexible, understandably due to nature of employment (members of the team with more seniority filled earlier shifts with junior members getting short or late-hour shifts). Management, though friendly, was often too busy to immediately discus employee concerns. High turn-over of staff (especially during seasonal hiring) led to few meaningful interactions between staff."
good,"Never had a big peoblem, everything os pretty organized. Although it wasnt the job for me, everyone was supportive and someone is always there if you need help. Enjoyed working here."
good,"I enjoyed working in the Costco environment because customers are usually very polite, as the employees are. Some of the management team can make the workday quite stressful, but overall it is a good place to work."
good,"es una empresa muy completa y estable , maneja una excelente calidad de servicio y de sus productos, codigo de etica en general muy buena empresa"
good,"Great benefits"
good,"If you are a dynamic young career enthusiast, Costco management is for you. You work long hours, a minimum of 10 to 12 hours, and always have work to do. However, adrenaline can only last for so long, after a while it catches up to you. One thing is for sure, there is never a dull moment and the tasks vary every day. There are some constants such as monitoring payroll, scheduling, pushing sales, merchandising appropriately to support the company's culture, communicating with buyers, training employees, supervisors and assistant managers, and improving overall efficiency in the warehouse on a daily basis."
good,Great place for part time students and even full time. They pay you quite decently and work around school schedule as well. It does get busy on the holidays but you do have guaranteed hours of at least 25 a week for part time.
good,"Costco is very fast paced, you receive a great merchandising education that is second to none.  People are great to work with and you create long-lasting friendships. Medical and Dental Benefits were the best aspect with Costco"
good,"Worked there for approximately 9 years and many people had worked there longer. Good pay, benefits and time off. Not gonna find much better in retail. But it is retail. If you want a career this is not the place for you. If you want a good to great job this may be a perfect fit for you."
good,"Friendly working atmosphere, not ideal if you're not flexible with working hours/ days."
good,"Good company. Low turnover, so many highly qualified workers have to wait longer than normal for advancement. Performance metrics are a bit inconsistent and could be standardized for consistency."
good,Muy buena empresa para trabajar en costco y poder estudiar
good,"Have a great group of people working this Costco, enjoyed the people and the management.  had a lot of fun getting to know customers and employees and gained a lot of knowledge."
good,"For the three years I worked at Costco, I felt like an important asset to the team. I was constantly put in different departments, which gave me an added value feeling. The starting pay was great and the opportunity to move up was always present."
good,"Around holidays there is usually plenty of hours, a lot of time part-timers are able to work full-time."
good,"I honestly used to love working at Costco, until I moved from Arizona to Kentucky. The management and your co-workers are completely different people. It's supposed to be based on seniority and experience as long as you have a good attendance record and work ethic, but it's not. It's about who likes you in management and if you have a pretty face. They don't care about your life outside of work like if you have a second job or a family. Unless you are a college student."
good,"Minor labor at costco. "
good,no advancement good pay lil hours everyone starts off at part time co workers are cool hardest part is getting through the rushes  i learned alot  best part is the bennifest
good,"Fun place, got some nice bonuses for doing a good job, overall great place.  Helps with schooling and gives discounts to phone bills and clothing. overall loved working here."
good,Started the day by dressing with the proper work attire provided by the company. Looked at the daily grid and assign jobs to employees. Start receiving goods and ensure their shipment as required. Maintain communication with management as needed.
good,"All associates and managers are friendly with one another. It's a fast paced work environment, time flies right on by! If you work hard enough, there is plenty of room for advancements. Benefits are great!"
good,Opening and closing of the warehouse with cash handling and staff management with running breaks and lunches.  Hardest part of the job would be managing breaks and lunches with maintaining lines with enough registers open.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the interaction with fellow co workers and members. Over my years I have learned communication is an effective tool to use when dealing with consumers and co-workers.
good,"They treat their employees there fairly well, they're always busy through out the day, always something to do and the food is really good. I had an enjoyable time working there. Thanks for the safe/friendly environment you gave me."
good,A typical work day at Costco was always fun and exciting. There was always something to do and the team always worked hard and efficiently. I would also be on cash register connecting one on one with members and i also helped prep food for the next day when needed.
good,"Good company to work for, management can ruin it though. For little experience, pay is good. Not much opportunity for advancement as openings in management are limited"
good,"Costco is an excellent company rooted in member service. Employees are well compensated with a great salary and benefits package. Opportunity is available for a go-getter, but praise is limited."
good,"great people to work with and exciting new roles regarding marketing and moving around different departments."
good,very cliquey environment between how managers treat employees by favoritism and sexism plays a role.. Was a good job for seasonal for good little pay time and good use of free membership.
good,"I enjoyed working in demonstrator for Costco, it had its bad days where you had to stand for 6 hours a day but at the end the community in the Costco well always make you smile."
good,Costco is a great company that promotes from within. They give you a great starting pay with full benefits. Part time employees will also receive these benefits. The only downside is the work/life balance. Expect to be working most weekends with unpredictable hours and days off. Management is inexperienced (may vary with older staff).
good,Costco was a good place to work at. the managers were willing to listen to you if you had an issue. They also asked for input on how to improve process. They also asked what they can do to help make our jobs more productive.
good,I loved giving out samples at COSTCO. While working there I consistently beat sales targets. Unfortunately vendor cancelling demos resulted in a lack of hours.
good,"The overall benefits that Costco offers to both part-time and full-time employees is phenomenal. However, it takes a great deal of time and work to move up within the company if you are not willing to relocate. Management is understanding of personal issues and very easy to talk to. They are not very lenient on sick days the first year of employment. Costco offers a balance of a strict work environment while also giving employees opportunities to fluctuate between departments."
good,"My time at Costco has been generally pretty enjoyable. It's a job where you come to work, do your job then get to go home. it's a nice safe job that's fairly routine but has the odd wrench thrown in to keep your interest."
good,"Upper management needs to learn the ins and outs of each department.  They tend to manage my a book and not by reality.  It would be a good system to put all managers through each department for a short amount of time to learn how they actually work.  Great company, great benefits, pay is good."
good,"Durant mon stage, les employés m'ont bien accueilli. J'ai pu apprendre certains termes anglais pour les commandes de viande et améliorer un peu ma vitesse. Les directeurs et superviseurs ont été assez gentil pour m'accepter comme stagiaire malgré que ce ne soit pas une entreprise qui recrute de cette manière, ils ne prennent pas de stagiaire généralement. Le plus difficile je dirais serait de m'adapter à une vitesse comme celle de Costco avec si peu d'expérience dans le domaine de la boucherie. Le plus facile était de travailler la viande et de répondre aux clients qui avaient des questions."
good,"I enjoyed going in to work and be under such great supervisors who works so hard and were great examples to all of us. My favorite time of the day was closing time when all the girls would get together and fold all the clothes in crunch time. "
good,"In the sales department, most of the work was initiative based, which meant you'd have to pace yourself to stay busy if customer help level was low, otherwise most duties would be completed in 0.5-1 hour.  Make sure warehouse was ""show-time ready"" every day, with all product faced and store kept clean, and assisting customers as well as other departments as needed.  Management would fluctuate with how much attention was paid to the sales department, typically either non-existent or overly micro-managing, no happy medium. Got to deal with whole spectrum of customers, ranging from tech-savvy to clueless providing full range of customer satisfaction/interaction practice. Business-casual atmosphere was nice but had trouble defining at any given time where exactly it stood. Because of necessities of membership, theft and undesirable customer levels were quite low.  Co-Workers were generally semi-educated, with fluctuating levels of morale dependent on policies being enforced at the time.  Employees who did more were given more to do and kept to higher standards than others occurring in every department, which was cause for much disruption, due to unfair work loads/expectations.  Management team had highly inappropriate behaviour with more attractive employees, causing favoritism and a few scandals which should have led to immediate firings based on company policy but almost always never did. Fairly good all-round camaraderie among employees, with a few exceptions.  Hardest part of job was learning to deal with hypocrisy of policy enforcement, and exaggerated neediness of clientele"
good,"Many different positions in varied departments, can always pick up extra hours. Very limited full time opportunities."
good,"This is a good Company to work for. I do like the long term benefit's of being with them. This company def. knows how to take care of it's associates, but what bothered me was some of the Management. You knew that some of them shouldn't really be Managers. Especially when they forget a key rule in being Management Material.  You alway's need to ""Lead By Example"" and what I think is just as important when being a Leader. You should give just a  little negative feed back, enough so the associate knows to learn from it, but you need to give lot's of positive feed back. Show them what they are doing right and then what to work on, so that the associate will work harder and be better for it, not to scare them into thinking there going to be fired every time they mess up. I would say some of my management pears just really seamed to MAD and UPSET all the time. That is not good leadership, but most people there are very respectful to each other and I really did enjoy that. Oh, and that they work good as a team. Except there was always that one person who you would always be nice to and give boxes to when they needed some, but when you need some boxes or a little help they would tell you to go take a hike and be really rude."
good,"Costco was a great place to work, always work to be done never a dull moment. there are plenty departments to work up to if qualified. people are friendly."
good,"If your looking for a great job, Costco Wholesale is the place to be. There are numerous opportunities with the company, let alone the pay and the benefits are grand. The best part is that if your a seasoned employee and decide to locate, the best part is. is that  you may be able transfer to another at your new location. "
good,"A typical day at work is pretty busy and in high demand. You are to cater to the members needs at all costs, sell memberships, take payment, an smile. However members can be very disrespectful and management hardly ever defends you as an employee or when you do good management hardly appreciates or applauds you for your hard work."
good,"Fun place to work....if you are in the upper managements ""click"". You will get out what you put in, for the most part. Its definitely a who you know type of place."
good,A very good part time low experience job.  Easy to find a fit somewhere to work in the company.  Management can be a little biased.
good,Costco treats every employee fairly. The pay structures are very fair and the means for promotion are straight forward. There is equal opportunity for any employee who wants a career with Costco.
good,"Good co-workers very team workable,Never boring, assignments all ways completed on time.Supervisors were very organized and explained job to the detail."
good,"Good company, with excellent benefits.  Company that allows you to grow and uses your strengths to help them accomplish their goals.  Also keeps your family in mind when scheduling."
good,"Very challenging and busy everyday. My co-workers became family after so many years and they still are but I always welcomed new faces. I had my ""regular"" customers as well that would purposely go through my line to check out and often wait in a long line just to see me. I am thankful for the friends and I have made through the years and the experience."
good,"As a senior manager overseeing over 240 employees, I have team of managers and supervisors that make the job easier. It is a fast paced environment that keeps us on our toes always."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Costco; but it is time to move on. Looking for a set schedule and set hours. I miss being in an office environment, working closely with accounts and sales teams."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Costco but I felt I was overlooked for advancement opportunities.  The criteria for advancement kept moving and I left for a better/higher paying job.  But would recommend this place to others.
good,Costco is a very fun and fast paced job. Has a very high physical demand but over all is an enjoyable work place. Not a huge opportunity for advancement.
good,Great place to work friendly people management was very nice to me and willing to work with me. I was a contractor so was not under Costco's management.
good,I enjoyed the company to work for and my store was very good. The people were good along with management.The work conditions were good and the management helped were need
good,A typical day at Costco involved me straightening up the entire department. Receiving in stock and doing inventory of the department. Upon completion I would assist in the preparation of medicines. Receiving in stock and providing customer service.
good,A typical day at work was always fun it didn't seem like work at all because of the fact that it was so easy going and easy when we all worked together.  The only downfall was that I didn't always have my set hours and I also had constant changing schedules.
good,"Customer service "
good,"There is room for advancement but mostly with playing the political game. Hard to not find gossip in any warehouse. Other than that, above average work environment with good pay and benefits."
good,"After working for this company (since it was Price Club, then merger to become Price Costco, to the now Costco), for 22+ years I have seen it through all the changes. It has always been better than most companies. There are always growing pains, but over all a good job with great benefits. It is a lot of hard work required at a fast pace, in most every dept."
good,"Costco was a great experience for me. It was demanding and fast paced, allowed me to try many different positions within the same warehouse, and beef up my work experience. I learned how the warehouse works, and all the parts to maintaining a successful company. The employees were very diverse, and constantly changing. The hardest part of the job was the physical demands of stocking, and retrieving carts in the elements."
good,"Wegmans overall was a very good company. Most of the employees and managers were helpful and friendly, while they had a few bad or less friendly ones. Overall, the management team was outstanding. The pay was above average but maybe could have been a bit more considering the amount of work a Night Manager/Service Team Leader had to do. The hardest part of the job was training and developing a team of thirty or so employees to hopefully one day move up in the company. My favorite part of the job was that everyday I was able to do or learn something new, and the daily interactions with the friendly staff they had hired."
good,"I go in, clock in my hours (from start to finish), then the supervisor have me do whichever work they need help with, whether its cashiering, packing, or stocking foods/returning items back on the floor. "
good,"Nice place to work. Great co workers. Easy to move around to different positions within the company. Hours change week to week, so you have to be flexible."
good,"The best thing about Costco is the pay and benefits. They are a company that likes to leave the crew short on people, therefore, overworking the rest of the crew within a certain area. This leads to bad crew motivation and complete aggravation for everyone. If they would just have more people working on a shift, They would be an amazing workplace."
good,"Good benefits,  Limited Hours, Hard to be promoted, opportunity limited. Learning opportunity is available seldom give to associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with coworkers and the camaraderie among friends."
good,"i answered phones the whole shift and helped members with any questions pertaining to the costco.com website.  I learned phone etiquette, i also got to work on my typing skills.  I got along well with all of my co-workers.  Probably the hardest part of this particular job was knowing it was going to come to an end after seasonal was over.  I really loved this job and was hoping to get kept on afterwards, but sadly, they didn't keep any of the seasonal on."
good,The benefits were awesome and the co-workers were kind. I learned how to be a cashier and how to give great customer service.
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at costco. As I am in the marketing and membership department, I talk to a lot of people everyday. You must have the skill of good comunication overall. co-workers are nice and suportive mostly. Many factors outside of job expierence and acountability play a role in how management is choosen. Being on your feet all day, every day and walking a lot is recomended for the fit only. job security is strong despite part time hours and lower pay in the begining."
good,"Te permite aprender e ir ascendiendo a diferentes áreas y eso te motiva para esforzarte día a día y en las juntas a nivel gerentes te inculcan a trabajar siempre en equipo. Sin embargo cuando las cosas no están bien cada quien busca responsables sin reconocer en que esta fallando cada uno y esto vuelve un ambiente muy tenso y crea divisiones."
good,I would complete a daily production log within my shifts. I would help any customers who needed assistance. I would maintain a clean work space all throught the day.
good,Lots of energized employees. good fast paced. not too many poloitics would find their way to me.
good,"Great Benefits and company practice and procedure.  There are areas that I believe could be improved upon.  It's nice to work for a place where you are encouraged to do your best.  Warehouse 359 is a rather negative, stifling atmosphere.  I stay positive though. :)"
good,"a typical work day required me to process transactions, new memberships, and manage a work staff of 10 employees in my department. learned how to manage my time efficiently and how to defuse situations with disgruntled members. management was not efficient there in certain areas. co-workers were responsible. did not feel any part of the job was hard. enjoyable parts consisted of meting daily goals and numbers."
good,"Greeting Members."
good,Pretty good place to work.  Was a relief to me after years at the airlines to have a break both in hours and responsibilities.  Management seems to be fair.  Opportunities for advancement seem limited.  As a station attendant you are removed from the main operation of the warehouse and so as an employee your seemingly out sight out of mind.  Co-workers are younger and haven't really established a sound work ethic.  The overall job isn't difficult with the best part getting to meet new people
good,"los compañeros son buenos,"
good,"Costco is a good place to work for, a fun and friendly environment that focuses on member service to its customers. Costco has a wide variety of products to offer its members. A typical day is very busy with lots of member interaction. My co-workers were very helpful and enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job is the adjusting to the various hours from morning shift, mid shift and graveyard shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was working with all my members and seeing them return each and every time."
good,"Costco as a whole is a great company, but the Costco in mayfield seemed to be the runt of the pack. The management was poor, while lower employees with a lot of drive wouldn't advance with the company. The general manager was also very cold and didn't try to be personable with employees."
good,Just like many jobs at Costco you have to start at the bottom. That is not always a bad thing but you get out what you put in. If you work hard than you can advance quickly which is just life.
good,Its not uncommon knowledge that Costco pays the best in the retail business and offers great benefits as well. This alone pushes myself and others to work harder than they would for any other job.
good,"Everybody is friendly, helpful and fun to work with. The casual dress attire makes it comfortable to work as well."
good,"the work was consistent, my job was maintaining the up come of the warehouse or some  call it house keeping, cleaning, stocking setting up displays."
good,"Work under pressure , be fast and efficient serving public, deal with harsh customer. The must regarding  when I get compliment about my well done job."
good,"i sold presious natural stones in sterling silver stttings. i learned about all different types of stones and the worth of the items, the management of the kioske was professional. the hardest part of the job was talking about a product like you knew everything about it but you were just learning the ropes. The most enjoyable part was the learning experience of the product and having customers leave knowledgable and happy with thier purchases!"
good,"Mon dernier poste occupé fut le marchandisage des vêtements. Ce qui consistais a replier les vêtements défais, remplir au besoin et répondre au membre si nécessaire. Les possibilité d'avancement sont bien, dès qu'un poste est afficher tous peuvent y postuler. L'aspect le plus difficile fut peut-être de terminer de plier tout les vêtements avant la fin de mon quart de travail, ce du au nombre réduit d'employé. L'aspect le plus agréable fut certainement d'aider les membres à trouver ce qu'ils cherchent et qu'ils soient satisfais."
good,"Great pay, great company to work for. Not really family oriented. Must have open availability. "
good,my experience was too short because I was just hire as seasonal but look a good place to work
good,"Su gente es muy amigable y cooperativa, la atencion al cliente es lo mejor y los fines de mes de inventario esta super divertido ya que se concentra todo el equipo a realizar los conteos y todos estar al tanto de perdidas y como salio la administracion."
good,"Management a l' américaine , Vraiment très bon sur le plan motivation et sur le salaire. Droit du salarié un peu moins bon qu'en europe."
good,A typical day at work is having to serve every client (53 members per hour) with a smile and a friendly service. I love this job but it is extremely physically demanding. I enjoy the high stress and being constently busy. I just found that are too many managers in charge and a consent change in rules and regulations (every week) makes it hard to do my job. Did enjoy the experience and the loyal customers who make it a great place to work. 
good,"Pretty fast paced environment. Job can vary by the day, even the hour. You will regularly assist members in finding merchandise. Cashiers will spend most of their time ringing up purchases. Cashier assistance will help cashiers while retrieving items that members may have forgotten or could not find. You can get plenty of opportunities to work in other departments. The  hardest part of the job is having patience with customers. But can be said about in retail job. The most enjoyable part is your coworkers. You work close with coworkers, supervisors, and managers, which allows you to form solid bonds with them. "
good,"I started employment working in the corporate deli. Duties included menu planning and development. Daily prep, cooking, serving corporate and warehouse employees. Daily bookkeeping and closing duties. Promoted to assistant manager in quality assurance apparel department.Quickly promoted to non apparel quality assurance department. Both quality assurance department duties include reviewing Open to Buy reports, working directly with vendors, buyers, labs and directing labs and factories to comply with specs. Transferred to warehouse (promotion) working up to position as Lead Cashier. Duties included opening warehouse, training assistants and cashiers, accurate processing of transactions and assisting in other departments, as needed."
good,"its ok. you work, they pay you. co-workers are great. management, not so much. hardly educated."
good,Great Company with benefits. various problems with management
good,I learned alot from the guys. Was at the right place at the right time when they where just opening a store near my area.I learned alot about day to day orperations in the meat department.
good,Attended to customers and their requests in the Photo department
good,"Costoc Wholesale is a great company to work for, unfortunately it wasn't for me personally. They offer great benefit packages and vacation time. Your raised are based on the amount of hours worked so as long as you are working you are towards a raise."
good,very good management.
good,- A typical day at work includes assisting members and working together as a team with co-workers.
good,A typical day at work consists of very continuous fast paced laborous work which I always enjoyed very much.
good,I assisted members with finding items or products within the warehouse. I enjoyed the time I was with this company I was able to meet a lot of new people.
good,A typical day at work would be coming in and training around 5 clients a day. The hardest part would be selling the training packages because they were a fixed price and most people could not afford what we were asking.
good,I worked for Costco for 8 years. They pay well and have great benefits. The draw back is that it's a retail busniess which means it takes up a lot of your time. Long days and weekends.
good,wonderful in many aspects. compensation is the best at costco. management just ok at best.
good,It was seasonal employment but I would go back again. The managers are stern but fairly reasonable. The work days are long but the checks pan out.
good,"Stock merchandise, talk to co-workers, job was pretty easy so there wasn't alot of hard work and the most enjoyable part was when i got to be a sales representative."
good,Costco is a great compnay to work for. They really look out for their employees
good,If you like the fast pace environment and willing to work late hours until you receive seniority
good,"Was a good place to work, but was very hard to get hired on at the after seasonal period. It had it's perks though. Had very good medical & retirement benefits. Paid vacations & holidays, as well as the ability to work around your school schedule were a big plus."
good,"Costco has a very fast working environment. They will expect you to work as hard and fast as you can everyday. Coworkers are nice and helpful. Management will see where your strengths and weaknesses are and coach you to help you become better. It is hard to stay on after the seasonal position is offered. Out of 30+ seasonal hires, they will keep less than 5 after the season ends."
good,"A typical day at work involved clocking in all time going to the supervisor on duty and getting a job to do whether it’s getting baskets from the parking lot or helping the cashiers. Towards closing time we would restock the store, do run backs putting things back where they belong, and making sure everything in the front is clean and tidy."
good,"Good place to work. Different opportunities to learn new things. I worked early in the morning so wouldn't recommend for people who don't like waking up early, but there's other opportunities once you get in to get different jobs. Overall I would recommend."
good,"Very fast pace. "
good,A typical day at work would be; we clock in then we go see a supervisor and they would assign us to a task. We would either help cashiers put rung up items back in their carts or go outside and gather carts.
good,"- Management is understanding"
good,Once you arrive at work and are ready I would start preparing merchandise for shipping. I wrapped pallets of merchandise. Would take my breaks and lunch on time. Enjoyed meeting new staff members. enjoyed the fact that when overtime was required it was added on at the start of the day and not at the end.
good,"They spell it out to you what seasonal employment means, but during my time there I would have supervisors say to me on the sly, ""keep working like this and we could have a spot for you in January"". So you get mixed messages. In short, you leave in January anyway feeling like you were strung along like a dog with your owner holding a steak just out of your reach. After you work your butt off (my case 2 months) you are unceremoniously taken off the schedule. In my case I just clocked out on my last day and left. Nobody said anything to me. My manager went on vacation Jan.1st for 2 weeks. I attempted to contact him because I was not aware he was going on vacation but he didn't return the call. Never spoke to him again. I liked the job but didn't like how things were handled in the end. Basically you leave feeling like a used up piece of meat. 3 days after my last day I attempted to log onto the employee website only to discover my account was cancelled. I was looking to see if my w-2 was ready. I guess now I have to call the extremely ignorant woman in payroll to get that information."
good,"I liked my job alot. You get great pay and great benefits. Your always busy, I enjoyed working with the public. The managers were hard to handle. Your never scheduled under 25 hours for part time"
good,Costco takes care of their employee's.  They offer great benefits.  There is plenty of room for advancement for those who want it.  The company generally promotes from within.
good,"At first, there is a lot of paperwork and there is a lot of information being thrown at you, but once all that is done there is less chaos. The day goes by quickly- it is a fast paced environment. My day included packing groceries, putting products away, folding clothes, helping bring in carts, promoting programs, and answering customer questions. I would have liked to stay on and become a cashier!"
good,"Enjoyed the job, always had a good time with my coworkers while getting job done at the same time.  Had opportunities to learn new positions, work in different departments and expand my experience"
good,Manager was well versed in our training I enjoyed works ng as a team member . Everyone worked hard and we had specific and or different duties daily  had a succezful
good,Costco wholesale is a fine company with great benefits. Most all employees are friendly and welcoming. They’re pay scale is competitive and they offer living cost raises.
good,"Great company to work for and I heard other locations are great as well. However the Costco in Duluth, GA is right next to the southeast regional office and it’s crazy in there. Management sucks, crazy front end manager that doesn’t even care about some of her workers. Fired me for texting my ride when I was a minute away from my endshift."
good,"Just like the title says, a great place to work at benefits wise but the location in my city puts the employees who have been with the company in front of the new employees when it comes to hours. Maybe I wasn't there long enough but that's just my opinion."
good,"Totally for having experience job in Canada is good .Management is good ."
good,"If you are a single person this is a great place to work. You meet a lot of people, stable job, good income, good chance of progressing with hard work."
good,"The company is fantastic. In my field, there is no room for growth and no possibility to advance through learning and zero interest in flexible work, even on partial basis."
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Gotta stay motivated and dont let things get personal"
good,"I wouldn't say any of the positions besides cashier is for students. The hours are too long, especially in season. I would recommend Costco for those that are looking for an entry-level position and have the time to offer them the hours needed."
good,"I started off at Costco by pushing carts and boxing groceries working part-time while I was finishing my degree. Management was more than friendly allowing me a schedule that enabled me to work while finishing my schooling. I rose through the ranks and after about a year had made it to their membership desk selling and servicing memberships. My particular store faced its own unique sets of challenges and it got busy, sometimes a little hectic. Long-term though, there is not a better place to work in that industry. Raises and time off are based on hours worked, Costco has a great culture of workers who have been there for some time."
good,Great place to work. Always respect authority and the word of others.. stretch and never put the body in the line. Managers are compliant and allow schedules to be quite flexible.
good,Warehouse mentality - some locations ask you to help bag groceries or take you out of the optician location and onto the warehouse floor for a short period of time during the work day.
good,"It was a beautiful place to work. A lot of processes and applications to learn. "
good,Okay place to work. Can be very stressful in food court area if management is not on point. Competitive when it comes to moving up and position changes.
good,"Overall Costco is a great place to work. Unfortunately some management makes it feel impossible to advance further, even when you have a great amount of experience and simply want to be able to use your skills and experience to provide your department with as much help as possible. Otherwise, Costco is a place that makes you proud to work there. Definitely good pay, compared to literally any other grocery store in the industry. I highly recommend it, but this is why they are very particular with who they hire because of their great pay and benefits."
good,I enjoyed learning and gaining valuable communication experience while working the floor for Costco. A quick and witty level of thinking is required for success within the job.
good,Working for Costco at the Morris Meat Plant has been a positive experience. Advancement is within reach if you work hard enough for it. Management can always use improvement but that is anywhere you go.
good,An enjoyable job but very fast paced.  The staff are very friendly and helpful. Management will work with you to make sure you are able to perform your duties.
good,"Above average pay for similar retail work, it can be physically demanding but the work at the cashier/assistant level is straightforward and most conflicts are handled by supervisors and membership services."
good,"Company culture is pretty hit or miss depending on management team. Overall the chosen ones to be hired internally are usually preferred based on personal preference. Often employees are told they are ""close"" or almost ""ready now"" meanwhile its just an attempt to get these employees to work like dogs with no real advancement plan ever existing."
good,"Working at Costco was a very good experience I learned at lot of departments. within the warehouse from the vault, Front End to Stocking to pulling shopping carts in the parking lot. Liked to help the members with any assistant they needed help with. The Management was very helpful in any way you needed for what you were asking for. Working late hours was a little hard."
good,"Great Job for Long term. Decent for short term. High pay for starting positions. "
good,I enjoyed my job although it was difficult. The people I was able to work with were fun and very helpful. My concern was more about the management. There are so many workers that it can be hard for managers to get an accurate idea of how well you are performing. The manager I worked for was extremely particular without offering much advise or training on how to perform tasks at the level desired. Whenever the manager was not present then I enjoyed the people I worked with and the challenge of getting as much work done within the limited time I had.
good,It's a great company to work for. Awesome benefits. 401k with company match. Management can make great workers leave. All in all it's the best retail job you will ever have.
good,"Most of the work is trivial as far as difficulty works so if you're used to being challenged at work expect to excel. However, what you receive in work/life balance you lose in overall compensation. Full time staffing is rare. Most management is pretty cool, but I got the short end of the stick working there. Would I do it again? IN A HEARTBEAT!"
good,The stress on my body was rough but the people were awesome.  The benefits are very generous. Days go quick as they keep you busy. Management was enhhh.  Learned how slow people work in Hawaii.  There definitely was a hirearchy and cultural clash but once broken through people were good about helping each other out(mostly). Meeting people/members from around the world was cool. This only refers to the Kona Costco however.  I'm certain ALL Costco's are different.
good,It’s was an great experience with Costco’s  very calm and cooperative place to work  this were I learned to operate the forklift  the best part about the job was getting off the clock lol
good,Have to work weekends No set schedule. Hard to get requested days off. Fast pace environment. Always work hard there. Management is decent. Great benefits.
good,"Enjoyed working there"
good,"I learned a lot working for the company and also learned how much of the corporation is a popularity contest. Great benefits but Costco becomes your life, they look at themselves as top priority in your life."
good,"My review of the company is that it is a great company to work for, being that the benefits and pay are great as well as the way they treat employees. A typical day at work is very fast paced and sometimes overwhelming but everyone does there past to help other employees. I've learned the value of hard work and working with others to achieve the common goal. The hardest part of this job is that management just like regular employees don't get much training and are usually unprepared and take out their frustrations on hourly employees."
good,"Working at costco is a stressful but rewarding experience. The managers are very experienced. There's a reason why managers there usually have been working there for so long. The job is great and the atmosphere is amazing. The only problem I have with them is how they treated me after. I had to leave costco and move to Michigan from california to help my grandma because she is very I'll. And die to that, it seems they have been telling my future employees that I left  without my 2 week notice. This is causing me future employment options and now I'm struggling.  So other than that, I consider them very great place to work."
good,"Different warehouses mean different cultures.  working at one warehouse had the usual work drama but was still overall a nice day to day place to be at while another warehouse had all of the same work drama but was and overall nightmare to go into.  "
good,"Will be attending KPU for Crim , going to the gym and playing sports is what I do on the daily basis , hardworking , dedicated and honestly is my speciality"
good,safety first. fast pace invironment. must be on time. work area must be presentable at all times.helpfull and kind to customers. follow company rules.
good,"Great group of people to work with and excellent management, good benefits and pay, positive work experience, management cared for workers, safe and friendly environment"
good,"I was on the college student program at Costco so I was there during its busiest times of the year in summer and winter breaks. It was great being able to come back to a good paying job and garruanteed 20+ hours a week. Usually almost 40 hours a week because they are so busy during those times. "
good,"Typical day for me was starting at 5am and ending at 1:30pm. Id stock my area prepare for opening then once we open you switch to the frontend. And from there you box or cashier. You have to have a sense of urgency while working the morning shifts as we are always preparing for opening and focused on having everything as neat as possible for our members. Have to have a great attitude after opening Costco is a well respected company and you must treat all members with respect. High paced no matter what position your in. Fun environment, great attitudes, great co-workers."
good,The company is really great to work for. The pay and benefits are amazing and didn’t cost you a lot out of your paycheck. The management at the store I was at was ok.
good,Great place to work. Very secure job. Management was very unstable and never stood by their word. But if an individual wanted to move u all they have to do is be a yes man.
good,Working at costco was great however it is time for me to move on. It is a great job but i would like something more flexible to work with my school and life schedule
good,Flexible scheduling as a student and understanding management. Great co-workers and work environment. Advancement within the company is easily obtainable.
good,"The people are hard-working and persevere through trying times. Costco international is rapidly expanding thru out the world; this presents many challenges, but good people push past difficulties and get the job done."
good,"When I show up to work, I greet and am greeted by fellow employees. I make my way to my home department & begin to perform daily tasks. If I need assistance with an issue throughout the day, I can easily contact management to help me resolve the matter, as someone is always there to help. Breaks are usually never a problem and everyone typically gets along great. The most difficult part of my job is the stress that accumulates in attempting to finish a large amount of tasks before the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of my day is when everything runs smoothly and more tasks get accomplished than originally planned."
good,"I liked the job. The only thing that made it difficult was your co workers.  I was in a smaller department and when we had callouts we usually had to deal with them by ourselves. Good pay and the more hours you work, the faster your pay will advance."
good,"Costco is a great company! They have amazing benenfits and take good care of their employees. I unfortunately have a had bad experiences with the management at my store where I work, but I have visited and heard about other  stores and everyone is so friendly and understanding."
good,"Costco provides great benefits. Raises are based on hours worked. "
good,The co-workers at Costco make the job worth it. Everyone   is dedicated to their job and the customer. I would have been there longer if they gave me the opportunity to be come a manager. They prefer to promote to the long term employeeds
good,An amazing workplace that gives amazing benefits and pay. A worthwhile experience for many people and a career worth seeing to long term goals. An enjoyable experience.
good,I worked at Costco Wholesale as a Optician. I enjoyed my time working there. The best part of working at Costco is the atmosphere; you are surrounded by fun co-workers who make the job of working in retail more bearable. The worst part about working there was never knowing what your schedule would be until you wake up that morning and check online.
good,"A lot of physical labor, need to have good endurance for repetitive lifting motions, need to be quick and organized. Morning merchandiser need to be an early riser (4:00 am)"
good,It's a good company just not much of a weekend life. Managment has been really poor lately. Pay is great and so is the advancement. Coworkers have been phenomenal
good,"Fast paced and extremely stressful."
good,Costco provided a decent work environment with great co workers. Management was accommodating however the hours may not be ideal especially if you value weekends.
good,"Muy buena empresa y bien estructurada, todos tenian sus funcionas ya bien delimitadas"
good,the company itself is great. its the Montgomery location that sucks. Management there doesn't care about their employees. They only care about selling and numbers. No humanly interaction so might as well be a robot. its either your to friendly or to nice. have to be serious and dull to be accepted.
good,"good place to start your career as a customer services rep dealing with people."
good,I have a solid background working in Membership as well as Front End and other warehouse duties. I have proven that I am detailed oriented. I can produce results under extreme and demanding conditions. Not only have my qualifications and experience given me the knowledge I need for this position. But it has also given me the confidence and determination to succeed and have a positive impact on both the employees and customers of Fairway Market.
good,Loved working at Costco. Only reason i am no longer there is because i was hired on as a seasonal employee. Would love to work there full time. Very fast paced job.
good,"Hard work ,fast pace, always be a hard worker,  lots of members daily need patience and customer skill to be good at this job. Great benefits and pay."
good,"closed major holidays, time and half sundays, free membership , great benefits, "
good,bonne ambiance de travail avec les collègues de travail
good,"A typical day at work was making sure customer needs are met and that your department is at it's best shape. Driving sales and figuring out how you can improve sales and move merchandise. At a place at Costco, they give you a chance to grow independently as a person, as well as with a team. Within the company, you gain critical thinking skills, customer service skills, and learn how to work on your own. The hardest part of the job is moving up. I know Costco usually hires and moves up within the company, but I'd like to say they go for favorites."
good,"Sterling location, the company itself is an incredible company to work for. Management at this location, however, does not care much for their employees. If you can pass all the bs and rudeness that some managers can be, you can move up within a year. Very tough at times but never take things personal."
good,"Packs purchased products into shopping carts for Cashiers,  general cleaning, merchandise restocking, runs for items as directed, and providing a high level of member service."
good,"The work atmosphere was fun and welcoming. The work was fast paced with many opportunities to serve customers.The work includes cleaning, folding clothes, restocking, cashier work, and baking."
good,"The place is alright, has good pay and benefits. The job is tiring and demanding and didn't work with my schedule. The people there were very friendly."
good,there is so many departments to move around and warehouses to transfer. with so many hours from about 4am until 2pm and anywhere inbetween to possibly start
good,"One word to describe how it's like to work for Costco would be performance. Meaning as a employee, you're expect to perform at your best performance during operation hours and after. It's fast paced, accelerated, commitment, engertic, and last but not the least is growth. When hired you'll going to experience not only career growth but character growth as a person; this will be challenged and developed you as you continue to be employed by Costco Wholesale!"
good,had great time there. wonderful people to work with and pleasant managers. very welcoming environment to be part of. the benefits are probably the best part of working there though.
good,"working here was great, it offered great benefits and paid well for an entry level job. the only issue i had with working here is i was not getting enough hours as hours are given to "" full-time "" and after my probation period i was still only getting 26-30 hours while working 6 days a week."
good,I worked for Costco for 12 years.  They had great benefits and were somewhat flexible with employees schedules and needs.  The company is extremely accommodating for those going to college.
good,"Depending on which location you're at you can either have a really busy day or very slow day. Weekends are beyond crazy , and they cater to their members so much that some of them are just out of hand"
good,Really good job with opportunity for advancement. A lot of in store politics. Management is 50/50. Many are only looking to climb the ladder with little care about the business. Others are solid with good intentions.
good,"I felt the Costco environment was one of mutual professionalism and respect. It was very fast paced due to the high and raising call volumes from increased use of eCommerce. Overall, by its nature it was lacking in team dynamics, because each person must ultimately serve each calling member on their own, which can be very taxing for those who prefer working with things rather than people. But, if I ever needed clarification on a policy or exception, there were almost always people available to help."
good,To work for Costco they take care of their employees with great pay and benefits however you must have open availability and physically fit because its hard work . For the reason I am no longer there due to physical abilities and also working all different hours.
good,"would def work there again.. and recommend other friends to apply.  Employees are friendly and if there are any questions in order to do your job correctly,, the leads were always helpful in showing what needs to be done."
good,"The paycheck was the only thing that kept me going. I was paid 19.50 on sundays and I honestly and truely miss the paycheck, that was it, everything else could have been better."
good,"Costco Wholesale is a fast paced well paying workplace with high demand of member care. Benefits at Costco is great my in order to rank up so to speak and the pay, it takes quite some time. But once top out pay is reached, seems like Smooth Sailing to me. Overall Costco is great beginner and career choice for a job."
good,"Costco has been a great place to work while going to college since they always work with your school schedule. I currently work full -time and go to school on my two regular days off. However, other option they offer are working limited part-time (only on the week ends), part-time, or student retention (working during summer and winter break)."
good,"In a typical day, i will be at work at 6am, lift heavy boxes in a freezer for half an hour, push a 200lb cart across the site and stock it for another half hour. I'll have to rush because there is no time for downtime. The rest of my 8 hour day is tending to member's orders. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with what needs to be done.  There's always something to do, which in my book is a good thing. I'd rather not stand around for 8 hours because on paper it sounds nice, but to do nothing for pay is not rewarding and the time goes by very slowly. I've always thought of it like this; say you're given a todo list with 3 tasks, each taking 2 minutes. As you finish taskA, a fourth task is added on, but this must be done before taskB or C. There's always something happening and you rarely get to finish everything and admire your work."
good,"Costco has a very fast-paced work environment, a very demanding job.  Most positions are all-day standing positions.  With exception to the Christmas season, Costco operates with minimal employees, therefore I feel that the pay should be increased in order to compensate the hourly employees FAIRLY.                                          I have learned how to work efficiently and accurately.                     The management team work along with the hourly staffs, which is a must in order to ""get the job done"".                                                  The ""Costco Culture"" is a family oriented/team player culture.         The hard part of the job is the constant standing and heavy lifting.  The hardest part of the job is pleasing the public.                           The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing it all come together on a day to day basis."
good,Great company to work for.  Costco focuses on maintaining the basics at all times.   Costco is a 7 day a week operation and is very good to its employees.
good,"Costco Provided easy part time work , good pay for a retail position and flexible hours. Sundays were paid an extra 4 dollars an hour which was a great bonus."
good,I worked there for 4 years and it was a fun and good company overall to work for. They take good care of their workers. It was a very physical job but that was right up my ally as i like that type of work.
good,"this job and all its departments helped me grow I met a lot of nice people there, I loved the food there Iiked the kids and all of the seasons of the centers"
good,I would enjoy working with or alone .I love to work on time .I like hard work where it is. I think    working with other kind of people would be fun too.
good,Human resources suck... checks was always screwed up.. rude management. No structure because the store was just opened. Great benefits and pay.. hours was great as well
good,"Love the company. Unfortunately, bad experience with coworkers who have many years with costco. Very rude! Not willing to work as a team. Immediate manager has a very cold personality."
good,"From an outsiders perspective, Costco is a fantastic company to work for. Unfortunately,  no matter how good the benefits are, working for Costco is still working in retail. If you get a great manager, working there is fine. If you get a manager who's not so great, you'll want to get out of there fast. Working for Costco is not for sensitive or timid people."
good,"First I check in with management, stretch, Pull pallets off of truck.  "
good,"Its an engaging and satisfying place to work, with spectacular benefits and good on the job training. The management could stand improvement as scheduling issues and lapses in availability occurred frequently."
good,Great opportunity for advancement! The pay is pretty good and they treat you well regardless of your work output. You should work here if you like a team that makes you feel at home.
good,This was my first big job and i worked in the food court the people i worked with were good people and hard workers. There were times were we did but heads but in the end we pulled together. I would recommend working here no matter what stage you are in work life.
good,"Fast paced, working in several areas, making shelves presentable for customers, made sure there was enough inventory of tv's computers & other electronic equipement"
good,"Lots of heaving lifting, everything at Costco is large scale. hard working fast pace environment. They have a great benefits package and lots of opportunity to grow. They care about their employees and you don't feel like a number. I found it to be a good company to work for overall."
good,They worked with my school schedule to allow me to put myself through school. Enough departments to move around if you are interested. Schedules can be inconsistent though.
good,Satrt at 4:30 am. Drive fork lift dropping product for the stockers to stock. putting stock in the steel to get store ready for open. Lots of friendly people. The job is retail after open I like working with the people and the job. Hardest part of the job is not having weekends off. Bets part of the job is starting early and getting out early.
good,"It is hard work but rewarding at the same time. Management needs to get it together a lot of the times. Fast paced work environment. If you can't hack pressure and fast paced, then this may not be the place for you."
good,"the work place culture was very friendly, but also very fast paced the hardest part of the job would be taking count of inventory after re-stocking. Costco really helps you develop a healthy work ethic while teaching new skills that can be applied in future positions."
good,Costco is one of the few major companies that really invests in their employees. All employees get benefits after 90 days and there is a built in raise structure. It is a good company to stick with if you are able to get a full time position. It is difficult to break through because promotion is based on seniority as opposed to merit.
good,"I liked working with people, so I enjoyed working at Costco. and it was during the holiday season so it was fun and most people are in good spirits during that time of year."
good,"Its a great place to work, just needed a change heading into bible school. Good people and fun getting to make a few life long friends. Lots of flexibility going through different departments."
good,"Working for costco is great, as long as you can hack the crazy hours and non set schedule. They have an amazing benefits package and intense job security. The employees generally have awesome attitudes which in my experience in a retail establishment is hard to come by. They try to help you feel like a family even though they are a huge corporation which i really do feel as though boosts morale."
good,Stay busy. Management is always watching you. There are occurrences of favoritism at times. I do enjoy the hourly wage for cashiers. In the workplace we must all just get along.
good,"I love working here, and I value the 7 years I have had with this company, but I am looking to branch off into my career path and finish school with less stress."
good,I worked very hard to complete the deli orders that were placed down to me by the higher one they call a manager at the place of buisness they call costco i had tons of fun doing so
good,"Nothing too dramatic, just what you experience when you walk in just notice the workers and if you can do that all day then it's a great place to work. Nothing too over the top or demanding, but it is a great job to have if you like consistency and the same pay rate."
good,For the most part everything was very good. I had an issue with one employee but management was very helpful and helped deescalate the situation. Management is very approachable.
good,ok company to work for if your out of high school with great pay . over all costco looks out for there people as well for the family of there employees
good,"Pour personne voulant se développer une carrière de gestion, il y a es possibilités. Moins évident lorsqu'il faut jumeler carrière et famille. Les horaires de travail sont moins appropriées."
good,Costco is a great company to get into when your young and eager. You can learn a lot from the tenured employees and get a good sense of the company and its mission.
good,Depending on whose running your building it can be a fun job or it can be a stressful one.  I’m currently at a stressful one and boy it’s a pain coming in some days.
good,"The company does value it's employees, however, the pipeline to executive positions is very small.  The company has undergone some founding members retiring and now younger leaders who will be in those positions, creates a bottle neck at the top."
good,"Overall the many years I spent with Costco were good. However, the last warehouse manager I worked for left ALOT to be desired. This person only promoted people that she brought in from her old building. Rarely would she promote from within the current building she was leading. She ruined my drive and desire to continue to work there."
good,I like working at Costco but would like to work where I can use my education and experience. They move us around so we don't get tired of one job.  I enjoy it there.
good,"very competitive environment, during the winter season is the  busiest time of year. Not very lenient with flexible hours for school. Lots of benefits if you make it to permanent."
good,"A typical day on the job can be described as chaos. You will be working, hard, the full eight hours, and their is almost no on the job training. "
good,"good place to work - face paced environment, on the job training, good benefits, good pay, room for growth/advancement, time and a half on Sundays, benefit eligible."
good,"always be willing to go the extra mile for you supervisors and members, you’ll meet all kinds of interesting people. Be willing to work overtime sometime during closing It wasn’t a choice."
good,Customer service driven all day. The company treats their employees well with the benefits package and compensation. Can be hard to get days off of work or take vacations.
good,"A typical day started around 2 pm up to 5 pm depending on your shift. You would be organized into different areas of the store and are expected to maintain the floor at all times. It was a fairly simple job so there weren't too many problems. We would handle customer questions on the floor such as directions to certain products as well as clean up displays and stock displays as needed. My day spent most of the time inside the cooler stocking the milk and other chilled products. I learned how to better manage my time as i further worked inside there. The management had alot of changes while i was there, There were constant changes that seemed to contradict each other at times. But overall it was a positive experience with management. They would look after me. The employees are quite close knit for example going out after shifts and it felt a lot like a family if anything. The hardest part of the job would be just the feeling of being understaffed. When we are expected to clean a whole store with 3 people during the day sometimes as well as help other understaffed areas if needed. It turned stressful at certain points of the year. The most enjoyable part would have to be the interactions of members and employees."
good,Learned about the value of having great co-workers and employees .Culture of providing great customer service and quality merchandise . Hardest parts managing the massive volume on a daily basis .
good,"I'm very thankful to Costco,  it is a good company to work for.  Pay is ok, benefits are good.  As far as work pace it very, but most stores are busy."
good,"Expect to be on the go all the time. That said the people who work and shop there are mostly friendly and understanding which means you don't take stress or work home with you. Management was understanding and easy to talk to in regards to personal of professional situations."
good,Overall I had a good experience working at Costco. It was fast-paced and that made the days go by fast. I would definitely buy work gloves from Home Depot if you are working Front End because the boxes cut up your hands and just make sure you always look busy even if there is nothing to do because someone is always watching and they will notice.
good,"Fast-paced environment, hard to get hired on. Work hard and do as much as you can to get noticed. Front end is the busiest of all positions but recommend so management can see what you can do."
good,"Working in a smaller department was difficult due to how few employees worked there, on top of how unreliable those people could be. Requesting days off and vacation time was a literal nightmare, especially with low seniority. "
good,Fast paced enviorment where you can fulfill many different positions within the day. Always something new to learn and people are generally in a really good mood.
good,Overall Costco was not for me. Not enough opportunity to advance and a very strict yet inconsistent schedule. I was unable to find time to dedicate to school while employed. I learned a massive amount of information about the world of business and met a lot of great people. I had to move on though to give myself an opportunity to go to college. Management has favorites. Hard to move up in the company without somebody higher up on your side. A typical day is just like any day in retail. Put the customer first. Clean up the store and get ready for the next day. Workplace culture is something I typically stayed away from. Workers tend to get complacent and not seek any advancement in management or education. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting raises based on hours worked. The hardest part of the job is getting used to customers and management breathing down you back.
good,"If you don't know someone there or if they hire many simultaneously you may risk losing the job within your probationary period even if you do everything right. That being said, it's great if you're willing to give them your all and you actually make it past your first 90 days"
good,"I have worked for Costco for 12 years as an hourly and manager. Lots of opportunity for someone willing to put the company ahead of their family. The job security is amazing, top benefits and wages as well. To advance you really have to tow  the company line, they do not want innovators or free thinkers. The company has lost its family feel with the new CEO. A lot of the long term staff and managers are losing their dedication to the company. I can't say a ton of bad about the company it definitely has its good points just not right for someone that wants a strong family life."
good,I really enjoy working for Costco’s for the most part it can sometimes get stressful just like any other job does. But I enjoy the benefits it provides for me and my family and the diverse culture.
good,"You start at a fair wage and as you accumulate hours your wage goes up. They also have a seniority system, if you have been there for a while, you can move up into management."
good,"If retail is your calling, Costco would be the place to work. Pay is good and raises are according to hours worked. Hard work, but good atmosphere. Benefits start after 90 days."
good,"Each Warehouse is run by a General Manager, each GM has their own ideas/rules to implement. Most follow Costco’s Policies made by corporate, some make up their own rules. Each building I have been in have been a little different, but mostly run by the same set of rules, with the exception of the Redding Warehouse. Costco is a great company, just depends on location and Managers."
good,"They have a great work environment and amazing managers. Only down fall is working nights and weekends. Great insurance benefits, fast paced work, but would recommend."
good,Grateful to have been apart of the Deli department and gain a lot of experience as a first job and gained a true work ethic on how to be a good employee your work manager can be proud of.
good,"Tpyical day at work would be to plan your attack by analyzing new product arriving and fit it out on the floor correctly."
good,"Fast paced. "
good,Great place to gain job experience. Fun place to work  and they work with school hours. time and a half every Sunday. They proved lunch form time to time. I met a lot of good people there.
good,"Fairly easy work, fast paced most of the time, co workers easy to get along with. Management is okay. I enjoy working here, benefits are good. Hours are flexible."
good,"Costco is a great company, with a great pay and benefits. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Costco was a goid and hard job at times ' Depends on sales in dept you work in ' I learned how to work on my own and be productive ' Went through many employess "" Cause they did not want to learn new work ethics ' And working early morning hours did take its toll on your body"
good,"Pros:"
good,"Fun to work inside the warehouse. I unfortunately worked int the food court;awful experience then again, I hate working food service. Terrible manager, very rude and seemingly discriminatory. A friend works as a manager and he does decently. Lots of hours tho."
good,Bonne équipe et environnement de travail. Gens gentils
good,"Costco was a good experience particularly if you are local. The company typically hires PT and adds hrs during their busier months."
good,"I spent most of my day stocking produce and found that most of the employees were fun to be around, although the warehouse manager could be quite intimidating. Other than that, everything was okay."
good,"Service Deli Assistant"
good,Una buena empresa con muy buenas prestaciones. Buenos premios por empleados del mes o del año. Buenas actividades socioculturales.
good,"My review at Costco,"
good,come with your willingness to achieve the daily goals while providing exceptional service to members. Have a good positive attitude and leave what ever is going on in your personal life at the door so members and employees have a great work / shopping experience.
good,It is a great company to work for and there are a lot of opportunity to grow. You can become a manager if you work hard. The pay is not bad at all for retail and their benefits are great.
good,always moving and looking for something to do. either pushing carts or assisting cashiers load members carts youre always busy doing something! friendly co-workers help you stay positive and motivated.
good,Costco is a very dynamic company to work for as there are many different roles to fill. A typical work day can be very high pace and sometimes stressful (depending on which department you are working in). For the most part a typical day at work is fun thanks to fellow employees and some very enjoyable members you interact with. There is always something new to learn within the business with a lot of potential to grow. In this job you will gain a large amount of customer service experience and retail management knowledge.
good,The job is great for the retail experience. I learned a lot since I've been there. I hope to get more opportunities as I continue to work there ulitmately getting a higher position in the industry
good,"stocking, learned pallet jack use and stocking technique, management was okay sometimes didnt understand, work place was usually up beat, getting off early in the day was nice."
good,Good place to work. Time and a half pay often. Mostly lateral promotions. Benefits are great. Mostly great employees. Many managers and employees have been there awhile which is a good sign of the company.
good,"Working at Costco Wholesales was quite the experience, had my first anxiety attack there. It starts off paying fairly well, if you are part-time you would generally work three eight hour shifts and couple of four to five hour shifts. Working there was a lot of fun at times, there's a great little community between all the employee's and everyone knows each other. During the holiday season, Costco can get incredibly busy and that can lead to lunch rushes or dinner rushes and those are very difficult at times."
good,"This job isn't for everyone especially a student. If you are a student be prepared to work around the schedule the company gives you and through the holidays get ready for working long hours.  This company offers good, pay good benefits, and job security."
good,"Me parece una muy buena empresa para estudiantes como yo, ya que te da la oportunidad de desarrollar tus estudios"
good,"When I worked there I was lucky enough to hired on in the meat department. Every department in Costco seemed to be fast paced and there was always something to be done. It could get stressful at times, especially during the holidays, but co-workers were definitely a team and willing to help you out."
good,The only bad thing is the terrible management. The pay was good and you have holidays off. The work is hard and fast past but once you get used to it becomes a rhythm.
good,"Usually you work 8.5 hours a day which includes one 30 minute unpaid lunch and two 15 minute breaks. I was hired to be a front end, but some days you will spend your whole shift in another department. The store is always busy so no matter what you will always be moving and running around. Management is very nice and friendly but they do not always respect requests such as days off and school situations. They pay very well, but even part-time employees can work closer to 40+ hours a week."
good,Company has a very strong management structure. Working in the tire sales department was a big leaning curve for me. I learned a lot on this job which will give me help all my life
good,My time at Costco has been well spent.  Ive advanced quickly but when a personal tragedy happened to my family they grew tired of my inability to regain my old self.  Subsequently I was demoted.
good,Very hectic environment- enjoy helping people and making them smile when they find what they are looking for. Store is always busy and having many families at once taste testing and providing new items in the store.  Its like one big happy family!
good,"Costco is a great place to work. The employees and managers are all really friendly and willing to help. The most difficult part is the hours, working late nights and weekends."
good,"I got the job as a part-time morning merchandiser. I've been there a week and I'm already about to quit. Let me explain:"
good,Es una  empresa muy  grande se trabaja muy a gusto
good,"The pay and job security is top notch when compared to other similar jobs like wal-mart. There are plenty of opportunities to advance, and large pool of jobs (bakery, cashier, meat, forklift driver, cafeteria, tire shop) that are easily accessible should you wish to change"
good,"Overall a great company to work for. Competitive workplace in the sense of seniority plays a big role in your ability to move laterally, but moving up is performance/interview based."
good,"Todos los dias de trabajo son diferentes"
good,Good work-life balance. The dynamic and challenging work environment pushes everyone to stay on top of the current technology. Safe environment for everyone.
good,Working with Costco is in interesting and a lot of challenges. You get to meet  new people. In Costco is a very cold place so we have to make sure we wear a lot of layers. Or else your going to be cold. But in certain ares your moving and lifting and you start getting warm.Its a fun place to work at .The hardest part of the job is packing patties the machine goes fast but at the
good,"Very fast-paced member-based business.  There are a variety of shifts/positions available within the warehouse.  Some start as early at 4:00 am.  They have great pay scale,  benefits, and opportunities for advancement."
good,"Great place to work, great place once you get hired and adjusted into the way things operate. I think that being new can be unfun for you but once youre there awhile, you'll be fine."
good,Costco is a very competitive place to work as getting in is very difficult seeing as they usually only hire and promote from within more than they hire from outside the circle. The location of where I was at had many friendly staff and fellow co-workers who were more than willing to train and show me how to do the job properly and correctly.
good,Costco has taught me many different skills and abilities. It provided me with job security and advancement. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers but at the end of the day it is a rewarding job.
good,Costco is a good company to work for and have a great compensation and benefits package.  Some of the things that goes on in the warehouse can bother an employee. Overall they are a good company though.
good,"It's a fast paced place to work, lots of customers and the staff are all nice, the working hours aren't to bad, earliest start 5am and latest finish 10pm."
good,"Friendly coworkers and shoppers, learned a lot about Costco products in order to help customers. Benefits were good with flexible scheduling. At Costco the culture is like nothing i've experience before, it is so diverse which has also taught me a lot."
good,"A relaxing day at Costco is usually unheard of, as it is busy all the time. Whilst being provided with a pleasant work environment, you are expected to work tirelessly throughout the day to meet expectations set by your supervisors and managers. Even though considered retail, Costco operates as a warehouse, meaning there is little downtime for anything. There is always something going on in the warehouse that requires constant attention. That goes for all departments of the store, including the Bakery where I worked. My job was to basically manage the whole bakery, as I would be working by myself most of the time. It included anything from wrapping company product, decorating cakes, baking/mixing product, and sanitation. I learned an abundant amount throughout my endeavors at Costco and it further made me appreciate the hard work that people do everyday."
good,Work hard stay focused good company but will push u to the limit and sometimes it's hard a lot of stress on the body and mind I wake up early for my job but great company
good,"Great company, management blew in my experience. Depends on who you know. Expect to kiss a lot of a** if you want to move up. Still, a solid company you could retire from if you wanted."
good,I only worked here as a summer job but know people who have stayed with the company and have great things to say. This particular  warehouse was a bit of a boy's club.
good,"Typical day at work: many different jobs to do plus the opportunity to interact with members, assisting with customer service, etc. Good hours for a balance work/family life."
good,"As maintenance, I was more independent than most other departments was able to choose my break times as well as choosing what tasks needed to be done. I learned how to work within the Costco environment as an independent while also being part of a very large team. Costco has an ""open door policy"" meaning that if there is an issue, you can directly go to higher management and not have to ""climb the management ladder"". Costco heavily enforces workplace diversity for the benefit of the workplace as well as for the member's shopping experience. However, the most difficult part of the job is always high standards that they have for their employees. They most enjoyable part is the professional manner with which it is conducted as well as the welcoming nature of all of the co-workers."
good,"upon clocking in, you are assigned a cashier.  I was a front end assistant, helping unload and load their items.  This is a fast paced company with little ""down time"" on a shift."
good,Weekend days are very busy but week days and nights can get very boring and monotonous.  The other employees are nice and easy to work with. I would recommend it if you found the right department for you.
good,"A typical day would be getting there very early morning , talking to supervisor in charge and see which pallets needed to be broken down. We would get into teams and get the job done for first 4 hours , then clean up all the mess from breaking down pallets. We would take a break , and the store would be official open. We will help the cashier , bag groceries until it was time for us to go home."
good,I like working Costco because it was a nice laid-back kind of job dealing with people. but also letting people know a good about certain qualities in certain foods
good,"COSTCO never has parking, and does not provide private employee parking so I would have to show up 30 minutes early every day for work to hopefully find a place to park. I learned what a union life is like: impersonal and competitive. Workplace culture was immensely busy and massive, like worker bees in a hive. Management was experienced yet extremely unfriendly. The hardest part of this job was working with people who would treat me incompetent for asking questions, or were more interested in talking to their fellow managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the compensation."
good,"I can't say working their was great, but it certainly wasn't bad. Pay was good, work was work, managers were decent. Work came first and everything else came second. Not that that is bad. Overall, about as good as should generally be expected."
good,"-2 (15 min) breaks and a 30 min unpaid lunch"
good,"There is a lot of opportunity to grow your skills within the company, there are plenty of department to transfer to. The workplace is full of friendly and helping co-workers to help you with your experience."
good,I work with amazing people and enjoy my working experience at Costco Whole Sales. Their benefits are amazing and available for part time employees. I worked in the bakery and had an amazing experience. It is hard work and with that comes knowledge and growth.
good,Working at Costco was an excellent place to work at.During the  years I worked there I wa thought warehouse procedures customer service and many other things.
good,Management depends on location. Most days ran around like crazy and was very tired. You are given a lot of breaks though. Still a pretty good company.
good,I met lots of people there and over all enjoyed my time at Costco. However the management were not too understanding when it came to scheduling shifts. They required you give them your availability status but then would schedule you to work when you said you weren't available.
good,At Costco it was my first getting in a job and it was first seeing I was going work hard or just give in High School. This job help how  be on time and asking question.
good,Overall a great company to work for.  Benefits are good.  Has provided me with a solid foundation in life and a code of ethics that Costco prides itself on.
good,"I enjoy working at Costco. I work with a great crew and managers treat me with respect. Each store/ department is different but my experience has been a good one. I'd recommend working here especially if you have a positive attitude, there will be a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,I liked working at Costco while I was in school and I think that it has many different types of positions to offer. The management want the best but they were always trying to improve. Hardest part of this job was the customer service aspect since these customers pay a yearly fee to shop there. The most enjoyable part of this job was the work life balance and flexibility of scheduling.
good,"Great Company to work for, but management can be the cancer for the work place.  There aren't much room to improve or move up in older warehouse, maybe new ones."
good,"Everything about this job and company is phenomenal. I'd recommend this job to anyone. Pay and benefits are awesome. Just had the unfortunate experience of my manager and I not seeing eye to eye, so I decided to find a new job."
good,"Had a great time with Costco, progressed through the ranks due to the heirachy believing in me and my skills. Was rewarded well for hard work and determination"
good,Very good job. Good pay. Great benefits. Excellent job security. Tough to move up with seniority based promotions. Otherwise it's an enjoyable experience for those who like to keep active.
good,"Nice conversations"
good,"Costco is one of the best there is hands down... However, as a creative, I saw limited opportunities long term because I want to get into developing campaigns through tv advertising, digital marketing, and campaign management that Costco doesn't need. They rely heavily on word of mouth and have built an empire doing what works for them so they aren't likely to shift gears anytime soon."
good,"Fun, fast pace environment. Almost everyone is great to work with. It is a very busy workplce so I have to work fast but with efficiency."
good,Aprender a dar un buen servicio y tratar de siempre encontrar una solución tanto a los problemas como al socio para cubrir sus necesidades y no dar un No como respuesta
good,Worked here for about three years doing everything from building maintenance to morning stocking and major sales.  It was a very fast paced and difficult job working along side some of the best people I have ever known.
good,"Management is very nice. Co-workers are nice and helpful. Great benefits including free membership. Good hours and reasonable pay, they pay extra on sundays."
good,Working in Costco can be very hectic. The store is always busy and can be tiresome. Luckily Costco gives good wages and premium pay on Sundays. They also have a college retention program for workers that want to go back to school.
good,"When applied, i love working with the Costco culture! Ive worked in a few warehouses over the years and when management applies the costco mission statement the workplace is great and it shows in the employees."
good,"They are super good to their employees. Only down side to this job is the hours... it is a retail job! Everyone starts out part time, But if you are a good employee you can move up! They do play favorites, if someone has a relative that also works for the company and theyre in upper management, that person will move up quicker than someone who is more qualified for the job!"
good,"There are great benefits and compensation, the hourly employees are treated well and are held accountable to the company policies. Many long term employees that enjoy their job and coworkers."
good,Fast paced industry with plenty of great people to work with in general. Best way to get through the day is just do what you're told and don't be afraid to take the initiative.
good,"Costco is a very fast paced place with no two days the same."
good,"Good place to work as everyone tries to treat you fairly.  Very little feedback from supervisors as to your job performance and the Costco model does not properly take advantage of people's specific skills, in trying to treat everyone the same."
good,They are a good employer but hard to make an impression when no one follows company rules. Make you wear steel toed boots when half the staff walks around in sneakers.
good,A workplace with good wage.  I was trained for two weeks before the store opening.  The supervisors were all helpful and friendly.  I learned a lot and I would love to work at Costco if I ever get the chance again.
good,"The day-to-day routine is usually simple unless upper management is doing a ""walk through"", because everyone freaks out about it. The management is generally friendly unless you have a conflicting schedule, such as school or a second job. The hardest part of the job is the demanding effort during peak hours and the general rule bending when it comes to these peak hours."
good,"Overall this is a great company, they take care of their employees and the work can be fun. I worked in basically every department which include but are not limited to; bakery, foodcourt, cleaning, freezer stoking, folding clothes, pushing cart you get the idea."
good,"Everyday you are learning something new"
good,"Costco is a great place to work, however the expectation is 110% commitment. The job at management level comes before anything else."
good,"Costco was a pretty good place to work, if you don't mind dealing with a lot of people all day, every day. It is constantly very busy."
good,If you don't mind not having a social life during the weekends then its a great place to work!!! oh and if you don't mind members being rude and sick notes from a doctor being discredited by people who arn't health officials.
good,Good place to work for the long term. Hard to get fired from. Do your work and you will advance. Great for students needing part time work.
good,"A typical day at work included cleaning and maintaining the floor. I learned that no matter what your position is you need to work hard, other doors will open up. Management could be improved, a lot of mangers gossip more than they should and talk down on employees to other employees I felt that was completely unprofessional. My co workers was great everyone usually stay to themselves. The hardest part of my job was being called for simple task that could have been completed in two seconds by the person who called me. I enjoyed the benefits, my co workers, and interacting with the members of the wear house."
good,"I worked at a union Costco and I must admit it sucked. I had been asked to drop two classes because it didn't fit with their schedule and according to them Costco should be my priority. I didn't agree with that so I ended up leaving. As far as work wise, there is never a slow day."
good,"Pros"
good,I've appreciated all the things that Costco have allowed me in life to achieve. The pay and wages are good. There are drawbacks including the monotony of the work performed.
good,"I wake up early to get the kitchen ready of the never ending wave of customers. This part of Costco is definitely a faster paced part. No time for stopping. It certainly doesn't get boring there though, anything can happen and my co-workers were very nice and exciting."
good,"Costco was a fun and energetic place to work. They offer great benefits for short and long term employees. "
good,"This was my first job, i got it right out of high school. The job was fun depending on what job you were doing. I didn't really like working in the sun but i enjoyed the workout pulling carts, it was exhausting but it was my favorite part of the job. The benefits they gave you were off the charts and the pay was good. The people were friendly to me and were always respectful to the customers."
good,"It's a great place to work at. The only problem is not getting enough hours. Great coworkers and supervisors. Good breaks. They wont work around family schedules but if u attend school, they will work around that."
good,"Very relaxed and friendly place, American values. Work in own clothes, and although a fast paced environment, a fun place to work."
good,"A typical day at work was not difficult but not easy at the same times."
good,I enjoyed the fast paced environment.  The shifts seemed to fly by because there was always something to do.  I work well under pressure and am a quick learner.
good,Typical day at work is exciting but physically exhausting. I learned a great deal about the retail business. Management was great other than 1 or 2 exceptions. Co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job was before moving inside the facility the closing shift was quite stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with regular members and new members as well.
good,"la gente cerrada, buena oportunidad de empleo te dan libertad de horario aunque muy mala capacitacion"
good,PWD is the work somethings i did out of my zone nut im glad i choose to do it. it is always fun to be around demos table and explain about products with peoples. i enjoy working with DEMO teams and proud being one of the Demonstrations.
good,"Facilitate outcomes, event planning, Customer Service,Management"
good,A typical day for a front-end assistant is you are helping a variety of cashier to pack items into members carts. Generally it is a pretty easy job the biggest thing is make sure to be nice and friendly to the members and make sure you always have boxes for them. So far I have learned how to balance my time with working two jobs. For the most part the management and co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is if you have to go but an item away and your not sure where it goes. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the environment is calm and even when it is busy you don't feel overwhelmed.
good,I have worked or Costco for 2 years and for the most part it has been a very good place to work. I have been able to be cross trained in several different departments which has helped me to be able to meet the company's needs wherever I can. My only complaint is that it has been very hard to move up into management. My warehouse is a smaller one which has made achieving my goals at Costco very difficult.
good,"Stocked meats all morning, answered questions when customer came in. Same thing every day, wasn't hard work. Good boss, friendly people."
good,empresa con buenos sueldos  prestaciones pero problemas en los manejos de areas y de horarios laborales debido a los empleados de ella como sup y gerentes
good,"Fun place to work with supportive co-workers and some supportive management.  Constant physical labor except for breaks and lunches. Learning is expected in order to advance in the company. Probation period of three months is very hard, difficult to get through. The benefits and pay are worth the work."
good,"Es una empresa muy importante a nivel internacional, dan mucho apoyo a los estudiantes con los horarios y manejan buenos salarios."
good,"i like morning jobs like i work 7to11am part time. it is fun and nice to work there. the management is very good. this is a good part time job, i have enjoyed it. all people that i am working with are pretty nice."
good,"Costco can be a great place to work, provided the management is good. On more than one occasion employees would have to shout at the top of their lungs to get a supervisor's attention. Managers have come and gone, usually leaving some mess in their wake. "
good,"The managers and co-workers are good people, and the benefits are impressive. The warehouse was always busy so it taught me how to balance my time. There is always work to be done, but managers are very understanding."
good,"Every day at Costco is different, one may come across individuals of different character or attitudes.  The job can be very demanding and stressful at times but thats what makes the day go by much quicker!  Management could improve on communication however they try their best with as many employees as they have.  The most enjoyable part of my day is meeting new people and hearing how much they love shopping at Costco!"
good,Un ambiance de travail positif. Possibilité d'avancement. salaire concurrentiel.
good,"Working at Costco was highly rewarding. Helping customers on a daily basis ,keeping clothing area neat and tidy was some days a challenge but as a team we did a good job."
good,"-not to busy. Everything runs smoothly"
good,"When you first start, you will not have too many hours. However once you pass your 2 yr mark, hours and pay will come. Benefits will make you want to stay with the company."
good,"El trabajo en costco, era rutinario, desarrolle muchas habilidades a la hora de estar en cajas, el manejo de efectivo, trato con la gente,el revisar que no faltara nada por cobrar, la venta de tarjetas de credito a la vez, el apoyo por parte de mis jefes y supervisores siempre fue muy bueno, el ambiente de trabajo excelente, el personal de RH siempre fue muy  atento con todos en general, nos brindaban muchos beneficios a la hora de hacer antiguedad ahi"
good,It is a busy non stop work environment that is always dealing with customers. Some days are slow and others are non stop but for the most part it is non stop. You will run breaks and make sure the business is in good condition. You also have to keep a look out for sales and make sure you are running efficiently. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone is happy (managers).
good,"Au travers des postes polyvalentes que j'ai occupé durant les 7 années à cet emploi, j'ai acquit une expérience de travail incroyable. Ce qui fait en sorte que je peux aujourd'hui occupé un poste de gestion d'équipe, gérer et planifier une petite entreprise, inventaire, productivité, horaire, service à la clientèle, vente. Je sais que j'ai les capacité et la motivation de pouvoir comblé ce genre de poste."
good,"The company itself is amazing and has great policies for shoppers, employees, and vendors. The benefits are amazing from insurance to paid days off to a pay scale higher than the average retailer. There are many departments in a building a person could choose from. Employees are encouraged to work in different areas and it's relatively easy to transfer. Employees are also given a grace period where they can choose to step down or back to their previous job if the new job didn't work out. "
good,"start the machines on and get the work out for make the goal."
good,"Great company to work for and took good care of employees.  I enjoyed working with the people of Costco, sometimes working with the customers would be difficult but taught me how to work with unhappy people."
good,"Have to be at work by 4am.  Go punch in at time clock then go to your forklift and perform safety inspection. Then I'd drop 40 to 60 pallets for the stockers to work on.  Typically we have 3 or 4 depots come in ex Coke, Pepsi, Gatorade, Water, Paper etc. and I was responsible for organizing the steel with these items. Store opens at 10am so all merchandise have to pick up off the floor and be show time ready for opening. The last 2.5hrs we would go to the front end and cashier for the rest of the shift."
good,A job that had several responsibilities and required full attention at all time. There wasnt a moment were I stood still and the the hardest part pf the job was standing all day long.
good,"Typical day - Met with GM/AGM to ascertain changes in business plan and merchandising.  Reviewed weekly sales and payroll trends to determine shortfalls and to make required recommendations.  Reviewed shipping and receiving docs for incoming depots.  Communicated with junior level managers and provided direction, as needed."
good,One day i have to work in a different department as there were short people .i was put on to there but i did not know how to work there but with thé friendly staff i was able to learn and perform my job requirements.After that day when thé superviser of that department want to go for holidays for one week then thé management have decided to put me there as i worked well and learned quickly.
good,Costco wholesale is a great place work with very flexible work hours.
good,"Great place to work, friendly people and was fast paced.. Seasonal position other wise would have stayed."
good,"Extremely busy and stressful. A great place to work however with good pay and benefits. Made alot of friends, management good. I learned alot."
good,Yes I sure would.. Costco is above reproach in there business and selling and customer serviceThere products and there brand is even better then some name brands. They arent always happy with us demostrators because the claim we get in there way but we sell there kirkland products too and most are very nice..The company we actually word for is CDS.. Thank you
good,We greet and take care of each member that walks into our warehouse. We offer services and go the extra mile as needed. We promote and sell vendor owned merchandise successfully.
good,"I was a cashier, stocker, worked receiving, and customer service. I had great co-workers and great surroundings. I learned how to deal with all kinds of customers and be courteous even with the most unruly of customers."
good,"Good job or young people. Good pay, and good hours. Management worked well with school schedule."
good,Co-workers were the best part of the job. Felt like working with family
good,"•	Answer customers' questions about products, prices, availability, product uses, and credit terms."
good,"The first five hours (5am-10am) is re-stocking and/or re-merchandising the sales floor at a fast and safe manner where being disciplined is necessary to achieve our main goal, always working with a team we learned how to be ""team players"" and achieving our goal is very rewarding"
good,"-Good Wages"
good,"A typical day at work would entail me entering the deli and jumping right into whatever the team members were working on prior. It consisted of making entrees, salads, pizza etc. I learned that it really does help when everyone is working together. As it is a fast pace environment I believe that team work is the key to getting things done! Management is decent I love how they not only gave us direction but they weren't afraid to do hands-on work with us DAILY. My co-workers were awesome! The hardest part of my job was coming to a cold environment as I hate the cold very much it wasn't the greatest feeling, wearing four layers helped!"
good,"Fast paced energetic environment, member service driven culture"
good,"Costco is a good place to work with a lot of great people and a positive atmosphere. The typical issues with any retail outfit are there, but overall, a positive experience."
good,Great people who believe in working hard and having a good time doing it.  Managers are very kind and most employees make everyone feel welcomed.  Sometimes lifting heavy items over and over would get taxing.  Ending the day making customers feel good after they had spent money in our store was very satisfying.
good,Every morning I have to be at work around 5 am to get the store ready for customers and to make their shopping experience easier. I stock the products and clean up anything that would be in the way for the customer. I use jacks to pull pallets to different parts of the store to be stocked. I would say the hardest part of my job is the time I start. Its very draining on me. But overall its a great place to work and the management and my co workers are the best.
good,"As a supervisor for Costco I am constantly solving problems and answering questions throughout the day. I ensure that every member receives the highest quality member service possible. I generally work with two or three other supervisors at a time, but I can also work independently. I report to several managers throughout the day and complete every task that is given to me. While working as a supervisor at Costco I've learned how to delegate workloads and manage a business that is constantly fluctuating."
good,Its a fine job if your not part time or seasonal. This was my first job so I liked it but the hours where bad It was hard to get a day off. Cashiers and night drivers are rude. Seasonal workers don't get union benefits but we do have to pay union dues which is $20 every pay check which doesn't make sense to me.
good,Based on my and friend's experience Costco is a great company to work for. Very employee friendly. But this creates a problem as no one wants to leave which creates very few opportunities to join the team.
good,"Overall the Costco company is a great place to work, good money with great benefits and the job keeps one very busy. "
good,"Se inicia abriendo, limpiando y verificando que todo este en orden."
good,I had to leave because I had personal problem everything was great and fun I didn't had to worry about anything. They give great raise too
good,"Amazing compnay, pay is great, people are awesome ( life long freinds), and you have the best opportunities to advance. I should not have left."
good,"A typical day at work starts about 9am, no matter what time it is they are always busy. Everyday there are people lined up at the door waiting to get in, its like a concert there going to see. My co-workers are very friendly, they greeted me and showed me around the place that I would be working. The hardest part of the job was probably keeping up with helping all the customers at once and maintaining the flowers. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching the customers walk away in satisfaction."
good,Expérience positive en général. N'hésiterait pas à y retourner. 
good,"Great place to work, excellent pay as well as opportunity for advancement. Co workers were great and it was fun to meet new people."
good,"customer service, installer,cashier,10 point release system"
good,Costco was a fantastic company to work for and also beneficial. The best part of the job was my co-workers and myself working as a team unselfishly and achieving our goals for the day. If there were any conflict between any of us we would handle it in a respectful and understandable manner. The management with this job was very organized and professional. Each department was under controlled and accomplished top sales everyday. The hardest part of the job was to encourage the customers to sign up for the golden membership. Working as front end I also had to attract customers in signing up for the golden memberships. It was my first time talking to customers presenting how beneficial the membership is to them.
good,"Over the course of 18 years I learned the importance of teamwork, hard work, and the importance of ethics. I enjoyed the fast paced environment. Expected to encounter a new obstacle daily."
good,Typical day at work requires that you work quickly and interact with many Costco members. Costco members are what keep Costco running and it is important to make sure their experience in the warehouse is great. Sometimes management can be lazy and not communicate as well as they should. Co-workers are friendly and help each other out when needed. Hardest part of the job is working on busy days like the weekend. Placing and taking out chicken from the oven can take its toll over and eight hour shift. The most enjoyable part of this job are interacting with your co-workers.
good,"Costco is a good place to work, but it is very hard to get fulltime in this company. You have to work weekends if you are partime."
good,"Costco Wholesale is an excellent job if performed correctly. The Lincoln Park Costco in Chicago is one of the only ones in city limits so it is very busy and the management is exactly like you would think Chicago management is, it is terrible. It might have gotten be since I've left but I highly doubt it."
good,"The day for me started around 330 pm, clock in go talk to the supervisor to see where I will be assisting until my first break. Usually helped up front with the cashiers. Unloading members carts to be rang up, then reload the cart. Some of my time was spent in the parking lot collecting carts keeping it generally clean. At the end of day was clean up and blocking down."
good,Fabulous company to work for. Great benefit package. Highly motivated work environment.
good,Great Job. Really depends on your warehouse. The benefits are great.
good,"Costco is a great place to work , great people to work with ! the only down side is the hours"
good,They promote employees up into management positions. It seems like management has little training when it comes to dealing with situations.
good,"el ambiente de trabajo dentro de la empresa es muy bueno, aunque no reconocen si haces bien tu trabajo y como te desempeñas, si no todo lo contrario si algo llegas hacer mal, enseguida te lo hacen ver, y para tener un puesto y sueldo mejor, tienes que tener dinero, carro del año, y ser muy presumido y prepotente con los demas. y creo que no se vale.uno trabaja por necesidad no por hobbie"
good,"organize an keep stock out on the racks so customers could buy. clean an sanatize the entire meat room, tools and equipment."
good,"a day at work was good.management was very helpful. learded alot about stocking shelfs, co-workers were dependable,hardest part of the job was making production. lunch was my most enjoyable time."
good,"I loved working for this company, even though it was only temporary. I felt the marketing department could have used better organization with the amount of the temporary employees they had"
good,on a day to day bases work on cars getting them in and out of the bay's at a frequent time ensuring that all essential functions are performed on each vehicle due to that invoice ticket.
good,"Spent a long time with the company as I watch other pass by everyone else because of favoritism, relationships and friends in the workplace. The company was great to work for in the early years but as the management changes so do the policies that are inforced. The company went from employee and family oriented too everyone for themselves. Its hard to trust most individuals because of the politics involved. I do recomend for anyone who is fresh out of high school or still in college because of the flexible scheduling and the base pay with benefits."
good,"Atg least at my store , the quality of the managers and supervisors they promote has gone downhill. I was there for over 11 years and have seen great managers leave only to be replaced with less knowledgeable people."
good,"Great company, fun place to work at and learn new things, great team work."
good,Everyday is different work to be done based on what is needed. I learned to adapt to different work environments quickly and excel. Co workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what you will be doing everyday. You have to be ready for anything. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you can get a sense of what is needed and do it without being asked to.
good,I was at the front helping customers unload and load their carts with their purchases. I would greet them and help them with cashing out. I also working outside assiting customers with loading their cart with heavy objects as well as collecting all the loose carts in the parking lot. The hardest part of the job was collecting carts on rainy days on a weekend when it was extremely busy. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers I worked with.
good,It was a fast-paced work environment with great friendly fellow employees. It offered great pay with benefits for part-time and full-time employees.
good,"I only worked for Costco for 6 months or so. In my short time there, I met amazing people. My coworkers and managers were great. The job starts off at a decent hourly pay. This was my part time job and I would go there after working an 8-10 hour day. It is exhausting, you are on your feet all the time but I enjoyed every minute of it. I moved out of state and was unable to transfer due to lack of vacancies, other wise I would have stayed with the company!"
good,I worked at this company for 15 years and got most if not all of my management skill experience here.
good,"I worked with a small group of employees who created gourmet entrees, lunch meats, and rotisserie chicken. I assisted the manager with supporting the work of other representatives, with scheduling employees, and completing necessary paperwork and reports for the department."
good,"I've worked at costco for nearly 8 years, and for the most part, I have had a wonderful experience. I started there when i was 19 years old...just a young kid with very rough edges. Flash forward by 8 years : this company has helped me to become a great employee with some awesome skills. The pay is excellent and always has been since day one, with regular raises based on hours worked, not quality of work. The company does appear to play favorites when it comes to advancement, and the scheduling system is all wrong. It is a 100% rotaing schedule, meaning you never really have the same days off, so making plans outside of work proves to be very difficult. Once the schedule is made, you can always count on getting a call to come in early or work extra days because someone else has called in sick. I recently went back to school to get training in the medical field because as good as the pay is, I find that retail tends to be rough when you've done it for so long. If, however, you are one of those people who can do the same thing for years to come without getting bored, then Costco will be happy to accommodate you and will pay you very well. I must also mention that the benefits package is out of this world! You will NEVER find another company willing to extend the caliber of benefits package that Costco is so well known for."
good,"I really admire the work ethic that you must have if you work at costco. It's about hard work with good pay and raises. Great benefits include health insurance, free membership for you and family, paid holidays and 1 week paid vacation."
good,"Most of my co-workers were fantastic to be around and work with. We became very good friends and through that, we're able to work very efficiently and play to each others strengths. If a job was particularly hard for one person others would step up. Management was very understanding of most concerns we had. Food Court is much more involved than most people realize so it's a lot on your feet and moving around."
good,Was easy to work with Co Workers and I really enjoyed the people around me who were really accepting of me and were especially helpful when it came to learning new things and getting a grasp of the job.
good,"not suitable if you are work shy or don't like working at the weekends, good food available for break time. lots of other staff so some great nights out."
good,This is my first workplace in Canada. The work culture is quite friendly. everyone is polite and helpful. Supervisors and managers are considerate and understanding.
good,You will feel that you are being overworked and underpaid but the benefits are great. Management will cut hours from departments to ensure that they maintain a positive overhead.
good,I was professional and good with others and asking questions what to do and how to do it. I was able to do it correctly and get it on time with others l.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Costco Wholesale and the people, good environment helps you with your people skills and works on your ethic and pays very well. I would recommend this job."
good,"Assuming that you are allowed to keep working there, Costco is a very friendly place that is forgiving to mistakes. The people there are nice, and you get to see how everything works. A typical day in the food court can be hectic, but it slows down at the end. And assuming you have the time, you can also shop a bit too. So it's a win/win."
good,"Costco Wholesale is usually a fast-paced environment. Every employee that stays employed more than 6 months are people who hate having nothing to do at work. You like always having stuff to do and working in a team, you might really like it. Management gives feedback from time to time, but more often depending of the departments. Costco Wholesale also offers pretty generous benefits. There are also many possibilities of advancement. Al so, Costco employees are given various tasks, if there is not enough clients at the cash, for example, they will send you to do other things, until there are more customers at the cash. They will go get you, sometimes after 10 minutes, sometimes after 30 minutes, depending on the needs, but you will remain busy."
good,"I worked here as a seasonal worker and this job helped me a lot with stuff I needed to pay (rent, bills) it was a great experience and overall a good place to work"
good,The work is fast-paced but it made you learn the work environment faster which essentially helped. It was about learning the store so to better help the customers with their shopping experience.
good,"Good management, friendly employees, enjoyable work culture, and good challenging work. Great benefits, good scheduling. Was hired seasonally, but strongly intend to reapply asap."
good,"If you don't feel you have a particular calling and are looking for steady work with great benefits and a likelihood of promotion, this is a great place. If you're looking for a job that is a stop along the way to something different, it's not really worth it. Unless you're young and fairly bereft of financial obligations the pay starting out is fairly punitive. You do get steady raises, but you do have to put in a few years at least before you're really making decent money."
good,Costco has been a wonderful place to work with multiple departments to learn from. The work place is very fast paced and often times members will stop you and ask for help so familiarity with the store is key to understand locations of general areas. The culture has always been centered towards member satisfaction and can cause many managers to feel that accommodating to a member is necessary to have a good interaction. I was fortunate enough to work in every department excluding hearing aid which allowed to me get a much more holistic view of the day to day operations and was useful when being promoted to a supervisor. The hardest transition from me came through my promotion in which delegation and assistance was limited by management who preferred a hands off approach in order to get operations finished. My favorite part of working within the warehouse is the ability to get to learn and understand multiple different departments which really allowed me to dig deep within the warehouse. I feel that these opportunities shaped my ability to lead and help my employees in the long run.
good,Start work in the morning and make sure that the warehouse is clean and presentable before opening. All merchandise is stocked and accessible for all shoppers. Wearing safety shoes is mandatory and might be the hardest part of the job since you're always on your feet.
good,Costco is a great company in general and has great benefits and job security. It also has room to advance within the company and guaranteed pay raises too.
good,"Both face-paced at time to quite slow (depends on your location), consists of quite a lot of walking and standing. The constant switching out between positions made work days more exciting."
good,Mais je ne voulais pas faire cela de ma vie donc j’ai quitté pour ce que je voulais faire
good,A great company to work for. It can take a while to get regular hour shifts. You learn a lot of great skills. They give great benefits and regular pay raises.
good,"Good place to work for, management seemed pretty fair. A place where there is opportunity to grow within the company. I really dont have anything negative to report about Costco Wholesales. However, I do wish I had been given more of an opportunity to show my potential but unfortunately I was a seasonal hire."
good,"Great Job. Surrounded by plenty of good and hardworking people. The Costco I was working at was supposedly the highest traffic tire center in the State, so we were always super busy. You are always working toward a raise, and the highest pay at costco is quite nice along with time and a half on Sundays. I felt like my life was all work but I think it's very possible to have a life outside of work at another location."
good,"The work is hard but the atmosphere is energetic and encouraging.  Each day I am helping cashiers, assisting customers or pushing carts.  The management is firm, but fair and consistent."
good,"Had an awesome Time working their, my boss was very accommodating to the hours that I could work. Always willing to help and we worked as a team. Some days were more hectic than others."
good,"During my time of having this job, I learned multiple things I had never known. I was certified at the gas station and also in the tire center. Management overall could be better. They work the good employees harder to make up for the slack of the workers not working hard. Also, I know seniority is huge with the company, but management treats the tenured employees like they can do no wrong. overall I did enjoy having some people around me that cared as much about the job as I did."
good,"Typical day at Costco is always busy in the warehouse. "
good,It was a alright job I just needed a different job title an I needed more income 390 was good an all it just wasn’t enough for me at the time though an the hours was too long for that amount of cash
good,"It's a good place to work when you're a student and only want to work during seasonal periods, such as the holidays and during the summer. They have a student option for working as well for university students if you're enrolled in 3 or more classes which is pretty beneficial."
good,environement developeur de competance et travail et esprit dequipe
good,Great company to work for!  Great work environment depending on department Great benefits as well! Just Poor management and lack of communication at the Baton Rouge location!
good,"The job was very physically demanding, which was not stressful for me at all, but it was simply repetitive labor. There were no real challenges to completing the job, just work fast and be flexible to step in to help out different departments when needed. Management was not always on the same page about things. Other workers that had been there for a long time, seemed unhappy. I believe that most employees just stay for the benefits as Costco does tend to take very good care of their employees. Although most people didn't seem satisfied with working there for the job itself."
good,"We were able to have fun while working! The people I met there are like family, some of them are still my close friends. I recommend this place to everyone!"
good,"Great company to work for! They take care of their employees, I've work for costco for almost 27 years. It's been a great place to work with great pay and benefits."
good,"Very productive environment, I enjoyed working there. Although there was a lot of heavy lifting required in the meat department, my co- workers were really helpful and easy to work with."
good,The key to getting a job at Costco is being tenacious don’t just do it with the application call the manager walk to the store and ask for a manager after you applied that shows them you care once you get the job work grind put your head down don’t stop until that 90 days is over. You will get a part-time or full-time job and even then grind ask to be part in other departments The multi faceted Will rise quicklyupthe ranks fasteralways get ahead
good,"I my experience, Costco has been an enjoyable place to work. It can be extremely fast paced, but it is always fun and exciting. It can be very stressful at times."
good,working at Costco was ok but for the people that have put in their time it seemed to be more beneficial. I know that isn't really helpful but I wasn't ready to write reviews of places I have worked
good,This place was very well organized but I feel they have a preference with American people. This was how I felt and yet don't know much since this was a seasonal job for me.
good,This is a good job to have for people wanting to work in retail but don't want to be at the mall. I worked 6:15 p.m. to 2:45 a.m. My advice is to work here as long as possible.
good,Great place to work but if you have a family it is hard to juggle with family life and work life Because I’m inconsistent schedule.  Great benefits wonderful 401(k) plan
good,Considero que es una empresa muy recomendable para trabajar ya que se busca el apoyo total de sus empleados. Siempre buscando maneras de mejorar con la finalidad de brindar el mejor servicio.
good,"Great place to work as far as income and benefits are concerned. But, a drama filled environment… Feels like high school on steroids. Instead of teenagers you are dealing with adults that act like teenagers. Management could be a lot better. There is a lot of little man syndrome in management.… Too many chiefs, not enough Indians"
good,"working at membership is fun and challenging. you are always solving new problems. if you work hard, there is room for career advancement. if you are loyal to the company, they will treat you well in terms of base salary and lump sum bonuses."
good,"Pros"
good,"Costco is a big warehouse, and you get to walk around it which is kind of fun. They want you to treat the customers with a prompt and friendly attitude. "
good,"It was a fun and fast paced environment to work in. pay was fairly well, no complaints.it was hard to balance work and school at the same time but managers were very helpful."
good,As a Rotisserie room worker or Deli Associate things could get a bit hectic definitely with quick changes implemented every week or so. Besides that my direct manager was awesome.
good,"Not bad overall. My experience was good, just with poor management. It seems the management in my area is poor to bad and they did not escape that stereotype. It’s was not terrible though."
good,fast paced environment that kept you busy and moving with a sense of urgency. Although the management was terrible. Not only did I think that but others made me led to believe.
good,"Great place to be a full-time or part-time employee. Great healthcare benefits and starting pay is normally above other companies within the same type of work!"
good,"Great company to work for, they teach on the job but teaching can lack in some areas. Advancement is there if you are dedicated and make sure to have a mentor."
good,"A Costco typical work day is fast paced, which I do like.  I have learned to work faster, literally running down the aisles, while having a positive attitude."
good,A typical day at work consist of being to work at 5am in the morning and stocking till about 9:15 when they get ready to open the store up. They only thing is the management at the store I was working at has lack of communication skills and they don’t work as a team at all. You’ll always have different managers telling you to do things and etc.
good,Many warehouses differ. Mine used to have a ping ping table and games in the break room. Now we have an Atari and corn hole! Just be ready to work quickly and efficiently.
good,Good company. Outstanding company to grow with definitely leaders in the industry. Be willing to learn all the different departments creates great opportunity for growth.
good,Everyone is hired seasonally.  It helps if you are referred by an employee. They choose certain people to stay and the rest are let go as seasonal employees.
good,"I love working for Costco and it's a very good business to work for if you're eager to move up in position and pay. They go by seniority when it comes to wanting to move up in the company but as long as you come to work everyday with your best foot forward, the opportunities are inevitable."
good,"Costco has one of the best starting pay rates, time and a half pay on Sundays, raises earned by number of hours worked even part time employees get amazing health insurance benefits. How ever managers and management styles vary quite a bit. I wish managers had more training  on dealing directly with the employees, and that the employees felt heard when making suggestions"
good,"good place to work, good pay, I would recommend to someone to apply it's a good place to start a career promote from within. "
good,"Working at Costco, you never know exactly what you'll do each day. Management cross-trains and gives the opportunity to cross-train employees in so many departments to allow for new skill development and opportunities for experience. Because of this, the job always keeps you on your toes and prepared for almost any situation that could come your way."
good,Great job for a young person to get their feet wet at. They take pretty good care of you. You get a free membership so that's a bonus. Easy to work your way up too if you work hard.
good,I would have preferred to work an evening shift. There is limited flexibility. Protective gear should be provided when working with the freezers and/or in areas where the temperature is extremely cold.
good,"The can be flexible with your availability, very easy, self efficient work. Most of the people who work there are easy going. Management does tend to show favoritism. Benefits and pay are the best in the retail industry"
good,"Not a bad company to work for.  The pay is good, and you get automatic raises every so many hours.  Biggest issue was with management.  They are a tight knit group and are unwilling to take accountability for one another's poor actions and attitudes from time to time."
good,"It was good for a temporary job, I would definitely recommend to a friend. "
good,A lot of hours and constantly on the go with little time to yourself. Nice people and nice managers. Can be very busy especially on weekends. Good place
good,Would work there again. Co workers are great. Days go by fast. Pay and benefits are very comparable. 401k and open for policy make the company a great place to work
good,"Good company with excellent benefits for you and your family. As a travel agent, you take phone calls to assist customers with booking reservations and modifying existing reservations"
good,Typical day you make sure sales floor is clean and presentable for members and to costco standards. Try your best to have all merch on the floor ready for sale that includes restocking if necessary. You learn basic customer service everyday. The environment everyone is mostly friendly and polite of course not all work places are perfect. Expect some co workers who are not always friendly. Hardest part of the job is being short staffed and having to do double the work load for consecutive days at a time. Enjoyable part is probably the free samples the demo ladies offer and the rare super occasions when the company provides free lunch/bbq
good,"Costco is a face paced warehouse, where you will interact with hundreds of people every day. It is fun because you work in close quarters with coworkers, however it can be stressful at times because of how busy and rushed it is."
good,Costco wholesale is a great place to work you need to be driven hustle with every assignment they give . There is a lot of good Mangers & supervisors if you don't know just ask .
good,"Tienes buenas prestaciones, buen sueldo y son flexibles pero tienes que trabajar siempre los fines de semana y no te da tiempo para vida personal durante los fines"
good,"It's a good job to have if you're in school and just need to have that income or don't know what to do with your life. It's fast and slow paced depending on the day of the week and time of year, once you've been there a year, you'll get the hang of knowing busy times."
good,"I worked for Costco for 3 years, what I learned is Costco is an excellent employer especially on paper. The only flaw is that each building has its own culture and corporate policy only applies when something can cause a law suit. So if you have good managers, awesome place to work. If managers are bad, the entire building feels it. I would work their again, and i highly recommend it."
good,"Good I like it make me busy"
good,i really enjoy working with the people at costco. the workers and management are all nice. the hardest part was the travel time to working and the different schedule changes.  i learned alot from them and how different it is from regular retail.
good,"Had a great review, people in management were great to work for. Dealing with people every day was a great and rewarding job. Management was very flexible with hours and always asked if you wanted more hours."
good,"All I have to say is that working at food court is not easy. I have learned how to measure things in order to make food properly. Management do not worry for their employees in the way they should do. Sometimes in my department, we do not even have time to take our 15 minutes paid break just because it is too busy and there is not enough employees on the department. We always need to ask for help from the front end in order to cover our lunches. The department needs more staff. It gets so busy and no employees to serve the members right. We are always struggling. The hardest part of the job is CLOSING because there is only two closer and everything needs to be done by 11:00pm , having in mind that the store closes at 8:30pm. It is so difficult, and we always rushing to try to finish on time. There is no way to enjoy at food court."
good,"Very fast pace job and require you to meet certain quotas in the deli. If you don't, you can easily get suspended or fired. They give you one 30min lunch and two 15 min breaks. Good for those planning to stay for long term with the company. Get consistent raises depending on the hours you work. Best of luck to you all."
good,"There are many chances to cross-train in different departments. "
good,"I applaud their business culture. Every job gives you the song and dance about how great they are to their customers and their employees. Costco lives up to what they say. While no job is perfect, Costco tries. I would still be working there, if I hadn't been  only a temporary seasonal employee."
good,"Great company to work for, great compensation. The people you wok with are great and you can make some lifelong friends here. Only concern specifically for the warehouse I am at is management refuses to take responsibility for their mistakes. Whenever there is an issue with scheduling and there is no opener or closer, or if the warehouse or a specific department is short handed the blame is ALWAYS shifted to the hourly employees. Another issue at the warehouse I am at is management rewards those who do not work hard, and those who go above and beyond see no mobility because management likes to keep those who work hard stationary and move around those who do not work hard, causing for the overachievers to lose out on opportunities, and when something does go wrong, the blame is all put on the few who actually do work instead of those who do not; it can be very backwards and frustrating."
good,Was a pretty good job and can be a worthwhile career. The management and co-workers are very helpful. The break room is also quiet nice. Though there is more of a focus on looking busy than actually being so. The scheduling can also be very chaotic so a open schedule is recommended.
good,"Working for Costco was a good experience great communication and people skills good organization, detailing and customer service and helpful co workers."
good,I learned alot at my time at Costco. I learned how to be a better team leader as well as how to follow instructions so that everything runs smoothly for others to do their job effectively.
good,"Costco offers some of the best opportunities for job seekers looking for a career path that will require no higher education. However, because of this, many of the employees that reach the higher levels of management are uneducated and lack the skills and understanding required for the complexity of the job."
good,"It is a good place to be, but not much opportunity to work full-time hours.  Cost of living is too high for a part time job.  Costco will not work around hours at a second job.  Plus, your hours are reduced when seasonal workers are brought in."
good,This was a good place to work. I learned various job related skills that's I think I may benefit from in the future. Management was well trained. They was also very understanding with scheduling
good,fun and fast paced. hard work but good pay. management is a hierarchy and people are moved up in the company based on favorites rather than seniority that costco is known for.
good,Overall I have enjoyed my time with this employer. I have been very blessed with the opportunities given to me here. Costco is a very family friendly environment that definitely takes care of its employees.
good,"The only thing I didn’t care for was if they were going to keep me or not for seasonal. I know I worked hard, but it would be nice to be told if they were going to keep you"
good,It was very fast paced and everybody sucked up to managers. I enjoyed working there with the people that were there to work. It was stressful during the holidays.
good,"Excellent company to work for and have a career with. Workload can be demanding at times but enjoyable due to fellow employees and some competent managers. Career advancement is possible, individual must show drive, problem solving skills, and excellent Customer Service."
good,Great place to work a job. Didn't see much Career potential since everything is pretty much outlined structured. loved the time i spent there in the pharmacy.
good,"My experience at Costco was pretty good. I was a part-time worker working full-time hours. Our morning merchandising crew at the time was under-staffed. All my coworkers and most of the management staff were awesome people. Yet I felt led on when I was looking towards promotions. My location was busy and crazy every day. Being fast pace, quick on your feet and hardworking are a must but in most situations it felt like it was appreciated and not overlooked. The culture is kinda like a stereotypical groups. Because the warehouse was broken down by department not many would socialize outside of their department for the most part. Although that was the case everyone was generally friendly to each other. I felt like I left with a bad taste in my mouth however but that is due to the fact that I felt led on with certain promotions. But overall the experience and benefits and coworkers were what made Costco worthwhile."
good,"Good part time job. Inside cosco. If your able to do demos everyday, and stand, you can do the job. If not, then they don't allow you to sit, you need medical clearance if disabled and need a chair."
good,"From my experience there Costco was an amazing company to work for, the hours are very consistent, the staff is surprisingly friendly, and nothing is taken personally. However, the management staff could be better as i wasn't informed about changes when i was supposed to be and would happen weeks after and I would have to ask."
good,At the time of clock in I was given a section (chosen by supervisor) and I was to keep that section empty of cardboard and keep the items faced/stocked.  I assisted customers as they needed as well.
good,"overall Costco was a good place to work at however they never gave me enough hours to sustain myself because I was a "" seasonal employee"". the workload was manageable but at time could prove quite stressful"
good,"Positive place to work with good money rewards. However, very difficult to manage social life and work as you have to work weekends regardless and holiday is a nightmare to get."
good,"During my time working at Costco, i learned many skills such as organisation, sticking to a tight schedule, customer service and communication. i would work for this company again."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Costco, it was very face paced and self-reliant. However, they were not very easy to work with on scheduling with college lifestyle."
good,"A typical day is always fast-paced, extremely busy, always moving, requires a lot of focus. You must be prepared to do the job, whatever task is assigned to you as an individual or as a team. Management is made of a controlled group of leaders who understand what it takes to complete the task and finish the job by the end of the night. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with everything to do, may feel like you are being split into a million different directions. The pros of the job are definitely the amount of accomplishment you feel once the task is complete, the joint effort as a team that it took to get to where everything is at; when all is said and done management will always prioritize the safety of it's members and workers and do everything in their power to keep the power balance equal for all workers(full-time, part-time, seasonal, etc.)."
good,"This is a great workplace to work considering the environment and the co-workers. There are opportunity to grow depending of you capabilities so, if you want to reach high position you can but you have to be dedicated and work hard of course. I general term i like Costco Organization."
good,"This is a great place to work as long as you don't need full time right away.  I really liked working with the bakery team, they were friendly, helpful and made learning easy.  The hardest part was cleaning at night but you do what it takes to get the job done.  My supervisor was excellent!"
good,"Lots of favoritism in the company. Micromanagement is common because the big guys don't want to deal with issues. Other than that, great benefits. It's a valued job. Flexible, and paid holidays."
good,I enjoyed working for Costco's as a seasonal employee.The management team was very welcoming and helpful. It's a very fast paced working environment but once you get the hang of the process it becomes easier.
good,Met many life time friends here. Great company benefits along with amazing training opportunities depending on the department you work in. Overall a very well run Company.
good,Good place work. Looking for a change for the better by learning to code. If I did not learn to code the probably stay here as a career. Costco is a great place to work
good,I learned a lot at Costco like how to have patience with members. I learned tire installation and sales. The management could have been better not really a team feeling between managers.
good,"I work for cds which is located at all costco stores which is food demonstrator so all of the answered were related to this company not costco, was not a costco employee was a CDS employee"
good,"Enjoyed my time working with Costco Wholesale in the morning merchandiser section. The staff was greta to work with, and made the working hours fly by. As a Whole Costco was a great organization to work for."
good,I loved working at Costco. The sense of comaradity and family is an integral part of the Costco world. The member is always your first priority and working as a team to make sure they are taken care of is a very fulfilling feeling. If I was a let to be hired back there is no question I would accept.
good,I was seasonal worker and enjoyed my time there. The pay for the work you do as a frontend assistant (load and push carts) is more than fair. And the accumulation of paid time off is very nice as well.
good,"good company to work for; Great benefits and pay, Family-oriented. However  some people on the Management team micro manage and don't really show that they value their employees"
good,"On a corporate level, Costco is fantastic. They have great policies which allow for high wages, benefits, job security and more. They also provide ample opportunity for advancement. The negatives however are that they require 100% availability. Being a retail store with bathing hours and days off I find this to be a very large downfall. This makes it very difficult to have a positive, manageable or predictable work life balance. Booking appointments, making plans in advance, having outside commitments such as colinteering or sports teams is very difficult to accomplish as your schedule is constantly changing and you aren’t aloud to have specific days and times which you are unavailable. A second negative would be the environment expectations and guidelines on a individual warehouse and department level. Though the policies and frameworks are strong. Indépendant stores and managers can create negative environments and expectations. However, with that in mind, overall Costco is an excellent institution who does very well for their employees."
good,Good job with good job security. Moving up in the company can take a while.  Pay and benefits are good. No experience or degree required. Work days are very repetitive and can get boring
good,"I was hired as a Seasonal Part Time Merchandise Stock Associate, it was a fun work enviroment i loved the warehouse work place, learned many skills like using pallete jacks, shipping and receiving, inventory and marketing/advertising product placement. Though I was part time I was able to grab as many hours as posssible. CostCo is an absolute amazing company to work for they take care of their employees and it shows."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job for me is helping people find what they need. I like to help people, so that's really rewarding for me. I learned that seniority based companies aren't always the most rewarding for high achievers, because performance isn't as important. Being there a long time is more important, at least that's what iv'e gotten from this job so far.."
good,"Always willing to sit down and work with you to make sure your schedule fits not only their needs but yours as well. Hours are pretty flexible as long as you talk to the schedule writer in advance, but they will work with you in emergencies and last minute schedule changes as well."
good,"Good opportunity for advancement within the company locally or internationally. "
good,"As an employee of Costco you will have to get used to many people coming in and out of the store. You have to be very alert at all times, a quick learner as there are a lot of moving parts, and make sure your attendance record is perfect and that you are on time. Costco gives you many incentives to work there for a long time. Their  401k plan is great, you receive a free membership as an employee, and your family benefits from you working there."
good,"Extremely busy department everyday.  Profit, profit, profit for shareholders.  Workers work hard.  Fast paced.  Rarely a down time.  Hardest part is management does not always listen.  They have their own agenda for advancement and bonus for warehouse managers.  Most enjoyable part was meeting and maintaining relationships with the members in the department on a regular basis."
good,It's a slow paced pharmacy since it's new. But the pharmacy system is very inefficient creating more problems than solving them. Flexible hours so that's a plus and good benefits
good,"Pay is good, as well as a fast, and fun productive workplace. Really fun Christmas parties every year. Great team and company to work for. They take care of their employees and Members."
good,"It is a fast paced working environment. Great to work here because every employee whether part time or full time receive benefits. Great people that work, it is so easy to get along with everyone. At times was very stressful because Costco is always soo busy but being busy made the time go by really fast. Also on Sundays, employees get paid time and a half."
good,I enjoyed my time at Costco short as it was. Managers and Co - workers were all very friendly. Its a very busy place to work though dont expect much time for slacking!
good,"It's a good job just very fast paced and sometimes stressful, but good overall and good pay / benefits. Decent management however at times communication is unclear."
good,"Costco was a good company to work in with advancement opportunities, my day to day task was merchandising. Managers were friendly and helpful. Can talk to anyone about any concerns"
good,"Worked part time during breaks from school. Everyone was friendly, understanding and approachable.This was a great stepping stone, and I learned a great deal about working with others, and interacting with customers."
good,"As a student Costco is a great company to work for as they give you lots of hours over the summer. You can work all summer and then you can go to school in the fall.  You don't have to worry about your job, as it is secured and you can come back for the holidays and summer to work again."
good,Quick paced great place to work. Great members. Many great employers.  Costco is a excellent place to keep a job for many years. Many positions available
good,"I was a seasonal employee in the meat department. No employee should have downtime in the eyes of management. There is always a shelf to be stocked, a counter to be cleaned, or a floor to be swept. Clocking-in and out of work on time is of utmost importance. If an employee is scheduled to clock-out at 10:00PM they are expected to clock out at exactly 10:00PM or before. At the end of shifts employees can be seen in a near sprint to clock out of work on time. The meat department was a fun place to work, we played music in the butcher's area, and I had a great manager. The pay was great for a job that required nothing more than a high-school diploma, if that. I only stayed seasonally, but I am aware there is ample opportunity for advancement. I would recommend Costco to anyone who is willing to work hard."
good,"Bonne place pour ceux qui n'ont pas ou presque pas d'étude."
good,"Everybody was very friendly to work with, especially my manager. Days consisted of clocking in, heading to my assigned work area, and performing duties pertaining to baking."
good,"A typical day at work is bagging product, and helping members. New managment was very crazy. The most enjoyable part of working ant costco is helping the members."
good,"I really enjoyed working with Costco, the fast paced environment and culture of the warehouse was challenging but engaging and I appreciated that about the position."
good,"Work hard but rewarding."
good,Costco is a good place to work. Costco encourages learning.  They help you take the time to deal with personal issues.  They have great vacation and paid time off.
good,"Come in, do what you're told by supervisor or manager. Once you gain time there you get some freedom in choosing the best task at hand."
good,"If you want to succeed here,  you have to be a yes person and get into the main click. I mean,  if you are a good worker you will keep your job, and you get raises based on time worked so after a while you'll be set,  but if you want to advance in the company you must do the above mentioned (at least at the location I worked at )"
good,"Not every Costco is the same. I would highly recommend the Woodbury Costco. Each Costco is unique, but they all do share the same benefits and pay rates. Advancement is also a good bonus, or if you're just looking for a part-time job for some extra cash, that works as well. They are flexible with hours as long as you are."
good,"Good place to work but hard to advance and become a full-time employee.  I worked there for four years and it became it pretty repetitive job, however the people that are employed there and outstanding that play into the culture of a great company."
good,Not many companies provide benefits for part-time workers so this was a nice perk. I worked here part-time as a second job. Only planned to stay for a year but that extended to 5 years. Some management is questionable. Pretty fair and understanding overall.
good,"The typical day of work consists of a high paced work environment."
good,"job was extremely hectic at times.  Manager always made sure we had plenty of supplies to accomplish the job.  liked the job, but it was a lot of standing in one spot all day."
good,Costco is a very fast paced retail working environment. Management is always understanding and makes your job a lot easier. Would recommend this job to anyone working on their customer service or management skills.
good,"Great benefits, great job security, lots of different paths for employees to pursue. At the warehouse level, people can still make decent to good money and the hours can be flexible. At corporate, there is a gym, which is nice."
good,It was a great and friendly environment. Everyone was very welcoming to the new employees. The managers were understanding if you werent able to come in.
good,"Costco is a great company to work for. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement if that's what you're looking for, and if you are motivated. The benefits are great, and you are eligible even as a part timer."
good,"Good company to work for, many opportunities for advancement, great benefits. However, the only con your life revolves around Costco . No set schedule"
good,"You are treated with respect both as an employee and as a member. Costco rewards hard work and a good attitude, they also give you the opportunity to cross train in different departments to add to your skills and determine what area you are best suited for."
good,"Costco overall is a great company to work for as far as benefits and the pay. My biggest issue with working for Costco would be that there is no set schedule, minimal hours, and managers only care about certain departments in the store and leave the rest of the departments high and dry by overworking their employees. Maybe it was just my location."
good,"Not a bad place to work but retail will be retail no matter who you work for. The company makes it easy to move around from within. The more you move around the more you can learn. Management varies depending on the warehouse. Like everything else, there are your cool managers then you have the ones nobody likes. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the ""members."" Besides that, working here isn't rocket science."
good,"In my 28+ years with Costco, I got to see and do a lot of unique things. I got to meet a tremendous amount of people, some of whom have become life long friends. I got to see a Top 50, Fortune 500 company work- I experienced both good and bad managers. I saw Costco do wonderful things for communities and I saw the company do things that the public would be shocked at. All in all, I would and have recommended Costco as a place of employment to anyone who does not have a formal education. Good pay, great benefits, and a place to meet new friends."
good,"Working for Costco for 5 years, made me grow up as a person, meeting good people every day and learning a lot about customer service, retail."
good,"The work style is very fast paced. You must be very productive, focused on your tasks, be capable of working multiple tasks, and have a positive attitude. I worked with fantastic coworkers that share the same positive and diligent  attitude that can make Costco a great first job. However, Managers and Supervisiors can feel very tense and almost rude. there is high stress levels with dealing with customers and occasionally my schedule would be inaccurate for time-off requests."
good,Costco was great but it became frustrating when you would like to advance in your department and they would choose some one with less experience just cause they have more years with company. It got depressing. Had to take leap and move on.
good,"its a great place to work, just make sure you get along with everyone and do your role and its the perfect place to work. If you are lucky enough to stay its pretty flexible and lateral movement is possible just takes a while"
good,Had an excellent time. Learning experience i enjoyed myself! I took in any skill building techniques. I would recommended this company as a good place to work.
good,It was a time that I was fixing up a department that has been left in disarray.  I interviewed new staff.  Hired and trained.  Brought up numbers and was learning as I went because it was a business that was still more new to Costco and taking off in the industry more every year.  The department was thriving.  I was moving to the area.  I was in heaven with my job during this time of working less in Tumwater and more in Silverdale.
good,excelente empresa con muchas oportunidades de crecimiento.
good,"One thing I learned while working for Costco was learning to deal with different types of people, since there's 200 employees per warehouse and thousands of customers that walk through every day. "
good,I enjoyed that atmosphere and the people. Overall all management were great to work with. I learned a lot about retail sales and the fast paced environment. The only issue I had was the advancement opportunities that were not presented to me.
good,"I was only a temp and I guess they expected high energy all the time and I just didn't have it. I wasn't a fan of the back-breaking work and as a seasonal wanting to get in, you had to want and be able to do everything to be considered a permanent member, or be lucky and well liked. I was pretty quite (but polite and helpful) so I guess I didn't' make a strong impression."
good,You are running from when you clock in to when you clock out. You need to rely on each other to get work done and consistently communicate with your team!
good,A great place to progress in different postions throughout your career. Fast pace environment and an easy environment to work. Supervisors and team leaders are always involved.
good,"The hardest part of the job was, honestly, the workplace environment."
good,"Great place to work ,just has a lot of unfair options when applying to different available position for job. I enjoy working there .It has opportunity for everyone at the company."
good,Costco was a place to work and had generally supportive management. I worked for several months as a consultant in the IT organization. The IT group was going through Agile training and seemed to put importance on ServiceNow modules.
good,This is an environment for someone who is looking for longterm stability. In the first year you need to be prepared to sacrifice time and money to get the seniority necessary to have a good schedule and pay rate. The work is simple but above average standards and effort is required in a fast paced high pressure environment.
good,"I have not worked for Costco in over 10 years so I am not really qualified to leave a review. From what I remember, it is a nice company and they are very good to their employees"
good,"I worked at Costco for four years. I think that it is a great company, but like I said, they don't want you there if you don't plan to stay there forever. I got a job in the field that I went to school for and that required two specific days off every week. My supervisor and immediate manager (both excellent) needed to go to the warehouse manager (not excellent) to get approval which shouldn't have been an issue. I was told that I needed to choose one or the other. I chose to leave Costco because I did not want to be there forever and would leave eventually. My situation was not handled well because I really didn't want to quit but I was not given another option."
good,"Since being hired there, they paid for my immunization certification and also my license renewal fee. I have done enough CE credits to receive a veterinary pharmacy certificate and Costco gives me a chance to use what I've learned. I receive Costco stock as part of my compensation package, which is very useful."
good,"A typical day at work would result in me punching my access code in the cash till and once Costco doors open and there are customers in my line I scan every item, and take the money. I learned a lot of things while working especially off duty. There are some hard parts that come to the job like rud customers. But the most enjoyable is seeing what the customers are buying because I can get a glimpse of what there life is about. Management is fine, there are some problems with scheduling, and promotions. But other than that it is fine. The workplace culture is very diverse. There are like a million employees, but are divided in specific work areas. But it is very diverse."
good,不斷改進工作效率，福利薪資佳，尊重員工。工作節奏超快，壓力大。發展性高、申遷機會多。需有良好的協調和溝通技巧。
good,Working at the Costco Call Center is a fun job as long as you are OK with sitting down for the entire day. I loved helping the members that called in everyday. The only issue is that the job wears on you after so long. I've been used to jobs that require you to move from place to place (Restaurants to be exact) and i thrive on being able to move and focus on multiple tasks. Being able to discuss the day and have constant support from your co-workers was a wonderful bonus of being in a desk in line with others just like you. the only downside is that the job has a rinse and repeat feel you can't shake.
good,"In short my head manager told me that I did great at personal tasks, customer service, and helping with steel work. Though the reason for my leave was due to me using my absences for a stomach flu and heart palpitations (due to panick attack) even though I was in the hospital for all check ups."
good,I worked as night merch. Typically spent the afternoon cleaning up/stocking and the evening driving forklifts. I had great co-workers who I still talk to 3 years later and a good management team.
good,"L'environnement de travail et motivant variées et avec des objectifs à atteindre. Toutefois, la pression peut être élevé selon les objectifs pour les étudiants."
good,Costco is a good place to work for the average joe. Decent wage and decent coworkers. Management wasn’t the greatest. A lot of the time employees will throw you under the bus to get ahead. Long term employees tend to be lazy. They say working hard will get you farther but seniority out plays hard work almost all the time.
good,"Costco has wonderful benefits, 401K, Health, dental and eye coverage. Paid vacations are also a bonus. The pay is amazing."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Costco however the contracted hours are not great and i needed more hours this is why I left. Great bonus’ free opticians bonus every year, time and a half on bank holidays and Sundayz"
good,"Costco was the first job I had upon moving home since 2 years. They had a great environment about them and it gave me the chance to work hard. I would recommend anybody to work there cause the hours weren’t bad, they paid good, and it was not hard work."
good,I have worked for different location of the same company for the past 30 years .I have already rated that company.same as Portland. please use the information provided
good,The hardest part of a job is to always have a great attitude becouse when u don't it really makes ur day bad especially for the customers because they want someone with a smile
good,"i would go back to them if i had a store closer to me.you stock at night after closing so nobody is around to be in the way,as in customers. they have wonderful benefits for the employees"
good,"Great Company, great people and great all around experience. I would love to continue working for Costco if a full time position became available. I believe Costco would be a great place to have a career!"
good,"Started off in the food court, transitioned to maintenance, and ended up in the sub freezer. Stocked merchandise, and unloaded truck items daily. I enjoyed my time there, and now that i'm gone I do not miss it."
good,loved having this job while while i was in college since they work very well with your school schedule. the starting pay is much higher than the competitors.
good,I gained more confidence and learned a lot. The hardest part is when you are asked to pack and you have to lift heavy items because they don't allow even big items to be left in the cart.
good,"Costco Wholesale is an active fast paced work environment. I started there at the age of 19 and loved it. As I grew older, my body began to disagree. I left after 13 years to change careers."
good,"I liked working at Costco, but it was very demanding and required a fast pace work ethic. However they have great benefits if you are looking to work part-time or full-time, but no benefits for students..."
good,"I personally wasn't a huge fan of retail, but being objective Costco has great benefits and pay. Easily able to take care of a family on the salary provided."
good,"Typical day consisted of following the production sheet. This is working in the bakery, sometimes you are to help others finish their job in order to meet the business needs. Certain production items should be done in a appropriate time in order to finish all tasks within the hours you are given to work. Fast Pace environment (bakery)."
good,"Costco is a great environment to work in, very spacious, hours are flexible and the pay rate is great, they offer a pension plan, benefits after 4 months, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people I get a long with very well, the training process was very easy so I had no issue learning brand new things at this work place."
good,This is a great place to work while you're in school. The staff is happy to accommodate your hours around classes. The pay and benefits are great. Easy to work in different areas of the store.
good,Work hard and Don't slack off. They appreciate people that take their position seriously. Be on time and refrain from calling out. They are flexible with changing shifts.
good,"The work environment is competitive and fast paced. Management depending on the person is great, some of the managers on the other hand are absent and don't care. The job quality changes per department."
good,A great company to work for. They pay well but you definately earn it. Very busy and fast paced enviornment. Not much chance for advancement. Have to work many years to get a promotion.
good,"A typical day of work at Costco Whoesale is one to look forward to. Employees are friendly and welcoming, as well as the members (customers). Theres always something to do and keep busy at Costco which is one of the many reasons i enjoyed working there. Hours are good, pay is good. Only problem is some supervisors tend to over work people when it comes to working outside in the lot."
good,"A typical day at work means that you cannot clock in more than 3 minutes past your start time or you will be considered late. Then, you have 5 minutes to get to your desk and start taking calls. You cannot have more than 1.5 minutes between phone calls, unless you want to get talked to by your supervisor. Every call is monitored and randomly listened to by your supervisor, who will score at least 2 of your calls per month. You have to make sure that you meet all the requirements on each call, and you will receive an automatic fail if you don't ask for the sale. Your screen will also be monitored, so you can only visit approved sites while at work. Yes, even if you only have 3 or 4 phone calls the whole day. Also, supervisors walk the area to make sure that agents aren't chatting with each other or talking. You can only talk with other agents if you are both off of the phones and in an approved break area. You're not supposed to call a supervisor unless it's absolutely necessary, otherwise phone lines get backed up. You do have your own desk, but you're not supposed to put up any decor that is not travel related. You cannot go to part time if its needed, and they will not adjust your schedule for any reason other than college. You will bid on your schedule based on seniority, and then you will have the same schedule every week for 4 months. You may be able to switch shifts with another employee, but they have to sell the same location as you do and all shift switches must be approved by a supervisor. "
good,Unfortunately it is impossible to get full time in most departments and it is possible to move up with the company but takes a while.. it takes 6 months for the health benefits to kick in
good,"Costco is not for the faint at heart, you must have a thick skin or the ability to grow one quick.    Also, it is heavy work for the most part unless you get Cashier, which isn't always a walk in the door job position.   If you’re a people person you will like and enjoy the different amount of personalities the members bring to the table. Costco has always been ahead of the game when it comes to pay and maybe that's why they are still on top of one of the most sought-after jobs that & they are more organized then most.  I learned to appreciate the amount of work that goes into making it look the way it does when I go in to shop ,  however I couldn't see myself there for 5years, and that's usually the first question I ask myself when I get a job"
good,"Great place, only temp, work fast paced, great co-workers, very busy,"
good,"Everything was great, but my manager had a lot of favoritism!!!!! witch i hated it. i think the hardest part of my job was dealing with my manager everything else i loved it."
good,"Very easy staff to get along with. lots of hours availible. but they cap you in the positions. part time no overtime, full time no overtime. so theyre isnt room for extra money to be made"
good,Compensation is good. Benefits are great even for part-time. There is already a 401k present as long as you get past the 90-day probation period and I couldn't complain about the location of the warehouse. They sell everything from baby diapers to hard liquors.
good,"Fun atmosphere at Costco. The company regularly hosts events and bbq's to show workers appreciation."
good,"Very fast paced environment.  Supervision was very good, and the full time employees were very helpful.  If you were faced with any problem, help and assistance were readily available."
good,I enjoyed working for Costco and supporting customers with their shopping. I also enjoyed working with the team members on a daily basis. Management is the reason I no longer work with this company.
good,It was a great experience to work for this company. I learned a lot from this company. Management was ok not to the best but ok. Great team member's..
good,Working in Wholesale for so many years I have learned a lot with member service. How to keep the customers happy or turn a bad situation into a good one.
good,"Everyday is usually a fairly busy day, if it would be slow where I was working I would get pulled to a busier area to help out. Fellow coworkers are friendly and nice but know when they need to focus and work. Hardest part of the day is when we are closing because we constantly have mangers looking at our work throughout the day, so by the end, we must be 100%."
good,"Job is straightforward, with managers assisting where required."
good,awesome place to work just has some people who don't work as hard and get a pat on the back while others who work hard have to work ten times harder. The benefits are great and we do get a lot of free things.
good,Thhe job was very fulfilling and helped me pay my bills. The job was not a bad drive from home and had a good work/life balance. The customers were always friendly and I enjoyed myelf there.
good,"Costco is a great company which has a lot of positive benefits, but within the first year there is not much flexibility and they have many strict rules. You have to work your way up, and they promote from within."
good,Hard work with good pay and benefits but it can become boring and monotonous. Little encouragement to move up the ranks as the pay is good just as an hourly employee.
good,Costco is a wonderful company that wants to take care of and help its employees however it can. They demand a lot of of their employees but they more than make up for it with their pay and benefits. If you're motivated and want to work and do well then you will do great. It is not a job for the lazy or people who like to complain. The managers and staff will go above and beyond to help and mentor you but they won't waste time on someone who doesn't take the job serious.
good,"It was very stressful, you never got your breaks at the same times, sometimes an hour in, sometimes 4 hours depending on how busy."
good,"Teamwork is really valued here, and immediate managers care about their employees. One is expected to be there and on time every day, and remote work is not a regular thing. People often stay here for a long time, so not a high turnover. The workforce is also diverse, in ages and background. Great company cafeteria, with good food and low prices!"
good,"I worked at Costco only as seasonal. Evenings were the most busy and of course also the holidays. The pay well and give you raises upon hours worked, so for every 1400 hours you get a 50cent raise. They don't offer full time and everything is based off seniority (they have priority) new employees work the latest shift and have to close and stay to clean and organize the store."
good,"Great job, and great benefits. But environment can be hostile at times. Especially when it gets very busy. The turn over is not high. Hours are ok. The pros outweigh the cons."
good,"At Costco you have to willing to move, its extremely fast paced. "
good,"Working at Costco was fun and enjoyable and a great start up for my career. "
good,While still being a Costco Employee I'm able to learn all the requirements to becoming an all around employee.I have worked in every department and also capable of conducting several different outcomes that are needed for members guidance and assistance in accomplishing their needs.I was also able to acquire a employee of the month plaque for the hard work and great customer service and positive personality towards my coworkers.
good,"I have always enjoyed the people I've worked with.  Honestly, it's the best part of working there.  I like teaching and training people.  If you are a hard worker, you will get noticed more than an average employee.  There is nothing wrong with coming to work everyday and doing a good job.  However, the workers that stand out are the ones that move up."
good,"Food Demonstrator clean  food cart , convincing customer to buy an try product at the time . By asking  customer try  a sample of food the  product  with a friendly matter also if discounts are available customer would receive"
good,"My shifts were typically 5am-10am, 4am-whenever on holidays."
good,"Starting pay is amazing, especially for working students.  Chances for advancement with the company are likely; most reasons why employees don't leave the company.  Part-time employees still get health/dental insurance, 401k, and vision through the warehouse.   They were also very supportive of my education and worked around my school schedule. The work environment can be fun but also a lot of drama between employees."
good,"As far as retail careers go Costco offers good pay, benefits, vacation, and advancement opportunities.  Management wasn't the greatest and of course expect to work weekend because it is retail after all.   Hours aren't great however Costco does close earlier than many other retail stores so there is a possibility that you wont work as late if you are coming from another retail store."
good,Es una empresa estable con una afluencia de ingresos impresionante. Es una muy buena opción a mi parecer.
good,"Daily tasks replening the stock shelves ready for consumers."
good,"Fast moving environment that required one to keep up a positive attitude and fast pace. An average day consisted of moving from place to place, from duty to duty based on the staff and needs of the warehouse. You were expected to keep up and work efficiently regardless of the task at hand."
good,"Working as a supervisor for costco is a high stress and fast paced position with constant battles on a daily basis to complete all tasks required in the allotted time. Costco is a great place to work with amazing benefits, endless opportunity to grow and some of the best pay in the industry."
good,"Costco is a great employer for many reasons - primarily for the great benefits, work/life balance, and overall culture. I've found management overall to be very approachable and easy to communicate with from the top down. If you want to make a great career in a warehouse setting, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better company in the entire United States."
good,"I work in the food court (making the hot dogs, pizza, etc).  The lines get very long during the weekends, and you're always hustling to work faster.  The pay is nice and benefits are amazing.  When it comes to managers, you just have to get lucky, some are great, some are not.  If you're okay with a fast-paced job, then this is a decent place.  But if you don't perform to their standards, then you won't have a job.  But it is an enjoyable place. Bonus: they pay you time and a half all day long on Sundays"
good,Was a great work experience working in all the departments. It was a good experience after High School. Loved working with all my co-workers and my managers.
good,"Es una gran empresa que se enfoca mucho en las necesidades del empleado, se requiere de un gran compromiso y lealtad a ti mismo y a la empresa ."
good,"It's a great company for people looking for job security.Depending on which group, you can explore cutting edge technology. It's also a great company to implement technology because of it's size"
good,"A work day is extremely fast paced, but the pay is rewarding (especially if it's a first or second part time job). People, management are friendly but there seem to be ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" and it becomes difficult to listen to all of the managers and supervisors at once. No discounts for employees, but free memberships are offered."
good,"travail et famille difficile"
good,Compensation higher than most retail businesses. Offers great range of health benefits at an affordable price. Corporate setting is more laid back than retail environment.
good,"A typical day at work you signed in then checked in with Management to see what jobs needed done, if there was no management available at the current time  you would find something to do around the area of your department until someone was around. The staff were friendly and everyone was very accomodating."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Costco, the management is really great and fun.  I had the early morning shift but my coworkers always had a positive mindset going into work.  We would help each other if one was lacking in speed to restock.  We had a variety of employees that come from different backgrounds and i really enjoy getting to know their culture.  The most satisfying part of my job is after I'm done stocking, I take a step back and look what I have accomplish."
good,"Costco's culture is centered around the employees. Managers take performance reviews seriously and they provide valuable feedback. Salaries work headquarter jobs are low for entry level, but grow quickly."
good,"Como todo trabajo tiene sus problemas y fortalezas. Lo malo es que le dan mucha preferencia a las amistades de gerentes, etc.  y lo bueno es que como auxiliar ganas  bien."
good,"Costco is fast paste, good management, excellent benefits and pay. You are expected to be able to help out in all areas of the business as needed to provide excellent quick customer service."
good,"Costco will take care of you through pay and benefits, but you must be ready to work with minimal staff. There has been multiple situations where my direct department is ignored, so other areas of the store may succeed. If you are able to shrug things off and understand that there are no easy days even on slow days, you should be fine."
good,"During my three years at Costco as a part-time employee, I've learned how to multiple tasks and different positions within this company such as starting out as a front end assistant, moving up as a cashier, membership clerk, refunds clerk, and a vault clerk. I've learned how to deal with members in a high volume environment that consists a lot of customer service and professionalism. It is an enjoyable environment to work at, as I got to know my coworkers and my managers."
good,"Overall, it's a great company to work for. Costco has afforded me many different opportunities to learn all aspects of the business. The salary and benefits package is amazing. It will be hard to leave after nearly 12 years with the company. However, stepping down to part-time employment (previously working at the Corporate office) did not lend itself well to having the balanced family lifestyle I am hoping to achieve. If you decide to work at any of the warehouses, be prepared to work nights and weekends...NO EXCEPTIONS! The Corporate side of the business is great but there isn't the possibility of part-time employment and advancement is nearly impossible. Lots of grid lock there."
good,Unlimited opportunities for growth and coaching. They take care of their employee’s. Benefits for employee and entire family is above all others. Hardest part of the job would be keeping people on task and responsible.
good,"A l'exception que tu es une machine a produire, c'est un emploi raisonnable."
good,I loved working at costco. My coworkers were all friendly and nice. But there was one manager that always walked around and was really picky and mean.
good,My experience at Costco was fairly good. The work environment was extremely chill and the management was fairly reasonable to say the least. My position was temp
good,"Was only a seasonal worker, fast work place. How Costco runs and operates on a daily basic. work place culture was diverse. Its was an enjoyable company to work for."
good,"The primary function of my position at Costco is providing excellent MEMBER SERVICE.  It's a simple, fun, and energetic part time job.  I've learned to deal with a wider range of personalities and people of different cultures, attitudes, and beliefs.  The hardest part of my job not having something in stock for a member, but the most enjoyable part of my job is providing excellent member service and meeting new people every day."
good,"Worked in different departments during the years i was employed at Costco. Started as a cart attendant then transitioned in to the front end, I became a cashier, and cashier assistant. Also worked in the member service department greeting members and reviewing receipts. towards the end of the years i worked there, I joined the merchandising crew during graveyard shifts. I restocked merchandise items and rearranged isles according to seasonal change."
good,"At Costco its very fast paced, especially on the weekends. We a have multitude of different duties and roles that have to acted on in a quick manner. You could be pushing and organizing carts and then if a customer needs help loading large products in their vehicle we have to help with that. There are many roles you play within the company. The most enjoyable part of this job is the staff, I have great colleagues who are very helpful and motivating. If you want to work at Costco be ready to put some pep in your step."
good,"Friendly co-workers,"
good,"Good company to work for. Very fast paced. Learned how to work in different departments, photo, food court, stocking, etc. "
good,Costco is one of my favorite places to shop. As an employee you get to see everything new as it comes to the floor. As a Holiday Store Associate you mainly do the same thing each day you work. Duties vary from from working the food counter to folding clothing.
good,"Great company to work for - lots of regulations are in place to protect you from bad managers. They pay you great. It's hard to get full time, sometimes you get lucky to get it quickly. Over all, would recommend."
good,"Horario de 13:00 a 23:00, un buen ambiente laboral, 5 días de trabajo a la semana, interacción diaria con los clientes."
good,"Costco is a pretty good place to work in my experience. The pay is good for the type of work, but they make you earn it most days. Fast paced and usually very busy but worth it. I would continue working there if it wasn't work going to school."
good,"Morning merchandising is a very quick paced environment. There is never any down time, and makes the day go fast. The best part of the job is not having to deal with customers and getting off fairly early in the day. the worst part is your workload is so large, you are always set up for failure. The management at this location are very poor. They are from qualified for their jobs. The pay and benefits are phenomenal however."
good,"Costco is a really great company to work for. It's fast pace, sometimes it's stressful and there are plenty of opportunities to advance with higher pay. The bad part really depends on the warehouse you work at management can be bad. Other than that the company  is great and have good benefits."
good,Great place to work. Learned much about merchandising. Gave me many opportunities to advance and allowed me to take an internship at corporate. Company takes care of families.
good,Costco is a good place to work when you are trying for find some skills to put on to your resume. I enjoyed working at Costco because the people there are really nice and the management system is not as bad other places.
good,"The meat department manager was too aggressive and harsh most of the time. The higher managers were on his a.. for a reason, and in turn, he took it out on the employees. He is easily stressed as he felt obligated to literally babysit everyone, even though there is no clear necessity to do so. Most of the employees working there are in their 30's. Do they really need a babysitter? Also, the diversity of younger people is too low. Not only did I work in the meat department, I worked at the 'fast-paced' front-end. I had to deal with older employees and their sh..ty attitudes working there. These older employees and their attitudes were unpleasant and inconvenient."
good,The days go by fast as there is always something to do.  I have always left work sweating and feeling like I attributed to the environment the best I had the ability to.
good,"Great benefits, salary could be better but overall great place to work. Costco is one of the best companies to work for according to Forbes, and I'll back that up."
good,Working there was good. Pay was good. Compensation and benefits was good. Job Security was good. Management was decent. Job Culture was good. Scheduling was ok.
good,"Good place to work, good benefits. The management is very flexible with you if you're flexible with them, although it's very unorganized and messy at times."
good,Good workplace good benefits and flexible scheduling management could be better overall a really good company to work for good home life and work life balance
good,It's retail so there are a lot of cons. Most of the people you work with are nice and benefits are great. Management isn't well organized and takes too long to address problems.
good,"Working in retail, one should be prepared to work nights and weekend. Costco takes that fact to a new level. Its a good thing overall, but they are always PACKED. Work life is very all consuming. The most enjoyable part of working at Costco is working for a company that offers such amazing value."
good,"El día a día era tranquilo, siempre había en que trabajar, pero el trabajo no era pesado, aprendí a manejar toda clase de medicamentos. Se contaba con política de puertas abiertas que consistía que si tu superior no podía resolverte el problema podías ir con alguien mas arriba que el para comentárselo, muy  bueno el ambiente laboral."
good,"Overall, Costco is a very good company to work for (the pay is great, benefits are even better) but most managers play favourites as many people are related at this warehouse. Also, not the best hours starting out as you'd have to stay until 11-11:30pm! Takes long to move up in the company as they go by seniority so anyone in the warehouse can apply to any job, even if they're not qualified."
good,the job is high volume and can be stressfull and fast paced but its a good place to learn new skills and the company does its best to treat all of its employees well
good,"Worked on both the early morning shift, and in the tire centre.  never had a problem with any of my co workers or managers. they also have a good benefit plan."
good,"Week days tend to be slow but weekends are hectic."
good,"enjoy the people i work with, not a boring place and they have good benefits. management is great and everything is really fair. room to grow in the company"
good,Face pace in environment is a typical day at Costco . My most enjoyable time at work is pleasing and satisfying the customer and make sure their needs are meet .
good,"I really did enjoy my time at Costco, but even as a part-time associate, I found myself working over 30+ hours a week. The pay and benefits are excellent, but if you are, like me, a college student looking for a career path that's outside of the company, make sure you go through the college retention program that works around your school schedule. It is very busy work, and trying to manage a standard part-time position there with school can be a challenge. However, as far as entry level jobs go, Costco is one of the best, as long as you're motivated."
good,Una empresa con gran cultura laboral definitivamente
good,Costco is an awesome place to work it has great benefits and compensation . if your not in shao it will deffinetly whip into shape. This job can easily be made into a career.
good,"Costco as a whole has been an outstanding company to be able to apply my services and work for. Like any job there are ups and downs however with Costco the ups out number the downs. Opportunities to move up the ladder are vast, cross-training is handled well, and the work itself difficult yet after experience said work becomes easier everyday."
good,Working at Costco as a Deli Servicer always gives you something different to try every day. There were a variety of products to make that would change seasonally.
good,"as much as it feels like family to work at costco, you give up a lot of ""family time"" within your personal life. they schedule you all day long friday saturday and sundays every weekend unless you ask 6 weeks in advance for a day off and they will still usually ""forget"" that you requested the day off and try to call you in on your requested day off"
good,"""Fast pace!!!!"" that is what a typical day will start and end. I learned so much in just the period i worked there, i learnt how to make pizzas, use a register, multitask eg; serve customers, get their orders ready and also refill machines if need to be done or get cooked food out of the oven. I also learnt to do prep which is ingredients for pizzas etc or mixtures or as well call them ""buckets"" of ice cream, ice-coffee and pizza sauce. Managements were awesome very organised and easy to talk to. Hardest part of the job would be having to deal with rude and arrogant customers, but that was the challenge we had to face everyday and it may not sound easy but was a great challenge not only for myself but for my colleagues too and also working right next to a huge oven whilst its 32 degrees outside. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with an amazing team, if it weren't for a hard working team i would of hated going to work."
good,"worked as a season person."
good,I have to say that Costco does give their employees plenty of reason to not only stay loyal to their company but also give an earnest effort in their every day work routine.
good,"This is a very good place, some of the work is hard, but if you are a team player this is the place for you. Everyone seemed very friendly, and very willing to help or show you the best way to do that particular task. Cart crew was the hardest, think of it as a ""Mexican Gym"", ""you get paid for working out"" nice right? anyway many good people there, so go there to have a good time."
good,"Costco is a great place to work. They offer great competitive wages as well as lots of job opportunities and promotions with in the company. It is a fast paced environment with  friendly staff and good management,"
good,"I just started in the front end and it's a lot of busy work. You're always moving around and this makes the time go by. I enjoy the people that I work with. The environment is very fast paced, because its very customer focused."
good,Costco was a great place to work where I learned a lot about management and job culture since the corporate office overseeing every Costco in the world was right across the street. The CEO also came in almost every week so it was a pleasant visit for all the employees.
good,Working in the pharmacy there were some people who truly did not want to be there and made it a toxic work environment. But when those select few were not there work was great and the days went by very fast and fellow employees are very social.
good,"At Costco it is a very busy environment. It is a fun place to work and you become part of a family. It has taught me about business and customer service. It helped me learn that not everything is black and white. Being a supervisor taught me to help others. It is crucial to train others and train them well. Keeping a positive attitude is also very important. Just as negative attitudes, positive attitudes are contagious and it is easier to get through a hard day surrounded by happy upbeat people."
good,"All the staff that worked at Costco Wholesale were generally very warm and welcoming to all new members of staff. I never felt antagonized by my fellow coworkers/supervisors and generally had a lovely time working there. "
good,i enjoyed the work it was my first job and i was eggier to do well. the shifts on the other hand were not the best. i was working the 4 am shift witch made it difficult to have a life out side of work.
good,"steady and secure job. nothing out of the ordinary , but great benefits. people are usually great as well. management is proactive on individual success along with the warehouse's success"
good,Overall this was a good place to work. It was tough to adapt to a stressful workplace but its a Great job while your in school
good,"Working at costco has been something i take great pride in. The work is fast pace and its very rewarding. Costco values its employees and shows it often by being generous to us. My co workers are probably one of the best I have had. Most have the positive "" you can do attitude"" and inspire you to be your best. The hardest part of the job is dealing with non english speaking consumers and struggling to satisfy their needs without being properly able to communicate. I love working for costco, but  moving up to being a full time employee takes sometime and well, i need a full time position."
good,"Great atmosphere for the most part, however it can be stressful with the high influx of customers and transactions. Sundays are extremely busy and so are the holidays. Not necessarily worth entry level work."
good,Like working here and learning something different everyday.  Enjoy baking and learning to decorate cakes.  Great team.
good,Management always favors friends or relatives. Nepotism and favoritism are solidly embedded in the system. It causes a deep wound to the morale of the hard working (non-related) hourly employees. Management has little or no training - it shows. They are keen to put on a good show for the public but when the doors close - look out. They do not practice safe working procedures. Being safety conscious is considered 'wimpy'.
good,very high volume and work expected from each employee. Great Merchandising job with good benefits and nice perks as well. High volume atmosphere.
good,"So far in my year of experience I'm noticing many opportunities for advancement. However, unless you have seniority it is difficult to move around the company."
good,"A typical day at work included preparation in order to never run out of food for the customers, constant maintaining cleanliness standards, always have a great attitude, and be willing to do whatever asked needed by management."
good,"Costco, is a good company to work for, it is possible to be promoted if your willing to relocate to another City or State. I've learned that politics determine your outcome in a position. The hardest part is not having a flexible work schedule, it would be nice to have weekends off at least every other week without requesting it two weeks in advance. The most enjoyable is the people you form friendships with."
good,"Amazing environment. I enjoy  working there. You can schedule any day(s) off as long as you are available. Sometime you have to rush to do your duties, but this is part of this job."
good,"Stocking early in the morning & installing tires when the store is open. I have learned to manage my time & help my co-workers when they fall behind. management is easy to communicate with & there is always someone available to handle any issues. The job is very versatile, & I have been in many departments. I have met many people & have enjoyed working along side many of them."
good,Great place to work! The work can be a little exhausting but the rewards are generous. They took great care of me. Great benefits and great pay as well.
good,"Costco is a great place to work. I learned a lot of skills, the biggest of them being attention to detail. However, due to seasonal contracts it was hard to advance within the company. One of the hardest parts of the job is to work around customers as the store is big and very well known."
good,Costco Wholesale is an excellent company and I would recommend it to anyone seeking stable long term employment. There is some occasional infighting between employees and management could be better.
good,"-Fast pace environment"
good,"Costco wholesale is a good work place. A typical day at work can vary depending on how busy it is with customers but always involves talking and helping customers, making sure my department is running properly, setting up in the mornings when i work or cleaning and closing the department at night on days i work at night. I have learned a great deal about pushing myself to my limits from working here. Each day I have to ensure that i can get everything done I need to in a timely manner while executing all necessary things properly. Management at Costco is improving,  we recently received a new general ware house manager and a new assistant general manager. This has greatly improved management as a whole at work.   It has also helped change the environment to a more positive one. My co-workers are great. We all get along for the most part and always try our best to work as a team on a daily basis.The hardest part of the job was learning how to get a great routine down on how to do things in order to get them done properly and as fast as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers or as we call them members. Yes we come across on occasion difficult people but i always remain positive and if i can not help them then i go to some one that can help and also handle the situation if needed."
good,"Competitive work place environment. Once pass probation, you can move up in terms of job advancement."
good,"Costco is a great company to work for, they offer prime pay, and benefits, although it can be hard to get the time off that you want, and in some warehouses it is very difficult to move up."
good,A typical work day was always busy because of the kids and their many activities that had to undergo. The co-workers were very friendly. Management was friendly and always helpful.
good,"this was my first actual job and i have to say, i loved and enjoyed most of my time there. "
good,"Typical day included daily inventory management, register sales and transactions, product stocking and merchandising. Management was a constant presence that was available to assist when needed. The coworkers were knowledgeable and helpful and the best part of the job was serving the customers. The hardest part of the job was lifting and moving cases of wines/spirits."
good,"Morning meeting, stretch and then separate to our departments, begin work before the store opens.  Once the store opens assist customers to whatever they need help with. definitely a lot of team work and communication."
good,"Management listens"
good,"I would engage in many different types of conversations while unpacking and repacking people's cart with their items. The management made sure you had your breaks at the right times and made sure you were always up to date with the security and health information. The hardest part of the job would have to be, standing on your feet for 8+ hours at a time and dealing with 'difficult' customers. I really enjoy the people I work with and the different stories they share."
good,"Started off as a cashier assistant and my job was to work with the cashier to make the member's transaction as smooth as possible. I also sometimes had to assist with bringing the buggies back from the corrals. My overall time spent at Costco was great but I require  daily challenges and change in a job therefore, I had to leave"
good,new advancement opportunities on a continual basics. great management team. willingness to work together and fun friendly work place.
good,"A typical day at work is busy and strenuous when your position is to get the store ""Showtime Ready"". Many of Costco's locations that have been open for several years, only have part time positions available. If your seeking full time employment with this company, you will need to consider relocating to one of the new locations prior to them opening."
good,"The benefits are great four full and part time employees.  There other perks that are beneficial.  "
good,Costco works you very phsyically hard and expects a lot of time. It is difficult to balance a light schedule if you are also attending school but I loved the people I worked with.
good,"Great Pay, good holiday rate.  Hard work especially in my branch because they say its the busiest costco in North America. Some Supervisor are nice, mine are not so. He's pretty decent but get upset too often for no good reason. Work at front end assistant is way easier!"
good,The job is fast paced. Its a routinely job and once you get the flow the job gets easy. Didn't like having to do inventory count because if some numbers aren't correct it is possible to be held back for recount.
good,"good place to work left to try and start my own company with a friend , and it is not all what it seems to be, costco is a great place to work"
good,"Costco 's culture is very obvious to those who work there and also the consumers who visit the store. It enables a positive atmosphere and the connections shared with various employees encourages teamwork. They were very demanding in what they needed to be done but always made you feel like you are a part of the Costco family, and you always felts as if your work was essential to the success of the company."
good,"Typical day at Costco (night shift) for me was rising at 3am biking to work for 4. Getting to work Signing in, Unloading pallets and other duties as instructed for about 6-8 hours a day. What I learned from this Job good team leadership and hard work goes a long way. The management was very good & I enjoyed most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the Job was waking up everyone morning. The most enjoyable part was meeting all the people & seeing familiar faces within and out the store."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo,  buenas prestaciones."
good,Very lively work environment with many opportunities for advancement but low education requirements which leads to unprofessional management.
good,"Friendly management and co-workers help create a good working environment, competitive compensation and benefits. Difficult ""members"", monotonous work tasks."
good,Very good part time job flex hours. Different demo every day from cooking to dry goods demo. Nice pay for a part time job. You do not have a set schedule
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers. I  had a place to grow and thought the products Costco sold where beneficial and priced well.
good,"A typical day at work varied every day depending on departments. I learned lots of teamwork skills and various problem solving skills. The management at the beginning was very good. Things got done, everyone was happy; then management changed and people managed departments they've never worked before. Co-workers were always friendly, not always good but in a big place not everyone will be. The hardest part of the job was having to stay back and complete someone else's work when they left it unfinished. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you were always busy and had something to do."
good,"working there for the few months i did, i notice that management has mainly everything in control with making sure every employee is moving and doing something constructive including keeping the store clean. they are very helpful and customers consistently leave with a smile on their faces."
good,"It is a very busy place to work as you are always on the move, I learned that you need patience and need to remain calm when dealing customers. I would recommend  anyone to work there"
good,"Fast paced environment, great opportunities for career advancements, friendly, kept me in shape, potential benefits for you and your family"
good,I worked at Costco Wholesale for 3 years. One of the great perks they have is medical and dental benefits for part-time employees. I recommend this job especially for high school/college age people looking to get a foot in the door at an established company.
good,It's a great place to work and has great pay and benefits as everyone knows however it is hard to move up in the company and it take a lot of time.
good,"Typical day for myself at Costco is opening up the doors allowing the members to come in. After opening the doors I am the first cart person to begin and the first to get off work. Typical day on carts begins at 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. "
good,"Pay is great for the industry. Plenty of work to keep you busy. Promote from within. A lot of different positions to do. The work is generally fast paced, and there is plenty of room to grown into a supervisor or manager position."
good,"I am in the deli at Costco and I am not really a fan of that. My manager is okay, but does not like conflict which can be a problem when some of my coworkers have lazy and poor work ethics. I wish I worked somewhere else in the store, and also between a lot of money gets taken out of my checks!"
good,"Costco Wholesale truly is a great company to work for. They care greatly about their employees and work hard to make sure that their employees are happy and will want to perform well at their jobs. However, when it comes down to it, hard work is not rewarded based on effort put it, it all comes down to how many hours you work."
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping hundreds of customers in your field or department. I learned that you need to move fast and have the ability to multi-task to be productive in this job. Co-workers are somewhat helpful, but most people fend for self. Hardest part of the job is trying to get someone to assist you with something, especially because everyone is so busy and has their own obligations. The most enjoyable part of the job was the Sunday Pay."
good,"it is a fast paced work environment that demand drive and multitasking at all times. Benefits and pay is not bad, but management is not the greatest. Work mates can be difficult and not easy to work with."
good,"Si vous êtes déterminé et enjoué c'est une belle opportunité. Malheureusement, les postes à temps plein sont rares."
good,"Belle culture d'entreprise, bon salaire, bons avantages sociaux, possibilités d'avancement, management défaillant et gestionnaires plus ou moins emphatique...."
good,"Working at Costco, I learned several things in my position as well as in the warehouse in general.  Looking from the beginning to end, I learned that every function is very, very important in Costco.  My co-workers from day to day were amazing, willing to help in any shape or form and .  Since my schedule fluctuates from day to day, the hardest thing to do actually deals with my body adjusting to the different times and not the actual job.  My job responsibility in Costco is actually high pressured; however I have adjusted quite well over the years."
good,"On a typical day I would just do all the returns and help customers sign up for memberships."
good,"I don't really have a bad thing to say about this job. The environment was positive, my coworkers were friendly, and the work was challenging yet simple. I miss it very much."
good,"I work the night shift and  come in at different times past noon. Typically I will go and help pack carts for a few hours, especially during busy times of the day. Occasionally I will be asked to help load a larger order into a customers vehicle during this time. When it starts to approach closing time and the amount of customers slows down I am typically asked to help return items that customers didn't want, or bring them to MR in the event they were broken/unsellable. During this time if customers approach me looking for items I am expected to help them find it. When the store finally closed I will typically either help stock the food which was rather physically demanding at times or to remove and compact the many empty boxes and plastic wraps that tends to accumulate while stocking. Weekends when they close early usually go better than others and we typically finish early. Weekdays are not always smooth sailing and many of us would be asked to stay late and help if the job was unfinished. If all the work is finished I am often asked to stay behind and help sweep the floors and tidy up the shelves so that the store will be presentable in the morning."
good,I great place to support your family that allows you to plan for the long term. You will get great benefits and opportunity for growth.
good,The management at this particular warehouse is very unorganized. Overall it is a decent place to work. The compensation/benefits are excellent and that's what keeps the employees here. If the pay was similar to other retailers such as Target there would be a high turnover rate.
good,"Costco treated me very well in terms of management and work environment. My fellow coworkers were very encouraging and were always willing to help or advise me with any concerns I had. When I asked for days off, the management did their best to allow me those days off. I've learned to be able to depend on my coworkers when I was ever behind on stocking or finishing up something I was asked to do. I've learned to be more confident when I was repeatedly asked where things were and when I directed members to foods or items they were searching for. The hardest part of the job was staying later if we were all behind on our responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting many coworkers and getting to know them."
good,"Costco es una excelente empresa para laborar, pues duré en ella casi 13 años, desgraciadamente no hubo crecimiento laboral, llegué al puesto que tenia que llegar y ahora buscó abrir mis horizontes laborales, ya que considero que hay mejores oportunidades para mi. "
good,Working at Costco has provided me with a lot of experience I can apply in any job. Customer service is very important and is what has given Costco much success. Providing customers with an all around good experience is key to being successful. Management at Costco strives to ensure everyone is working as a team to accomplish the mission which is to provide all around good member service. The most difficult part of my job has been working in merchandising due to the time constraints. The most enjoyable part of my job has been meeting so many different people and making people smile. There is a family atmosphere amongst coworkers. Everyone takes care of each other when needed.
good,"My experience at Costco was a very positive one, the staff was very good to work with, fun and supportive. i was disappointed when my temporary position was completed."
good,"I worked in a few different departments at Costco. Stocking, register, food court but my main job was tire installs. It's a great place to work but very difficult to get hours. I learned how to be more versatile and focused at this job"
good,"I worked a Christmas help, and then at another facility --nights. i learned about a lot of different products and how to work in a fast paced environment. I had a great time with my coworkers--they were very positive. Hardest part was doing manual labor during the graveyard shift. Most enjoyable part was interacting with the clients and my coworkers"
good,"fast work environment, high pressure and early mornings."
good,"I've worked in several positions during my time here. I've spent most of my time as a stocker, which means I work mostly when the warehouse is closed. As a stocker I start work at 4 a.m. and usually work until 10:30-12:30 depending on the day. The first thing I do is fix up my specific area (ex: get all empty boxes in aisles). After that I will stock any items that are running low on the pallets. You will get help from the fork lift drivers. This is a fast paced job since we need everything to be ready by opening time (10:00 a.m.).  The management was fine in my case. As long as you work hard then the managers will like you. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting and limited time to get everything done. I'm also not a morning person so getting up at 3 a.m. was horrible. The good news is I get to leave work by 10:30 a.m. on most days. The best part of the job was not dealing with customers and just doing your work at your pace."
good,"Management has a huge impact on the quality of work life. Location manages can make or break the enjoyment of the location. Non-union stores are better to work at do to better quality of work force. Learned tons in customer service, management, sales. Pay is really good after some time has been put in for the type of job."
good,"A typical day at work would start with a group meeting where we would receive previous days productive summary and how we can improve if necessary and the days' order count. After receiving order count we are then sent to our designated departments, carrying out the orders for our area until finished where we then help base pick (dry good/ general merchandise), which is usually where the bulk of the orders are finished. "
good,"Good Place to Work , Lot of opportunities to learn,Humanity,Humility and integrity"
good,"good, but you learn more than trained... thinking on your feet... management cant manage the stress level of the job and points fingers on others"
good,"In a given day I may complete multiple tasks including working in the vault, coordinating health and wellness events, and completing safety training.  I enjoy the diversity!"
good,Instilled a fast pace in the work environment from day one i was hired while still in high school.  The standard of work i was held to was higher than any other place i had been employed or seen/heard anywhere else.
good,"Costco is a fantastic place to work, the pay is great and most of the employees are also fun and nice to work with. another nice benefit is their is no shortage of hours. if you get hired there they will have you working a ton of hours, at minimum of 24 hours a week, mostly more."
good,Came in had a huddle with the managers and other coworkers. Discuss daily objectives. Assist customers on registers. Work on sales floor. I learned how to drive  a forklift. Management was ok communication coulda been better. Coworkers was great everybody got along. Hardest part probably was working outside. Most enjoyable part was assisting the customers
good,"I look back at it now and wish I never left. I learned that even though every day may be the same, the one thing that could be different was me. The one thing I miss most about it was the friends I developed."
good,"Very good employee benefits, such as vacation and salary. Colleagues overall exert very supportive and positive work relations, like a family. Depending on the warehouse, management can be inefficient. It takes a lot of time and ridiculously amount of work to work the way up in the company, as there are limited opening of positions due to limited amount of new stores opening, and seniority takes precedence."
good,Everyone in teh Warehouse was my friend and you really work there as part of a family.
good,"Great place to work if you are going to school. I would start my day pushing cart, then go inside and help the cashiers with ringing up members items. At the end of the day I would go outside and collect the carts so the warehouse could close for the day."
good,I liked working here. They teach you how to do multiple jobs. Hours are tough but all Holidays are given off and paid.
good,"Very fun, only problem I had was that it was a contract job. I was told that the manager loved me and will call me back but he never did. Sucked but I didnt give up and found a new job."
good,Costco Wholesale offer excellent pay to all of their employees!
good,"Great company!!!! If your not afraid to work hard and have great customer service skills...it is fast, efficient and they a great benefit package."
good,"Establish department priorities to align with corporate goals and initiatives.  Provide leadership and support to Claims management staff.  Establish protocol for identifying and analyzing claim fraud, waste, and abuse patterns.  Implement system logic to recognize aberrant billing patterns by providers.  Analyze trends and patterns in claims payment, develop strategies for process improvement of claims payment.  Institute procedures to ensure claims over payments are identified, recovered and appropriately applied.  Develop reporting protocol to illuminate over payments, establish strategy for mitigating future over payments.  Oversee all business process applications and/or interfaces used to support cost containment initiatives.  Managed 4010 to 5010 conversion project for 837 institutional and professional forms."
good,Costco is a great company to work for. You have to be a strong minded and persistent person work for this company. They do a very good job weeding out the unproductive employees and replacing them with efficient employees that embody the hard working characteristics that looks for.
good,"I wanted retire from costco, I was good at my job and enjoyed it Great benefits, cheap insurance, and they matched my 401 K contributions.  unfortunally, some manager didnt treat me well at certain times and it was boarderline harassment, their company polices are written pourly also."
good,"Fun, The staff was  outstanding even at all levels. I loved helping the customers and it showed. Management noticed and recognized with barbecue  and holiday parties."
good,"Worked lot of hours "
good,costco was morning stocker job. basically just restocking restocking the store before opening hours
good,Wholesale work can be long and tough but the company treats you well and rewards those who put in the time and effort.
good,"Fun place to work if looking for part time employment, friendly staff, overall great place to work"
good,The job was not complicated.The only drawback with Costco is the reduction of hours for t months of January thru March because business is slow.I enjoyed answering customers questions.I also found it very difficult with dealing with Bridgestone because they were having product delivery issues.We only had 2 manufacturers we dealt with.I wished the buyers when they had the opportunity to switch to Goodyear as a vender.I believe they could have been a good compliment to the MIchelin brand.The hardest part of the job was trying to deal with the Bridgestone short supply of tires.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customer happy on their purchase of tires.Management in general was fair and treated everybody with respect.
good,"I enjoyed working with the public, helping people.  There were a lot of varied duties that made work fun."
good,"Not a lot of initial training from my experience, make sure you ask a lot of questions. Detail, Detail, Detail. Work hard, there is no seniority, it is what you make of it."
good,Costco is run very well with a great set of managers and supervisors.
good,Working grave yard shift. Full time position. Work hours are typically 6pm - 4am. Work enviroment is active with a fast pace.
good,"A typical day at Costco would be a very busy and fast paced environment. "
good,"On the sales floor, we virtually manage ourselves, including how we manage our time and the product placement for the electronics area. We deal with multiple managers throughout the day, and for the most part all of my co-workers are a pleasure to work with. Standing on the concrete floor can be difficult to handle for fourty hours a week, but overall I enjoy the department."
good,"This is a great company to work for.  I am a mother of 4 and was not able to work nights and weekends is why I left this company.  The pay and benefits were wonderful.  The job was very fast paced and organized.  Everything needed to be done in a timely manner and customer service must be at its best at all times. Costco only has employees that are hard workers, smile, efficient, and overall great employees.  I worked there for 10 years and enjoyed everyday going to work.  The hours didn't meet my family needs though."
good,A day as a Costco Bakery Wrapper. I come in and start baking everything that needs to be wrapped and then sit and wrap it ALL. My co-workers make work very enjoyable. My management could be better and understanding but i have learned that everyone doesn't work for the team and only for them selfs.
good,"fastpaced environment with little time for error, great coworkers, picked up many useful skills along the way"
good,execellent benefits and work schedule. lots of holiday pay is better than average. great advancement.
good,"It is enjoyable serving members but sometimes it needs patient. We can encounter different kinds of people's behaviour such as strict, fussy and impatient. It needs cooperation with the co-workers and teamworks to serves the members with there expectations. the hardest part of the job is lifting a heavy staffs. Always remember the right position in doing liftings.   "
good,"Costco is a busy, fast paced work environment. The work day usually goes by fast as there is much to do. The large group of diverse employees makes it easy to form friendships in the workplace. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unpleasant members and employees. For the most part, the managers are attentive and caring to employee needs in the workplace as well as on a personal level."
good,"After clocking in at 5 A.M., I first take a walk through my department to determine my objective for the morning and then create a drop list for the forklift drivers. Once my merchandise has been dropped I begin stocking. When I am finished stocking I take my trash to back and sweep my department."
good,Costco is a very good place for employment. I have had many oppurtunities working for Costco. The people there are great.
good,Costco management team worked well with giving my schedule the flexibility to have a work/life balance. Also the salary and benefits were great. And management was on top of any issues with scheduling.
good,I am a baker. We produce multiple items daily as a team. I've learned how to organize the day in the most productive way possible. Management is willing to help the employees as well as the members as needed. My co-workers are hard workers and know how to get things done effectively while not letting a stressful day get to them. The hardest part of the job is keeping the shelves filled with enough product to sustain the whole day without being empty. The best part of the job is opening first thing in the morning and making the days production plan.
good,"A typical day would be me helping members to pack their products into their carts. At times I worked on cash. I have also been at the front door greeting members and at the ""out"" door to check receipts. I also have been in the clothing department folding and tiding up the merchandise. I also put products back on the shelves where they belong. I learned how to use a cash register and to work quickly. The hardest part was not always knowing where things went cause they are always moving things around. The most enjoyable part was the people I got to know and work with."
good,"Hay un agrdable ambiente laboral, como todo hay usu presiones, te ofrecen muy buenas prestaciones muy por arriba de la de ley"
good,"Costco was a great place to work. Great pay and benefits. The atmoshere was sometimes too big, felt like you were just a number"
good,the work there is like going to the gym its a lot of lifting. We deal with all types of people from all around the world. Working there tests your patients but you learn fast. the people that I work with are different ages and races and for the most part its like having a family at work. You have the moms the aunty's the sisters and the brothers but but it all works well most days. The management sucks they play favorites a lot even tho they say they don't. the thing i enjoy most about the job is getting to met people from around the world and people from other warehouses and hearing how they compare the costco i work at to theirs or there home towns ones
good,"Great place to begin your journey and build yourself for the future. Friendly environment, very team oriented which helped me thrive."
good,"working at talofa wines ltd was a very great experince for me, it was my first job and i loved it. I was constantly moving around and interacting with the employess. i had the best co workers ever. there was no hard part of the job, i loved everything i did."
good,Great pay and Benefits. Management is highly organized with clear expectations and goals. The work is fast paced but overall great place to work.
good,I followed the code of ethics for costco and was fired for it. I notified my management team that my manager was commiting fraud. They covered it up and told me it is easier to terminate a tech verses a pharmacist. This coming from someone whos father is third in the company and untouchable. Costco Jacksonville sucks!
good,"i'm looking for a forklift position,mainly if i get a 9am-6:30pm would be nice for me.i can't wait to go back to work."
good,"Costco is a wonderful place to work. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement for the right people and a lot of cross training possibilities in various departments. Although it takes a while to get to top wage, once you get there the money is pretty good and the benefits are excellent. Costco employes 50% full time employees, and 50% part time employees so depending on what kind of work/life balance you are looking for, there is a job that is right for you."
good,I loved working here except for how time served oriented it is. Whether you better then your coworkers or not it is hard to get ahead without putting alot of time in with this company.
good,"I worked for this company for just over three months. This was only a seasonal job, that being why my employment with them was short. I learned various ways to stock food merchandise and make end cap displays. I also helped customers find products that they were looking for."
good,This was a great place to work until my manger was transferred to another store. When this happened everybody got very stressed out and the new management was very difficult and frequently made bad decisions .
good,"I had gained a lot of experience for 7 years working for Costco. Areas I had never work before I was able to learn and grow each and everyday. As time went on, I was able to achieved and got the employee of the month back in 2016 that means a lot because hard work pays off!"
good,"Great company to work for, with great benefits. Employee and management very friendly and helpful. Great opportunities for advancement,,they really take care of there employees."
good,It has a good work environment and they work really well with your work schedule if you're in school. Helpful staff and will teach you the ropes until you get the hang of things and feel comfortable doing things on your own.
good,"I worked as seasonal staff at Costco for about 8 weeks.  I enjoyed the work, the environment, and the people.  I was disappointed not to be kept on at the end of December, but have no hard feelings.  I will be re-applying."
good,It was usually very busy. I would work 9 hours a day and the hours would go by swiftly due to the amount of work we had to do daily. Compensation was great.
good,"high energy,fast pace,friendly atmosphere,management is very helpful.this job is stressful and very hard and demanding on your body and mind.typical day was between 8-12 hrs. of non stop moving."
good,"buena empresa para trabajar, buen personal y entrenamiento"
good,Great company. Great management makes for a great working environment.  Positive influence from management.  Accommodating and trustworthy. Ability to advance.
good,"My review at costco was simple, I had really only one task to worry about. Considering I was always on top of my work, my reviews always came out as excellent."
good,"...and all that comes with it. Pay and benefits will make you stay for years. The culture and entitlement of members will make you wanting more. Overall, I was satisfied working here, however, if you have an education in a specialized field it will likely go to waste here as most of those jobs are at a regional or corporate location... unless you move."
good,"Usually, the day starts demanding but eventually slows down. Most of my coworkers are nice people. IT management needs a little work. other than that, a typical working environment."
good,A great experience to learn different departments and be more efficient in everyday tasks. Get to interact with customers and make friends on the job.
good,"I was a seasonal employee during the fall/winter season, meaning I wasn't fully guaranteed a job, (but if your store needs people and you do a well job, you will get one). You will do a lot of different things, from working/cooking with food to pushing shopping carts and taking out trash, as well as working with cashiers and stocking. (Theres honestly too much to type in terms of a normal day for 'front end' employees. Management expects a good amount out of you, but starting out at 15 an hour, you should be doing your best anyway, and if you do your job at at least an O.K fashion, no one will give you any trouble. All of my coworkers were really really nice and supportive and gave a lot of advice, schedule was really flexible too, they were very understanding that you have a life outside work."
good,"Employees and management get a long very well, and you are encouraged to apply and move up into a different position. The most enjoyable part of the job is to help the members find what they are looking for."
good,Overall good company with great benefits. Great chances and opportunities of moving up within the company. Management and constant corporate visits do make for a pretty stressful environment at times though.
good,The tire center is fast-paced. the supervisors each have their own idea of how it should work. As I am placed in one station another supervisor could take over and send me over to another department of the store.
good,Great place to work for the salary and benefits. My coworkers are fantastic and I thoroughly enjoy working with them.  I fully recommend working at Costco if the opportunity arises.
good,it is very fast paced and it tires you out after a certain time. they paid well and gave good hours. If you want to constantly work and have a fast paced non stop environment then apply here.
good,good company to work for. fast pace busy alot to do. management is very kind and courtious. good work hours. alot of opportunity to learn and grow within.
good,Working at Costco really had me motivated to work. The work place environment was always up lifting and the people I worked with helped out alot. If you didnt know what to do or had trouble with anything in the store there was always someone to go to without hesitation. Costco was always organized and clean. I was a great worker and fast learner.
good,Costco is structured to take care of the their employees. It is not so well structured on training but they are actively working on it. They are understanding when it comes to personal needs and will work with you when it comes to your schedule.
good,"I love working for costco specially because they have workers from all places, diversity is something that you will find at costco for sure !"
good,"Typical day for starting men is the parking area. Women get sent inside as cashier assistants. One is obviously more demanding than the other but both are still pretty hard because of how busy it gets. I did both of them but mainly focused on the parking area. There is a lot of sun and cars and you only have 15 min breaks if you are part time. If you get 8 hours then you get a 30 min break and one of 15 min. Lots of benefits like high paycheck ($12.50 starting) and a free membership from the store. One of the hardest parts is when the store gets super busy and there is a lot of rush and you have to thus work faster and better. I still enjoyed it because I could at least eat inside and I made some good friends. Culture is solid and the veterans usually treat you with respect even if you just started. Apart from that, you have to be very resilient because sometimes the higher-ups will just throw their weight around towards you and you MUST NEVER complain about. Also the customers can break you with all their asking for support and hardest part probably is balancing satisfying the customer demands with the store policies (e.g. You can help some people pack stuff and not others).  Apart from that, I would say the benefits outweigh the hardships but it is still incredibly demanding."
good,"I had an overall great experience paired with a  great work culture. Costco offers great job security, and equal opportunity to excel in the work place."
good,Costco is a great place to work. Flexible hours and understanding managers help make it easy for you to succeed in the work place. They tend to give a good amount of hours.
good,"On dois être rapide,ponctuel, souriante et on dois s’adapter à tous"
good,"It’s not your typical grocery store, especially being a newly opened store it demanded a lot from the front end—where I worked. Nonetheless, management works hard to ensure employees are treated fairly."
good,Work with a great team and grow with the company and gain experince and work in all deparetments and also learn new skills and there lots of hours to work for
good,Costco is a fast paced working environment due to the amount of traffic that they receive day in and day out. You also get to interact with a variety of people because of all the different departments. I would highly recommend socializing with other people from other departments because being on a good standard with other departments is a plus.
good,"Overall good company to work for, they are really good about encouraging cross training within the warehouse. They provide a very open work environment and implement the open door policy if you ever have a problem."
good,Very good questions love working at Costco maintenance department good kept warehouse clean customer service management good company good pay good benefits good co workers good training
good,"Overall, my time at Costco Wholesale was decent. Great Pay, Amazing Benefits! Management could be a little better. And I wish I was giving a chance to grow with the company."
good,"Costco was an excellent place to work, the work place was fun and management was great. The company always had schedules posted three weeks in advance."
good,"great company and fun place to work, great enviornment, co workers and  staff are easy yo get along with.  it was fun learning the system and working with others."
good,"Its a lot of hard work and dealing with customers here can be a pain, but overall Costco is a great job. Work hard and you'll be noticed, can be promoted within a year or two if you try."
good,"During the holiday there was chances for overtime. The management was very clicky, so if you made one made the others observed you more. If you kept your head down, did your job and did not cause any issues you are golden."
good,"Really nice people made it fun and happy to come to work. If you can work hard it's fun to challenge and push yourself physically. It was hard to wake up early, but definitely worth it in the end."
good,Work with great people. Work is always constant. And you get paid very well for a retail environment. You earn more vacation time as you work there longer.
good,"Awesome job for every one whose looking for a job,Be positive.Be more hardworking ,stay away from trouble, mind you own things ,don't bother no one.Make sure to be friendly trustworthy.Thanks."
good,"Very polite coworkers, supervisor was the best. Great work environment as well as great pay and opportunities to move up in the company. Different shift opportunities as well."
good,"Working for Costco was stressful especially in Membership, You would get rude customers and un patience customers but you always have to keep a happy fake face on, make sure your giving them 100% of your time and listen whatever they need to help them fully even though you know you want to but you have to because it's our job."
good,"After clocking in, the employee meets its supervisor for instructions. The employee goes to its work station with Supervisors’ orders and no tardiness policies in mind and begins taking customers merchandise and organizing merchandise into customers shopping cart; and the employee does these maneuvers for the customer gently and quickly, within the fast paced environment, with Associates’ Advisor keeping up with constantly elongating and fast paced work station customer lines. There were 15 work stations, each work station had its Advisor and the Advisors’ Associate. Each work station had received orders from the Supervisor. After Associate is complete with the shift, it begins to replenish the cash register, and leaves."
good,"Easy job, and lots of ways to advance within the company. Good benefits after a certain period of employment. Annual raises are good, and overtime pay on certain days of the week is a good bonus."
good,"Working at any major retailer is a lot of physical labor. I learned how to drive a fork lift. Management was always busy but always willing to help with whatever question or concern you voiced. The culture of the workplace was a lot of career employees; there was a lot of camaraderie and employees were even friends with each other outside of work. The hardest part of the job was definitely just the physical toll it took on your body. However, I did love my coworkers and only have good memories of the position."
good,I loved working for this company. But I do see a bit of favoritism for some and not for others. The benefits and compensation can't be beat! Just always abide by their safety rules.
good,Excelente trabajo para ascender y empezar con responsabilidades laborales
good,"Good place to work. I liked working there they were very helpful in training as well as family oriented, If you had a family issue that you needed to take care of they would let you take care of it"
good,"Horraire stable, apprentisage pour travail en équipe , bon salaire et avantage"
good,"Food Court specifically could use some fresh faces. The company as a whole pays you really well for what you do, but the environment in there is not what some may expect."
good,"This job is very good for people who still don't know what they want to do. There are many possibilities to move up within the company, plus you get benefits for both part time and full time employees."
good,"Best ever..Hectic long hours nut they treat you great...  Was to retir on Januaer 9, 2016.. had stroke on Jan4 and they kept me on meducal leave...full salary for 8 months to make sure I was ok"
good,Fast pace job which required physical labor and problem solving skills at times. My particular store had a bad culture at times and i didn't enjoy going to work there after a while.
good,"I've enjoyed my almost three years working for Costco Wholesale. I have always been treated with respect from management and had a safe workplace. I learned how to adapt to change there because at any given moment, they may change your schedule or your job title without notice. I think that also was the hardest part of the job, though. I never really knew what I was walking into and it could be stressful at times. The most enjoyable part of working there was the good benefits and awesome fellow employees. I made many friends and always had a good time with them at work."
good,Ayant travaille chez Costco. jai vraiment aime travaille au sein de cette compagnie qui s'occupe de bien former les gens afin de pouvoir travaille activement sans problème.
good,"Good company to work for, they treat the staff well. I worked there over a Christmas period. Plenty of hours and opportunity to progress if you work hard."
good,everyone was focused on getting things done and together. sometimes it was even intertaning to work by how everyont got along. then on top of it they treat there employees good
good,"Costco is a very productive workplace, which endures substantial physical activities. The staff at Costco was very pleasant to work with, helpful and friendly."
good,"Pretty good place to work, the pay and benefits aren't bad. The big problem is that every department is understaffed the time, and because of the good benefits people take advantage of it and are constantly calling in or getting medical leave, which leaves dedicated workers constantly picking up the slack."
good,Managers should have been more helpful and understanding.  It is like any place usually where the employee comes second.  The benefits were nice. The hours could have been a little better.
good,"the benefits provided by Costco Wholesale are above and beyond the standard for retail. Pay raises are based on the the number of hours you have worked for the company. The insurance is one of the best policies in the game. the company sees its employees as assets, not liabilities."
good,"It's a cool place to work when you know your routine and the people who work there. If you were to finish your area early, you have the option of working overtime."
good,"Costco is a great company to work for."
good,"Food Court Attendant"
good,really good pay for starting out lots of hard work. Benifits after 90 days and you get a free costco card. Also you have safty trainings and earn customer serive exsperence in the bakery
good,"A typical day would be fast paced day, however there was a manageable work load. Management was fair. I enjoyed the work environment and positive employees."
good,"Very fast paced, but the day goes by fast. Unfortunately, you are still held liable for incidents that weren't even in your control so that aspect of the job is miserable."
good,Good place for a first job or for those looking for a part time job during school. Flexible hours and friendly coworkers. Good benefits and room for advancement..
good,"I think the supervisors were unrealistic with their selection demeanor, however I learned to excel utilizing my resourcefulness and maintain a sense of urgency. I enjoy using the competitive skills I developed from this location to stand out and perform above expectations."
good,"helping members with product from store to car/truck/suv, fun to work with fellow employees and help them with their job as well as interaction with members, helping them with questions and finding product they are looking for in the Wharehouse. Can be stressful and very busy at times. Must be able to change what your doing and help in other departments when the need arises. over all the job is fast paced and busy."
good,When I worked at Costco I was working 5 days a week and I absolutely enjoyed it. Although it did take away my summer because I was working so much I wouldn’t take it back. It was a really great experience for me to have worked there.
good,"Great place to work as it is one top retailers in the country. Further, they are very flexible with scheduling for students and provides extra hours during the holiday periods."
good,Good job for minimal skills takes of employees with insurance even as part-time. Room for growth. Give free membership. The typical day came in and just do your assigned job and then go wherever the supervisor tells you too. Lots of events for employees especially for their families and if you're in the employee work club.
good,Costco is a great company with fantastic job security. Most managers don't have a problem writing the schedule so that students can go to school while working part time at Costco.
good,"It was a lot of physical labor, but with fun co-workers the day went by quickly and easily. Everyone was willing to help out the other departments when needed, and worked hard to finish everything by the end of the night."
good,"I use to be A certified medical assistant. Costco paid me more then what I made working in the hospital. Costco is a very strict company that offers great benefits. It can be very hard to work their your 1st 90 days, but after my probation period things got better. I start out on carts. It's a lot of micromanagement, but when I went to stocking much better."
good,I only worked there for a few months due to a death in the family. They reached out and reminded me I was always welcome to come back when I was ready. That meant the world to me.
good,"I was only temp help for holidays. Not much to say did "
good,"Costco is a very fast pace environment, you have to be able to think quick and get solutions to problem. I like it there but I just don't get enough hours that's shy I'm seeking another job"
good,"7am- 3:30pm Shifts. Management is very friendly and fun but can get serious when needed. Get to work with people of different cultures. The workplace culture is very friendly, everyone knows one another and it makes you feel like you're part of a family. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you work with and the laughs and memories you create with them."
good,Unfortunately I was hired ad seasonal and being in a small department they didn't have the payroll to keep me and I was laid off at the end of season even though my immediate supervisor was very impressed with my work and dedication. I would've loved to be kept on in that position.
good,"Faced pace, friendly management and helpful coworkers. Nice benefits. Overall great employer. Flexible too. If your having any difficulty always someone there to answer questions."
good,Solid company to work for but I don't want to work there anymore since they kept me doing the same thing I did at the other Costco for the past 5 years which was pushing carts.
good,Love the coworkers and management . For a seasonal job they worked with my full time job as hours could be available to me. Always friendly associates.  A fast fulfilling job. I could use my talents and always willing to help others when in need.
good,Es una empresa de muy buen nivel con un excelente ambiente laboral en donde puedes adquirir mucha experiencia teniendo la confianza de estar trabajando en una empresa de categoria internacional
good,The pay and benefits are EXCELLENT!  I really enjoyed working there.  The management was great and very helpful.  My coworkers were wonderful and hard workers.  Great working environment.
good,They treat you like family and are a great company to work for. They have helped me further my time and worked with me through the difficult events that have gone on in my life.
good,Management is laid back gives general idea of what needs to be done and leaves the figuring out to the employees other then that its a relaxed environment and pays well.
good,"if you dont mind the putting in the work, it is a good place to go. excellent management and good people to work with. always worked with me as far as being a veteran and my needs for that."
good,"Training happens on the job by your peers who are expected to teach how their department works.   Most employees are very friendly and supportive.  Membership counter can be fast pasted and slow at times. You can expect to be pulled from the counter to help the front end box and load groceries on the concrete floor. Also be prepared to become  a good salesmen of upgrading memberships, selling Citi Visa cards and promoting supportive services."
good,It is fun and productive. People are nice to you and you can learn how to wake up early at morning and typically thats only difficult part of this work.
good,Overall great place to work. Cost of living is not there yet with their pay tho. The people and Management are really great people to work with just wish they could keep up with the competition of pay.
good,Job was a good experience and provided lots of knowledge into wholesale. Management was good . Needed to push carts rain or shine but was provided a raincoat.
good,Es una empresa con oportunidades para jóvenes de estudiar y trabajar
good,If the location i worked at had the Semi tractor division i would have stayed. The work was satsifying once you learned the system and task. Time spent at work does make the difference in advancement. the more hours you contribute the more upgrading is open to you.
good,"I worked at Costco for 12 years, the management are fake as all can be.. they don’t really care about you, they care about themselves and are very selfish. They need to learn how to respect long time employees!"
good,Everyone is pretty friendly and very fast paced with overall a very well team oriented environment. Rely and count on each other of reaching the same goal.
good,"Costco, specifically the Optical department, is a wonderful environment to work at. I learned a lot of things about something I wear and use everyday, glasses! It's interesting how much goes into glasses and contacts and how many people actually use it. The most difficult part of the job are the rude customers, but that goes for any job. The best way is to stay calm and explain that you are simply doing your job and trying to help their problems and needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is there is always something new to learn."
good,"I only worked for Costco for a short time.  To continue you were required to work whatever shift they gave you.  It was busy during the holiday season, so often you didn't always get a moment to recharge your batteries.  Loved the crew I worked with.  I was able to work front end, then off to recover the clothing section as needed.  It was a good experience."
good,"I would clock in and immediately check in with management to await my assignment. I cross trained for multiple departments, as they never had proper staffing for departments. Workplace culture was very welcoming, but management could strongly improve on their professionalism."
good,The pay is great for standing in 1 spot and putting groceries into a shopping cart for a while. Oh and sometimes you have to go and spend time outside collecting carts which kills time pretty fast. Not much to complain about other than picky customers but you can always hand them off to a supervisor
good,"Generally a good place to work. Room for advancement. Hourly and salaried positions very good for the industry. Can be a fun place to work, good benefits, perks, and bonuses."
good,Working for Costco was an enjoyable pharmacy experience. The corporate culture within Costco was very supportive of employees and managers were very helpful.
good,Fast paced environment. Can be stressful. Lots of hardworking coworkers. Not a fan of resuing boxes to place customer’s purchased goods. Pay was good.
good,"Costco was a great job to start with out of high school that I could have certainly made into a successful career, like many have/do. They offer a wide Varity of jobs within the company and treat their employees very well."
good,This job taught me the effectiveness of teamwork and how it's used to keep every part of the business functioning. The management was tough and always trying to stay productive.
good,"Costco is a great employer and would recommend a friend to work there. Hours are secure and if you have worked there for a while your employee ""perks"" increase."
good,You stay very busy. You work on your feet a lot and help a lot of customers. Helps build communication skills working with a lot of people and dealing with different customers with different needs. Hours go by fast when working non-stop.
good,It's a good place to work with good coworkers. However the work load could be heavy because of lack of help and hiring. It's a good job in general if you want consistent pay and advancement to a certain limit.
good,"Calm place to work, friendly associates, and easy work to finish in an eight hour period. Not very physically demanding and decent pay for the work that you do finish."
good,"I would start my shift at night. I was a stocker. the work was fast paced, fun and easy.Costco is really good at promoting in house. they were going give me forklift training only after 3 mouths. I really like working for this place"
good,I stocked the frozen food cases.  I was hired as a seasonal employee for the holiday season.  I also helped customers find what they wanted.  I enjoyed it but it ended after the new year.
good,"I was a student that worked as a CSRP. They always called me back every summer and Christmas holidays. Very supportive and gave me time off when I went back to school, and I always had a position when I finished school for the year."
good,"I enjoyed working with the company and the employees/ co workers."
good,"Great job to work for , great place to grow and move up in . Flexible hour and if your a college student they work out the schedule to fit your needs ."
good,great..atmosphere co workers were a joy to work with comfortable atmosphere to work.management was a joy to work for the hardest part about the job is inventory audits the most enjoyable part about working there is meeting new people.
good,"fast pace, hard work, great people."
good,"Working at costco was fun. They like to move their products(which are on pallets) around a lot. Customers don't like everything being moved around always and employees don't like it either as it wastes a lot of time and customer have to look for the products instead of knowing where the product is. Managers are cool, but they expect too much. Heavy lifting as everything is wholesale, so everything you stock weighs 25-45 Lbs. Good pay, but hard to get full time. Hours are 5am-10am. Sundays are paid X1.5 which is super nice. Overall the job is good, but they cant provide enough hours for most employees."
good,"Typical work-day was 5pm-10pm. You work the floor until close answering Member's Questions, keeping the area tidy, and ridding of the plastic and boxes. After close, you restock all of the necessary area. One of the best Retail jobs in my opinion, especially considering the pay compared to other places."
good,I loved working for this company and would do it again. I was in school so I couldn't get the full benefits of the job but the little that I did get was good enough for me
good,it certainly wasn't a bad place to work. but the managers were very unprofessional and would typically spend their time gossiping about the social life of employees and staff
good,"I worked at costco while i was in college and enjoyed everyone i worked with and the environment there. The work was tedious and "
good,It’s a great place to work at with a positive attitude management. Makes day go by faster when you work together with other employees. Really friendly staff
good,"But i was put into pushing shopping carts all day for 6+ hours a day every day basically which doesn't make the place any worse, but everyone has their role. When you're given your role, you are put into it."
good,"Great place to work at."
good,Long hours and breaks feel short. High physical demand can be very tiring and there is no privacy just constantly surrounded by people can be exhausting. The location of products and isle placement constantly change on weekly basis so you're just as lost as members are when locating items which can be stressful when attempting to help members with their shopping and questions. Coworkers were friendly though and management was respectable.The company has great benefits and ok starting pay.
good,"Most enjoyable, meeting people, assisting them with their questions or needs, management is good, understanding, and helpful."
good,This was a great good while in collage. Offered good income and great job security. You are able to transfer to different warehouse easily if you relocate.
good,"I have nothing negatve to say about Costco."
good,I enjoyed my time there. People were so friendly and welcoming. The management was great and they gave everyone a fair chance at every job in the building.
good,"Very busy days goes by fast, I learned several things there's alot to learn, Management is great ready to teach and helpful, Work place is clean and spacious, I really enjoyed my days working at Costco there were no problems that I had working there, Most enjoyable were the employees and customers very friendly and easy going."
good,Tons of good guys to work with. Quick promotion if you learn your job  and take leadership on small tasks. There are tons of different jobs to do. Morning shift is the best shift.
good,"I was a seasonal/part-time employee at the Costco in Austin. I worked there for the majority of the fall season. Since during that time I had school, me and the jib worked around my school schedule and gave me the most amount of hours that I could work. Everyday was a different environment inside the store; there was never a slow day. Everybody was friendly and inviting. And when I say everybody I mean everybody. I think my biggest challenge working there was becoming not only fast at doing the tasks that were given ( which ranged from cart retriever to food stocker) but also being efficient. I really did enjoy my time at this job because it was a job with good benefits, understanding and encouraging workers, and a good-feel type of vibe that was always enjoyable coming into. Definitely one of the best jobs I had."
good,"Costco was a good place to work, management in my particular area was great, but overall could have been little less crazy.  Benefits were good for the employee and also covered the family as well."
good,"The place was alright. They made sure you stayed busy. Breaks were given when the work environment slowed down. The whole time I was there, nothing to really complain about."
good,"Costco is a busy place to work as expected. However, expect to do the same thing every single day if just working as an associate. Started off as a seasonal employee and continued working part-time. There are lots of managers, coworkers, etc in each department which makes the work environment better and more supportive."
good,"I worked at a Costco helping to market and open the warehouse then in a few different departments. The company offers competitive benefits and decent pay for grocery sales. However, there was not room for upward mobility if that is something you are interested in with the company. It also becomes boring quickly, so do not expect to be intellectually challenged if that is something you want from a job/career - as you are stuck to a specific department and it becomes tedious work at times. With that being said, it is still a good company overall to get in with and work for."
good,"once you clock in they put you to work which is good there's no horseplay you get your breaks on time unless its overly busy, which is understandable."
good,"Hands down the best job I've ever had. Loved the work, loved the people, loved the opportunities. I was sad to leave but I had a full time job offer from the State of Hawaii. Cannot recommend this company enough"
good,"If you enjoy the public and interaction with people, this is a good place to work. Never a dull or boring and very challenging. I enhanced my people experience, understanding why people need certain products for everyday living and just be able to apply myself to helping the public."
good,Costco was a great place to work for many years. I learned many valuable skills and how to deal with coworkers as well as members in many different settings.
good,Typical day at work included packing and stocking the sales floor. A lot of heavy lifitng however it was self controlled. Fairly laid back environment. Everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs and each other. Everyone had a purpose and that was to focus on the task at hand and complete your work for the day and go home.
good,"emballer ,nettoyer , faire linventaire ,respecter les normes de solubriter"
good,"This is a great place to work part time or on a temporary basis. As with all retail, you will have to work weekends. Everyone you work with is very friendly."
good,"Costco is a very friendly and convenient place to work. The setup is always organized and clean. The evironment of this workplace is very positive,  helpful, and everyone communicates well with each other, especially with their members."
good,"Demonstrate and explain products,methods,or services in order to persuade customers to purchase products"
good,"great place to learn the basics of a good job, but there is a lack of opportunities to move up in the company unless you've worked there for more than 5 years."
good,"I am very happy to work in Costco, is a wonderful place where you could have a amazing experience with costumer, different culture and opinion."
good,"Fast paced, family oriented.  Great people work there, you learn to do everything at Costco.  Everyone is subject to do almost any job. Management is great"
good,I was a great job when I was in my 20's. I wish I would of stayed with the Company because there it lot of room to grow and you can always transfer anywhere.
good,Mi puesto en la empresa es categorizar y surtir mercancia para que el cliente tenga una mayor facilidad de encontrar lo que busca
good,The days were busy because i was hired during the holiday season. My co workers were very friendly and helpful when it came to showing me the procedure on how
good,"From start to finish you feel as of the majority of your work force as the smallest to biggest impact on the rest of your department. You can also tell that the management finds it admirable when put hustle and initiative into your work when or when doesn't even require it. Key focuses are to always be friendly, focused and timely. After that, it is smooth sailing."
good,enjoyed interacting with costumers and other employees. Was able to move around to different departments. this allowed me to learn other positions and become a well rounded employee.
good,When I worked here it was very busy fast-paced and crazy because of the Holiday season. I had some difficulties during my time there but I did enjoy working ther
good,"Upon arrival I had to jump right in as i would have plenty of boxes to load on a pallet and additionally open the truck up. This involved unlatching, opening the back door, attach the metal connection to be able to walk in the truck and remove excess pallets.I worked on a conveyor belt where any of 1 to 4 people would be packing boxes for me to load. The dept. was called Google Express and we were responsible for shopping for the customer    and then mailing the boxes out to them. Very physical work which i enjoyed."
good,Good company with good pay and benefits.  Good work to life balance and job security.  This is a busy workplace which allows for getting into the flow of your job duties.  Good management also.
good,it was fast pace opening the store everything needed to be done by a certain time or the store couldn't be opened. you had to grab your forklift drivers and double check what was dropped in which Isle so you knew where the work needed to be done.
good,Costco was a learning experience and with it came a lot of ups and downs. At first it was hard for me to get the hang of things. I was trained well and within no time I completed tasks at hand with no problem.
good,"I actually still work here.  I'm just exploring what else is out there, as well.  Overall it's a great gig for the type of work and place that it is. Would recommend overall."
good,Very enjoyable work environment fast paced and fun very high volume store. Some poor management but that is with every company Timly reviews and raises
good,Working here really helped with my time management skills and gave me experience working with a team. I've also develop a the ability to work under pressure in a fast pace environment.
good,"Costco is a good company to work for, especially when it comes to job security and a life/work balance. I have learned many skills during my time here."
good,"I don't hate working at Costco, in fact I enjoy helping the members. Some of them are pains but some are really nice  In the end it's a balance. The company wants you to put in lots of hours but you get perks too."
good,What’s the warehouse live with the job like to go hours good benefits provided 401(k).  I really enjoyed seeing how they treated their customers. Where was good opportunity
good,Very good place to work. They'll definitely give you an opportunity to work your way up through the company. The employees are really helpful towards the new incoming employees as well.
good,"Overall good experience, definitely fast paced place, on your feet. Great opportunities given in many departments, for a cashier assistant you are showing your work ethic skills."
good,"Who doesn't love Costco?  There's a reason its been listed as one of the best places to work in the United States.  Yes, it is a retail-like atmosphere, so those challenges are ever present and at times it can repetitive and exhausting.  However, there are so many different departments and roles that a Costco Employee can get into to ultimately find their strengths and excel.  This is why management at Costco encourages cross-training in multiple departments to ensure employees are well-rounded and gain as much knowledge as they can for the company they work for.  They have a decent business structure that rewards those who come in every day and work hard.  In my experience, management has been very accommodating with employee's needs.  Coworkers become your second family. The most difficult part about working for Costco is being on the receiving end of their extremely lenient return policy. I will leave it at that. Moving up in the company is not extremely difficult.  As I mentioned above, if you work hard, you will be noticed. The work you put in is what you get out of it.  I have had a great run with Costco and learned many things which include; merchandising, sales, supervising, and my personal strength - marketing.  I am under 30 years old with my own house, an unbelievable 401-K and I plan on taking everything I learned at Costco and apply it to a new career. I can't be thankful enough for the opportunities Costco has provided me."
good,"great benefits for working at the corporate branch, health dental, paid time off, sick pay, and additional family benefits, commuting benefits. has cafeteria for employees which is awesome. gym onsite"
good,Great place to work. Great work environment and is friendly to everyone. Great for summer job and while in school. Sometimes get a late shift but other than that the starting pay is above the normal minimum wage
good,"I love the company I work for, from the benefits to the pay I could not ask for a better job. But the members, what we call the customers, are 99% the most spoiled/coddled customers I have spoken to in my entire life. They throw fits worse then any toddler I've met. No matter what, management will bend over backwards to help the member's. No matter how the customer is treating the phone agent or them. The communication between various supervisors and managers is laughable due to the fact that no one fallows the same set of rules. They continually switch us between departments (eCommerce Calls-eCommerce chat, US eCommerce-CA eCommerce) with little training and expect you to just roll with it. Workplace culture is a lot like high school in a way, plenty of gossip and nosy people. If you are just starting, get ready for the cold to be your new best friend because this place is the definition of a petri dish the CDC would rather burn. Though I would have it be known that the company itself is amazing, what they do for people and how they handle their business is above and beyond commendable. Overall it's a good place to work but end all the member service you have to put out will make you feel dead inside."
good,It’s a good job it pays well but .. you don’t get all the hours needed to work. The staff there are very kind they help you when needed. You are on your feet 24/7.
good,"tres belle endroit ou travailler ,bonne ambiance de travail"
good,"Costco is an overall good company to work for with great benefits and good pay. I would recommend Costco to anyone, but it is a fast pace competitive job. If you cannot handle customer service and working in busy situations this is not the job for you."
good,Overall Costco is a very good place to work and they value their employees by giving them a fair wage and benefits for part and full time workers. Unfortunately my shifts were at an inconvenient time and I had to leave. I still rate them as one of the better working experiences I have had.
good,I enjoyed my time with Costco and recommend them to anyone who enjoys a high energy career. They provide good starting pay and excellent benefits with opportunities for career growth.
good,I would help out the baker with what need to be done and help collect shopping carts and put them away. Always helping out each other to get the job done for the day.
good,"Es un trabajo muy ágil, aprendes mucho y hay muchas oportunidades de crecimiento."
good,"Kind, fast-paced environment"
good,"Great place to work.  Overall had an amazing experience working here.  Starting pay is 14 dollars an hr, with many opportunities for a raise as time continues on."
good,"emballer les commandes des clients "
good,"My summertime employment at Costco included many busy, fast-paced working days around the 4th of July holiday weekend.  Employees are also avid Costco shoppers and are always up-to-date on the latest inventory and sales."
good,"Costco gives great benefits and job security. They will take care of you, but depending on your location can vary on how fast and hard you have to work."
good,Costco Wholesale is a very good company to have a career.  I have gained a tremendous amount of skills and knowledge that would benefit any company.  Teamwork is paramount in this work environment
good,"Worked for the company during the xmas period, they were very flexible and offered a great company package. Overtime helped boost the wage also."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Costco; however, I feel that I needed something more challenging and obtain new perspective on uses for my skills. I always take away experience and lessons from any experience in my life."
good,"Costco was a very busy environment, with a lot of organizing and stocking to do.  There was a lot of merchandise of a high quantity wholesale products. "
good,"One of the best places I’ve worked and great place to be. Able to take a break at your own time. Ability to move up if desired. Personnel was great , managers were ready to answer questions and help."
good,Employee oriented company that tries there best to help you move forward in the company. Fun workplace with many friendly faces. Management was amazing in helping solve problems and helping employees improve in there work.
good,"If I was offered the opportunity to return to Costco I would."
good,"I worked p/t at Costco in the Maintenance department for two years. There was only one store in the city I lived in and that made advancement difficult.  A typical day had me cleaning and organizing parts of the store, then assisting in others as needed."
good,Great place to work at the people are very nice it feels like a family the managers are always there to help you in any way if you can get in Costco I highly recommend it
good,"exelente ambiente de trabajo, yna gran experiencia ser parte de la familia costco"
good,"Costco has a great atmosphere to work in. Management was great, the employees, in general, were really great as well. I got to experience a variety of positions there as well."
good,"It was a great working space, but I just wasn't working enough, and was busy with school but now I have a lot more time to work and I am ready to make an commitment to work."
good,great place to work if you are working under the correct managment. it is very face paced most days and sometimes you will have to work over time but if you are a hard worker this would be okay for you
good,"Costco is a awesome place to work great environment amazing experience to work in "
good,They tend to overwork you outside while pushing carts. The management and a lot of the upper staff were quitting or being shifted around at the time of my departure.
good,"I was a cashier, but my job consisted of many different aspects. Physical labour, stocking shelves, folding clothes, sometimes inventory or training is all part of being a cashier at this job, as well. One time we even got paid to knock out all the tills and help the construction workers install the new ones over night. The pay is decent for what it is, the variety keeps it from being boring, and the staff is a healthy mix of student and lifers. management can be relentless about upselling memberships, but every job as its drawbacks. overall I'd recommend working here, especially for students."
good,The company respects employees culture and differences. The management always make sure that safety procedures are observed to avoid accidents in the warehouse. Starting salary is low for apersons with their own family so might as well look for a part time to make ends meet but after couple of years you get a livable wage.
good,I enjoyed the team oriented environment that Costco provides. The work flow was smooth and everyone did their part to make sure the customers were well taken care of.
good,Trabajar para esta empresa fue aprender. Ya que se elaboran guizados cuándo se trata de degustar.
good,It wasn't a hard job but it has been years since I worked there so I don't remember much. They did follow a strict union break time schedule. other than that I had no issues.
good,La mejor experiencia para desarrollar tus habilidades.
good,"facilidad de empleo, flexibilidad de horarios, un excelente lugar de trabajo"
good,"The culture at Costco is like no other. Good balance and strong ethics. "
good,costco is very fast paced and you have to know how to problem solve very quickly. seniority is a big thing here so don’t be expecting to have a good schedule or as many hours as you want when you start.
good,Started work by getting greeted by managers as they hand out our duties for the morning. From there on it was constant work and lots of team work. It was never an easy day for us but with working alongside great managers and people the environment was never stressful and so work was done on time and as told.
good,"Would recommend for starters and people that would like to stay with the company."
good,"It's a fine place to work that pays absurdly well for what you do. Only downside it this store is in a busy one, and the people are all grumpiness incarnate. Current managerial staff is not well liked, and there's an overabundance of supervisors and managers, and an under-abundance of bodies to fill the roles."
good,Great workplace. Managers/supervisors are really helpful and supportive. Most of the people you work with are the best. All around the work atmosphere is great.
good,Costco is a friendly place to work. It attempts to be as supportive and accommodating as it can be with employees. There is also ample opportunities to change your roles and be promoted within the company.
good,Worked at Costco for 3 years and loved it. The pay was great and there was always an opportunity to move up in the company as long as you wanted to do so.
good,"Fun workplace"
good,Costco is very flexible and good to its employees. there is a lot of opportunity and room to improve. The wage is also fairly reasonable. Costco offers a lot of great job departments
good,A typical day of work is a nice one. You clock in and either report to your supervisor and figure out what is needed for your day or just head straight to your job and work till closing time.
good,"It’s all customer service. You have to leave your pride at home and suck it up. You will deal with a lot of members. Most are great and loyal, others may be inconsiderate and difficult. If you have a positive attitude, you will do okay."
good,The people that work at Costco are great to work with and are really nice. A day there is like a workout. You are constantly moving and working. The hardest part of the job would be going out in the parking lot to retrieve carts.
good,"great entry level company, advancement is more about tenure and less about qualifications.  The constant interviews you had to go through to apply for any position was great training for interviewing later in my career."
good,"A regular day at Costco consisted of fast paced organization and running around. During my time with Costco I learned many useful skills in organization, sales, costumer service, and the finer points of working culture. Both managers and co-workers were joy to be around and had so much to share amongst each other. Every member bringing something unique and new to the experience. However, the job was quite physically demanding and the days where I had to make many back and forth trips came out to be the hardest for me. That being said, it was still quite enjoyable to be surrounded by so many friendly faces as the work day went by."
good,"Flexible time for students who need time to focus on studying but still earn some money. "
good,conciliation travail-famille difficile vu les horaires si on est monoparentales
good,Initiate and close sales for a leading supplier of telecommunications solutions. Sell service renewals and expand customer base within the Palm desert location
good,Had  excellent care for guest and staff teaches how to communicate with your co workers and how to give the guest great services at great deals. just a wonderful place in general
good,"I think is a great place to work. In this company, you can grow, we are offering a lot of opportunities. Our leader team is effective and focused. You'll love it."
good,Maybe over concerned with employees image but is managed professionally and at the 4 warehouses i have worked at everything ran smoothly compared to other retail jobs I have had.
good,"good place to work, very easy going people with always a good and positive attitude, fast,busy and good for someone that likes customers service; with very good benefits."
good,"it was a good working environment with great co-workers, it was quick paced and there was always something to be done. i learnt how to problem solve under pressure and finding a task so i am always working."
good,It's a great place to work! A lot of room to improve and work around through the warehouse. Everyone wants to help and make your job a lot more smooth.
good,"i really enjoyed working for this company,i have made good friends and i have learnt many skills but it was time to more forward and i need a new challenge."
good,"Busy place to work, learned a lot about customer service and management was great. The hardest part is there is not downtime. I would recommend Costco."
good,It was very fast paced but relaxed at the same time. Managers are friendly and the pay is very good for an entry level employee with no experience or education.
good,"Costco is a good place to work they treat their employees very well it is a very fast pace enviroment. "
good,"The only thing that went wrong with me is that I simply couldn't get the full-time hours I wanted. That, and my job itself was rather soul-sucking. "
good,"8 hour work shift Monday to Friday. Manage inventory for a department category for a specific region. Learn time management, team work, and how the company determines which items to purchase. Overall great company that provides great benefits and pay."
good,"Co-workers are great. Work was hard, but not overwhelming. Hours were flexible to my needs. Management was very easily accessible. was very willing to help out when needed"
good,"A typical day involved filling prescriptions, supervising techs"
good,"Costco is great place to work long term whether you want to climb the ranks or just work to get a really good paycheck. I love their raise system, which is based off hours worked not work performance. They have strict rules for being to work on time and calling an hour before your shift if you won't be in, but I consider that common sense/courtesy. They do require that Costco be your primary job, you can have a second job but they are not naturally flexible to other jobs. If you have a good manager they will work with you or you can just ask off certain times but even as a Supervisor I do not have a set schedule. In all truth, Costco's goal is for you to only have to work for them and not work three jobs to survive. At the writing of this review, they paid $13 base pay. 5 years later you should be making $17+ if you work often enough and your pay can cap within 10 years at 20+. You need a good management team though, everything is dependent on whether or not managers/supervisors have personalities that work together or cause more chaos. But since Costco's culture is more about hiring functioning adults that can work independently rather than just anyone who applies that kind of chaotic situation is rare. I work at the Rochester, MN location and I hear our's is that rare breed. However, it's not so bad that I want to quit, it's just annoying sometimes when they micro-manage you or make poor hiring choices (such as not hiring any seasonal help)."
good,"Great place to work, coworkers are great, management good. Just about impossible to get Full time though. Too many full time longtime employees so new employees stay at part time for years and years waiting for a full time position to be available."
good,"Very fast pace environment."
good,This is a job that pays well depending on where you livd but has unbeatable benefits. Hard for growth in the business as far as pay advancement but bonuses are a plus.
good,"The work shift itself is smooth, the coworkers are cool. Specific managers make the shift longer that it should be and bit more complicated but overall its a pretty good shift 4am-10am"
good,"They only hire part-time, but otherwise it was a great company to work for. The work environment and the customers are pleasant and it is easy to feel welcome and appreciated."
good,Great pay and great with your schedule. The people who work there were always energetic and fun to work with. Costco has so much departments you can work in.
good,This company gives you the option to experience all areas of the warehouse. You are given opportunities to explore other areas to see where you fit in and enjoy working.
good,"busy schedule, fun environment, lots of members and good emplyees, strict time code and strict on rules . always enjoyed my job and now time for a new one"
good,"I love working for Costco but i feel like they wasn't really for the employees benefit and the well being for the employees , i feel like that they don't care about the employees at all but beside that i love working there because they have great benefits."
good,"Good people, no drama, great benefits. Learning by observing, no formal training. Mostly each team members work independently. Supervisors and managers are knowledgeable and helpful"
good,un bun lugar para trabajar con exelente abiente laboral y sueldo muy competitivo
good,It was a great temporary job that got me through college! They had great pay and very friendly co workers. Only con was working nights and weekends which I did not prefer.
good,"My time at Costco was enjoyable and always fast paced, there were many hard moments with the early mornings of the shift I worked. The only reason for my leaving the company was due to a school conflict but otherwise the company was a pleasure to work for."
good,"Costco was a very fast paced and busy environment. The company focuses heavily on scheduled state mandated breaks for each employee. Costco has excellent starting wages that have guaranteed wage increases depending on how many cumulative hours you have worked for the company. Also includes insurance for both part-time and full-time workers. The management at Costco Wholesale in West Fargo is flawed however. Rather than giving management positions based on time spent with the company and job performance, the individuals that were given the promotions were popular. If management focuses more on a job well done instead of who was the most well liked, it would be an ideal place of employment."
good,Très bonne compagnie au niveau de la gestion administrative  ils ont couper mon poste de sécurité au niveau des pertes
good,"I was hired on to be seasonal. Job didn't last long. When asked what area would I not prefer to work in and why. That is the job they gave me. I needed a job badly, so I took it. I continued to look else were but I was fighting with 8 other people to keep my job. If i wanted to stay."
good,"All and all, it's one of the best companies I've worked for. Every organization has their pros and cons, and Costco is no different. If anyone would come up and ask me if they should work there, I will tell them the same. Pretty good start up pay."
good,"I loved working at Costco as a Cashier. The staff are what really made it great. These people are so dedicated and stay so positive. While I was a student, the managers really supported me in attending classes and still making my shifts."
good,"Good place to work with fair working conditions.Hard to get on full time,but could be a good career path once put on full time.Very good salary for the long term."
good,"This is a great company to work for. They treat their employees very well. Room to grow and learn in your area as well as advancements and transfers around the world. Opportunity to meet and interact with people from customers, coworkers and management."
good,"It was a great place to work, wish I had stayed on after the season ended. The pay was competitive. The only thing I didn't like was how far out the store was."
good,"Very busy, rushed to put items back at the end of the day, lots of people ask you where the items are because costco seems to like to switch up where everything is placed every week. i cleaned up the front end of the store and pushed carts back to where they belonged. I organized the produce and helpped the cashiers with checkout"
good,Benefits are good. Management is strict and are very rude at times. . Always busy. co workers are petty. Shift times are ridiculous. its very unorganized
good,"They give you great amenities that give you a well rounded job in terms of benefits. However, their expectations are frequently unrealistic and forced"
good,I was hired as a seasonal employee with the ability to apply for permanent employment. Your ability to acquire permanent employment is based on your seasonal performance. I was given the option but chose other employment opportunities.
good,Une journée typique chez Costco c'est de voir environ 54 membres à l'heure et d'offrir quotidiennement des options plus adaptés à la clientèle. J'ai appris à sortir de mon confort et d'avoir une approhe amélioré et plus facile envers les clients. Le plus difficile est de devoir bien gérer le temps entre les commandes à passer et les promotions qui doivent être appliqué en même temps. Le plus agréable est le contact quotidien avec une clientèle aux standards plus élever. C'est de relever le défi  que cela occasionne chaque journée passée à mon travail
good,"I enjoyed my time here and loved the people here as well. Everybody was funny and we all had a great time working there. When we had to, we always cracked down and worked our butts off."
good,"Great benefits, great pay, great co-workers; everything else depends on the warehouse you are stationed at. Some managers will bend over backwards to help you meet your goals while others could care less."
good,A typical day at work was blocking down the freezer/cooler to get rid of all unnecessary boxes and then at the end of the night to stock in the back of the store.
good,"This company was a subcontractor of Costco. Every day we must meet in the office and gather all the information and the necessary elements for the sampling of the products. The best part of the job was learning about new products, meeting people and practicing the language. The worst part was standing for long hours, without receiving payment after having sold the designated product in the middle of the working day."
good,"As a cashier, you report to your immediate supervisor and he/she will determine who you'll replace or what other job you may have to do in the warehouse."
good,Very fast paced. Was only there for a seasonal position. Pay was good and some of the staff were friendly. My managers were nice and I wish I could of stayed on permanently.
good,"This was merely a job to pay the bills while I was a student at the university, now that I am graduated I am looking for a career in the engineering field."
good,It was fun. I learned a lot. There was always stuff to do. So many customers all the time. Got breaks every two hours. Management is always ready to help.
good,"This a great company to work for because the benefits are great, pay is great depending position. Too much favoritism, no communication between managers and supervisors."
good,"Costco Wholesale is a very good place to work, coworkers are very friendly and love training new people. The hardest part of the job would have been the heavy lifting and the most enjoyable part for me was working alone on the bakery closing shift."
good,"I was hired was seasonal help , holiday help. i was treated ok their. the boss and supervisor were great .i would love to work their again.i have also met my high school girlfriend .i was also offered some overtime"
good,Excellent company to work for. As a student it was nice to know I had a job every summer and break that would provide me with lifelong lessons after my time was done
good,Costco is overall a great place to work at. You can always pick up hours if needed as long as you don't go over 40 hours for the week. Co-workers are fun as well.
good,Costco is a great employer. Everyone gets benefits as soon as they are part-time which is unheard of in most retail jobs. Costco also gives 6 weeks off unpaid to whoever wants to take it during the winter which is great for those who want to travel. This is along with the 2 weeks vacation paid you already get.
good,"Part time work with an average at this store is over 30 hours a week."
good,Costco was a summer job between my freshman and sophomore year of college. The people you work with are very friendly and the company pays well starting out. They were very accepting to me going back to school in the Fall. While there I learned to bake and learned customer service skills. At times it can be very fast-paced. Always something to do. Management is very friendly but tough. Most enjoyable part was making some friends there.
good,good place to work i really liked it and they offered a decent amount of pay compared to other jobs everyone was really nice and cool to be around they always help and give feedback that is meant to help you grow.
good,"I am glad to work with costco, positive attitude, helpful, busy and more fun as well as great and engaging and educate the members helping them to find their products."
good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo y motivación a lograr objetivos.
good,"Costco was excellent company to work at."
good,"Brand ambassador for the warehouse by greeting members when they enter the store and answering any questions or concerns."
good,"The work here at Costco Wholesale as a seasonal early morning stocker wasn't bad. It was intense, hard labor which is fine as long as you have a good work ethic, and the pay was better than most any job you can get with basic labor qualifications. The only complaint I have was the pressure and stress level given by management. I have never before received reprimand for my work speed, but the management here was not happy with it. I had to RUN from station to station and absolutely exhaust myself to convince them I was doing my best. Although this is good for general productivity, it burned me out pretty fast, even being 19 years old."
good,it was fun working with team it helped me learn faster and it took a bunch of mental stress away knowing i had a team that had my back and on top of it all my co workers stayed positive an kind made me feel very comfortable an helped  me with opening up to everyone
good,working for Costco is one the best jobs I ever had  I love all the people I encounter with and it was a great experience to work with these guys. I'm not there anymore for my personal reasons but if I had to choose to retire from somewhere it would be Costco.
good,"I love working for Costco. Awesome people.Good benefits. After 5 or six years you get top pay and bonuses! I work in the deli and i started out cooking the Rotisserie Chickens and Ribs. When you work at costco you definitely can't be afraid of hard work, cause its very physically demanding. But everyone's respectful and we have fun!"
good,A typical day at work is to make sure all the carts are collected and in the appropriate area for the customers. I also assist with the gas station when necessary.
good,"Amazing place to work at, many people are very friendly and you can get along with everyone very well. Some days might go harsh, but the day pass good"
good,Learned how to manage and control work while being under high pressure. Definitely great to have on your CV. Great friendships are built with coworkers
good,"they were great to work for. i would recommend any one to work there it was a pleasure, if you want a great company to work for they are the perfect fit for anyone."
good,"Working at Costco was a great job during High school. It paid well, in Missouri, and it was very flexible around my schooling. I was able to build up extra money in their 401k that was a blessing, when I finally quit in 2014."
good,"Eight to nine hour shifts with overtime."
good,A good working environment and very fair. If you want a career in retail its a good place to work. they have room for advancement but it is very competitive.
good,You can't move up quickly because no one ever quits!! If you wanna work in retail this is the place to work. You know how retail is every where but Costco tries to make it worth it
good,Great place to work. Management is fair and the work-load is manageable. The warehouse operations are very organized and employees are helpful and supportive.
good,"Good team. Good Pay. Bad Hours. Hard work, you can not slack of at all. Customers must be dealt with extreme patience. Good job for first timers to get the feel what it means to work hard."
good,"excellent company to work for with good mangers and good benefits, i truly feel they are still growing have plenty of room for employees to advance in."
good,"Great place to work, I was only a seasonal while working their but they offer good hours to hard workers and plenty of room for diversifying your work experience based on your own personal application. Flexible hours as well."
good,"Good job for students, flexible schedule. Also good for long term placement, there's advancement opportunities. Managers were nice and co-workers were awesome."
good,"If your looking to grow within a good company, it's a great place to work. If not, then it will be stressful. If your in college, this can be a good job if your saving money for it. If your focused on school, it is not the best option."
good,Overall a good starter gemology job. The management could have been better but may have improved since I worked there. The major drawback was that it was a salaried position when I was there. Hourly is a more fair compensation for the position.
good,"great place to work, especially since you get benefits even if your only working part time. great for students. employees are all very friendly. team player environment."
good,"Would be a great job if full time "
good,Job was fast paced and required good customer services skills. Plenty of interaction with members and fellow employees. Required good communication skills and a conscientious work ethic.
good,"Horaire non-stable, prime du dimanche intéressante."
good,Very fast paced environment with room for little error with your duties. Didn’t mind working there but it was a little uncomfortable at how much management and supervisors watch you.
good,"Started out as a gas station attendant, cleaning and maintaining the pumps. Changed out fuel filters and monitored for safety issues. Also worked as a cashier in the food court area, prepared food and cleaned the dining area. Also assisted with cashiers both unloading and loading items for customers. Also worked as a member service representative, checking member's cards before entering the warehouse."
good,"Working at costco was fun. I got to do a lot o different things and wear different hats in the time i was there. Im glad I got to work there, even if it was a seasonal short period of time."
good,Bonne entreprise avec possibilité d'avancement et choix de postes varier.
good,I worked outside in the gas station and on part of the mantainence team. I reported to my supervisors for daily task. When I wasn't doing a new task I was sweeping and collecting trash inside and outside of the warehouse. At night I would clean the floors with the zamboni-type machine.
good,I loved my time at Costco Optical. I left to undertake a project in another state with my husband. I am in great terms with my former manger and colleagues and still own my Costco stock. Great company to work for.
good,"Took a little getting used to the hours for the morning shift like 2 am or 4 am but after getting into a routine this job will keep you busy throughout your shift, which is the way I prefer."
good,Give promotion to employees who deserve it. Some manager can also start acting like professional because going out and dating your employees is very bad for business
good,"great great great"
good,"Working for Costco is pretty good for the most part, the co-workers are probably the best part, the pay is decent, being jjust above minimum wage, but promotions and getting a full time position could take years. Costco is best for student jobs as they have a really good student retention program"
good,Costco is a great place to work. The managers and supervisors really seem to care for their employees and it creates a great work environment. Decent starting pay and plenty of opportunities for raises.
good,"Es una empresa que su enfoque es el servicio, fue trabajo de medio turno, donde te daban la prestaciones de ley."
good,Everything from the first time you apply you feel the family warmth. People are very nice. Costco chooses wisely about who they hire. Very safe clean environment. Above all all employees follow the law and rules.
good,"My seasonal employment at Costco was a great experience. I spoke to many long time employees about the benefits you can receive if you are hired on for a full time postilion. As it was a received a temporary Costco card while working there and $11.50 per hr. I was tasked with facing and restocking product, bagging groceries, taking in carts, and speaking with customers about any problems they might have while shopping (where is said item located, do you have this in stock, etc.)"
good,"Lovely workplace and enjoyable place to work, however the management could be more organised and give updates on how you are working and whether you are working at the right standards."
good,"Costco is a great place to work if you're lucky enough to get in. The business delivery centers are a lot easier to work in because the member traffic is less hectic and there are less products offered there in comparison to the core buildings. Working as an order picker for the newly added Costco Grocery program (a lot like amazon pantry, but from costco) gave me way more hours than I would have received had I been hired under any other position. I average about 35 hours per week but costco's part time workers are guaranteed at least 24 hours per week, $13/hour starting pay, and benefits that kick in after you pass your 90 day review. Its a good job to be in if you can stick it out, but its difficult to reach full time status if your building already has a high ratio of full-timers working there."
good,"It is a face paced environment, where you are dealing with 1000's of customers a day. Great place to grow your communication skills and on the spot thinking."
good,This place was pretty fun to work. Especially if you like doing manual labor. I was in the section where there are a lot of heavy lifting. I thought of it like a workout.
good,"Working at Costco as a student was great. I was able to get decent hours and still have time for my classes. Overall environment is very friendly and busy. However, some shift leads take there roll in power a bit too far at times and can feel unfair. It take a while to get a better position and when one is available seniority always gets the underhand."
good,"When I was there (2005 to 2008), the management took advantage of me. I understand the manager of the pharmacy when I was there is not employed by Costco anymore. I did hear that the current manager is more than fair and treats their employees with respect and kindness. Would work there again if there was an opening."
good,"Good Money fast paced, management was not receptive, disorganized, demanding, unable to assist with employee request or questions. Management was impatient."
good,it was a seasonal job but it was cool was very fast paced and was always working no down time. but the dress code is way laid back and able to have fun
good,the only reason I left was because of my Deli manager not realizing I had an almost full time job that I was working at and he wouldn't accommodate my schedule and kept playing games working me 40 hours a week when he knew that Costco wasn't my main job
good,A typical day at Costco mostly consisted of maintaining great member service with members which is where I learned these skills. It was enjoyable to work in a pleasant environment
good,"It's hard work, but with the right people, it'll be fun. Don't be lazy. Don't be rude. Leave your personal life outside of work and you'll be fine. Very fast paced. It's a workout."
good,"it is busy on weekends more family's come."
good,Customer driven and Customer focus. Typical 8 hour shifts for full time employees. Have to be flexible for start and end times. Management was fair. Learned to operate machines.
good,"Very fast-paced enviornment,  must be on top of your game every single day. Managers can be very annoying at times, but they usually leave you alone when they see you are doing your work."
good,The little time I was employed there was an interesting experience. did a variety of work tasks and all was a great learning experience. The management was fair.
good,Great Management great people to work with worked opening shift middle shift and closing shift usually worked 6 to 8 hours a day Had to work weekends and holidays.
good,this job has an amazing atmosphere and coworkers. our management was nice and easy to work with. training was on the go and not always comprehensive but you figured it out quickly.
good,"I personally like to feel like I am accommplishing things while at work and learning while doing my job. At costco even wit the pay and benefits being good I don't feel like I am doing anything special. I want to have a feeling a gratitude when I leave my job, I want to feel like I'm doing something. Maybe there is another position there that would give me that but at the moment putting bagels in bags and packaging their baked goods just doesn't bring me joy. I would highly recommend working here. The managers really care about the employees and make sure everyone is being taken care of. You get 3 breaks total throughout an 8 hour shift. It's a wonderful place. If it wasn't such a drive for me and I wasn't just seasonal I would stay and find a department that was for me."
good,A typical day at work was long hours which involved pushing carts or stocking shelves. I learned how to improve on my work and get things done a lot faster. The management was overall good people there where some who didn't communicate with other employees.
good,"I loved being able to provide an enjoyable experience for members, and my co-workers are unforgettable people! Managers are always kind and accommodating, but don't forget, they're people too, and everyone has their off days. Always be willing to give second chances with first impressions! You have to show everyone that you're ready and willing to do your job."
good,this was one of my favorite job the atmosphere is amazing to work all staff is friendly alot of benifits from working here and the management team is cool
good,"Costco is a good company to work for, Many opportunities, and many changes coming. Starting to change over to SAP.. new opportunities, and changes in the future. Online shopping becoming a thing of the future.. for grocery.. Competitive with Amazon and Whole foods merger.."
good,"Great place to work, management level employees are generally happy and accommodating. Reminiscent of a low-skill unionized environment where understandably so, many low to no-skill workers cling to any authority and influence to constantly secure their position because they know if they were to ever have to leave they don't have much that is transferable."
good,"The job at Costco was fun, stressful and never a dull moment. The people I worked with were great. I didn't like that I had to work the weekends almost every week."
good,"Loved working at Costco. Great starting pay, and wonderful benefits.. you become like family with some co-workers but very poor managment, dont really care about employees."
good,"Working for Costco is great, along with the fact that everyone is a team player. Teamwork is what you can get and what you can see when working for this company. You will be given the opportunity to work in the majority of the departments depending on your experience and skills. But they never limit you, because there are always new opportunities for you to experience.  Even if you don't have experience in a department, they'll give you training so that you'll feel confident enough to do it yourself. I was personally given the opportunity to work in many departments. Every day at work a new door is opened for you. Your voice and your concerns will be heard and will be considered. The company always has your back. Whatever the situation may be, you always have your leaders backing you up and helping you every step of the way."
good,"Lots of good people. Great place to work and fantastic benefits for part time and full time. The management staff was well trained. If you work hard there is room for advancement. Need to be able to move around fast and juggle lots of tasks and responsibilities.Great environment to work in. Almost all of the managers were employees that were promoted from within the company, so, staying within the company can prove to be very rewarding. "
good,"Great place just not enough hours, friendly people working there. Great management. Rapid working in bakery. High demand on weekends. If you work as a full timer its better"
good,I think i learned a-lot form my position with costco. The customers were good there was a-lot of open positions that one can move up with. The only downside for me was that it started at 4 am.
good,Great benefits but my GM wasn't the best he wanted me to work my school schedule around the companies needs even though the company has a policy of working around students needs.
good,"Costco is a good company with good people to work for. I would highly recommend them to anyone. The daily challenges are really cool, I have worked in many different department and learning never ceases."
good,"I enjoyed working here!! Management was always friendly and ready to help. I was in school at the time and could not relocate to another facility and since I was low on the totem pole, I had to leave. Which was okay because I was finishing up school at that time."
good,will miss this place.This is a truly great company. The culture is very open and very results oriented. This growing company requires a high degree of initiative from its managers and bases its decisions on performance
good,"-Assisting cashiers and assisting members with large loads."
good,"Interpersonal communication"
good,"Improv my communication skills and learn on retail job at costco,, how to present my self to client and meeting there expectations.. fun invironment multi cultural ,, tyre centre skills at work shop are so good working on a car I like it ,, work team are so funtastic healping each other for the heavy work load of the day..... "
good,"Overall Costco was a fun place to work. Breaks are a big thing, and the managers don't over work you to hard. Pretty easy laid back and occasionally free lunch."
good,"Costco was a really great place to work. The only problem with it is that when you get hired you're only considered temporary until further evaluation. With that said, they can drop you from the staff for whatever reason and they hold the right to tell you nothing about why they let you go, which unfortunately happened to me. Proceed with caution."
good,"greeted customers upon entry, helped customers find items they wanted to purchase, maintained pleasant appearance in the clothing department, organized customers purchases into boxes."
good,"It's retail, so you have to keep that in mind. But as far as retail goes, Costco is the best place to work. The company treats you fairly, and the management has reasonable expectations for their workers."
good,"Costco is a very go go go place, so the day passes quickly.  Coworkers are great and management is usually okay.  There is a ton of opportunity to go up in the company, which is great for ambitious people, but you can also stay where you are comfortable."
good,Costco is a great company to work for. You can make a career of it and live pretty comfortably if you stay there for enough time. They offer plenty of benefits.
good,coscto can be a gritty place to work. Getting task done can be a challenege when jumping from customer to customer needs. But can be very rewarding in down time and great work never goes unoticed.
good,it was a good family like atmosphere to work in. Typical day was fast paced but at the same time relaxed. Everyone treated each other like family helped each other whenever called upon.
good,"costco is a biggest retail company, when you are a student, it is really good to work over there. you will get more paid than other retail store. and after getting hiring and you will get vacation even you are part time over there.company will fix the schedule for your school class. if you work hard and know how to talk to people and get closed to you present manager. it will help you a lot when you want to move up."
good,great place as a part-time job. good hours. great management team. great company to work for if you want a friendly work environment. great people at each location.
good,I think that this is a great starting point for someone that wants to be in the retail field. I would say that they should come with the mindset that they want to be successful.
good,Great place to work..................You can work is various departments.The most enjoying part of the job was working with people . Management is very optimistic about their employees. I learned time management being here and how they are dedicated to the quality of the goods they sale.

good,"Great Benefits"
good,"As a merchandising supervisor or manager your day starts early usually around 4 AM. You start the shift by looking at what is products are coming in. Then you make decisions on when to put the product and how you display it prior to stocking staff start time. Then you manage the staff to get the sales floor stocked and ready. Down time is used to run reports, write schedule, reviews, etc."

good,"This job is non-stop, there is work needed everywhere. There will not be a day where there is nothing to do. Must have lots of patience while working in a really fast paced environment."
good,I have worked for Costco for 10 years now.  I want to believe there is more out there.  Work life is difficult as a manager.  Working 10 to 14 hour days.  Six days a week to make a profit.  Hardest part of the job is the staff.  They feel entitled so they slow down.
good,"Work day consist of Operating the forklift and Pulling orders to restock the shelf's."
good,"Learned a lot on the product and easy to cook, hardest part was to get the sale but selling it came easy once you understand the customer demographic."
good,"Costco gave me the chance to learn many new things such as how to work in a pharmacy, proper customer service and teamwork.  A typical day at work was opening the pharmacy, placing merchandise where it belongs and setting up computers, welcoming customers, answering the telephone, lunch time was fun, they had some games for their employees and a tv, coworkers were friends and management was good."

good,"This is a rewarding company with competitive pay and good benefits. Costco treats their employees with respect and offers paid holidays, sick time, and vacation."
good,typical day at work is pretty much routine and time management is critical and if you use it wisely you will be well off. weekends get pretty busy and will be asked to help out other departments when needed.
good,"At Costco we are always busy, always doing something. If we're not being a cashier, we are cleaning up, going around the warehouse to make sure everything is in order, or pushing carts outside."
good,"Lots of fun working in a warehouse, especially morning or night crew when store is closed. Fast paced and never boring. You don't have to worry about what to wear, makeup or pretty hair,just be presentable."
good,"Great place to work. The company's motto basically is ""we take care of our employee's so they'll take care of our customers"". Great job ops and very competitive wages."
good,"Costco is a fun company to work for, they treat their employees well.  The main problem is it is hard to get a job there because employees enjoy working there so much that many will stay until they are able to retire."
good,It was a pretty good job. Management was ok. A typical day was steady work. Steady hours per week. The people that you work with are a nice group of people.
good,"Very fast-paced customer service: consisting of answering member questions, inquiring on merchandise availability, and providing the friendliest service while providing fast -handling transactions.

good,Must be preparrd to give alot of your time to this company. But great culture. Managment is friendly and there for you. They will ensure you have all the right tools to succeed.
good,creo que en este empleo en particular adquirí experiencia principalmente en área administrativas ya que mi puesto era muy apegado a gerencia
good,Started at  6am preparing food for the shop floors displays to see what we had to sell until 8am then would re-stock missing food items on shelfs in store
good,The management is a lot more responsive than other jobs that I have been employed. The culture of the workplace is one that makes sure that everything gets done and done correctly. For the most part it is a team effort to complete assignments and everyone does their part to make it happen. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would have to be the fact that i get to wear multiple hats. I am one to get easily bored of day to tasks and that is something that always keeps me on my toes.
good,"The benefits are offered to part time employees."
good,Arrivée au travail 45 minutes avant l'ouverture du magasin pour vérifier l'inventaire pour que tout soit en ordre avant l'arrivée des clients. En étant en sous-traitance nous n'avons pas de collaboration avec les employés. C'est agréable de côtoyer les clients
good,"Excellent benefits and pay.  Management is asked to work hard and long hours, with salary compensation.  Over time pay would be nice.  Advancement opportunities are available, which is always something to strive for."
good,"A typical day as a Courtesy Clerk at Costco consisted of assisting registers or cleaning up aisles while gathering spare boxes for members. I certainly learned how to multitask, being assigned to multiple lanes at once, running items back while grabbing new ones, there was never a time that I could just sit and relax other than breaks. Everyone was determined to do their job and were encouraging others to do the same. The hardest part of the job was during rush hours when members (customers) would catch you in the middle of something and ask you for intensive help while you were already on a short runback or something of the sort. The most enjoyable part of the job was not having to worry about ""looking like I was doing something,"" there was never a boring moment on the front end."
good,"Every day was new day, new products to display, new members to impress. This was my first retail job and they require the absolute best every day.  This job pushed me a lot."

good,Buen ambiente de trabajo trato respetuoso y amigable
good,Costco is quite the popular warehouse for merchandise and can get very crowded most times. It's requires constant focus to stay ahead of tasks and production is always being made to avoid any complaints.
good,"As soon as I was introduced to my coworkers they immediately put me to work. You have no time to do of anything other than work. Although the work seem never ending, the employees always seem happy. The managers always make sure you know what you have to do and do it proficiently."
good,great benefits. good pay for job that didn't require a college degree. high ceiling with corporate. everyone gets to interview with a job they put in for.
good,It was an amazing job as a student because there were pay increases each summer and flexible hours for students. I also was able to keep my job each summer even though I left for school during the school year.
good,A typical day at work was rushing to get customers their items or carts to the entrance but at all times running. I learned to always be in a rush and help customers the fastest way possible. The hardest part of the job was pushing the amount of cars they required for long hours. The most enjoyable part was helping customers.
good,"It was an excellent place to work if you didn't have a career focus, were in school, needed a part time job or really enjoyed retail and sales in the consumer field. It paid well though"
good,Learned a lot about customer service. Got great cashier experience and the staff was very warm and friendly. The hardest part was meeting sales quotas on executive membership upgrades.

good,"I learned about the merchandise and equipment at Costco, I had the opportunity to train on the forklift and skud. The overall workplace is super friendly, my co-workers and supervisors were awesome to work and talk with. Management was very understanding about scheduling around school hours. Most enjoyable part of my job is working with my hands, lifting and feeling satisfied with how much I worked."
good,This is a great company to work for early on in your career.  I started when I was in school and worked my way through college and then graduated to a new job.  Management was very flexible with schedules.  It is retail though so there were unruly customers to deal with.
good,"My typical day working at Costco was very busy always on my feet non stop work until i got off at my scheduled time. Working at Costco was only a seasonal job so i only had about 6 months of retail experience. I learned that working for this company specifically speed is what you need to do to keep the front end moving getting our members out of line in a nice orderly fashion with no issues once so ever. Working fast was not what i was expecting working retail but the more days i worked with Costco i learned pretty quick. Management treated me like the way every boss should treat you no matter where your currently working for, they were always working hard just as we were the one quality that i really appreciated was that when you needed an extra hand or an opinion on something that our members wanted they knew what the right answer was exactly.  The hardest part working at Costco was after a long day of work getting up and moving for the next long hard working day was tough for me my body was getting used to moving around all the time being on my feet from clock in time till clocking out time. The most enjoyable part about working for Costco was that i was following into my fathers shoes one day i want ton be just like him."
good,Costco is well known for it's multiple advancement options offered to it's staff based on their cultural value to promote from within which is great for their employees. This leads to a good overall motivation from their staff and also helps the process of making employees adopt your cultural values.

good,"This is a great job. While management isn't always the best, overall they are nice to work with. As long as you do a good job management recognizes it and will take care of you."
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed working at Costco. The management was better than most places and my co-workers where great people. The company made sure that we were taken care of."
good,This was a great summer job that I learned about organization and great customer service with a variety of types of people everyday. This job also taught me about managing highly tense situations and how to prioritize problems in the workplace.
good,Supervisors are supportive. Managers are willing to work alongside you. Good climate and atmosphere to work in. The people are friendly and helpful and take time out of their schedules to support you.
good,I learned how to be quick at a register at this job. Manegment at this job was pretty good. customers were very rude but something you deal with in every day life.
good,"Help load items into carts. Help cashiers. "
good,"The job varied in pace, mostly due to the randomness of population inside the store at certain days. The people are mostly nice, but the management was sub par."
good,I loved working there. The staff are all very friendly. It is a great work environment. It is a very fast paste job. Customer service is incredible.
good,Hazlet was old and needs new blood. Employees are set in their ways. Management are not on the same page. It got old. Employees were getting nasty with each other
good,I mainly work in the bakery but I sometimes bounce to other departments. During the busy seasons the time goes by fast and I work with enjoyable people so the holiday season is the best time of the year to work in my opinion. The management at Costco is very good. People pay to shop there so the company has to keep a good reputation which comes from good management. The hardest part of my job was getting used to things and staying at a very fast pace. The most enjoyable part is the nice customers that recognize how busy you stay in the baker.
good,The trainers and co-workers are very helpful. Hardest part of the job was learning the software. But it was so much fun learning and being part of the team.
good,While working here you learn a lot about how to treat the members of Costco. also there are many positions in which I have done where you use other qualities in order to work.
good,I was a part time employee and always treated well. Was compensated well and enjoyed being at work. the managers were very helpful and you never felt threatened to ask questions. they were very reasonable with my work schedule
good,"Good place to work. Busy environment, fast pace. Great benefits. Training and great job advancement  for those willing to put the work in to learn and grow."
good,Costco Wholesale is a terrific place to work. I have learned many different skills but most important of them all is commitment. The hardest part of the job is waking up at 4am
good,"A typical day at work here would mostly depend on the department you worked in. For example, I was employed as a front end assistant but I also had knowledge of how to work in the food court. With just these two positions, I was able to cashier, help other cashiers, work the entrance and exit doors, push carts, and serve and prepare food in the food court. I learned how to work quickly and efficiently here as well as sharpen my multitasking skills. The only complaint I've ever had while working here was the management. Not all of the managers were strict, but there were a select few who really liked to give me a hard time, to which I never found out why. I was not a favorite and that had nothing to do with my work ethic or job performance. I was a very hard worker and my efforts were often taken advantage of and under appreciated. "

good,"I loved working at Costco. I worked beginning in management than moved to every department that they had. I learned how every part of the business works from stocking to sales, inventory control, management, and financial books. The most enjoyable thing about the job was learning new things. When the learning stopped I had to move on to learning something new. I left to continue my education and start a new path of learning that will hopefully take me to my next 25 years"
good,I liked working for costco every body i worked with were happy people shopping is always good. management is there for you when ever you need.I don't have to much more to say about working with costco.

good,"The attitude is general really great at Costco. However, since they promote from within it seems like some people are very lost or don't know how to manage people or departments so it gets a little frustrating as an employee. But overall, co-workers are always kind and as long as you show up and do your job, it's generally easy and you get great pay."
good,I was given decent hours and a decent pay for the work that I did.  the people around me were great and I enjoyed the time i worked their and the people i worked for.

good,a busy day at work where I learn to be initiative with the work that the crew cannot handle. I meet assigned task on time with cooperation with other coworkers. My coworkers are in need of leadership where I sometime take over and the hardest part of the job is where coworkers does not cooperate when its busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is when preparing the menu to serve because its quiet at that time.
good,"Very busy location. Flagship of the bay area and corporate headquarters in the area. Typical day, even the slowest of the week is a hustle gig from start to finish where 100% is required of all employees and management."
good,"The typical day at work was filled with lots of responsibilities. I learned how to polish floors, work in the food court and cashier for the front end. The management was very firm and tried to be good leaders for all the employees. Since Costco is a big warehouse and there are many different types of people, not everyone got along but we were all able to put aside differences. The most enjoyable part was meeting some lifelong friends."
good,"Great co-workers and benefits along with pay, fast paced environment and on feet all day. Paid holidays was a great benefit as well."
good,Great place to work. Could have better Managers. Great opportunities to move up in the company. Good employees to work with.
good,"Employees are extremely nice and helpful as well as the managers."
good,management was great and enjoy my time with the company. A safe and secure place to work and conduct business. Co-workers are easy to get along with and we work as a team. I enjoy all my time with the company. I will go back anytime they need me.
good,the store requires shift work for the needs of the business however it is crazy some departments how they require a close open close open .
good,"I really enjoy working with my co workers and costumers, everyone's really friendly and helped each other out."
good,"I really love to work at Costco, my only concern is the schedule and the management, my co workers are great.Benefits are really great."
good,"COSTCO was a great place to work. It was fast paced. Many of my co-workers were easy to deal with, but there were a few that were allowed to slack and not complete their work, which left that responsibility on the hard-workers.... that was the most difficult thing about the job."
good,"Costco is a great place to work with good advancement, they have competitive salary and benefits, however it is difficult to maintain a full time position working in administration at Costco. I have learned how to work in an office environment, how to pay bills, audit sales, and work in the vault. My co workers are very pleasant people, the hardest part of my job is having to help out on the front end and pack groceries. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to fix mistakes and solve problems."
good,"If you work mornings, no matter how organized you are, be prepared to work quickly, stress, and get everything stocked within 4 or 5 hours. Be ready to get to work at either 4 or 5 in the morning.Time will fly by; which is good and bad. Everyone around is generally good tempered, yet in the mornings everyone is stressed to get their work completed. Benefits are great no matter if you are part-time or full. Pay gradually increases over time. The more hours you work per week will impact your pay raises. Opportunities for advancement come often, more-so for evening positions."
good,"They are the best in their products and their service, they are dynamic in nature and well organised. Moreover they are having employee discounts and breaks. The management is cooperative and the work ethics is friendly."
good,There was never a dull moment working at Costco.  Any down time was always filled with helping out others throughout the warehouse.  Down side of the job was never having a consistent work schedule and usually never getting to be able to have dinner with my family and put my kids to bed.  Many of the members shopped there on a weekly basis so you got to know many people which made for good relationships with the people you are there to provide great customer service to!
good,My fellow co workers are amazing!! Very physical and fast paced job.If you like early mornings this is the place for you!
good,"store filler and customer services."
good,It is a fun environment to work in. You get to meet new people. The warehouse i am at there is no chance for you to grow or advance because they have their favorites
good,"god job, very productive"
good,"Cosco is an interesting place to work, however they are not able to provide me with sufficient amount of hours. Carrier growth is too slow and when you transfer to another branch you have to start from the bottom, because you are losing your seniority."
good,"Costco is a great stable company to work for with amazing hardworking employees. There is constant work throughout the week and double the amount on weekends, which I thrive on. The management are a bit oppressive but they do try their best to have employment meetings often to better improve our working environment. "
good,"Pour faire simple, le seul hic a cette emploi est le fait que je n'ai pas vraiment eu de training et j'ai vraiment du me débrouiller pour apprendre avec les outils donner. (prendre note que oui j'ai eu un training, mais la personne qui me montrais l'emplois a vraiment fait cela vite et a oumis plusieurs choses importante)"
good,Very helpful and the managers take care of their employees. Co-workers provide an excellent support and the experience is incredible.
good,"Starting my day at 5:45 in the morning with some clothes stocking and stacking, then moving to Domestics whereb I folded towels and stocked  various different items for the sales shelf. I learned different ways to fold towels and I learned how to use a Pallet hand Jack. The mamagement was very helpful and willing to teach me everything I needed to know to complete the task. The hardest part of the job was staying awake so early in the morning. The best part was having Supervisors acknowledge your work and let you know that they appriciate how well you"
good,"I learned how to load and unload trailers full of merchandise, Always kept a clean and safe work environment. Co-Workers were always more than welcome to help and to answer any questions. I liked that you were always learning something new so that your job was more interesting and you could help where help was needed. I couldn't say that there was any hard part in the job, but if I had to choose, it would just be making sure loads were going out on time when we were extremely busy."
good,"Costco has some of the best employers I've had the pleasure working for.  As a union setting, co-workers and members of seniority become a tight-knit community always looking out for one another's best interests.  Once employed, hard workers can easily be promoted within and often become life-long employees."
good,Convivios cada mes posada cada diciembre con rifas e regalos motivaciones para los empleados con un bono extra cada mes
good,Costco was a nice place to work only the pay is low and it takes at least 5 years to get a full-time position. So you will be working for a while.
good,"Costco takes care of their employees better than most fortune 500 companies out there. Good people to with. Strong emphasis on member satisfaction, sometimes a little over the top. Great place to earn a living and support a family."
good,I worked in merchandising and would start at four in the morning.  I learned to pace my workload and to operate a fork lift.  Management was good and I had interesting co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was it's physical nature.  I enjoyed being able to work in many different areas the most.
good,"As a company we effectively manage large amounts of incoming members and phone calls. Both my coworkers and managers work to identify and assess customers’ needs to achieve satisfaction. We work hard to engage with each member to build a sustainable relationships of trust through open and interactive communication. We do this by handling any and all complaints, provided by each member with appropriate solutions and alternatives within the company's limits and follow up to ensure resolution. As the membership representative we keep records of customer shopping interactions, process customer accounts and file documents. We accomplish all of this by following communication procedures, guidelines and policies that a allow us to go the extra mile to reach customers satisfaction."
good,"Loved my coworkers like family, however management seemed distant and uninvolved in my position. Multiple employees were transferred over to this location resulting in zero open permanent positions for seasonal employees, which was disappointing."
good,it a veryfun place to work and pay rate is really good. it is very flexible and you can work the hours you want too. the people and staff are very friendly. you meet so really nice people.

good,"Workload was heavy at this job.  Very busy and packed throughout the work day.  The breaks were long, the work was strenuous."
good,Costco helped me to grow both as a professional as well as an individual. Working at Costco during my undergraduate career helped grow a variety of skills and helped me gain knowledge which allowed me to further succeed in school. Costco was very accepting of me as a student and allowed me to take time off when I needed to study for mid-terms as well as final exams.
good,"Great place to learn and grow, keep in mind0 member service is #1 goal. If you don't communicate well with others not a job for you. Overall great experience."

good,been at Costco for almost a year and so far so good. however the shifts all all over the place. close till 10pm then open at 6 then a mid day shift. its hard to plan around in advance the hours are not bad guaranteed 25 hours a week as a new hire but can get up to 40 going from department to department

Conocí un poco mas madrid, aprendi sobre la ideosincracia madrileña, conoci lo que no quisiera si tendria un negocio propio. Mis jefes directos no tienen claro como llegar a los objetivos que impone la gerencia. Mis colegas todos un profesionales de las ventas y muy buenas personas para trabajar en equipo. Lo mas dificil fue vender un producto que nadie conoce, que no o puede ver sino por internet pero que fisicamnete aun no esta terminado y de paso hay que pedir el dinero de la afiliacion por adelantado. Lo mas agradable fue conocer nuevas personas y haber hecho buenas relaciones con los clientes futuros socios"
good,This was an after highschool job for me but I enjoyed it very much. It was a very friendly environment and we all worked well as a team. Management had a good handle on the operation and made sure everything ran smoothly and efficiently.

good,The typical working day start at 4:00 AM which began with a walk through the assigned area. Manager informed you as to what needed to done. You learned a lot of methods and ways that is safer and easy to apply.  The hard part of the job is massive pressure and lack of time to accomplished those task.  The most enjoyable part of the job is completing the day task.
good,"High tempo customer service. Holidays are days off, and time-and-a-half on Sundays. There is always something to do. Great company culture!"
good,"The bakery is fast paced, and focused on teamwork.  It is a fun environment, but demands production. The bakery is always busy, but that guarantees consistent hours."

good,"I drive in cars and lift them on the lifts. Take the tires off and replace them with either new or used tires. After I change the tire I balance them. Before I put them back on the vehicle I check if the hub is clean then I put them on. After I finish putting the wheel on I ask a Tire Lead to check my work before I drive the vehicle out. I have worked on a variety of vehicles like duel wheelers, sprinter vans, trucks, and cars. What I have learned from working in the tire shop is that communication with your colleagues is really important to get the job done. I learned that in everyone in the shop plays an important role in order to be efficient. My co-workers make the shop a fun environment to be in. I can look forward to going to work because my colleagues are really fun to be around. The hardest part of working in the tire shop would be working on the duel wheelers. the most enjoyable part of the job would be working with my co-workers."
good,"I have worked for the company for ten years.  It is growing exponentially.  Getting on board is really hard but worth the struggle."
good,"Working at Costco was fairly rewarding. Compensation was fairly high, considering the work was very easy and demanded little. Benefits are fairly high as well, even for college students, considering the work done. Management was great at my location, though other locations that I have visited have seemed less than ideal. Customers were usually easy to manage and please. Not a whole lot of negatives working here, unless you are looking for quick advancements."

good,"cash handling, customer service, food preparation, prep work, maintaining a clean environment, filing, great company to work for with great benefits."
good,"Costcco's creation of the code of ethics (policies and procedures) has given co-workers a healthier work environment and a warm welcoming environment to members and shareholders and the respect they deserve. The educational videos give a clearer understanding of human nature, strengths and weaknesses. Unlike other companies, Costco or management treats their employees fairly and rewards them accordingly."
good,"Worked with members on a daily basis. Management rotated, so you could always find someone on your side. Co-workers could become friends for life."
good,"Costco Wholesale offers the best benefits for its employees that a corporation can provide. They understand how important their employees are for the company's daily operations thus offering the best benefits is a key factor to motivate employees to work. In addition, compensation at this company is very fair as well."
good,"I worked as a merchandiser, stocking pallets with items up to 90lbs. Was a very fast paced environment, stocked pallets with in a three minute time frame. I also helped out at the front end of the store with putting the customers stuff into the carts on average one customer every minute. Management was very good, they treated every employee equally.

good,"A busy and wholesale focused retail environment. "
good,"la relación entre todo el personal durante mi vida laboral en costco fue muy buena, siempre existió muy buena colaboracion"
good,"Costco is rated as one of the best places to work. They have excellent benefits such as health insurance, worker investment compensation, sick/vacation leave, etc. As well as the opportunity for growth and advancement. There are pros and cons to any work environment, and I tend to focus on the good things. The work can be hard and fast paced at times, and the concrete floor is unforgiving to your legs, feet and back. That being said there are great people who work there and great products to stand behind. They have set the standard for return policies around the nation, making it almost mandatory to accept and return items if you are unhappy with the product you have purchased. There are a number of managers that you work under, and on a good day they were great...but everyone has bad days. Sometimes to get the job done quickly I had witnessed some shady or unsafe workplace habits being practiced. Not everyone can handle the pressure of timelines and high volume as well as others. Most of my memories for working there are positive and would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a serious team oriented job to consider working there. You MUST be flexible, open minded and professional to succeed in this company. I still stay in contact with friends I have made while working there and recommend Costco as a shopping destination for products to this day."

I learned how to be social with others and relate to customer needs. The management was very energetic and caring. Co-workers were very social and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was learning new department that were unfamiliar to me. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my peers. Mostly everyone there were young students which made the job pleasant to work for.
good,"A typical day at work in Costco is a busy one. Running back and forth returning or bringing items that members no longer wanted or wanted. It is a fast paced job. Costco is one of the busiest jobs but it is also an enjoyable atmosphere. I learned to be quick at Costco. Being a Cashier Assistant, I had to be quick in returning cold products to the freezers and make it back to help the cashier speed up the process of ringing members. The co-workers at Costco we're friendly and nice to work with. The most difficult part of the job would be cashiering or assisting during the rush hours. Even considering the most difficult part of the job, it was very enjoyable for the most part."
good,"Les cadres de l entreprise sont tout a fait remarcables dans l ensemble, il existe une vraie volonte de l entreprise de developper tous les colaborateurs. seul inconvenient, il ne faut pas vraiement avoir de vie sociale en dehors de costco , c est compliquer..."
good,My job is to bring in members for the warehouse. The easiest part of the job is to make sure that I take care of the members. The golden rule of the company is to take care of the member.
good,"Though most of my time was spent cleaning, maintaining, and crafting food items in the deli, my position could be shifted on short notice depending on where I may be needed in the store.  I feel that my supervisors were always very informative and effective in their tasks, and teach their employees well enough so that they are always prepared and ambitious to beat their daily goals.  I learned how to quickly be where needed, and methods to adapt quickly.  Questions were welcomed by all managers and members, making an easy to learn work environment.  The most difficulty was meeting extra high demands, more often than not, due to holiday traffic and sales.  Hard work, but with the end of every day a feeling of accomplishment.  Most of all I enjoyed the quick pace, making time fly by."
good,it was fun interacting with people sometimes seeing their insight in things. was not hard they would help you if you needed help
good,"This job takes quite the impact on your body if you are a front end assistant since you may have to move carts then move right onto merchandising after 5 hours of lot. The management tries to intimidate you for no reason what so ever, that may be a drawback but the pay is decent with a starting of $12/hr."
good,"Assist Cashier - Pack customer's cart or box"
good,"Costco is the epitome of wholesalers in general, good place to work for and the chance to meet many different characters"

good,"Typical day: kind of the repeated threw out the week same stuff "
good,Costco Wholesale is designed to be a very good company.The owner had a vision to be the best at offering the lowest prices on wholesale merchandise to its consumers and i believe he has done that.

good,I regular day at Costco is me engaging with members on a constant base. making sure that all their needs are met and that customer satisfaction is provided.
good,A typical day at work would consist of me doing my job to the best of my abilities. At the end of the day I would learn something new whether a new skill or a life lesson. Managers are professional and respectful and coworker are responsible and friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with individuals that are not motivating nor respectful. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a positive environment with great people that help you strive in life.
good,"Though I did enjoy the company of many employees there - I never did not like anybody at Costco - I must say that working the Graveyard shift (which typically started at 3 am to 9 am) certainly took its toll on me, both physically and mentally. Every shift consisted of me lifting 50 lb rice bags, which put a great strain on my back; and due to the time that such shifts occurred, I often would find myself asleep in bed throughout the day."
good,"Typically I would show up and perform any task that the managers needed done. I was never confined to just one area for a full work day which was great because variety helps me stay energized. The managers were good, they always kept it professional but they seemed too busy or annoyed to answer questions at times. Very understandable considering the amount of customers that come to Costco during peak hours and holidays. The hardest part of the job was getting to know all the employees since we are dealing with a huge warehouse. The most enjoyable part was the variations of jobs I was assigned to. No matter how tedious tasks got, it always kept things interesting."
good,"a typical day at work would be tidying up the store all day."

good,"Great company, great values"
good,"Working at Costco was an overall good experience with good benefits and pay. I enjoyed working there despite the hard work I put in almost every day. There was a lot of cart pushing and running around the store to get items customers forgot or couldn't find. Costco sticks to a strong ""members first"" attitude and they made sure we went above and beyond to make customers happy. I liked almost everyone I worked with, and made a few good friends during my time working there. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got to talk to people when I worked as a greeter at the front door. The reason I had to leave was because they would not allow me 4 days off so I could go to California. I had this vacation planned the year before I worked at Costco and I had already paid for air fare and other expenses, so unfortunately I had to part ways with Costco."
good,"Working with high energy people"

Cleaning, filling pamphlets, assisting in other departments that need help due to call offs or departments getting busy. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I meet so many new people on a daily schedule."
good,I have been working  in my warehouse for over 10 years. People don't stay at a company that treats them poorly. Costco has the lowest employee turnover in the industry. I do appreciate what I have especially in an economy like this one.
good,"I work hard love to make people happy, I learned how to work with co workers and help understand management work.  costco was one of the hardest job of my live but ill love to go back "
good,I usually worked nights after the store closed and I would clean all of the meat cutting machines. If I worked during the day I would wrap all of the meat and put it out on the floor.
good,"My day would begin with making sure that the displays were looking okay before the store opened, checking on the cashiers to make sure they had enough change and cash, making sure all front line staff were accounted for and plans in place for standby, ensure that orders were forthcoming, handling all customer and staff queries on spot. Generating ideas on how best to boost sale and in store marketing. "
good,Costco is a great company that will survive no matter how the economy is. I have worked there for 10 yrs and love working here. The pay is great compared to other retail jobs. 
good,"      During the course of business at Costco I am not only working on my register but also focused on all of the members in the store. Weather it is helping them find what they are looking for or helping answer any questions they have. At the register my job is to check the member out and try to up sale them on the promotions all the while giving the member the most attentive and helpful service I can so that they have an enjoyable experience. "
good,A typical day of Costco is simply helping in any way you can. Everyone is friendly and your job can change from day to day.
good,"My work schedule for the Holiday season was over night 9pm-5am shift. "
good,I was only a seasonal employee but i enjoyed the job and respect the company about its professionalism 
good,"Worked on an overnight shift that picked customer orders using pallet jacks, electric pallet jacks, and forklifts. I learned how to work in a fast paced company and work as a team to get the job done. It was fun working with a variety of races and genders and I enjoyed working here."
good,"I started at Costco in the corporate deli department as a cashier. I was quickly promoted to menu planner and menu development. Responsibilities included opening and closing procedures, bookkeeping, cooking and training new employees."
good,"Great Opportunity for advancement, Great Staff, Great Safety Measures"
good,good place to work. co-workers helpful. schedules not static always
good,stocking and helping customers
good,"opportunity to work on team building, how to lead people, and how to deal with customer service."
good,It was a great job to have while I was turning my life around completely.
good,"Casual atmosphere, fast pace, high volume. Outstanding customer service provided."
good,"Working at Costco was very fast paced, something I really enjoyed. Never any down time, always something to do. My manager treated everyone fairly and made it a pleasant work enviornment. The staff really worked together as a team to make our department shine."
good,"working at Costco is good, the work is not too demanding. The staff is very friendly and professional. I learned to work as a team, I learned to work with the public and i learned how to manages my time. the difficult parts in this type of jobs are the hours of work. Finishing late almost everyday can messes up the social life but if you get to drive a forklift, the experience become even better despite the responsibilities that come with it."
good,The owner of this business know what she wanted when she hired me. She was very specific which made my work easier. The final results was over 30% increase in traffic in 6 months.
good,"Costco starts off their employees at $11.00 and your pay moves up from there based on hours worked. Even part time employees can get full benefits and the benefits are some of the best in the industry. I pay $32/month for pretty much everything and it's not skimpy coverage. Wisdom teeth surgery was paid in full and most prescription co-pays come out to 10 cents per pill. The main reason I took off a star for compensation is that they make it very difficult to get a full-time position, and employees with more seniority will almost always be given preference. It doesn't matter what your education level is or how well you perform. I often find myself giving pointers to supervisors who are promoted over me because of their seniority. This is counter-intuitive and unfair to the most competent employees. One more thing: tips are not allowed. If they catch you accepting a tip from a member, even if the member insists, they can fire you over it."
good,"From the first day, the members of the bakery welcomed me with opened arms and taught me the basics and what it took to work at the busiest Costco location in the area. Throughout my time there, the team encouraged me every day to take on a new challenge, complete a task just a little bit faster, or just compliment me on a job well done. I was saddened by my short time working there, but all were very gracious for my help during the crazy holiday season."
good,"Costco is a great place to work. They pay well, they treat their members and employees well."
good,This was my 2nd job while I was in high school. Great place to work for the first time.
good,Good company to work for. Enjoyed the people and friends that I made over the years working here. Overall great experience with this organization.
good,"Work at a very fast pace during christmas time,"
good,"after working there for almost 3 years I've picked up more than one new skill such as dealing with bakery machinery, forklift training, and organized stocking and rotation"
good,helping members and giving the best customer service enjoyed working here
good,"fun environment. always doing something, never a dull moment. very face paced. one on one customer service."
good,"Early hours, (5-10 am)"
good,Costco was a fantastic place to work and loved it completely.
good,works with school schedule
good,"Customer Service was key in my day to day activity. I performed under strict time restraints and never faultered. I learned that my customer service skills as well as my rapport with my co-workers was ultimately the reason for my success with the company. The hardest part of the job was trying to understand the Warehouse as a whole, but it was also the most enjoyable part of what I did."
good,A typical day at costco would be me cleaning around the warehouse and moving 80 pound boxes.
good,"es agradable el trabajo pero de repente puedes llegar a ser rutinario y si no hay una motivación , un buen hecho por lo demás esta muy bien"
good,"they always treat you with respect, i learn a lot in the time i was there..managers always find the way to help you when u in need..."
good,I honestly can say Costco was the best job i've ever held. The employees were all treated fairly and with respect. We had dependle schedules and shifts. I felt safe within those walls.
good,"come in, make sure everything is neat and orderly. i learned how to package and how to clean and maintain a healthy working area. The managment was flexible with hours. Co workers where nice. hardest part was sometimes learning new and interesting things."
good,I really enjoyed working for Costco but I ended up leaving Costco to enlist in the military.
good,"As soon as I would get to work I start work. I learned how to push my customer service skills to a farther level. My supervisor was great. She would come out of no where and get you pumped to sell some sales. There was nothing hard about the job except to get the sales scores up. It's like a competition, but in a good way. The thing I loved most about the job was that one my first day not only did my fellow coworkers make me feel welcomed, but also the other coworkers on the different sides of Costco. I really want to have the chance to work there again. Why I am not is because my transportation was stolen from where I used to live."
good,"their college program allows you to keep your job, while you pursue your academic goals. Doesn't get any better than that"
good,"great co-workers and customers. great hours, loved the benefits."
good,"Good company with good benefits i enjoyed working here. There were good teams, nice working environment."
good,"I've worked here going on a year. For the most part (90%) I've enjoyed the staff, and members."
good,Overall a great place to work. Gained learning and experience for my next future job. Best job I have ever had. The managers were all very nice and professional to employees and members.
good,A very fast paced work place. Working evenings and nights are a must. If possible start working for them when you are young and it will be a very good courier for you.
good,"Great place to work, great people, and great benefits. You are always doing different things. You get to interact with a lot of awesome people day to day."
good,"Costco was a great company to work for.  The people were wonderful, the pay and benefits were adequate.  There was plenty of opportunity to move and advance and made a great place to have a career."
good,They are always open to teach you more if you show your willing to learn. the coworkers are friendly and most the managers are nice and approachable. their good at working with you if you are sick or have a family emergency. room for growth.
good,Managers are willing to work alongside staff and listen to work place issues and respond correctly. Experienced co-workers are more than willing to help. More than enough room to grow personally and inside the company structure. Excellent benefits and opportunities.
good,"Costco Wholesale is a great place to work. It's difficult but rewarding. On busy days there's never a chance to stand still. There's many different positions available that are suitable for many different kinds of people from those who like interacting with members as they shop to those who would prefer to keep their head low prepping food or stocking freight. The atmosphere is friendly and the company takes care of its employees. The hardest part of the job is managing seniority. When an employee first starts, whatever schedule is needed is the schedule employees are scheduled for. "
good,"I enjoy working there with my fellow coworkers, and enjoy interacting with my daily members.  The hardest part of the job is when non members use someone else's membership and you have to calmly explain to them why memberships are non transferable.  But you just have to get through it in a positive way and continue to do your job as best as possible.  The most enjoyable part is working with a team that you can rely on to help improve your performance, or just simply work with, as a team."
good,"The employees at Costco are paid well for their time. The work culture there is professional, and provides an atmosphere where employees exceed the standards. The majority of the supervisors and up lead by example enabling employees down the chain to improve and positively impact the every day job and the member's shopping experience and perception of the business."
good,"Great job just be ready to be on your toes and be able to lift heavey items regularly, great managers and supervisors, always willing to help or show how to thing correctly"
good,"La cultura laboral es excelente sin duda mucho que aprender a nivel profesional y personal, en Costco su cultura se convierte en parte de ti."
good,"Between there great benefits and flexibility, I would say that Costco is say that it is a great company to work for. I work at the Egan location as a seasonal employee and they had great employee atmosphere. They are very flexible when it comes to time off and managers are always willing to help you out. All in all, I would say that working at Costco was enjoyable place to work."
good,"You are treated equal at Costco, everyone takes turns bringing carts in even the managers. You are never forced to stay after your scheduled shift. Costco is also very flexible with hours for students."
good,"I worked part time in the evenings restocking.  It's a fairly straight forward position and requires you to put in the effort to get the work done.  You'll have folks that like to laze around. Ignore them and put in the work, apply for other positions in the company, and get your rotations in if you're looking long term."
good,"I worked the Orillia outlet, which was busy, but not CRAZY busy (Barrie store). I am compelled to differentiate because I even found shopping at the Barrie store quite stressful: it can be crowded & eclectic. The retail work itself is busy but enjoyable. Customers pay a membership fee--hence, they are generally very considerate."
good,"You work for your paycheck and benefits which are stellar for the kind of work."
good,Costco has great benefits and job security friendly environment fast paced .members are their top propriety theres room for growth also when you reach a certain level the pay is great.
good,"On a typical day in the front end, the work is varied and fast paced. Management is built on varying levels, allowing many facets of the job to be handled in a timely manner."
good,Started at 10:30 p.m. busy like assembly line Non-Stop work. Sometimes we could even take our breaks right away cuz we were so busy and had me on schedule everything on time adjust 7 in the morning sometimes overtime very hectic
good,"It was very easy to know what you needed to do, due to the fact that at least one manager was near the time card area, and they would tell you which job you were to do, whether it be pulling carts or helping a cashier. The hardest part of the job was the many hours of standing."
good,Learned to Cashier and to assist for other cashiers. I also learned how to check reciepts at the door and how to keep count on the entrance door. All in all great place.
good,"Un lugar donde puedes obtener grandes conocimientos de servicio al cliente, atención y apegado a las necesidades financieras que necesitas."
good,"they are pretty cool place... kinda childish sometimes a lot of the people have been working there for sometime so everybody is basically family their which is cool. i'll miss the fresh fruit mondays and bbq they do, they really keep you fed."
good,"wonderful people to work with, learn a lot of procedures on food safety, a lot of hours to make at any time of the day. excellent benefits and salary."
good,"The pay and benefits were great, fellow employees were nice and management were kind and understanding. The fast paced and go go nature and constant interaction with customers was too much for me though"
good,"A day at Costco can be great, to say the least, or a little stressful depending on the department you are placed. Working in the bakery is the perfect fit for me, given the lower stress demands of the bakery & we are only worrying about our department. Our manager is an intense manager but a great person who is understanding and will do anything to see you succeed. The Higher-Ups are also very warming and welcome the more they see you being productive at my warehouse in Northwest Vaughan. Overall, Costco is the best place a university student can look into for jobs and a stable income."
good,I liked working with good people around me and Costco was pretty good experience.  I learned how to work FAST around holidays  and it dont matter what is going on outside of the work area...inside we was a great team to work with
good,Great place for money and benefits Costco treats all employees equal pretty cool place to work free membership card and lot of different places you can apply within in the company
good,costco a de tres bon défis et plusieurs poste d'avancement et travail d'equipe bon environnement avantage sociaux bon choix d'heure de travail bon reer
good,fun place to work and meet new people and help out the customers  and the place is a clean and friendly I also likes that it is easy to talk to the managers and they listen
good,Fun fast paced work environment. Great employee benefits. Free Executive Membership for employees and three family members. Growing company. Can make Costco into a career.
good,"Costco is a great place to work if you're willing to work hard. It pays well and gives a lot of hours, even if you're part time. Furthermore, they were very willing to work with my schedule as a student which was a major benefit. However, it's extremely challenging work. So I don't recommend applying if you're looking for an easy job to relax at."
good,Worked 8 hours a day and is a fast paced workplace.I enjoyed meeting people and working with different vendors. Had a very good working relationship with the vendors. Was given opportunity to train other employees with my knowledge of my job and overall work experience.
good,There was a lot of management issues at some of the locations but the pay is competitive and the benefits are really hard to beat. Overall working at costco is worth it.
good,You are able to branch out to different departments if you feel that you want to be more challenged or want to try something new. Always a great place to move up in the business either in store or at a different location.
good,"I enjoyed working at Costco. There were times that it was difficult since the hours are typically 2-10:30 pm (if you've worked there for a while it is possible to get better hours) and overall it was not the career choice for me, but they provide many excellent opportunities for employees, decent pay (time and a half on Sundays), and they give benefits to part-time as well as full-time employees. I especially loved the atmosphere and the sense of community."
good,"The environment working there is great, the members are welcoming and treat you as well as they would family. The business treats their employees with care and only thrives to make each employee and great as they can be. THere are many different departments that can be chosen to fit your work and life style best."
good,"I would recommend  Costco to anyone looking for a career. The benefits are good, they start you out at a good wage and raises are steady as long as you show up and work hard."
good,Great place to work . Just do your job and you will do just fine. management is great takes care of employees in the fairest way possible.  Promoted from the inside.
good,"Management is hit and miss with pharmacy unfortunately.  I didn't learn much about actual pharmacy, you're really just a walking/talking pill counting machine as a tech.. The respect is minimal, only thing worth it is Costco takes pretty decent care of their employees."
good,I view Costco as one of the few organizations that has a significant level of career advancement opportunity for employees that have some or no post secondary education. They do all promotions from within the company and provide great benefits for even part time employees.
good,"fast paced work, fun co-workers, organized/responsive management, plenty of work to be done. The main thing that was draining in my experience was the high amount of customer interaction."
good,"Great place to work! Good management, frequent and helpful training, and decent scheduling. Very fast paced work environment, and very friendly workplace."
good,"On a typical day, I would clock-in at about 5:15 and would walk through my section to see what needs to be restocked and which new items came in and find paces for them based on the type, size or promotions the items had. Next, find the items needed to restock in the hardlines aisles and give those locations to the forklift drivers to have them dropped. Then, make all of my space and place and display the items as needed. Rewrap any pallets that were not finished, crush the empty cardboard, stack empty pallets and clean my section for the opening f the store at 10 am. While customers were in the store I would help them find what they needed, and straighten up behind them. Also, if cashiers were needed I would help out."
good,"Typically we have to provide security solutions to different businesses and they often don't want to consult the security team when required. Everyone comes at the last minute so most of the time we don't have work but when we do, it's with a tight deadline. The team is super awesome with most of them from a military background. You get to learn if you keep bugging everyone to allow you to shadow in their project."
good,The ability to interact with members was the most enjoyable part of the job.  Working with a diverse group of colleagues and building relationships was very valuable.  I would recommend the company for young individuals that are not pursing a higher education.
good,Overall a good company. Just alot of weekends and nights to meet the needs of the business. You can make a great career if you want to.Have to be flexible to open availability
good,The corporate culture tries to maintain the warehouse culture. The warehouse culture can and will be stressful but your coworkers help out a lot. Lots of employees are friendly and have great advice to help you out.
good,"if you want a lifetime job, it is perfect for you. But they aren't flexible with their working hours and they don't have anybody to replace you if you need to take a day off."
good,Great place to work if you are a hard working and are willing to learn. There is room for advancement if you put in the work. The company definitely takes care of it's employees
good,Very good work space and good people to work with. Loved my job but it just was time to for a change.l
good,"I would say this is a great first job for teens because the company in general treats their workers well. PTO, Health, Dental, Vision. Free turkeys on Thanksgiving, management providing lunches, and a drama free work place. I worked in the Las Vegas area for 2 years. I really loved it until a new set of management came in because a new store manager took over. My original higher ups left the store and relocated, couldn’t handle his craziness. New guys changed the whole work culture, so it really depends on who you’re working for. Other than that, I would say it was good. The pay could be better for certain jobs."
good,"I only worked there for a few months and it was a amazing experience, staff were extremely friendly and nice, they teach you how to do you're job right and they will do an assessment to let you know what you need to improve and what you are doing well; management is that you have multiple bosses so that's kind of weird to have but you eventually adjust, the hardest part is pushing the carts because one there is a lot of them and you have to bring them in as fast as possible, and if they dont scheduled enough cart pushers then some of the times you are alone and there are no carts in where you pick it up, also putting items in the cart cause you also need to be as fast as possible and you need to basically play tetris with the items to perfectly put them into place, that's the only difficult part; the most enjoyable part for me was working in electronics, I loved the environment and being around all that tech."
good,Ésta empresa es excelente en cuestión de prestaciones y horarios pero lamentablemente a veces los altos mandos tienen a sus empleados preferidos y los promueven a cada rato por encima de los que realmente se esfuerzan y trabajan mejor
good,I had a great time working at Costco. The long days would go by fast due to the work flow and how busy you are kept. Costco's Management and the coworkers you are placed along with are amazing and very welcoming to all. I would recommend this company to all.
good,Costco will take care of you and the experience you have working there will be great if you put some hard work in. They offer all sorts of benefits and assistance to their employees and the pay is good too. There absolutely will be days when it is hectic but that just comes with the sort of job it is.
good,je trouve que  c'est  une bonne place ou travaille
good,"Great company with a value on teamwork, and doing your part. Could be difficult to move up in company because people stay with the company. Lots of long tenure employees. 20 years+"
good,"Coming In, you'd think that everything is going well till you've been there for 2 years and realize no one is on the same level as you because they have their own going on. Overall good place to work. Members (not customers, they get mad) act very snobby so you have to compensate for that."
good,Working at Costco was a great experience for me.  I'm glad I had that opportunity. First week there and I was on  cashier duty.  I was hoping to be there by at least the 2nd or 3rd week there.  I flowed right into the job with everyone around me there to help when I needed it.  I hope to have the opportunity to be there again.
good,"Costco has a highly competitive salary, great benefits, and a friendly environment. However, the hours are long and busy. Waking up at 4:30 to go lift heavy items isn't ideal, but not all jobs there are that early or demanding"
good,"A good place to work if you get in. I have seen people move up in the company and stay there forever. Overtime is forbidden, but you get paid time and a half every sunday."
good,"I am really a contractor working inside of Costco stores, not a direct employee of them.  I work as a Product/Food Demonstrator/Sampler, it is a very regimented and somewhat detailed position, where part of ones personality and sale-ability come into play, to be able to sell the customer on the product, service or food."
good,"buenos jefes, algo de promocion para crecer laboralmente"
good,"I am currently in the student program at Costco, and it is amazing because they give me time to focus on my studies, however when I do work, it's usually over time. But you get a lot of money so there's a benefit!"
good,Starting your day at 2am is always a challenge and it sucks that you only get 5 hours a day. The opportunities to get more hours are always limited because always looking to cut on payroll.
good,"I loved Costco I was making way more than my peers in other companies and met many amazing people, the downside is for sure the heavy lifting plus hours spent on your feet. My body really took a toll and I could no longer continue after a none work related accident. I would recommend it if you love interacting with people and do not mind the physical labour."
good,"Costco hires and promotes within the company and goes based off of EXPERIENCE not how hard you work. So you may have someone that is not a good fit as a supervisor/manager that is more than likely promoted to upper managment only because of the years behind them rather than someone who is more qualified in work ethic but has less years in the company. Overall, great company. Having worked with more than one building, you realize that some buildings are filled with really badly trained managers/supervisors and it’s toxic but then you meet like 5 out 10 that are really cool and helpful when you need it. So it helps to remain positive as much as you can."
good,"A typical day includes receiving instructions from the supervisor and working as a team to complete the tasks. You learn about teamwork and time management. The culture is friendly, and the hardest part may be working with a lot of customers during rush hours otherwise it is enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed working in costco as tire installer but one thing I dont like is they dont have any specific job description, I applied as tire installer and they accepted me but when the tire shop has few costumer on that day they immediately transfer you to supermarket as cleaner, assistant to cashier and sometimes cart attendant. After the off season  they will tell you to stop working on the following month theyre not hiring you on permanent position but for seasonal and temporary position only"
good,There is not a lot of time for there to have any type of leeway when it comes to Costco. The environment is very crowded and fast-paced which makes it very anxious to get out of there as soon as possible.
good,"That's the only thing that makes it hard to advance. the seniority. Sometimes they use it sometimes they don't."
good,"Costco is like most marketing companys. the company is directed to allow customers to engage with the product and ask questions. They also become knowing the product. The environment is rugged with refrigeration and cold, however: with a lot of friendly workers and management."
good,"Lo que reconozco de la empresa es la capacitacion que se te da para tener un mejor trato al cliente, que es el enfoque mas importante que tiene la empresa"
good,"A day in my position its very charged because you have a lot to do! Financial Analytical program, make sure every product of every company are be show, etc"
good,I loved working for costco! They treat their employees great. Full and Part time employees get benefits. I was in school while working their and they were always willing to work on a schedule with me.
good,excellent company to work for. coworkers are pleasant. for the most part everything runs smoothly. the work environment is quick paced but not soul draining. overall working for Costco is pleasant. on the downside there is no room to move up unless you've been there for multiple years since seniority is weighed much more heavily than skill. full time positions are mainly reserved for those who have worked for the company a very long time. it's extremely difficult to get full time. the benefits are great and scheduling is flexible. the pay is good and Sundays are always time and a half. it's a safe and secure job to work at if you can manage to become a permanent employee.
good,"At Costco as a stocker, the day-to-day operations are physically demanding. The managers are great to work for and I enjoyed my position at Costco. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement as they hire from within."
good,The company was a good place  to work. It had good benefits.I worked a fixed shift. enjoyed working the staff. Have no bad things to say about my long term experience.
good,"Nice play to work very clean and calm.  Great environment "
good,Its a good place to work but being regular part time you don't get enough hour of work. People who work here are nice and cooperative and easy to talk.
good,En la empresa aprendimos a tratar bien al cliente y a poder relajarnos entre turnos.
good,"Excellent place to work, but pointlessly inflexible with regards to scheduling. They will not work around anything, and even if they can only give you the minimum 25 hours of work per week, you will work those 25 hours over five days at inconsistent times of the day. Other than that, for what it is it's great."
good,Costco treats their employees well and is true to its creed which is to provide world class service to their members. The best manager I have ever had has been at this company.
good,it is really hard to advance your pay in a short time for part timers. the do raises by how many hours that you have worked. it takes a long time to advance in the company. if you stick with it and make it work than it can be a great place to work.
good,Es una excelente empresa para trabajar. Ambiente de trabajo agradable.
good,"Was hired for technology sales due to past experiences, very accommodating if you want to go to college or university."
good,"For the amount of work you do the pay is really good, especially for an entry level job. With Night Merch your basic job is to keep the warehouse looking clean and organised during the day and restock items after the store closes. There's a number of different training opportunities such as forklift driving or various management positions. The management at the Costco I work at has been steadily gone downhill after the was a big shift in power. All of the coworkers get allow fairly well. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of leaving at night after you've stocked everything you possibly can and the store looks perfect."
good,I love working for Costco. It is a great place to work and amazing benefits. It also has so many great people that you get to know and build relationships with.
good,A typical day at work is active and fast-paced with excellent staff and positive working environment. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with a diverse range of friendly staff and always having new exciting things to do.
good,"Making sure our members are taken care of is the most important part of our daily job. We need to make sure product is available and easily accessible to our members. The work environment is quite enjoyable, very much like a family away from home. I'd say that is my most enjoyable part of the job. It makes it feel less like work. There is always something to do, and when it is busy we are required to prioritize order of importance for making our product on the sales floor accessible and tidy. Sometimes this can be hard because you are pulled in different directions, so learning to do one thing at a time is important, but can be hard to follow."
good,"A typical day in the kitchen would be doing the dishes, preparing the pizzas also serving people. It is a non stop job. The hardest part would be when it was only two workers and the dishes needed to be cleans and pizzas needed to be made but someone had to sit up front the whole time"
good,"Fast paced, good people, everyone is either seasonal or has been there forever. Competitive pay. There is not a lot of time to stand around and you must always be doing something because there is always something to do."
good,"This is a fair place to work, excellent benefits, a competitive environment. Quality products with satisfaction guaranteed. Convenience with available services."
good,I felt appreciated when I had health problems they offered me to apply for paid time off. The schedule was flexible with notice. The hardest part of the job is to please the management.
good,"Good place to work, you put in the hours and it's worth it in the end, the staff was really nice and the pay is good to start if you want to work there in the long term, also lots of position to choose from."
good,"I worked in the wireless phone part of costco, was not really for costco but was good, flexiable, great benefits, everybody was friendly always and always getting to see deals was a added bonus"
good,"Costco is a great company that will show you many innovative ways to how create a ""treasure hunt"" of products. Costco has the Costco way and is difficult to have them to anything out of the norm. They are a proven company that does very well for their shareholders."
good,clock in go to your workspace
good,it was a very nice company  with amazing benefits lots of people worked there part time because of the benefits the company offers and always room for growth if you work hard.
good,"If you get a job at Costco, consider yourself very fortunate. Good paying job, good benefits, paid time off, sick time. Every Sunday, you get paid time"
good,"I enjoyed working for Costco and they we generous with pay and benefits. They have plenty of room for advancement and will give training and experience opportunities to move up in the company.  "
good,"Très bonne compagnie pour faire carrière, avec de bons avantages sociaux et une sécurité d'emploi. De plus, les possibilités d'avancement avec la compagnie sont nombreuses, l'ambiance au travail est très bien. J'ai aimé mon expérience de marchandisage, ce que j'ai moins aimé, c'est qu'on occupe un poste différent de celui pour lequel on a appliqué durant la moitié du quart de travail et j'ai moins aimé cet aspect là."
good,"Empresa Mundial con buenos beneficios y un trato muy humano para sus trabajadores, un gran ambiente laboral. prácticamente todos los puestos son sencillos, prácticamente todo se trata de el servicio al cliente."
good,"Working at Costco entails very fast-paced and high-stress situations, but the employees and management are all part of a friendly, helpful, and collaborative team that is conducive to the best possible working conditions."
good,"based on seniority, very nice people that work there however if youre a male, be prepared to be used for very physical shifts. they would get me to lift heavy couches, fridges, tvs, etc but i didnt mind. have to bring in buggys at the end of each night and sometimes throughtout the day."
good,"retail environment except fast paced and in a warehouse setting. front end assisting can be back-breaking, and you do the same thing for hours."
good,demonstrating different food and products gave me comprehensive acknowledge about different products which are available at Costco. also this job really improve presentation skills and hospitality.
good,"This company offers lots of vacation and great benefits.  Once you pass your probationary period, you have great job security. "
good,A typical day as work is helping customers with what ever help was required. What i learned is that if keep going you will be rewarded. The management are to help you with all your needs and if you need someone to talk to. The workplace is a happy work place for everyone. The hardest part is keeping the members and management happy. The best part of the job is meeting and greeting the customers and making them feel welcome.
good,"Great company,  employees are treated well,  nice break room with TV, couches,  fridge coolers coffee machine, microwave, lockers. etc... "
good,"Great place to work with great people and culture. "
good,"Yeah there are some problems with management, like every store, but the pay here is amazing for what it is. Very professional, they comply with all of the state laws with breaks, training, etc. Although management at my specific store did not help me with a student retention program they offer, I unfortunately had to leave. I am in the process of working for another one at a different location. I wish I just stuck it out and never left. Pay on Sundays was time and a half (which for me was $20 an hour), on top of already decent pay at $13 in my area. Great job and I still recommend it for all of my friends/family."
good,"If you have not gone through college Costco is awesome to work for. There are opportunities to move up. They pay ok for uneducated people. The benefits, even for part time employees is AWESOME."
good,I enjoyed my short stay with my Costco family and would reccomend working there if given the opportunity. The pay is fair across the board and overall the benefits are appealing to the everyday citizen.
good,"Nice environment, nice people, good management style. You are made to feel like a member of a large family right from your first minute within the premises"
good,At this time costco is currently hiring. Good place to work. Flexible schedules if your in school. Great employees. Good opportunities for advancement.
good,"Costco is  a great job for those who are in school or want a job that will keep them busy but still let them enjoy a personal life. Very flexible for enrolled students, fun atmosphere but hard labor (you;re on your feet all day and will get tired). Pay is above average and if you work in the food court you will never get bored!"
good,"La empresa como tal es excelente, el personal es difícil ya que algunos no diferencian lo personal con el trabajo"
good,"It was a good job, I enjoyed the pay. I learned about manufacturing and inventory. I was also surrounded by all kinds of cultures and always learned something new whether it was by co-workers or customers."
good,"I first started at Costco in their Burlington, Ontario dept and had nothing but a positive work experience daily. I commuted on a bicycle to and back from work and never had any problems with tardies."
good,"the pay is great for the type of work, its a bit boring though."
good,"Everyone always arrives early to hangout in the huge breakroom, happy-go-lucky staff that work great with other team-members."
good,Costcos CDS services constantly strives to find ways to keep weekly schedule flexible enough to fit employees changing needs with the Companies weekly sales goals.
good,"Costco is a good place a work . The hours are set , but are flexible when needed. The hourly compensation is worth the long hrs. The Health benefits are very good as well."
good,Fast paced very work friendly and always willing people at the store! Friendly customers management was great and very understanding I recommend young adults/ high school graduates and college students to apply!
good,Was responsible for a great team and energetic group dynamic which saw everybody assisting each other in order to complete what was required of them A great opportunity for advancement given the right circumstances.
good,"Costco was a great company to work for. My co-workers were very pleasant and my bosses were very capable. The work was demanding but the company takes care of you and wants to set its people up to succeed wherever it can. The pay was pretty decent and there were very promising opportunities for advancement. If you want to be in the grovery/shopping industry this is probably the place to go. Personally, that isn't where I am headed so I moved on to another job, but other than that it was a good place to be for a summer even though the work was though."
good,Its a very excellent environment to work in. Have breaks which is good to help us regain our lost energy and to give us rest from our duty. You work and have fun at the same time.
good,on demande beaucoup aux employés pou le type de fonctions qu'ils occupent
good,Excellent Company to work for. Great pay and benefits. Friendly co-workers. Latest computer system. Everyone helps out to meet daily company goals. Everyone understands that customer service is very important for an excellent shopping experience.
good,Not to much to say management has their days when their not the best but still a pretty great company to work for and they actually care about their employees .
good,Costco es un grandioso trabajo y muchos se sentirán afortunado de laboran en esa empresa.
good,"Management is great"
good,I enjoyed my time there but really the only issue was that it was difficult to obtain full time. The managers were excellent and the workplace had a welcoming feel.
good,Costco was a great place to work while I  was still going to school. They were flexible with my schedule and understood that I was still in school. Time passed by quickly because there were always people in the store shopping.
good,Working the night shift for restocking is a calm job experience. Learning the job is easy and coworkers are great to get along with. Management are great leaders without having to be strict
good,"Costco Wholesale is a big corporate warehouse chain. "
good,"Doesn't give desired days off. Good employees and good hours, very by the book and organized. Always caring about members. Good environment to work in."
good,"Really awesome department management for the few departments I worked for. Nearly everyone was super nice or at least lot mean. Awesome benefits, good pay, raises for better or worse are based on hours worked not performance. Free membership while working there. Management on assistant warehouse, warehouse manager, and one more level up, or now two was very poor for the first one. Second manager was a bit more fair but he also lots some employs due to poor management. That was one of the reasons I decided not to transfer to the costco where I am now."
good,"Like you all know, Costco is a very busy place to work and customer service is the number priority of the company. A typical day at work is going into work and helping the customers by putting them through. I learnt the beauty of excellent customer service. Management is very good as they are easily accessible . They have a very good workplace culture as you have a good diversity of nations working there and everybody works as a team. There was no hard part to my job. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you render wonderful customer service."
good,"Great stable company to be a part of.  They rarely hire full timers but once you are there a while, there is room for advancement.  Friendly co-workers will work with you to help you get the job done, especially when you are a new hire."
good,"It was a decent place to work, Demanding members but awesome co workers. Learned a lot from the staff. Management wasn’t anything to rave about......."
good,Costco is a great place to work. They have a great environment and they have great benefits. Management is always super helpful if you have any questions or concerns. If you enjoy working as a team this is the pace for you.
good,"Competitive salary, good benefits, regular breaks, good training and regular raises. Plenty of opportunity for advancement and good equality. Typically only one weekend day off (when full-time) and 0 weekend days off (when part-time)- but that's retail. Opportunity for relocation."
good,"The money was great for part time works , wish I could have stayed the staff is very nice and pretty helpful definitely a team environment. The most difficult is sometimes being on your feet for 8 hours"
good,"I enjoyed working at Costco! They offer great pay, benefits and raises. There is also training for additional positions and advancement within the company."
good,"Typical work day for myself included: Lots of cart pushing, helping members put things in cars etc, helping load customers carts, helping clean the store after hours. Fantastic management, well managed breaks for equal work output etc. Great people, friendly and helpful superiors. Hardest part of job is keeping up with customer pace when short staffed. Most enjoyable part of job is making customers as comfortable as possible."
good,the managers just did not follow the rules of the handbook. Seniority was not anything to them when i’ve been there longer than the other people. not enough pay for me for the 6 years i was there
good,"Work duties varied on job positions. As a front end assistant, one collects carts and flatbeds for members, assists cashiers with boxing up the members orders in a fast and friendly manner."
good,Overall the work environment was just ok. You are literally on the go from start to finish. Communication is very essential in a work place and I believe that could have been better. Other than that I can’t complain.
good,"Met a lot of really friendly and professional people while working at Costco. Made many new friends. It was very rewarding to be able to help the members with their problems related to costco.com. Management was always very understanding and seemed more concerned about my health than my attendance, sent  me home when I was looking or feeling ill. I was only seasonal but I intend to go back next season, if they'll have me."
good,good place to work great benefits good hours about 40 a week good breaks 2 paid 15 and one 30 unpaid very easy to do not very mentally challenging good all around job
good,Everyone is nice and friendly. Great benefits. Opportunities to move up. Awesome pay rate with frequent raises. Schedules are done two weeks out so you can plan stuff
good,The staff was just great. I was running a trade show for the Himalayan salt company and Casco.  The staff was helpful and so was the shipping department.
good,"Costco is a great place to work, they obviously pick people who value their work and are extremely friendly and professional. Breaks are given and are important; have paid holidays for permanent workers."
good,i started with this company collecting cardboard in the morning from he stocking staff. not shortly after i was able to move up and become part of the stock team and then moved into other departments
good,Fun place to work at and you make new co-workers and you will learn new stuff as well as having fun and not being bored at work. The bosses and supervises were all good and funny people to work with they would always help new people at work and the people that been working there.
good,Costco was a place that respected their employees. The benefits and 401k package was really good. Full and Part Time employees were able to receive benefits. Some perks were Free Eye Exams and of course Free Membership.
good,"I felt Costco Wholesales was a good working experience for me and enjoyed working in such a collaborative team. I worked front end and there was no typical day for me. I would help pack items and do carts during the hours where the store was open to customer. I would stock , put items back on shelves, and do maintenance when customers left. At Costco Wholesales I learned that it is important to be able to do multiple task asked by supervisors and managers. I also learned the importance of team work in the work place. I would say the hardest part of the job was dealing with stubborn customers but I would do my best to respect the customers and be a professional. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was helping others whether it be employees or customers. I wanted to do my job well and not waste time."
good,A day at work at Costco is very busy. All the employees have to ensure every Costco member is given the right customer service. I've learned Costco is a big company worldwide.
good,"The high retention rate speaks to how great it is to work for this company however it is also the disadvantage to working here. Upward movement and opportunities are hard to come by. Plus, seniority overrides all other considerations including your ability to do the job a lot of times when a position is open."
good,Very friendly and productive environment. Had clear goals on what to achieve for self and the company. Management always willing to listen to your oncer.
good,The people you work with at Costco make the job worth going to. The benefits are great and it is nice getting time and a half on Sundays and paid holidays off.
good,"My typical day working at Costco was great, i learned about communication skills more and how to work as a team when it gets extremely busy at the workplace."
good,My time at Costco wholesales was a wonderful experience. I always had enough hours and great coworkers to work with. I would love to work at a Costco Whole sale again.
good,"overall my experience with costco was alright. I was in college at the time which brings me to my first point- costco is good if its your first and main priority. they do not work with another job schedule. However, if you have proof of a School schedule or medical reasons why you can't work a certain amount of hours in a day, they will usually work around that. Extremely gossipy, everyone knows each other's business which is a bit annoying. Also very fast paced and stressful, especially on weekends and during the holiday seasons. overall, they pay very well, and have amazing benefits and its not a bad place to work."
good,"Great place to start a career and is really a place for those who don't really care to advance their education. It is really busy and really fast pace environment, you're expected to work 110% at all times."
good,"Lots of good people. Great place to work and fantastic benefits for part time and full time. The management staff was well trained. If you work hard there is room for advancement. Need to be able to move around fast and juggle lots of tasks and responsibilities.Great environment to work in. Almost all of the managers were employees that were promoted from within the company, so, staying within the company can prove to be very rewarding. "
good,"Costco is an excellent company to work for. Costco has plenty of opportunity for advancement, the quickest way to advance is when new stores open across the country, apply for a position above the one you are currently in. They have excellent health and vision benefits, as well as prescription benefits with their pharmacy. Your personal/sick time as well as vacation time ranks as high as other leading companies."
good,"At costco wholesale it was always great and fun to go to work , the way they treat their customers are exceptional and management is great. the most enjoyable part of the job is to see that smile on most of the customers"
good,"Overall, Costco is a very good company to work for. I personally wish to pursue other avenues of vocation. I would recommend working there to anyone in need of a job for no longer than 5 years (although that's plenty of time to advance to Supervisor or Management). Sure they have some flaws, but what company doesn't?"
good,There were slow days but typically working in the food court meant always moving and always having something to do in order to either take care of customers or getting ready for closing that night.
good,"I have worked here through my entire college career since high shcool and this company has done nothing but support me and assist me in anyway as well as pay me very well and gives me some of the best benefits.  If you can get full-time here and do what you're supposed to do, you can move up quick and make a decent living."
good,"A typical day at work was serving food samples to customers who come by, taking up their concerns, questions, comments and complains. A typical work day was 10 - 12 hours long."
good,Costco is an ideal place to work if you plan on having a long-term job that is secure and has benefits. All the employees are always in a good mood and always working hard.
good,I truly enjoyed my time at Costco. As I was a contractor I did not get the same perks but learned and grew so much. Costco treats their employees with respect.
good,"I have worked at Costco Wholesale for 13 years. Pay is good and opportunity for growth in the company. Benifits are great including medical, dental, and 401k."
good,"Costco is a great place to work. But you must have communication with the managers in order to make sure you are taking care of the job correctly. I did not tell my managers when a job was too difficult for me, and it cost me."
good,"Especially around holidays, Costco's is a fast paced place to work.  I've learned how to value each customer and treat them with respect.  The management overall is excellent."
good,"The benefits that Costco offers it's employees is unheard of in the industry. For an employee who is single, you can expect to pay $15 per pay check ($30 per month) for full medical benefits and $1 per month for dental benefits. Costco will match your 401k contribution at 50% up to $500 per pay check. The benefits alone make Costco a leader in the retail  industry."
good,"Costco is the company you would think it is, it's built for people to work hard and advance, however it doesn't always work in the statement: it's not WHAT you know but WHO you know. This is very true due to the fact that you should be in the IN crowd or your chances or being promoted are very slim to none."
good,"If you start as a cart person or cashier's assistant at Costco and find the itch to try something different, there are many departments within Costco to experience a variety of work environments."
good,"*A typical day at work is about helping members and completing your daily tasks"
good,Costco is a great company to work for and they really take care of their employees. The longer you work for Costco the greater the benefits become and the more secure you feel about life after work.
good,très belle entreprise. les employés sont productifs et l'ambiance est présente.
good,"I worked at Costco for alittle over one year. During my tenure at the company, I found the work environment very friendly and exciting. The management coached and supported their staff on multiple levels. "
good,"Enjoy what I do in the early morning baking, and excellent company to work for."
good,Soy cajero de medio tiempo poca gente en la semana y pues siempre activo en la empresa todo normal
good,"An 8 hour workday at Costco included two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. The workplace atmosphere was very positive and if you were lucky enough to get a full time position, you held on to it. Very little employee turnover at our warehouse. It is possible to move around to various departments within the store and the training is on the job but very good and the supervisors were quite patient. Before landing in the photo lab I worked in the bakery and delicatessen where I learned many skills. You are expected to work very hard at Costco but the pay scale and benefits reflect that effort. I particularly enjoyed working with and helping our customers at the photo lab. I also liked the fast pace of the lab and my coworkers and supervisor. We were a fabulous team! During the holiday season I had to come into the lab very early in the morning to process greeting card orders. It was difficult to wake up at 3am but there was usually coffee and a box of pastries in the break room waiting for us early risers. Overall, a good company to work for."
good,"Costco was an amazing place to work. It was tough, but the pay was well worth it. Very good customer service, the managers, supervisors are very nice,  flexible and understanding."
good,I really enjoyed my time with Costco. I thrive on chaos and it was perfect for me. I got to lead and support a wonderful group of people. Management was proactive and always ready to help us succeed any way they could.
good,"Costco puts a premium on having a sense of urgency while working, which can be wearing over time, but neither are they harsh taskmasters like in other jobs I've had. They truly do care about their members, and accept that helping them can and will delay other tasks. They hire people that are the best for the job, so people that tend to be dead weight don't typically last at Costco, so it helps balance the work load more evenly."
good,Pas beaucoup d'heure mais bon salaire. Le travail est exigent physiquement et les horaire ne sont pas pratique.
good,Although I was only hired as a seasonal employee I was able to ascertain a very positive opinion in many aspect to the job. The starting salary was very generous and most of the associates were very pleasant to both the customer and co-workers. Management was always very helpful and although the job called for a fast pace it was nonetheless enjoyable.
good,I learned a lot of speed and accuracy working here. Some of the management can be a hag. It is a fast paced moving work establishment. great job to have.
good,"I was with Costco for more than 16 years.  Worked in different departments around the store and enjoyed them all.  Really great company and they hire good people, which makes for a positive work experience."
good,Great company but the hours are not very good for family life. You are guaranteed 24 hours a week but you will be required to work 5 days a week no matter if you are part time or full time. The employees are great but there is a lot of favoritism there so it can make it harder to move up at times. Also the concrete floors make it hard on your body after working there for many years.
good,"The company cares for its employees well but you are expected to work hard.  The structure of the management can feel bloated as you may answer to multiple people, which can feel like a waste."
good,"Very good place to work. Some days can be very busy and some days can be slow. Coworkers are nice and are approachable. Guaranteed 25 hours seemed promising, but I started to lose the extra five hours."
good,Hard work. Good for students & P/T workers. Good benefits. Be prepared to work nights & weekends. Pay is good. Very busy & always something to do. Fun work environment.
good,"Great job security, great pay and benefits, works with school schedule. Many departments to cross-train in. Many stores to transfer to if you ever move or want a change of scenary."
good,"Fast paced environment. "
good,"Though the work can be tiring and brain-numbing, my coworkers and even management are like one big family. They are always open to hear your concerns or difficulties and willing to accomodate you. "
good,I'm able to work Mon-Fri 630-330.  I learn something new every day and I work with absolutely amazing people.   The hardest part of my job is delivering bad news to employees.
good,"A typical day is fast pace and demanding. With this job I have learned lots from adapting new skills to improving customer service relations. The culture is very warming treating employees as family. I would say the hardest part of the job is labour itself, after awhile the heavy lifting can take a toll, but on the bright side a gym membership isn't needed."
good,El sueldo es muy competitivo considerando que sólo piden preparatoria. Es una empresa muy grande con las mejores prestaciones del ramo.
good,"bakery life was too difficult and the management was messy. They didn't train me at all and expected me how to work the ovens. I had to close all the time by myself which was ridiculous because that is barely a two person job because there is so much to do. No one tries to help you out and they expect you to do everything at once. They treated me like a child and if I was stupid, but I would still apply to other departments because it is less stressful."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is the people. The people we work with and the nice members we encounter."
good,"Very great job with a very good starting pay! I do recommend this job for everyone, just make sure you specify the occupation you wish to do in your resume!"
good,The culture of Costco is treat a member as a family. Management is not flexible. Safety and regulations are a top priority. The workplace culture is bring good customer service and being productive. The hardest part of the job is being multitask in a high paced environment. And you get to know a lot of people everyday.
good,"Great management, can be stressful at times, some can be rude but overall is a great place to be. The pros outweigh the cons and advancement opps come very often. The best part is they only promote from within unlike most "
good,"Costco was a great place to work, and the culture of the company is very conducive to having a very friendly staff who is eager to work as a team. The particular department that I worked for contained a couple of employees who had been there for quite a long time, and were possibly feeling disenfranchised by being in the same role for too long. Costco has a great system for giving raises every 1,040 hours worked, or every six months, but this is rewarded whether performance is outstanding or just ""okay"". I would not fault management with the performance of certain employess, but on the system that seemed to reward mediocrity, and lacked hard incentives for stellar workmanship, other than the occasional pat on the back, so to speak. On the other hand, if you worked hard consistently, you could be recognized and considered for advancement within the company."
good,"customer service"
good,"Working hard goes long ways. Being friendly and having great customer service. Dress to impress everyday is a plus, understanding when no one sees over you that mean you have to work faster and harder.."
good,if you don't mind them making you work full time for part time pay and benefits then this place will be for you. Great company but they would not work with me to go to school.
good,"A job that provided learning experiences in a community of friendly employees. Little workplace tension, and easy to show up enthusiastic and happy to work."
good,"Costco is the best job I have ever had so far. Typical day is immediately getting to work after clocking in. I'd assist the cashiers (or cashier myself) and help the members if necessary. Learned good patience and customer service, as well as working efficiently and quickly. My favorite part was pushing carts from the lot to the warehouse and stocking after the store closed. "
good,"I have enjoyed working for this company, with the many benefits as well as getting my voice and thoughts, it's a great company to be working for now.."
good,It was my first job. My co-workers were great and very pleasant to be around making me feel welcomed as part of the team. In addition this gave me an insight into the work force.
good,Great company to work for have learned so much. Many job opportunities and lots of room for advancement in career. Great benefits and very competitive wages.
good,"My tasks included returning and retrieving perishables when needed, putting products back, directing customers, maintenance, stacking carts, and jogging to get the job done."
good,"you are busy from start to finish. receiving product, merchandising product, keeping area clean, constant inventory of stock. helping members with there purchase. scheduling freight for the next day."
good,"I loved working for Costco, hard work for sure but great benefits and it's easy to pick up. The company itself stands for great things and really takes care of their Employees first, and Members second."
good,"Overall a pretty good place to work. Always had something to do, so it wasn't very boring, but it was also fairly demanding. You can expect to do plenty of cleaning as well as assembling various products that are put on display in the chilled food aisles. The hardest part of the job to deal with for me was definitely the constant cold temperature that was required to keep food fresh. Other than that though, the work environment was friendly and I was able to learn a lot about handling and preparing food."
good,"The employees are generous."
good,Costco is a great place to work and the pay is great. You can't beat their benefits. Alot of growth and opportunities to move around alot. They treat their employees very well.
good,The workplace was a good place to learn the speed of things. As part of the bakery we had multiple tasks to complete over so many hours we would prep and bake dozens of pastries and layer pies and complete other tasks around the area. The hardest part of the job was having to prep the racks of croissants in under 9 minutes it caused you to move very fast to keep up.
good,good place to work with really good benefits. Good management and very flexible with your schedule (especially with school). Fast paced work environment.
good,This place is extremely fast paced but that makes the day go by quickly. You make extra money on Sundays and you can stay there for years. Most people had been working there for more than 10 years.
good,"I never complain about money but work/life balance is really suffering. If job stability is your thing, Costco is for you."
good,"Working for Costco was great. They offered amazing benefits and always made sure the employees were happy and comfortable with what they were doing. I worked in two departments during my seasonal employment and I only really enjoyed one. I worked a couple weeks in the Bakery department, which was fine however the manager was quite harsh and sometimes unreasonable. I was given an apron but it only did so much to protect my clothes. No matter how hard I tried to ovoid getting dough, ""slurry"" or any other very sticky substances away from my clothes, I was left with something caked deep in the fabric and it would never wash out. I even tried to wear older clothing that I wouldn't mind getting dirty or ruined, but they had a very strict business casual dress code and didn't like when I showed up in older, faded jeans or exercise pants. I did enjoy when I worked the front registers as a Cashier's Assistant. There, I got to interact with the members and help them find the items they needed."
good,Morning merchandise stocker required being at the work place by 4:30am each day of the week. Managers are very demanding and work place is very fast pace. Great benefits.
good,"Identify,sales,objectives direct development profit-loss and 100 % costumer satisfaction at all in all the warehouse"
good,"push carts and maintain property cleanliness"
good,"Great benefits and base salary. Management is power hungry. And a bit of micro managing. "
good,Be energetic and be quick at your job and you'll do fine! The managers were great and helpful and the pay was amazing! Usually started at 5am but finished an 8 hour shift at 1:30 which was also very nice!
good,This is an excellent place to work for somebody who is okay with working almost every weekend.  The shifts range from 4 a.m.-12:30 p.m. all the way to 1:30 p.m.-10 p.m.
good,"Fun place to work & benefits are wonderful. Management is wonderful. Learn at your own pace, you control your advancement. Lots of self teaching. They encourage independence & everyone doing the job."
good,"Fast paced, standards on consistency and appearance of all areas of the store, always new growth opportunties, high standards on customer service to all members of Coscto."
good,"Most shifts are between 5-8.5 hours long, good amount of break time, always learning something new, great co-workers always a pleasure to be around, almost all of the managers were very kind and friendly!"
good,Costco was a fun place to work.  Everyone is friendly from bottom to top.  Great benefits for part-time and full-time employees.  I learned how to think outside of the box and be a more efficient worker.
good,"Working in the meat department once you get there , you start working. Its a enjoyable work place because you're not isolated and surrounded by customers and co workers."
good,Costco is the king of brick and mortar retail and has a strong reputation of treating their employees well which is well deserved.
good,"They pay well and expect the best, benefits are great. I tried a little of everything there and had fun. I had down times but mostly that was due to my own mistakes and not getting along with some people. Lots of management and most of them were great. I just got tired physically."
good,"I worked at Costco for the 2015/2016 winter season. My supervisors were all very nice and helpful towards me, ensuring that I knew what to do, and providing my with constructive criticism when needed in a friendly manner. My hours were flexible, and my pay was very good."
good,"Costco est une entreprise formidable qui offre un environnement de travail actif et diversifier seulement, celle-ci offre une opportunité a tout personne souhaitant être temps plein mais ne donne pas lieu a des horaires flexible pour les étudiants."
good,Excellent medical benefits and great pay.  Management takes good care of their employees and looks out for their best interest.
good,"Wonderful positive staff and management, I was responsible for the Maintenance department, keeping the warehouse clean. the most enjoyable part of my day was working with others and interacting with the members."
good,"Avoir appris a gerer la rapidite de la production , travailler en equipe , et aussi  savoir controler son niveau de stress .Etre organise dans  son travail.Il faut  savoir satisfaire les demandes des membres."
good,The company did a good job at making sure that shifts were distributed fairly and the management was also very reasonable.
good,"Great pay and benefits. Overall a very solid well run organization."
good,Costco is a company not for the faint of heart!! It is a company with extremely high standards and prides themselves with excellent service and they promote from within. If you not afraid of long hours and have the ability to relocate.... Costco is for you!
good,"Costco is an excellent place to work . they are very flexible with scheduling ,as I was a college student they woked around my classes. Not to mention the compensation is well above average."
good,Costco is great if you enjoy working with high volumes of customers. Decent wages. Low work experience required for low positions.
good,"Pour être franche , une journée typique d'une personne au service aux membres est plutôt instable. Une heure je peux être la personne qui accueil les membres à l'entrée , l'autre être la personne qui s'occupe de charger les paniers et ... Bref, une journée en tant qu'un employé chez Costco n'est jamais pareil. J'ai appris à être productives et à rester à l'écoute des membres."
good,The company made it very easy for me to switch from a part-time summer student to a full time staff during a period of time in which I was no longer in school.
good,"Personally, I enjoy a fast-paced work environment that continues to offer new challenges. Costco provided a workplace experience that was busy and engaging with great co-workers and management. Advancement opportunities were somewhat rare but did occasionally present themselves to hardworking and driven individuals."
good,The company overall is a great company.  Benefits were great.  The ability to advance was good.  I learned different departments in a short period of time.
good,"If you have a problem getting work done and staying focused, this is not the job for you.  Work is super fast-paced.  No one will cover your butt for you, you need to do that.  Do your work and you'll be fine.  Most people working here are laid back."
good,Quality products at an exceptional price. Customer Service is number 1. Management isn't above lending a hand on the sales floor.  Co-workers are more than helpful. Great benefits for a part time job.
good,"Work load was perfectly balanaced among team mates and for fun we used to enjoy by watching Tv  "
good,"I was a night stocker, I stood at the tables folding clothes, restocking, serving our members."
good,"Hay muy buen ambiente de trabajo, el salario y las prestaciones son buenas, te dan dos dias de descanso pero son 10 horas de trabajo diario, y tienes que ser muy puntual, en general es un buen trabajo si entran ahi, piden muchos requisitos"
good,"Good company to work for, lots of room to move around and advance. Starting pay is pretty low but better that most. Be prepared to work random hours and not get a full pay check while seasonal. They hire many workers and keep very few but as long as you work hard youll make it."
good,"> organizing the wear house"
good,"Greeted and welcomed customers entering store and encouraged return visits when leaving"
good,"Working at Costco was a great experience for me. I worked at the Baton Rouge location which opened in March of 2014, I ended up parting ways with the company only because I was looking for a full time position in house and couldn't seem to get one at the time."
good,"Costco is always pretty busy, so there was always something to be doing, easily. I learned how to work better with a team. My managers were all very nice, and helpful people. My co-workers were all of different ages and races, so i got to have a lot of interesting conversations. The hardest part of my job was working in the small space of the food court. The best part about that job was that they loved all the colors i dyed my hair or what lipstick i wore."
good,"fun work place with supportive management not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop."
good,"Got to work at 4:00 or 5:00 AM. Worked until 12:00 or 10:00 (or 1:00 PM if I had a tire shop shift), depending on when I started. Spent 5 hours stocking pallets with merchandise, often on my own since my team was split among a large area. After 10:00 I would either box groceries for customers or I would move to the tire shop. Busy shifts I'd be balancing and swapping seasonal tires, dead shifts I'd be cleaning equipment."
good,Crazy work environment. Very fast paced and you definitely get thrown in the fire to learn. But you definitely have a supportive staff.
good,"An amazing work environment with a focus on peer-to peer growth opportunities. Healthy competition with a balanced work-life, a blend of supportive and sensitive culture. immense opportunities to learn and grow personally."
good,I liked working there because we always had something to do.That made time fly by.I liked helping the guys build bikes.Stock the shelves.
good,"Costco is cool. Its a stable job, it can be very demanding at times. All I can say is that you won't regret working at Costco. It will be days that you want to quit but you keep pushing. Costco takes wonderful care of its employees. The benefits are beautiful and the compensation is satisfying. They cater to all people in all walks of life. They definitely care about all of their employees. They take personal matters seriously and will help you in anyway they can. You can definitely advanced at this company, if you are dedicated and hardworking there will always be advantages for you to work your way up to higher positions."
good,"Costco has a great environment that helps the employee feel appreciated with good wages, motivation to advance with raises, and superior benefits. They have a great 401k and employee events to have fun. When the employee is happy everyone is happy. The job is a very busy fast paced environment. It takes busy to a new level but the experience is good to have. Most everyone is a team player and supportive. Management was friendly and always ready to help you if you had a question. Overall it's a job that's great to have if you can handle a workout and redundant customer service!"
good,"Always on the move very fast paced, i learned how to be a baker, gas station attendant, as well as a cashier and morning merchandising. The employees at Costco are a very tight community and always help each other out."
good,"I learned a great deal about myself and effect management skills in the workplace. I was a member service employee which required constant interaction with customers/members. My communication skills dramatically improved during my 2.5 years employment at Costco Wholesale. I learned the vital importance of good management and how to appropriately balance the happiness of the employees and customers/members. If you have unhappy employees, the work place can be quite sterile."
good,"a Typical day at work would be very fast paced ,hectic and hands on.i learned that you cant make everyone happy while i was working there. the management was somewhat hard to get used to,but gave alot of time and effort in providing for the company. the co-workers were very diverse and friendly. often easy to become acquainted with and very helpful.the hardest part of the job would have to be the constant incoming customers and the unfair treatment from managers at times. the only enjoyable part of the job was the benefits and the pay."
good,"High volume, fast paced. Benefits are amazing! Bosses are pretty cool. Breakroom has a huge plasma TV, a keurig, and they provide the coffee/creamer/sugar. Everyone is pretty nice overall. The only thing that stinks is when you first start you don't have a set schedule. The only ones who do are the people who've been there 4+ years. Getting to be full time is kind of hard but not impossible. They host events for the employee club. Which are always nice to have because its family oriented."
good,"One thing that can be viewed as a con for most is a pro in my eyes, and that is that the job is never ending; there is always a new issue to solve."
good,"On a typical day of work I will usually interact with at least 60 customers per hour. The job requires customer service skills, attention to detail, the ability to work in a fast paced environment,and money handling. I have been able to really develop my customer service skills and learn to really be able to work in a fast environment with attention to detail while engaging a customer at the same time. "
good,"Most days were 100% productive, and aside from any newbies, everyone knew how to do their job. I learned to work many different departments and the skills required to be proficient in each. The managers were well trained and most knew their jobs well, and lead with excellence. Supervisors on the other hand were hit and miss when it came to good leadership, as there were often new ones from different stores or seasonal ones, and sometimes you'd wonder how they managed to climb the ladder. My co-workers were 99% of the best employees you could ever hire, with the other 1% percent just having a bad attitude towards the company or work environment. The most difficult part of the job was assimilating to the different work and pace of multiple departments, and always remembering it in case I needed to work that area/job again. Additionally, there would be days I would come in prepped to work one department, and upon arrival, I would be sent to another department, for example; say one that required long pants and non-slip boots, when I came in shorts and tennis shoes expecting to be in the heat pushing carts all day. And the most enjoyable part of the job was the collaboration with my co-workers, as being on the ground floor with them gave us a kind of camaraderie."
good,".Fast pace environment."
good,i loved my job i never wanted to not be there but other things got in the way of this as of 8  years i learned so much i loved the people i worked with they became like family .the customers are great people . never had a problem with them i worked at one of the busiest stores in northern California and i loved it my day went by so fast . the mangers are good people some look out for the company and not the employees and so are fair and care equity and i am a true beliver that if one works they all should not just one doing all the work i love helping people so i enjoyed the work and all the learning expreness
good,I worked for Costco Wholesale for over 10 years and I enjoyed how well they took care of the employees. It was a nice to  focus on safety and for a reward they would feed the employees.
good,great place to work for long term. pay sucks in the beginning but if you tough it out it is really good. hard to advance within the company but the benefits are just as good.
good,"Typical day at work included pushing carts, loading carts, and putting customers through tills. It was fast paced work and easy to learn. Only problem was that it got very repetitive and sometimes was quite boring."
good,"Very high paced job, on the busiest day it gets crazy. Co-workers are wonderful love the people i worked with!"
good,"- a typical work day includes helping members locate items on the sales floor. Doing projects for mangers. Being very versatile helping other associates in the warehouse."
good,Each day brings you something new. Having the opportunity to meet new people everyday and learn skills that can help you advance (whether your looking to make Costco your career or if your a student getting ready for the working world) many opportunities are waiting. Fast and friendly work environment. Being flexible is a must.
good,"Worked here in college, flexible schedule, great pay for part timers and great place to put some years in."
good,The hardest part of my job was working every weekend and not able to spent too much time with the family.
good,"We are working in a fast pace daily. Co-workers are helpful and nice, the hardest part of the job is when stocking the shelves and some of the products are heavy and you have to lift it and work fast before the day starts. The most enjoyable part of the job is payment time."
good,Worked with Costco Travel for over 11 years in WA and really enjoyed it but moved to a warmer climate.
good,"Journée typique aux caisses : "
good,it is a nice place to grow as a person and better your skills. i learn a lot everybody was willing to hep me when I couldnt understand anything
good,"it does depend on your department but usually you work hard and you get paid well worth your time. The company really shows you that it values you. You can always talk to management, any one up the chain of command. They prefer you use it, but you don't necessarily have to.you get to know most of the coworkers. Hardest part for me was making sure i take my lunches on time because you'll get a lunch violation if you take your lunch to late. Easiest part was clocking out to go home."
good,"I came to work 15-20 minutes early in order to prepare because you have to be out on the floor, ready to serve or give out samples to the members. Throughout the day I would have talk about my product and convince members to buy it. Sometimes it was very fun, when the members would make jokes and have a little conversation. For instance once i was sampling toilet paper. Many people made jokes and it was actually quite comical, and through laughs i would be able to convince them to buy it by comparing it to other toilet paper brands, and there own personal stories. "
good,Todo tranquilo aprendí muchas cosas y me encanto los horarios y los 2 día de descansos de cada semana
good,"Son jornadas de 10 horas tiempo completo y 4 o 6 para los estudiantes, se realisan rondines a los auxiliares en cada area asi como los inventaros de mercancias de alto valor y mayor desplazamiemto, informacion a alta gerencia asi como al gerente de inventarios de varianzas (faltantes) y verificar el motivo, por parte de gerencia apoyo en situaciones de detencion y deciciones sobre detenidos evaluacion de desempeño y actitud."
good,"A typical day would involve working with customers to ensure satisfaction while shopping, and helping management run a high pace and high quality store.  I learned how to multitask and get jobs done in a timely fashion.  The hardest aspect was having to always keep a high level of energy.  I enjoyed all the interactions with members."
good,"Hard work and determination was key to daily operations at Costco."
good,All of my co-workers are fun to work with and the pay is very good.
good,"Working at Costco is very different its a fun environment members have there days, but overall work keeps you on your toes."
good,"exciting always pumped to service the customer making the company a fun place to work for and a fun place to be as a customer,  Co-workers always worked together to make sure the day ran smoothly and met our goals.  The hardest part would be the holidays, very busy.  The most enjoyable part is making the customer happy,"
good,"lots of different tasks to keep it interesting and different day to day. good scheduling very organized. good management and co workers to kkep it fun but still get work done and fast. learned more how to be very punctual, organized, very clean and safe work environment. I only left this job to begin school in Calgary."
good,"- Each day was different but always ended well. "
good,"As a clerk, you take a member's membership card, welcome them to Costco, ask if they found everything they were looking for, scan their order, take their form of payment, and usually box everything yourself. I have learned that no matter who is to blame, you always take responsibility for what happened. The hardest part about the job is the inconsistent hours and days off so you can never plan anything unless you request it off. The most enjoyable part is the people. Both members and workers enjoy being there and it is like a big party a lot of the time, with everyone laughing and working hard and moving forward."
good,"Costco is a fast-paced work environment but despite the focus on efficiency, most employees interact in a friendly manner and the managers for the most part try to make sure the employees have a good experience on a daily basis."
good,"Starting at 5am, I mostly worked at Produce were the fresh fruit was distribute. Me and two others I worked with in that position, rearranged the fruit in the order the boss wanted on paper. We used our pallet jacks to reorder the fruit, and move it from the walk in fridge to the fruit display. If I wasnt in Produce I was either in Foods or Hardlines were I stocked items and straighten everthing up. Before, we leave from work we clean up and throw away trash and smash boxes through a machine. Cleaning up was a great feeling after a hard day of work, I walked up and down the isles with a wide mop, which I called my cooling period. After reordering and stocking supplies, it was good to watch shoppers shop and enjoy getting whatever they needed. I started working at Costco from Oct to January because it was a seasonal job position."
good,"Costco is a very busy place to work on any given day. Management is fair to everyone. Co-workers are great to work with and everyone gets along as a team player. Costco is a warehouse, so you do have to buy a membership to shop, therefore you are meeting and dealing with new members everyday.It is very difficult to be hired on full-time at Costco, they usually only hire part-time employess."
good,"a very good company to work for, but very ""senoirity"" based."
good,Day begins by assisting a cashier and boxing cutomer purchases. Great co-workers and cutomer interactions.
good,im only a regular part timer but this is the one of the best companies i have worked.
good,"Fun atmospher and great people to work with. Hardest part of the job would be the massive flex in schedule, but that happens in retail. Other big thing that is hard is to advance to full time."
good,"Costco is a wonderful company to work for. Management varies between the different locations, the location I work out does not have the best management staff. A lot of decisions are based on how much the person is liked, no rewards for people who actually work hard, come on time etc. Hours are cut and given to newer employees. I love working in the photo lab as a photo technician, I enjoy helping people and interacting with them in all of their endeavors. i've learned several different positions, and have been able to broaden my customer service skills."
good,Being with Costco while being in school allowed me to work and gain an education as well to further my career as a professional. It will always be a place where I started out my career regardless of what field I end up in (Accounting).
good,Am I job hunting for their benefit? I worked there for three years. I always asked to be transferred to Vancouver or the Okanagan and they didn't seem interested.
good,Costco Wholesale is a good place to work. There are always other job opportunities within the company during most of the year. The relationship between most coworkers are good. Everybody mostly gets along with each other. The management part of the company is good. The managers are very helpful and have good attitudes. The company rewards their employees thoughout the year for good work and keeping the workplace safe
good,I enjoyed my time there. They pay really well. It is a big working environment so it can get quite fast paced but overall it's an enjoyable environment to work in.
good,"I have been an employee for over 10 years. I am forever in debt to this company because of what Costco has allowed me to accomplish both personally, professionally, and financially. This company allowed me to go to school by working with me, schedule-wise. I met my wife at Costco, started a family, and purchased a home due to the generous salary that Costco offers their hourly employees. I have met so many wonderful people along the way, many I believe will continue to be friends long after my tenure at the company comes to a close."
good,"Hands on work, knowledge of grocery outlets through out society."
good,They work with you and a sustainable job. I loved working in the marketing department because I was never going to the same place. You learn a lot about people skills.
good,Great for somebody looking for a part time to full time gig. Especially if they're looking for decent work for a great wage and great benefits. Would recommend if you have previous store experience and are looking to advance to a more warehouse environment.
good,"The only draw back for me, was being hired as ""seasonal"". Although my overall evaluation on both season terms (East Hanover and Union) was great,  I couldn't be considered for permanent since I did not have the convenience of having a open flexible work schedule.  I was looking for part time evening, over night, and weekends.  Due to being a single mom and working a day job, I didn't have the flexibility to work day hours"
good,"A typical day at Costco Wholesale is VERY fast-paced, busy and employees are always moving. Employees should always have something to do and should always be attentive to questions or needs of Costco members. Most of my coworkers were very nice and loving, and we always respected one another. Management could be a bit nicer and address problems related to the Costco Warehouse or other employees with a little bit more respect. Other than that, I loved working at Costco and I'm glad I had the opportunity to work with such nice, amazing people."
good,a great place for a college or high school person to work. It has some great benefits because it is a union company. You get great pay but your hours will be cut during slow season so watch out for that.
good,"Even on the slowest of days expect to be asked millions of questions (I liked) and tasks to accomplish. Because of this fast-paced workstyle, the dat goes by quickly and you feel a sense of relief having done your best."
good,It is a great place to work with great benefits and guaranteed pay raise every year until you reach Costco's max pay for the position.  Working hard and staying committed will give you the opportunities that you want.
good,Overall great company that really puts employees first. Hard work but days go by quick. Good employee atmosphere. Good job security and full benefits for part time employees
good,"Great benefits and a competitive wage you may have to start as part time but eventually you'll get full time they give you paid  vacations, as a new hire you get a minimum of 25 hours a week but have the ability to pick up extra hours in other departments as long as you dont go over 40 hours in a week, the give you 8 sick days a year as well as 5 family days ."
good,"Worked there for 4 years right out of high school. There was potential to grow with the company but being in college I could not relocate at the time which seems to be the only way of moving up anymore.  Great work environment though. Teamwork and cooperation are key and Winchester, VA location had a lot of good people."
good,"Everyday work wasn't stressful and the workers were nice to work with. I learned a lot about time management and working as a team. Management was nice but a bit unorganized when it came to scheduling, and ordering meetings. Ive made some good friends with some of the people there because of the culture. The hardest part pushing carts for 8 hour shifts for 5 days a week, Though i still very much enjoyed it."
good,A typical day at work was busy. I learned to have a sense of urgency and to always go the extra mile to be of service to my coworkers and the Members.
good,"Costco is a fantastic place to start a part-time job, they offer benefits to part-time employees and on Sunday they offer a time and a half! If you can work in a high-capacity, moderately stressful job then Costco is a perfect fit for you."
good,Upper management is very reasonable. You will be busy no matter what department you join. The pay is fair and consistent. The environment is welcoming and diverse.
good,"The job itself is easy to work and can become a draining position at times. An excessive amount of human interactions daily-weekly basis."
good,"Costco wholesale is a great place to work. It is a fast pace retail environment with solid starting pay, benefits, and 401K. I would highly recomend to anyone who enjoys retail."
good,"Costco was a fun and exciting experience. My coworkers were friendly and helpful. The work pace is very fast. Speed efficiency and quick decision making are valuable skills, in this field."
good,After finishing school during the week I would go to Costco Wholesale to  begin work. Working there gave me a sense of accomplishment and responsibility.
good,"I was wrongfully let go 2 weeks before my 90 days. They made me work ""the chicken room"" alone for weeks and it took its toll on my back, so I asked for help. never got it. so I told my supervisor if I can be switched to a different department. The next day I was let go. Even after the head honcho at corporate came down and loved my work ethic and how I was able to learn and manage the entire room by myself. think they just wanted to let go of me because I mentioned my back."
good,"It was a good job, highly recommend staying there if you can because you get good benefits from working there (Costco membership, health, retirement after 90 days). Always pushing to learn new skills, to practice them, and get better. Very high pace and always things to do. Specifically in the food court, there's always something to do, so time passes by quickly. Only downside is, that if you're going to school or planning to go to school, lowering your hours might be a problem depending on how much staff they have. In my case (and many others at this specific Costco) you can get a schedule change and lower your hours but it goes by seniority and are likely to get scheduled close to 40 hours again when you asked not to because other people requesting time off, etc."
good,"Pay is great, and the people working there treat you as family. The upper management needs improvements. Lots of benefits provided when working at Costco."
good,Costco is a company to work for a great place to shop as well have a good insurance  for the employees good pay stars at 14 dollars  pr hr work  with  as well student that they go to school lots of customer very busy store
good,"A fast pace company with lots of members to deal with, customer is always right policy and we aim to please member."
good,Costco Was a very good place to work. The people there are very motivated to make the company an even better place. The company itself takes care of its employees and is very fair.
good,Schedule doesn't let you have a social life. Warehouse manager is cold hearted. Coworkers are great to work with. Great benefits competitive wages.Great company.
good,"If you have a solid work ethic and good people skills, Costco can teach you anything. They take care of their employees better than any other retail company and the environment is great as long as you don't bring drama into the workplace and you are consistent in your work efforts. If you are receptive to feedback and adjust your performance accordingly, Costco has a lot to offer. However, it is still retail. Aside from ample vacation time and paid holidays off, they are open 7-days per week and you will likely work unconventional hours and weekends throughout your whole career. In addition to that, staffing is very tight and everyone depends on each other to come to work and give their best effort on a daily basis."
good,It was a really good place to work in general but really busy and because there is such a large staff it is difficult to get time off / have a regular schedule
good,"Everybody helps in all departments, even though the job is considered part time, there's plenty of opportunity to make your schedule full time.  There's never a shortage of things to do, so you are always busy and helping out.  If you want to learn additional skills, they will not say no."
good,"High turn over rate for employees working there less than 3 years. Management is poor based on this turn over rate, however the job is steady and reliable."
good,Costco is very good company every one dreams to work there but the problem is they don't give full time only part time .if like they give full time I will not work anywhere again .
good,"I was a meat assistant so it was fun to cut, prepare and serve happy members. also, there were opportunities to assist in other departments. so lots of chances for advancement"
good,"We have a job to do but, enjoy working together. When we slow down there's times to straighten/tidy up the work area. Management is pretty cool they hold high expectations and we follow."
good,Working at Costco is like working with your friends. The atmosphere and management are very friendly towards you and will take all the necessary steps in insuring the employee has a safe and fun working environment.
good,El buen buen trato al cliente y buen ambiente laboral
good,i like working there cause they make you feel like you a home. friendly environment and they got a gym at the dry department. they also got a cafeteria in the break room.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Costco. The management was helpful and always willing to take time to teach their employees, as needed. They promote from within and have excellent pay and benefits."
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits and great pay. Loved the environment. It was awesome to learn everything there was to learn about working at Costco.
good,"Costco is an exceptional company with above average social responsibility, benefits and management.  I enjoyed my time and I would recommend Costco as an employer."
good,"I had a great deal of opportunities and learned a lot there. "
good,"Working at Costco is like being on a nonstop treadmill. There's never a moment when you're not moving unless you're cashiering or folding clothes. It's super fast paced and can get pretty stressful but the pay is definitely worth it. Management style depends on location, but in my experience some of  the managers/supervisors were the worst part of my experience here. They can be rude at times and display obvious favoritism. They are also very strict on when you clock in and out, which is understandable to a certain point. Most of the coworkers were really nice and helpful when I was just learning. I worked in a somewhat affluent area, and the members here definitely had a sense of entitlement as to the service they felt they deserved. Overall, this job like any other has its ups and downs, but there is no better company to work for than Costco. The pay and benefits are great, as is the ability to move up in the company, perfect for those that are looking for a long, stable career."
good,super friendly people and awesome opportunity. i worked in the warehouse and it was very fast paced work. slower employees couldn't keep up and the turnover rate was incredibly high.
good,Working at costco feels like the golden ticket of retail but they rarely keep those who work seasonal there. They’re so many workers with senority working there that most good positions and the double work hour sundays are already taken. If you manage a permanent position there then it’s great.
good,I really enjoyed working here. It was very fast paced and kept you active. Co-workers were friendly. It is really competitive during their seasonal periods.
good,"Its a great place to work. You can work crazy hours and feel overwhelmed. It gets better as you work your way up. You get a free membership, which always helps."
good,"I worked maintenence. So I would maintain cleanliness in the warehouse. Check trash cans, sweep, scrub floors etc.Their is no moving up in that department and they weren't offering any new hires full time hours. My schedule was inconsistent."
good,"Daily helping members with any questions concerns and enhancing their shopping experience. I've learned better how to communicate and serve in a retail environment. Management is great, you met various types of people and can further your career quickly through Costco. They are very accommodating towards students as well. Very handy when you need a job with flexible hours! I found the hardest part of the job was working on a concrete floor. The most enjoyable for me, was training in different departments to change up your work days and gain more skill."
good,Costco is great company to start working with. Starting as a Seasonal-Hire is the best way to get your foot in the door. They have great starting pay and is always above the starting minimum wage.
good,it is a store but fast paced and can feel like a lot of work most of the times. not an average store it is a warehouse if you can deal with heavy workloads and fast pace tasks then this is for you.
good,"Fast paced, friendly co-workers and management.  Provide opportunity for advancing, great raises.  Make you feel like you matter.  Very good long term job."
good,"Good environment. Good package. Kind to people and coworkers."
good,"Great company  "
good,"Working at costco was amazing, all of the staff previously there was very welcoming and kind. the ability to get used to a high pace environment is crucial though. Many of the tasks involved require a quick pace,  great customer service, and problem solving skills."
good,"At Costco Wholesale, employees are cared for, from the compensation plan, to the benefits packages offered.  Even part time employees get benefits.  I have experienced that hard working, results oriented employees have the opportunity to move up, and widen their career through Costco.  "
good,"Tuve la oportunidad de trabajar para la compañía por 3 años y en ese tiempo tuve la oportunidad de ver las oportunidades de crecimiento que tiene la empresa, así como la importancia que tiene el capital humano para la misma. "
good,Really fast paced during holiday season. It is very fun to work here especially in the bakery! You have to stay busy because managers are always walking around watching.
good,"Loved what I did and enjoyed the people I worked with. Every day I learned something new about how Costco techs performed their work. Never a boring day, when one car was done there was always another ready to be started."
good,this is a great place to work. Majority of employees have wprked there for 5+ years. lots of room to grow within to the company and wage increases with amount of hours put in
good,"Was a great environment to work with co workers but my some of the management and supervisors would slack off and forget to do some of the basic tasks they were given, there were many difficulties with scheduling that should have  been handled in a different instead of being ignored. Still in the end the pay was good and if you know the right people at your warehouse you should do fine and get by."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment. Everyone is always willing to help no matter what department you are in. The people make it challenging but fun at the same time. During a typical day at work always be aware of your surroundings due to the amount of traffic that goes through the store.
good,"A typical day at work for me is working in a fast paced retail store, where every day I would help customers by answering their questions, finding products, and prices.It was very challenging for me to find or look for products at first but, I learned throughout the time I was there. In reality, I disliked the management some of them were rude and helpless.In this work place I and my coworkers would help each other as a team with any questions or help that we needed. Overall, Costco's workplace culture is one thing that I like most, because they value their employees by giving us good benefits and salaries."
good,"In costco you can find the oportunity develop your career in a serious place, at the same time the longer time you are in the company, the bigger is your salary."
good,"Overall, my experience was great at Costco.  Fellow employees were hard workers and always maintained a positive attitude.  Costco is one of the few companies that I can sincerely say is a company that takes pride in taking care of their employees, I just wished more companies did the same, but oh well."
good,this job was a great experience as i got to work with great people who were motivated and loved doing what they do. the management treating everyone like a big family. it was a a joy to work at. however tasks became mono and repetitive and opportunity for personal advancement was limited
good,"Interacting with the customers,"
good,"The benefits and people you meet will far outweigh the stress of the people you help. The management is very understanding, and works with you to get the hours you need and also the time you need off."
good,"Really nice benefits package and the starting pay is great for anybody in school, scheduling is flexible. Job duties are clear and management is helpful with any questions."
good,Costco gave me the opportunity to work in a community that allowed me to learn and develop professional skills in customer relations as well as multitasking.
good,Its a good place to work if you intend on staying there for a long time. raises and advancment goes through the company. People are friendly and really easy to work with
good,"Never really had any terrible complaints, except they would just throw you wherever they needed you. overall a great place to work, managers aren't the best."
good,The hardest part of my job was collecting the shopping carts from the parking lot area. The best part of my job at costco was all holidays were off.  Costco wholesale offers great benefits for employees.
good,"This company was excellent. The pay grade is very well considering the average amount paid for a student in college in Horry County. I learned about selling, customer service skills, monetary exchanges, production management, and working quickly. The hardest part was running through the store to find items because the layout of the store was changed regularly. I loved the people and the atmosphere."
good,"Injoyed my job at costco. Costco was a good company to work for. I would like to go back to costco. I have applied, and will apply again. Unless a better  opportunity comes my way."
good,Costco provides numerous advancement opportunities and grows people in the direction they want to go. It opens unlimited doors as long as you have the drive to keep climbing.
good,I believe costco provides one of the most excellent customer services for a large indurstry. alot of employees stick with costco for the benifits and customers you all was have you regualrs.
good,"Mismanagement specially in Deli dept. there is a favoritism goin on. I work hard gave my very best in this department of Deli , but i just realized that it’s not worth it. But i still work fast and organize specially at closing time i cleaned all over the Production area and chicken area and i sanitized specially the tables coz we put food on top of those tables so it should be clean 100%. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Costco and would have continued to work there, but I was hired as a seasonal worker and my term ended.  Co-workers, managers, and other staff were easy to work and interact with.  When I informed them that I needed a day off to study for an exam, they changed my schedule without hassle and allowed me to focus on studying.  They were good to me."
good,There isn't much room for employees creativeness.  There are so many exact ways of doing things as an employee at Costco that things become very repetitive and you start feeling like a robot working in a  factory.
good,Very good salary and wonderful management. Benefits are great and time off requests are granted with no fuss. Employees are treated well and there is a lot of room for advancement.
good,Costco is a great place to work because of the opportunities it creates to move up in the company. There are strong work ethics with great benefits...
good,"Good company to work for. Good pay and benefits package. The longer you are with the company, your pay and vacations increase in time. Paid major holidays off."
good,"Costco is a fast paced, up beat place to work. The one aspect that has stuck with me is the family environment there. Theres good days and bad days but working with good people makes up for the bad."
good,"For any of you that shop at Costco, you know that it is busy 99% of the time. This usually mean the days go by very fast. You can see up to 3,000 different members in any given day and do over $350,000 in sales.  It is a very fast paced environment and a very fun place to work. Schedule flexibility isnt the best but job security is. The turnover rate is very low at Costco and employees tend to stay there for years."
good,Hard work fast paced. You have to really be interested in your work. Pretty good understanding on what it is exactly what you're doing.Your co workers are very helpful and there if u need a hand.The managers are really tough and hands on with everything u have to make sure that you're putting your all in your work and make sure it your best work. Time management is very important also.
good,"Stocked shelves, assisted customers in finding products, and cleaned the warehouse.  Management was always helpful and made their directions clear throughout."
good,This job has a fast pace and a lot of member's to care and help with technical issues. If you ever need help there is so plenty of Team Managers there to back you up.
good,I really liked working here at Costco. It was a very fast paced place to work and everyone treated everyone like family. It was a true pleasure to work for them. I learned more about my food handlers cards. The hardest part of my job was clean up at night because there are some serious rules when it comes to cleaning that place after closing. The most enjoyable has to be the people. nothing really about running around taking money and handing food off excites me.
good,This job is fast paced and a changing work environment everyday. You are constantly moving and will be required to multitask and will learn on the job skills.
good,"Costco have a opendoor policy and you can talk to anyone about anything."
good,"Good company to work for, good pay with great benefits. Advancement takes time but it is worth it if you can hold out as part time. 401k, medical and vacation provided."
good,Costco has been fantastic to me through the last 9 years. A wonderful place that takes care of their employees. Outstanding heath and dental insurance. Great benefits through 401k and stocks.
good,"A typical day at work would inculde; Assisting for cashiers, cashiering when busy, and helping members locate items. I've learned alot of different skills such as, sales, merchandising, and inventory. Management has shown me that there are many oppurtunities to grow in the company. The hardest part of my job was the physical labor but it also showed me that I can get stronger the more I partake in it. The most enjoyable part of my job was to meet very nice people and be respected by coworkers and management."
good,Lots of good people. Great place to work. Fantastic benefits for part time and full time. Management staff was well trained. If you work hard there is room for advancement. Need to be able to move around fast and juggle lots of tasks and responsibilities.
good,"My first job, Costco Wholesales is a fast paced, non-stop moving environment. All of management are always on top of their people & priorities. Costco, like most, when it comes to the presentation of product. Wants their product and inventory looking at its best if not, perfect. The cooler department, my job at Costco is the hardest job in the building, I have leaned to maneuver my ways of moving to get the job done more precise and faster. The most enjoyable part of my job at Costco is working in departments I have yet to work in, and bettering myself at everything as it comes to me."
good,Costco expects a lot out of its employees but also supports them tremendously with whatever they require. Management is very well put together. The company really cares about you and its customers.
good,all around a great place to make your second home. Just show up be safe and take pride in what you do and will do great things here. Enjoyable mix of work available
good,"It was alright but I resigned due to health and many other issues! There isn't anything else to say about working there, it was very stressful. The employees were fantastic but the workplace itself was to much."
good,Buena empresa para trabajar y buen sueldo en general buena empresa..
good,"was a good place to work in my teen days, had a lot to learn about working and picked up a few good traits there. made some clothes friends and good bond with mangers ."
good,You really need to knuckle in and you will stand out and be rewared. Its a very hard job but time goes by very fast as you have alot of deadlines to meet.
good,"If they see that you are a hard worker, they are going to do what they can to keep you. You are not treated as a number and the job benefits are quite decent for a company that is not unionised."
good,"A typical day at my work place would be interacting with Costco members. Ensuring the member is satisfied with their experience at Costco. Fast paced working to make sure each car gets completed in a reliable time span. Working together with the Management team to help settle member issues. "
good,All about the members no matter what pay is amazing. Great hours. Standing on your feet all day. Great way to advance in a compay. Definitely have to have great work ethics
good,I was hired as and audiologist. I worked to the best of my ability. I was professional at all times. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I lI enjoyed my job.
good,Great team of people to work with. Days go by fast and it is a lot of fun to work there. Free membership and you can shop on your lunch hour and get samples
good,"Working at Costco at my location, is very fast-paced and a lot of physical work. I've learned to work well under pressure as well as learning how to work in a very diverse environment. The hardest part of the job would have to be able to deal with large amounts of people. Overall, we have over 1,000 people shopping at Costco every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet different people and building relationships with your customers as well as your coworkers."
good,"Overall, Costco provides a great work environment for its employees. Solid benefits, paid leave, and ample sick time make it easy to work there. And even if management can be distant, they still try their best to accommodate those who need it. The worst part of the job is consistently the members. Tread lightly, the fact patrons pay for a membership causes some to be drunk with power."
good,Great to work for all around. Management is well. Time off can be hard. Carts can be difficult in this seasonal weather. Breaks and lunches are always on time.
good,"The Costco Optical Distribution Center is fast paced and demanding on your body. However, advancement, benefits, and compensation are great. The hardest part of the job is being consistent and fast at picking and scanning orders. The best part of the job is that you typically work early hours and won't stay past 8pm."
good,"I worked as a seasonal cashier assistant and you have to be able to life bulky objects, sometimes heavy. The job was pretty simple and definitely fast paced. The employees are incredibly nice and reached out to you if you were a bit shy, like me. The management team were encouraging."
good,Very good work environment with friendly employees and management. Job offers stability and opportunities for advancement. Schedules are given 2 weeks in advance.
good,"I loved working there, learned a lot about the runnings of a professional organization. It was a great company and there is room for growth and promotion."
good,"Life in the retail business is never easy, but it is rewarding. You have to keep your head on a swivel on a daily basis. You're in constant communication with managers, supervisors and more importantly the members. Providing Costco members with outstanding customer service and a wealth of knowledge about the latest product(s) to hit the store shelves. The hardest part of the job was being a cart attendant. Working outdoors at Costco can be physically and mentally challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing long lasting relationships with colleagues and learning different things."
good,"Keep in mind that Costco likes to hire from within."
good,"Everything was perfect except the supervisors: they keep annoying you by telling you things you have to do throughout the day, even if ou did it without them seeing you do it."
good,"- Always busy, very fast pace. I loved working there, it was a good and fun experience. "
good,"travail debout"
good,"I worked graveyard shift , it was great in the beginning until they saw how good I was at my job where they started giving me extra tasks that required more than two people to do. found myself overworked ."
good,"A non stop fast pace enviroment with great team members to work with each and everyday. "
good,"great opportunities within Costco to grow and expand "
good,"This was a fun and fast place job. You can learn a lot about warehouse, stocking and merchandising. Training is quick and you will learn a lot from your co-workers. If you are working part time you will find it hard to get a full 8 hour shift. I have found a lot of people do like working 5-6 hour a day. If this is what you like, it might be a job for you."
good,"I usually working on weekends due to my classes and other activities on weekdays. I started my day at the membership counter, attended department meetings and performing all over the week to complete the targets. Best part was the customer interaction. I am now more punctual, a good listener, and excellent problem solver."
good,easy going company and a great place to work. warm environment and a nice pay. the managers were all attentive and did a great job.
good,"I enjoy most facets of my job with Costco. "
good,"•	Promoted membership programs, payment services, and company culture to potential members.  "
good,Management care about there employees and take care of them great benefits. Its a very busy environment you will learn a lot and co-workers are very helpful.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Costco wholesale,a very clean and friendly place to work,I learned many things here that will help me down the road with many jobs to come."
good,"revicion de equipos entrando en la manana llenando check list de temperaturas y revicion de compresores, terminar el recorrido de equipos antes de la apertura de bodega,después de la apertura un descanso de 15 min para tomar café,después hacer un recorrido por todas las áreas para revicion de maquinaria.la parte difícil fue cuando falto personal y cubrimos varios turnos,lo q mas me gusto fue el ambiente laboral mucho compañerismo."
good,"I very much enjoyed my time there, my coworkers and management. The only thing was I wanted a regular working shift each week which is very difficult to gt unless you have lots of seniority."
good,"When working at Costco i felt welcome. All the co-workers were friendly. The work was usual consist and repetitive, but doesn't add to much strain on your body.  The break times are reasonable. They also offer benefits for students."
good,"During a typical day I may work several positions such as cashier, bagger,stocker, pushing carts. This has forced me to be adaptable to new positions."
good,"Amazing place for a college job, they offer flexible hours and are willing to work with college students to make a schedule. The work days go by quickly since Costco is always busy, working side by side with a diverse workforce. The management is always ready to lend a helping hand and guide employees when lost. The hardest part as working at Costco is that it is often very exhausting having to be constantly working. The most enjoyable part of working here is being able to help make a member's day with simple conversation or helping them with their shopping experience."
good,"Fairly busy, mostly deliveries. Management is respectful, and friendly. Co-workers are like family. Difficult customers are always the hardest, but you'll always have that. The good overcomes the bad."
good,"There is a unique quality in being a COSTCO employee. In addition to health benefits, progressive advance, and bonus opportunities, COSTCO seems to pride itself on an outstanding membership approval. This employer deters from the term of ""customer"", as it would imply a discouraging stigma associated with shopping at other stores. Being an employee meant being part of a family, metaphorically speaking. Very few jobs would present a sense of comfort that would make one think of a job as a career, like COSTCO has."
good,"A usual shift at Costco Pharmacy would start with greeting my team. In the pharmacy everyone is smiling even when we are very busy, and that used to make our hardest day still fun.  I have learned how to mix compound, receive and send faxes, type all kind of prescriptions including hospital orders. I have also learned how professionally communicate with doctors and their office team.  One of the hardest parts of working for Costco was the very high volume of phone calls I used to answer everyday. However, having supportive and organized team is always a key to a successful work day.  And for the most enjoyable part of the day, I would say, was typing all prescriptions and leave the pharmacy knowing that the morning team will start fresh with no need to worry about undone prescriptions."
good,The people are great to work with and the help with benefits can't be compared. Advancement is hard to come by and has a better chance by relocating. The raises come automatically based on hours worked so working long enough can eventually bring you to the top of the pay.
good,"I worked at Costco for 15 years. During which time, full time was next to impossible to get and never got a steady schedule to where I could work a second job. The benefits are great and co workers were great to work with. The management team were not on the same page. Many times I would be given conflicting duties by the managers. What made me quit, was the lack of a steady consistent schedule and room for advancement as well as working for years as a part time employee."
good,"I found working here very enjoyable, great atmosphere and excellent colleagues. Management was very involved and friendly and gave very helpful performance reviews."
good,"if you work at head-office, vendors often come for presentation. amazing cafe on site. energetic team. great location,"
good,Every day was good something new everyday its a big company I worked every area certified in most areas and customer base .
good,"Working for costco trave was EXTREMELY benefitial to my life in so many ways i cant even start to explain. A trypical day was showing up for work after using the company gym down the road.signed into my computer and email and when my time to start came up i put on my head set and begane taking calls. could range from a young couple looking to get away all the way to an elderly couple who has been traveling their whole lives. i learned how to deal with dificult situations and conflicts arising from customers as well as all about to travel industy. Taining for this job was a 10/10!!!! a full month focused on teaching us how to do almost everything and what could hapen on the ""sales floor"". My managements was extremely amazing. i love all the supervisiors and managers of this place! they always helped not just tell me how to fix somthing but show me! i sat down with my supervisior once a week to discuss the following week and what has happened and what i could do better and any tis and tricks they had for me. Hardest part of my job was my family life. i had a rough schedule and it was hard with an active duty military spouse and a 1 year old at home with no family in this state. i couldnt get my scheduled changed to save my life. hense why i had to quit unfortunetly. my most enjoyable thing about this job was everything. if i had a different schedule i would have never eft even since i moved 60 miles away!! i would still go every day!"
good,The Job I have at Costco is great its  just very demanding but a good work place to be. A day that may seem bad for normal people is actually a breeze to us at Costco. We are organized at keeping our store efficient. Sure we have moments of shock but we bounce back with a plan to execute. Hardest part is just to deal with some of the most stubborn members we have. The most enjoyable part would be when you find your rhythm to work then after that point your good.
good,"My usual schedule was either 6-2:30 or 7-3:30. It was very fast paced and detail oriented, because everything had to be out by a certain time but we also had to pay attention to quality. My coworkers were very hard working and made my work much easier, everyone worked together very well. My boss was also great, he started off in the same position as me when he started working at Costco, so he was very understanding and knew how to train us so that we could also become the best and maybe even be in his position one day. The hardest part of the job is having to train new people during the holiday and  maintain my own work but you always get it done. Everything was very enjoyable, a very great place to work."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about Costco. They've paved my way for the last 12 years and offer a plethora of opportunities, especially if you're willing to relocate to the corporate office or a regional office."
good,"Concernant les avantages sociaux et bien être du travail, Costco est une compagnie très respecté et qui respecte ses employés."
good,"Excellent place to work. Supervisors and team leaders willing to help and teach. Well managed. Good options for advancement. Decent benefits and good pay for call center work. You always get feedback, especially when you ask for it. Co-workers are more like teammates, no matter how much your work seems individual you can always get help or get questions answered."
good,Good workplace. Very fast paced. management can use some work as they are all over the place at times and rarely on the same page.
good,"Co-workers were great"
good,"This was an enjoyable experience working with a company with set expectations and a management system that helped to apply and maintain the expectations. While the majority of the typical shift is spent on your feet, there are three breaks that are provided on a standard shift. Fair pay and a good group of coworkers really help to make this a job you want to keep coming back to."
good,- Enjoyable place to work with great benefits and pay. Taught me to a lot about maintenance and gave me a lot of customer service experience.
good,At Costco I learned what Customer Service is all about.  With Costco being a members only company I was able to build a relationship with the members witch is very important when providing customer service.
good,"Costco is a fast paced, great cultured company to work for. There are hoops to jump through with management to get full time positions though, and it has led me to want to pursue other opportunities because of these games."
good,buenas prestaciones seguro infonavit estabilidad economica compañerismo agradable y constante crecimiento laboral
good,"I loved working for this company. Unfortunately my warehouse had a revolving door of management and a climate of political games. I would love to work for the company again, given things were different from my personal experience."
good,"In addition to being a fun place to shop, Costco manages to be equally enjoyable from an employee standpoint. Members have pretty high expectations so delivering upon that can be hard work, but it's also very rewarding."
good,"Mi dia tipico: era de llegar y cubrir el turno de la mañana, que me diera la informacion de lo que paso y que teniamos pendiente."
good,A typical day at work involves customer service and processing customers orders. The hardest part of the job is processing the customers orders in a 1 hour time frame.
good,I loved working for Costco.  It was a job that challenged me to learn more about the products that were available and getting to share what I learned with the other members.  I was able to learn how to schedule people in the department and get involved with the behind the scenes operation.  I was able to use my organizational skills and organize the department I was working in and also the freight we received.
good,"I was there for seasonal work. I enjoyed the work. My fellow employees were awesome and helpful. When I talked about positions in regards to my degree, I was told they were held for people that have been there for 10+ years. I didn't feel like being Front End during that whole time."
good,"Excellent employer, and one of the best jobs I ever had. I enjoyed working for this employer, and hopefully I may eventually return to work for this company in a full time versus a part time position."
good,"Frist thing I do is touch base with my collegues to see whats new on our department and if any changes have been with regards to products we stock, then I shall have a walk around to familiarise myself. My co-workers are very supportive we are a close team and work very well together as well as on our own. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people i work with and assisting customers to the very best of my ability. "
good,"I learned how to make pizzas and different types of foods. Usually you will come in, everyone will great you with a smile, you could always go to anyone in management with problems you maybe having, and dental insurance even when working part time. Hardest part of the job will be how busy Costco can be on a Sunday and trying to keep up."
good,"I took this job when I was 19 years old, which provided plenty of opportunity for me to move up in the company. The management was made up of smart, ambitious youth who worked to ensure customers left happy and returned happily. I was very happy to have the opportunity to be a part of this enterprise."
good,"Costco has been one of the best companies for which I have ever worked. It was a fun and friendly environment with several departments to choose from. I had the opportunity to work on the front end and in the bakery, which made me learn a lot more about what I am capable of doing! It was difficult doing task such as the wrapping end of the bakery, which I had never done before, but easily caught on because everyone was so helpful - that was also my favorite aspect - it was easy to learn in a place where I felt everyone wanted me to succeed. It was an extremely enjoyable and very productive experience for me!"
good,"Great place to work, especially if your in school."
good,I have worked for Costco Wholesale in many different positions over the last 25 years years and I wouldn't have stayed if I didn't believe in the company. Costco is a great place to work with excellent advancement opportunities and compensation that is second to none.
good,"Great place to work, very flexible work hours.  It can be a tough job at times, but its retail, so what else can you expect.  If you can get in its great."
good,Costco has a very friendly environment and it seems as if the employees' mindset is solely on the satisfaction of the members. It is very easy to move up in the company. Costco also pays very generously.
good,"Costco is a very great place to work! Very fast paced all day everyday. You're busy your entire shift. Constantly communicating and helping all kinds of members. All Costco workers are very hard working people that consider all of the members needs. Management is overall good, although they don't work around your schedule. It is a great costumer service job and the workers are treated very good."
good,"All in all, for the short time I was there Costco was an enjoyable place to work for the most part. The staff; no matter what department, were all friendly and helpful in the utmost, always willing to give advice or lend a hand when they had the time. The customers as well were always friendly and considerate. The managers that oversaw the entire warehouse were each helpful and always quick to listen if there were any issues, ready to do what they could to solve the problem and ensure everyone was happy. It's no wonder that as a whole Costco has very low turnover rates, amazing benefits aside they treat the employees very well."
good,"I learned a lot of things at Costco as i am not only a cashier but also a helper in many departments. I can work by myself under pressure as well as in a team. I like to teach what I know and to help others. "
good,"Great benefits, good employee culture, good time management with various scheduling issues, steady job safety."
good,"As a company Costco is amazing. There where great benefits, great pay, and lots of room for growth into the future. the only negative that I experienced is that a lot of the people there just viewed it as a job and didn't try to make it an enjoyable experience, so it made for quite a negative atmosphere."
good,"I enjoyed working here but the only thing that made it hard was that I worked with a lot of non-speaking English in my department. However, I did learn more Spanish."
good,"I started July 22 2002 to present. I install tires and supervise a garage ensuring vehicles leave the shop in a safe and timely manner. I have learned that patience and empathy goes a long with customers and leading by example is the best way to run a crew. My managers lead the way in professionalism in ensuring safety and fallowing protocol, they provide the assets that are needed for me to get the job done. My co-workers are knowledgeable and urgent at getting the job done. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with an under staffed department during a promotional period and or holiday. I enjoy working with other people who are also goal oriented."
good,"Most days I was managing the bakery at night, setting up for the next day and helping customers. It was a great place to work, the manager would call me in some days if they were short staffed and I was more than happy to come in."
good,"The managers are friendly and helpful, the employees are like a family, the wages and benefits are great, and on occasion they give us free food to reward a job well done. The only downsides are that you're working in customer service - so dealing with dumb people is a regular thing - and doing shift work, which makes maintaining a social life somewhat difficult."
good,"Excellent place to work at."
good,"Excellent Work Environment, learned a lot, very helping co-workers and had very well balanced work life."
good,"fun environment to work in "
good,"Recommonded, you can join and earn more i am looking for change currently."
good,"great company, flexible they work with your schedule especially if you're in college"
good,"It is a relaxed place to work, although not enough that a person can be lazy. People are always friendly and willing to jump in and help from other departments. "
good,"- fast paced environment "
good,"I would show up, prepare the bakery for the days orders, then make food as needed, or as orders would come by phone. Co-workers were very helpful, and nice to each other. Hardest part of the job was the overtime when unexpected, and the higher ups can be a bit dictatorial at times, but that comes with any job. Most enjoyable part of the job was the smell. Coming to a workplace that smells like cookies and red velvet cake daily makes life that much better."
good,"Manufacturing and basic assembly line work environment.  Hardest part of the job would be that many fellow employees lack the appreciation and motivation for a job that I desire to be surrounded by. Great management team, very encouraging. Typical day involves working machinery and having knowledge of all work areas and what is going on at each station."
good,"Typical days at work began very early, with early morning stocking shifts from 5:00 AM to 9:00AM. From 9:30 to 12:30, time was spent assisting customers when needed and maintaining cleanliness and order in the displays."
good,Costco is an amazing place to get involved with as a employee.  The management and staff are normally friendly and is a very secure job as long as you work and take pride in your job.
good,"Was a buzz to get ready and plan a busy day, The hardest thing about the job was to get the right amount of product at the right time not making too much creating waste."
good,"A typical day consists of a steady work day making food for the Costco members. It was about a 2 week training on how to clean and keep everything properly sanitized for myself as well the the members. With the help of my coworkers i have become proficient in all the demands asked of me. Even the employees that are not in my department are very helpful, and friendly they make me feel at home. I enjoy working with people and have a safe and friendly environment to work in. People make me smile and I love having the conversations  with all the members."
good,"A company that really takes care of its employees. The best place to work and make a real living. Benefits such as medical, dental and retirement are top notch for the retail industry."
good,They have been very good to me.  They promote from within with a lot of different areas you can work.
good,"My usual days at Costco were rather fun and tiring."
good,"I work in the Major Sales department (televisions, electronics, computers, and laptops). Sales is the first thing a member will identify when they come inside the store. I am responsible for making sure the store is what Costco calls ""SHOW TIME READY"", meaning that the warehouse and its products and/or merchandise must be at stocked and presented in a satisfactory way. I have gained an abundance of experience while working at Costco."
good,"One of the things to realize and appreciate about Costco is the ethics and values they strive to maintain within each warehouse. Though the management has some degree of freedom as to how they run their individual warehouses, they always make sure that each employee is taken care of. "
good,great company top 5 to work for. but no fulltime avaliable. there are no hard parts only ones that is hard is memebers that lie to your face. but overall good employyes and benfits
good,"I worked at one of the busiest locations, so it was definitely intense. I loved the hard work, though."
good,"Interacted with customers to upgrade memberships, resolved escalated customer complaints and customer service, and"
good,"A normal day is all about the members. Regardless of your specific department, you will always be answering questions and solving unique problems. Management allows some freedom in dealing with member, and so I've learned to take matters into my own hands with each problem I encounter. Most co-workers do the same but when we need help, we dont mind asking each other."
good,"I would fold clothes, stock shelves, unload/stock/move skids, learned about facing, help clean at the end of the work day. Good co-workers, and overall good working enviroment."
good,"A great part time job for a college student. The management team is fairly flexible and the employee is held to high standards. The shoppers are not customers, they are members so they have an expectation as to how they should be treated."
good,"A typical day for me at Costco wasn't all that bad I did alot of labor work with pushing carts for a good 5 hours of the day and stocking at night. I learned alot though. I learned how to interact with people even when your not having the best of day and how to stock merchandise safely, quickly, and correctly. I really enjoyed my managers and co-workers so it made work a lot easier and the work was done more efficiently. The hardest part of the job though was working in the snow and rain while pushing carts but the most enjoyable part of work was working inside or stocking cause it made the day go by fast."
good,"This company was all about business. I worked over night so we had to complete a huge amount of tasks quickly and efficiently. I learned how to use an electric power jack and the importance of working within a timeline. The management at times seemed like slave drivers because of the high standards set by the company. Sometimes i felt as if the supervisors could have been a little more human as opposed to robotic. The hours and the sheer amount of physical labor may have been the most difficult parts of the job but the payout was well worth the trouble. You actually had a sense of accomplishment once the night was done. My co-workers actually may have been the most enjoyable part of this job, They were great people whom I enjoyed working with."
good,"a typical day at work- busy, meeting new people all the time"
good,Costco has a set way of how they do things and it works for them. They have extremely hard working people there and they love what they do. Management really works with you when you need it. The co-workers make everything so much better there.
good,Enjoyed working there never had dull moment. Staff Is just awesome. I treated guest equal and help out to the limit.
good,The company has been helpful to teach me about the company and the computer system (AS400). I have had the opportunity to empower my fellow employees to gain the same knowledge as I have gain from the company.
good,"great place to work, only really have open availability for work schedules, its kind of hard to move up in company unless you are able to relocate"
good,"Costco offers a lot of benefits like insurance, optical care, auditory care, photo center, and many more. Flexible with college students which is nice, and pays generously which is hard to leave after 2 and a half years."
good,Très bonne adresse pour formation. Hiérarchie exigeante au service client
good,Costco has a great atmosphere and awesome people to work with. They offer training and lots of opportunities to advance within the company. I wish I would have never left but couldn't get a transfer to TX.
good,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Costco, from the workers to the people it's an overall good place, a great invornment to shop! Love the place, frequent shopper. Good people."
good,I work in the RTE department on the hot dog lines. You have to wear your PPE at all times on the floor. There’s 4 main jobs to do on each line. Tosser: throws hot dogs into the back of the line. Graders: watch the dogs as they go down the line and take away the bad ones. operator and there assistant: they make sure the hot dogs are even in the packages before they get shrink wrapped while controlling the machine.
good,"As an assistant cashier, I was expected to help folding clothing, help members check out, assist with closing and push carts. The job is physically demanding and it extremely fast paced, but the benefits and pay make the hard work easily worth it."
good,Its a great job with great benefits. Makes workers feel like they are appreciated. Manager and supervisors have an open door policy and can always go up to them with an issue.
good,The culture at Costco is above average.  The Management and staff are friendly and supportive.  I would recommend Costco as an employer and a place to find great products.
good,"Everyone I worked with was very nice, understanding, patient and seemed to carry the same mindset. Costco does a good job of meeting the needs of those that need it or may need a little extra help. "
good,It was a great job with great benefits.il I wanted to move up but didn't get the chance too. various locations employees had the opportunity to move  and start fresh on a different state which I liked.
good,"Clock in, get your basket, shrink wrap, tape and marker for inventory. Go to your section of the store and again stocking or moving pallets around for that week. Management was not very nice to employees  but the workplace culture was very good. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting everyday on your body. The thing I enjoyed about the was it kept you busy."
good,the workplace is very suitable for all kinds of work done there.  security measures are well implemented by all.  This is one of the companies for a Warehouse career.
good,They are a good company to work for. They have a competitive salary and treat the employee’s good. The Benefits are also good. The only things I could say that I didn’t love at Costco was really the hours and how strict they were about being on time to work. If you were 1 minute late you get written up.
good,"I enjoyed working at costco because of the environment. The managers were very nice and they don't micromanage. There was a lot of variety in the day and I liked that aspect. It is busy work though, plan on being active."
good,"Working at costco is a hard days work. No matter what the position you have to be aware and on the ball at all times. The benefit of working hard though is great benefits and pay. Staying with the company has its share of rewards as you get stock in the company, etc."
good,"Empresa que te cuida mucho al empleado sin sobre pasar sus políticas, arropando en todo momento con prestaciones superiores y con un ambiente laboral que pocas empresas tienen. Su cultura laboral esta enfocado hacia el empleado para dar un mejor servicio hacia sus socios."
good,Sorry. Nothing to say very much about it. It's ok for working but that is not having enough hours for the new staff. Some people are working more senior years than they can get more choices.
good,Great company incredible benefits treat you well. You will work hard and it’s not easy but pays good and the company was great gave you plenty of sick days and paid time off.
good,It’s good place to work at you have to be hard working and patio if you want to move further in your career. Everything will come with a time. Just keep pushing
good,"I didn't work at Costco for long, but I enjoyed it. At first I thought my job/task was impossible to do in the allotted time frame as it would take me over 8 hours while working as fast as I could and no breaks. By the second month though i managed to bring it down to 6 hours which was the time they wanted you to finish in. My job as the Bakery Cleaner was difficult to say the least. It was extremely tiring and strenuous work."
good,As a cashier assistant packing items back in the cart moving fast is the key. Almost like playing Tetris. But the day goes by fast and everyone is usually nice.
good,"Awesome place to work except the fact that in food court department you have to wait until last customer leaves even if thy order a pizza and store closes in five minutes and then you still have to be finished cleaning within an hour. This includes tables chairs pizza oven hot dog machine with three sections, scrub and spray floors, charro machine, smoothie machine, frozen yogurt machineect.."
good,"Its a good job, just be ready to work and earn your money. The Benefits are great and if you have nice co workers then youre set. You can also enjoy paid vacations"
good,"Management is great, I love coming to work and the people I work with are very helpful and supportive. It’s almost like a family here. There could be some bad apples on the tree, including the members that come shop here, but the benefits are nice and I think the pay is reasonable. However, I wish I could have more hours. Sometimes they cut hours depending on the sales and this place could be very physically demanding, lots of hustling and running. I’m always drinking water and carrying my water bottle around everywhere. The benefits however are great! Lots of opportunities to grow and things to learn about. Overall Costco is the best job I’ve had so far. I’m somewhat very satisfied here"
good,Worked in the deli. They have focus on food safety and customer service. Working conditions in the deli were less than ideal. The deli was kept at a temperature of just above zero.
good,it is a hard place to get into but you'll enjoy it if you do. They are really kind to work with.. I will say though it is like a high school I never really went out to work events because people would always talk mad gossip other people the next day.
good,a typical day at work involves helping members book the vacation of their dreams. When hired you take about 5 weeks of paid training. Hardest part when members are unhappy
good,a typical day at work its busy a lot of customers come and we have to keep them satisfied. the workplace is pretty easy everyone gets along so it makes the day go by faster.
good,There is always something new to learn at Costco. Everyday can bring you a new challenge and help your skills grow. Management is helpful and works alongside you when necessary. The benefits are amazing and they are lenient with time-off request. Certain members can be difficult to work with but ultimately we find a solution for them to leave the store satisfied and pleased.
good,Typical day is you clock in and check in with your supervisor then get sent to different tasks to do. Very team oriented. Lots of activity in everyday you work.
good,"Trabajo estable y seguro"
good,Accommodates my school schedule and has a good culture. Diverse work environment and friendly co-workers. Good company benefits and has a CSRP program for university students.
good,I love coxtco the whole atmosphere. The staff is friendly and everyone gives 100%. Its always clean and we try to get people out pretty fast. There is plenty of parking.
good,I love working with coworkers sweeping floors stocking and compressing boxes I love working in the front end putting the customers groceries in the shopping carts
good,"This job was the most inviting place I’ve ever worked. It felt like a community, and I was deeply respected by all. Yes it does have its fast pace days and parts of days, however as a team many were never left with the feeling of overwhelming emotion due to the stress of the fast pace environment."
good,"Very high volume of trucks daily ,would be some days you wouldn’t get a lunch it was so busy. Good benefits and sick days ,with vacation pay. The management was very understanding."
good,"Awesome company to work for. Treat employees really well. Very hard work and it is appreciated if you can keep up. 1.50 hot dogs for lunch every day, can't beat that."
good,I love this company. I believe that Costco will always be my favorite company. They really do care about the employees and everyone I worked with was amazing. The only problem I was having was getting full time hours. I needed to move on in my life and part-time wasn't enough money to support myself. Within my specific building was union which made advancement a little difficult if you didn't have much time there.
good,"The workplace culture was refreshing. Everybody knew everybody and they treated each other like family, whether its was your first day or you've been there for a surplus number of years."
good,"Costco is a great job, they care about their employees. They take care of us. IT IS A TEAM EFFORT. The Benefits are good. you also recieve bonus checks yearly."
good,"The work you do is consistent and always similar from day to day. Per my experience as a student, management is very good and flexible to your needs."
good,"I am a college student. and when I worked for Costco, they worked with my school schedule, giving it a priority. The managers are nice, respectful and the store manager is very friendly."
good,"Every employee is cross-trained in multiple departments. The work schedule is very flexible during nonHoliday weeks. The probation pay is around 14/hr and 21/hr on sundays until you reach 90 days. Getting a raise is very easy, especially if you work in a specialty department (meat, bakery, cashier, merch, tire center, etc)."
good,"Costco Wholesale supports and manages its employees very well. This job taught me how to be extremely efficient in a very timely manor, as well as improved my customer service skills."
good,"I learned that Costco is absolutely a wonderful place to work and also a very hard place to get into. The turnover rate is very small because nobody ever wants to leave, because it is a great place to work.  I was lucky to start working there into a seasonal position and unfortunately was not able to stay because there was no room to stay once the Christmas season was over.  I did learn a lot while I was there and would be so so happy to be able to return there to stay one day !"
good,"For the days I have worked as a seasonal I did enjoy working for Costco. Ever Supervisor and Manager was very friendly. The job was a fast paced job but always had your hands moving never would have the excuse to say I have nothing to do, which I really enjoyed. Ever employee were friendly and helped others when it was needed; team work based which I love in the workplace. They had me moving to multiple Departments throughout the season to test my limits working for the company. I enjoyed every part of it, sure was a big learning experience of retailing. Loved working for them and wished to work for them in the future."
good,Good place to work as a member. There alot of jobs to work in that store great quality in food and the people treat you right. Great experience as a worker.
good,"Son muy rígidos con ciertas normas y en ocasiones olvidan que mantener felices a sus empleados crea un mejor servicio al cliente, sin embargo estás dispuestos a escucharte."
good,"My experience with Costco was overall very good. I worked on the front end for a year and was lucky to get into administration for the next 3 years after that. If I would've been stuck on the front end, I would've ended up leaving earlier. The front end is hard work and repetitive. Working in administration was good. Supervisors and managers are a lot easier and better to deal with when you're an admin employee. As a front end employee, you feel like they're on top of you every second if you aren't constantly moving. "
good,"Good working environment, salary and friendly colleagues. I left because I have to relocate to other country, or else I will definitely work with this wonderful company."
good,"This is the best part time job with people who are very fun to work with"
good,"always very productive day at work, great morning shifts, great work environment, always friendly, happy to work there, great company, enjoyed everything."
good,"Wonderful part time job for college students, good balance between work and school. Hours are not bad, flexible with school schedule as well. Great place to work!"
good,"There is not much to say, It had great benefits and compensation, time off, 401(k), and job security; it's Costco. Working that kind of job though was not for me"
good,"I worked here for 3 months in front end and it was a great experience! My managers and co-workers were all super friendly and had no problem showing me the ropes, It wasn't a hard job to learn and it was so fast paced that time went by really quickly. The Managers would always made sure you got your breaks and they would usually mix you around a little bit so you're not doing the same job all day. There is really good advancement options and they encourage you to as well."
good,"Take use of the extra benefits like the free 24 hour counseling hotline service. "
good,"Fast paced environment, retrieving boxes inside warehouse, boxing items, cart retrieval, customer service, greeting customers as they come in and out of warehouse. I learned that the customer is as important as the job that i perform."
good,Costco promotes positive feedback from their employees.  They also provide an excellent benefits package.  They pay for travel time and milage.  A very happy place to work.
good,"Great people in every department, chill supervisors and not a lot heavy lifting. I got certified in Lean Six Sigma. I was thought continuous improvement process and took part in projects to improve work stations for employees."
good,"Great place to work, they care about their employee's success. Employees were very helpful and friendly to other employees. Management made sure there were enough tools available to complete the work"
good,"All in all i enjoyed working at Costco for the last 10 years. There isn't a job there i can't do. Unfortunately i had to quit due to the fact that the salary they pay isn't enough to live in Washington by yourself, as well as my family was moving to Oregon so i decided to go with, since  i could afford it there. But unfortunately i couldn't get my transfer due to lack of openings which forced me to resign. Would i work there again? Yes. Just so long as I got to keep my wages that i worked so long for."
good,A topical day at work would be putting the stuff that the clients bought in their basket. I have learned that you have to be very fast at packing the food in the clients baskets.
good,"Typical day for me as an AM stocker is come to work at 4am and stock my area to open the store. Great employees that make work seem almost like free time. We have two paid 15 minute breaks and a unpaid 30 minute lunch all of which you can take when you want, depending on what time you work that is. If you work later in the day or on the front end you have more of a guideline on when you get to take you lunch and breaks."
good,A great company to work for you have a chance to advance to a different position.You can work in different departments as openings are posted.  Costco has great products good prices As an employee you have great insurance benefits and increase of pay goes up with amount of hours you put in..
good,"Great place to start out in an office environment. People are genuinely very nice and the management is kind. You can move up fast if you want to, but beware, you will be talking to hostile members 90% of the day if you are a supervisor."
good,Costco is an amazing place to work but you do have to walk in prepared to work and get your job done there is a bit of a wonderful flow at Costco once the store opens up its like watching synchronized swimmers swim
good,"my experience with costco was very good, i meet  a lot of people "
good,"Empresa que tiene en cuenta la opinión de los empleados."
good,"I loved working there, only down side it was hard to maintain or obtain two jobs because of the schedualing "
good,"As far as retail goes there is no better place to work"
good,The employees are friendly but management still needs some work. Members are the best part about the job they are always smiling and friendly. Free membership
good,"Managers are very positive and motivating, everyone is friendly, and help each other out. The holidays get pretty crazy busy, but the steady season is nice."
good,"there isn't really anything bad i have to say about this job, they worked around my school hours and everyone was polite and respectful and helped me out when i needed it."
good,Great place to work for students. They are flexible with your schedule and pay great overall and have amazing benefits. For someone who doesn't have a degree you won't find a better place to work
good,"slow paced work place, at a manufacturing job in Otay Mesa, CA"
good,good place to work if you like fast paced work. it has great workers with a wide diversity and always something to do. pay was great and so were the benefits youd receive
good,"a typical day was both slow and fast paced. I'd have very productive days. I learned costumer service, how to stock, and also increased my costumer service skills. The management was great, I never had any problems with anyone. The workplace is very relaxing and my team members were all outgoing. The hardest part of the job was closing, but eventually I became used to it. The most enjoyable part about working at Costco was being able to be outside. By that i mean helping costumers with there bags, and recovering carts."
good,"Costco is great place to gain experience, and have a consistent workflow. They have a position for almost anyone based on your past work experience and will help you get the tools you need to learn something your interested in."
good,Costco est une entreprise incroyable. Très agréable
good,"They have you where ever they want you. It's Fast paced but the pay is rewarding. Coworkers are friendly but managers are all over the place, they do a lot of seniority in that store when it comes down to going to full time or working another day."
good,"If you are a hard worker, they will take full advantage of that. It is a great company to work for as far as pay and benefits go. The part I dislike most about it is that management is content to get the bare minimum out of employees that don't have a good work ethic, while asking for the most from those that already work hard."
good,Empresa que desarrolla talentos y genera empleos . Empresa líder que forma líderes
good,very busy and challenging. how to work well with others. kept you on your toes and very motivating. culture very organize. helping with the carts out side. Working as a team when the store got crwoded.
good,Costco is a very busy place with members constantly in the store from the moment they open to the minute they close.  As a Costco employee you will always be busy.  Management looks after their employees and has a good checks and balance system.  Costco offers great benefits and the ability for advancement.
good,"I really liked working at Costco. The warehouse was at was union so everything was seniority. I was only getting 25 hours a week, if you are scheduled at 5 hour shift and it was closing you had to stay till your 6th hour and the can extend you with out asking before you 3rd hour.If you did want to get more hours it depended how long you worked there. That would probably be the only down fall. Other then that management was very nice and part time employees are also eligible for full benefits. i would definitely recommend if you are a college student."
good,Costco is probably the best place you can work for without a education. Their benefits are too great to pass up and you get raises for the  total amount of hours you work. Start out at 12.50 and can top out at 22.00. Sunday's are time and half and they follow all major holidays. It's hard to move up without being there for at least 3-5 years.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me helping out the customers either find items they want and loading their items onto the conveyor belt. "
good,Love the job everyone is friendly it's a big family environment you have to work hard and work fast but make sure everything is nice and neat .. no slacking but overall a great job
good,"Excellent health care benefits and retirement benefits. Great salary; however, it is difficult to get a full-time position. Managers are good and give you the opportunity for growth."
good,"pros: great people to work alongside, time goes by fast, always something to do."
good,Very simple. Had to learn a lot of equipment and safety rules. The biggest thing that I favored was building connections with my members and helping them have beautiful photos.
good,"Work life balance can be a bit more difficult compared to Target were it was relatively easy to swap shifts. At Costco it is easier if you just request the time off rather than switch with somebody. Also it can be a little difficult to move up depending on the warehouse because of seniority. I also see a little bit of favoritism every now and then, but not rampied like Walmart. All in all great place to work!!"
good,"I have been with Costco for 10 years, I have worked several different departments throughout my career, to this point. Costco is a great company to work for. I am so greatful to have a place to work where I feel appreciated for my hard work and dedication. Management is good and easy to talk with if a problem ever arises."
good,"I got to add more to my Customer Service experience from different departments. You always have to be on your toes, learn and pick things up quickly. It a very fast-paced environment. I enjoyed working at Costco. They always made sure you took your breaks and lunches on time. I got to learn new areas of each department and experience how things go especially during holiday seasons."
good,"excelente empresa, buen ambiente de trabajo excelentes prestaciones poca paga"
good,"Great work culture with low turnover. Company encourages employees to learn skills beyond their job function. However, due to the low turnover, it takes a long time to actually move up in management."
good,"Working at Costco is great, the benefits are fantastic and they are very flexible with scheduling, especially if you are a student. It starts off part time ans is slow to get bumped up to full time."
good,Long work days depending on your position. Everyone starts from the bottom.They only promote from within. Great work environment. The benefits are great and paid vacation/sick leave.
good,While working at Costco I was able to enhance and use my amazing customer service skills. Costco is a big warehouse so you will consistently be working with people. I was able to use my Spanish speaking skills while working here due to the location of the store. I believe that working here is great for anyone who loves customer service!
good,"Costco is an awesome place to work. The only drawback is the varying work schedule.  Management is good, the culture is excellent.  If you have talent and enjoy working with people, this is the place for you."
good,l'ambiance de travail est très motivante. Les hauts classés sont constamment présents pour motiver les employés et pour venir en aide à ceux qui en ont besoin afin que les standards de la compagnie puissent être accompli.
good,Everyone I worked with at Costco were great workers and even better people. Great environment. Good management. Motivation ethics work well. Sable work environment for being so crowded and busy so often. Organized and clean.
good,"The work I did at Costco wasn't the best for me. The reason I say that is because I worked in the food court area, and I didn't like it too much. It was very hot all the time because of the 400 degree ovens, and the job required very physically demanding work. The good thing about the job was the great benefits that were offered, and he good pay."
good,"Es una empresa que cambia su ritmo de trabajo de acuerdo al número de socios (clientes) que tenga al día, aprendí casi de todo, el compañerismo es importante para conocer de otras áreas y las ganas de dar una mejor solución a los problemas también ayudó a conocer otro tipo de áreas. La gerencia siempre encuentra la manera de ayudar a los empleados a que se sientan a gusto y también a decirnos cuando cometemos un error y cómo darle solución. Exiten todo tipo de compañeros pero es fácil adaptarse a su forma de trabajo y viceversa. Desafortunadamente hay ocasiones en las que se maneja tan rápido todo que se te va un detalle y ese detalle te puede afectar economicamente pero afortunadamente los errores se cometen una vez y eso te va convirtiendo en una persona experta. Todo me gusta de mi trabajo, no me pasaba levantarme temprano o ir todos los fines de semana. Es una excelente empresa para laborar, sobretodo si es tu primer trabajo."
good,A typical day at work involves ensuring the cleanliness of the clothing area and interacting with coworkers to delegate responsibilities. I have learned the importance and effectiveness of teamwork in achieving goals. The management is very accommodating to the employees' needs and the coworkers very cooperative in and out of work. The hardest part of the job is the repetitive and unchallenging work while the most enjoyable part of the job is the employees and corporate culture.
good,"Learned a lot at Costco, its a great company. Learned about the tire installation process. Also in dealing with member only customers."
good,"A typical day at work, consist of helping members find the produced that they came in for. Assisting members with their groceries, Making that I am staying busy and productive and finding projects."
good,"Enjoyable company, lots of paths to progress and great pay and raises. Definitely a company to look at working for, as well as a future prospective for those who aren't sure of what they want to do."
good,I will love to come back after being seasonal employee its a great company. Management can work on having a better communication on there department.
good,"My experience for working at Costco, Corp. was excellent and had great compensation benefits. My co-workers were fast-paced and more experienced."
good,"Great place to work, excellent customer service, high quality products, great place to grow and learn new things, many opportunities to move up within the company."
good,"Happy to working with team members in this company. "
good,very busy the course of a day. challenging every day. co-workers are fun to work with. from ceo craig jelnick to district managers all are wonderful people to work with.
good,"Depending on a department, there is hardly or never a downtime. You are always busy assisting customers, helping the fellow employees if needed. It's a great place with good reputation. The business is growing and it keeps you energetic and always eager to meet people and feel good about helping them. Good pay and benefits."
good,Costco is hands down the best place I have ever worked. They genuinely care about their employees and reward them for good work. I've made great friends working there.
good,"I truly enjoyed being apart of the Costco family, although it was short lived because I was a seasonal hire, I still learned a lot from that experience. A typical day would consist of me coming in to open the store along with the other co-workers and jumping straight into the days daily prep with the many assortments of fresh baked bread and pastries. My co workers were all very mature, and were very helpful I must say. It was a absolute joy working their I could not complain. The best part of working here is engaging with adults who enjoy being creative all while appreciating a great tasting cookie and its main attraction, our valued loyal customers."
good,Have to be ready on daily base for members and the continuous demand to keep merchandise always fully stocked in every dept.
good,"Once you have established seniority, you have a choice of choosing your shift (morning or evening). It is interesting to learn the steps on manufacturing lenses for eyeglasses. It may seem like a small job, but one lens goes through a very long process. Management was fair and depending on which department you are in, co-workers are pretty helpful."
good,"- Work was always fast paced and things were constantly changing. (i.e. location of merchandise, getting moved around where they needed you, deals, etc.)"
good,"I loved working at costco. The company seemed to really care about its employees and had a reasonable manner of showing their appreciation of their employees. I worked in the membership and deli departments, so I was able to be exposed to the behind the scenes and front of the store"
good,"During store hours I am responsible for, giving all team members in my department a section in the store to maintain, making sure that the store has an organized and shop ready appearance, assure that an adequate inventory of products are maintained, and provide superb customer service to all Costco members.  After store hours I develop a list of all items that need to be stocked in my department for the next day.  I then work with my team in stocking and organizing the department to insure that all nightly procedures are completed.  Great company just not where I want to make my career."
good,"I am very grateful for my job at Costco.  Even though the job is mindless and not very rewarding, I could not have made it through school without this job.  The environment is fun, the pay and benefits  are way above average and I have enjoyed working with my co-workers."
good,"Prácticamente se enfoca mas en lo que es atención al socio, de ahí el mejor precio y manejo de mercancía, para que esta este en excelentes condiciones, para así cerrar con la mejor atención, el mejor producto, el mejor precio."
good,One of the best retail companies to work for.
good,"Good start off pay and guaranteed hours. Lots of job advancement opportunity, Management is ok but I can only speak for my Costco."
good,Oversee daily production.
good,J'ai eu la chance de travailler pour une grande compagnie. Avec des directeurs et des gérants de qualité avec un intérêt pour les employés et de bonne formations.
good,this is good place for starter who need a good pay and will hard worker.
good,"This is a great place to work. Cashiers after 4 years can make over $40,000 a year. Great benefits, but you have to work your tail off."
good,Worked as DB analyst at Costco for 4 months and had a wonderful time. Great work culture and environment. Would love to work again with Costco.
good,"Having daily contact with customers can be very rewarding, when a customer is happy with the product or service provided. Caring about customer satisfaction ,recording any damaged, missing or faulty goods,moving the goods to the correct area in the warehouse,labelling goods,folding clothes - these were my duties"
good,"Great company to work for. A lot of the older employees are helpful with younger new employees. Depending on where you begin, the front end new comers are put on carts and work up from there."
good,"Working at Costco was a short-lived but educating experience for me. Although the position was only for the holidays, and I only worked there for a few weeks I made quite a few friends. Everyone on the team is friendly, the management team immediately made me feel welcome and they always had something for me to do. They didn't rush me into anything but instead took the time to teach me how to do the job correctly and efficiently. The hardest job for me was collecting carts, they are quite heavy and you must take 6-8 of them at a time but after a couple of shifts it got much easier! My favourite part of the job was packaging customers carts because they always seemed to be in a good mood and I had many lovely conversations with some great customers! Overall, costco was a great company to work for and I had a great experience!"
good,The management team is great. The job is ever demanding so you’ll be busy all the time. Meet and help lots of customers throughout the day. Benefits are incredible.
good,Great work environment the training is easy the people are good good benefits I would recommend people to work there definitely a good jobs for people getting out of high school.
good,When I first started with Costco I worked in food court and i worked my way up. i moved to night merchandising and then went back and fourth from clothing and night merchandising. Also did a lot of cashiering and as well pushing carts I was all over the warehouse.
good,Great company to work for and great advancements.  Friendly people to work with and has a good management team.  Only thing you need to have is an open mind with the work and the schedule.
good,Operated cash register to accept payments and make change. Addressed all customers concerns promptly and with professionalism. Re-stocked merchandise..
good,I enjoyed working there even if it was only a seasonal job. The people mostly are fun and helpful. As long as you can keep up and have a good attitude it's a good fit.
good,"On a typical day, I'd clock in then go check in with the board runner to see where they needed me (generally cashiering). Every two hours I'd get a 15 minute break and every 4 hours I'd get a 30 minute lunch. The hardest part of the job was probably just getting to know everyone I worked with and adjusting to the different ways they wanted things done. Other than that, its not a difficult job. I loved the work culture and the diversity in the warehouse. I have no complaints working for Costco the only reason I stopped is because I moved from WA state to Texas and a job transfer would have taken too long."
good,Great place to work at Costco they value your opinion and comments respecting your members and your employees and having a lot of fun working for Costco
good,"A typical day of work has you straightening pallets of product.  Moving them as necessary before the store opens.  Dropping pallets for the stockers as needed and making sure that everyone is on task.  After the store opens we engage in the front end by cashiering, greeting, or pushing carts."
good,la mejor enpresa para trabajar muy bien pagado con respecto a los demas autoservicios
good,After my interview a couple of days later I was offered employment. I accepted and advanced for work. Management was good and employees were super friendly and helpful.
good,"There are several positives to working at Costco, great pay, always busy at work and you have great coworkers. I still keep in touch with several of my ex co workers"
good,Excellent environment to work.  Good salary.  Opportunities to grow professionally.  Excellent benefits and good work  area.  Flexible work schedules.
good,"I enjoyed working at Costco, the only issue i had was that the front end job duties i feel were distributed unfairly, but that's not for me to say. Great job to have."
good,I was able to learn just about everything I wanted to know about a department even though it was not my department. The hardest part of the job really was dealing with the members and the returns
good,"Fast pace, all ways something to do.sometimes challenging (depending on what section you are asigned to or type of job). Sometimes it could be overwhelming"
good,Was really fn to work there. I got a seasonal position in the deli which pays more then the rest of the store as a clerk. worst thing about Costco is I got treated like a seasonal. I understand that vacation hours are earned and they go away if you don't use you're hours but our whole department started putting in for vacation as soon as the 3 seasonal got there.
good,"Working there was a giant stepping stone for me, I met a huge variety of people which gave me a chance to broaden my perspective in what field of work i wanted to be in."
good,I love working at costco. My managers have been super flexible with my schedule and allowing me to have a great work-life balance. People who want to advance receive that opportunity with opportunities to do supervisor-in-training or cross-train in other departments. We also receive time and a half Sunday pay which is great and paid holidays.
good,The work that done consist of alot of labour hard and physical work and I have to be on toes at all time when putting out every morning. At the end it all look good when finished.  The management is good and they know what they are doing
good,"I enjoyed working here as a front end assistant. The time would go by rather quickly for me. I would only work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday because of school but the days went by pretty fast because we would be busy. The supervisors and managers were really nice and understanding. The most enjoyable part for me was being able to cashier. The hardest part of the job was having to go outside and push carts no matter the weather condition, sometimes for over 2 hours."
good,"Was only there for a month due to being forced to move back home (1800 miles away), I'm a person who loves a job with a lot going on at once and this was one of those jobs. Coworkers were friendly and very helpful. The Costco CEO made me glad to be working for that company because he took pride in his employees. Should watch a video about the man."
good,"I had to unload the products off the freight trucks and stock them onto the shelves. Rotate stock the food and drink items, everything else was just put up. I had to do it in a very presentable way so it looked nice and natural on the shelves. The management wasn't half bad...but they need to communicate with their employees more. I was let go for not wrapping my pallets tight enough. The entire time, I thought I was doing it well. But, they let me go for it. Never told me once that I was doing something wrong. It would get pretty difficult at times, like lifting VERY heavy items by yourself over and over again. Some items up to 100 pounds. LIFT WITH YOUR KNEES! I really enjoyed the feeling though of clocking off after a long night and finishing that tough job! A very rewarding feeling."
good,"Cette nouvelle société, implantée depuis juin 2017, s'avère être une entreprise performante aux modes de management américain."
good,"A typical day at work was very fun and exciting, meeting the new costumers and communicating with them was always a rush of excitement. co workers were great and the management were also."
good,"I was only temporary help for a short while. I clocked in and met with my supervisor and was told what departments needed checking for inventory. I helped count items on the floor, took note of the items that needed to be ordered and once I was all finished I reported my calculations to the supervisor."
good,"labor intensive, good conditions, always under the pressure to make opening, they will train you, pay increases are by the hours you have put in. over all not bad."
good,It was very very hard to leave Costco.  They are like family and that is the culture they bring out.  I do kick myself for leaving this company sometimes.  I am still friends with most of my coworkers there and will continue  to be.
good,"Un excellent travail et bon service aux membres.au cours de mon emploi  j' ai été traité ,très bonne entréprise."
good,"Is a great company to work with great benefits and good place to advansement if you want to go farder with in the company."
good,"work with team members"
good,"The typical day Working at Costco would include, being very hand-on, always satisfying the customer as well as co-workers and management. Learning how to work better with others and solve each others problems. Managers at the store are very focused on making sure that every thing in store is how it should be. The hardest part of the job was getting the interview."
good,Costco is a grate place to work. a typical day consists of making  several different entrees cleaning and sanitizing the deli. I have the opportunity to work with grate management staff who are highly motivated and very encouraging.
good,the company is great to work for you get lots of benefits. the company knows how to keep there people happy and not sad
good,a typical day at work was ring up members. i learned not every member is the same so you have to go out of your way to make them happy. management was nice and help full if you ever had any problems. co-workers were helpful if you needed help with anything you or a member needed. 
good,"This is a good company to work for, I enjoyed myself but it was time to move on it's hard work some management is not doing their job and it make it hard on the workers"
good,"Really love working for Costco,the staff is great,management is great,all around great place to work.Fast paced,challenging work.Great benefits and job growth.There is nothing bad I have to say about the place. I’ve been working there for the last three years and truly enjoyed the experience."
good,"My time with Costco was truly a pleasure, they are very accommodating with your schedule. You'll quickly "
good,"Costco is a busy fast pace to work in but enjoyable."
good,working at costco is so much fun they have a good manangement on how to take care of there employees. working at costco it give you lots of experience improve my skills
good,Everyday was a daily date check up. Print out the daily and weekly produce sheet. Along with your signs in the area you will be putting in the produce. Then routine produce if necessary and clean and freshly produce is ready for the customers.
good,"Good Environment."
good,"great place to work, but need more of a work/life balance. not a lot of room to grow with the company. not many where houses in the area. need more of a bonus program for better employees."
good,Very cooperative bosses and cooperative coworkers. Break room was always clean and the workers were always socializing and friendly to each other. Made me feel like Costco was a second home.
good,"a typical day at costco is busy, ive learned howto manage my timebetter with completing tasks such has keeping the clothing folded and neat."
good,"Hardest part would be having to deal with rude customers since they are paying for a membership they are paying for you to treat them well too, a lot is expected from you."
good,"Learned a lot of information about fraud. Great place to work, everyone was friendly and always willing to show the newcomers things that might have not been taught and/or always willing to provide a helping hand"
good,"Great place/ good team/ hours were crazy, but it was a seasonal thing../ My whole paycheck ended up going to Costco just because I would see everything before it came. Opened up great opportunities"
good,I harder work doings cakes myself help other people respect .. support learn commutation teamwork good open honestly everyone ... that good learn commutation teamwork best true smile anytime I am deaf take time u
good,Easy to catch on and do what is told to do.  The best job I ever had yet.  Catch on quick on what to do and like to explore different departments in this area.
good,"Great company to work for, but it's difficult to get on full-time, which is what I was told by the majority of full-time employees.  Great employees and management!"
good,"i worked in the cafeteria and bakery, i got to help customers everyday, handled cash, cleaned and helped prepare food for the day, also cleaned everything at the end of the day."
good,My time at Costco was pretty good made some good friends in my coworkers and customers to. But the only two problems Costco have is some of the managers and supervisors bring their attitude from outside of work to the job talking to the employees any type of way. And the other problem is they don't care about your personal problems when it comes to them and you working
good,"Typical day at work is the same every day depending on what department you work for, don't expect for many different work situations. Management is terrible, they force you to work hours that do not work with a school schedule, and will force their culture of no friends, only work on you. If management does not want you there you will be removed, they will find any reason to write you up and suspend you. I have been employed for almost a year now and in 8 months I received 0 write ups, in the past 2 months I have been given 5 write ups and suspended once. Management told me that Costco is more important than my college, and I need to make more time for the job. Hardest part of the job is dealing with management pressing down on your neck. Most enjoyable part about the job is the people you get to work with."
good,"This was a very busy environment. A little too demanding sometimes but you learn to adjust yourself to your situations. I didn't get the hours I expected, but took what I could get."
good,The company while good to work for as a whole needed some help in the management at the Fremont location. Since I left several of the managers have also transfered to other locations. It seemed at many times that no one talked to anyone else and therefore had no idea what was going on
good,"Some management was really understanding to circumstances, others could care less. After corralling carts at night you have to help cleanup inside the store. Corralling carts is very fast paced and busy. If you take a breather, be discreet. You also have to clean up the parking lot while corralling carts."
good,"It's busy, but there were always problems with the scheduling. The is blatant favoritism shown towards supervisors from the upper management and so you will be understaffed depending on who is the supervisor is for the day. They only give you two days to work with your availability and scheduling is done on a seniority system. Not a good place for college students."
good,"Always a busy day"
good,"I learned a lot working at Costco’s , that I use in day to day living. Such as Patience ,and the Value of a dollar. Interacting with customers at my job showed me how to be more appreciative of the little things."
good,"This job is hard in regards to drama around coworkers. Management isn't great. The hours are terrible, but the pay is good.  It is best to get along with coworkers at all times."
good,"Depending on managment, its really who you are friends with to get promoted. Different schedule all the time. Lots of drama. Favoritism. But all jobs have that."
good,loved working as a sales associates in costco. got a chance to interact with lot of people and friendly environment. but there is no proper management of allotting shifts.
good,Learned a lot about tires to when you should have them changed due to the season and just a normal routine check up I also learned about little parts of the tires that are very important for the vehicle itself
good,"Working at night pulling order, working palette making sure that they were balanced, make sure that the right weight, make sure that all safe was use while using differ type of forklift, pallet jacks and other of hand held tools"
good,I defended myself to management about their double standards and it didn't go well. They were trying to get rid of me. Write ups for any silly reason so I had to quit so that my resume didn't say I got fired. Very unfortunate.
good,I worked seasonal wish I could have stayed permanent. I worked in different department. Wish I could have stayed in one department to get a hang of the department
good,"signing in, good customer skills service, not available management, varies, bathroom during calls, need more breaks....reward of satisfaction to the customer"
good,"it was a really good job to have but i was only for the holiday season witch was for 2 months i  would have loved to work longer for the company. I did call back after the holidays but was only given false information on being hired , they should be more honest."
good,Ability to adapt and not be overwhelmed easily will get you far. Great first job but unless you are willing to wait years before advancement not an ideal place to work.
good,"It was very fun experience working for costco... learned alot of things with great people, remodels. Overall experience i give iy a 10 +  I am planning to reapply..."
good,it was a nice experience was able to learn about new food and got to interact with others it was a fun experience even though I did not work there for too long
good,"Costco is a great career, if you don't have any job security it can be tough you can be fired or let go. Costco value there long term employees. Also the role of a new employee can be reviewed  by a employee with more seniority, which I thought was unfair. Corporate Costco is the best!!!!"
good,"Come in to work , Grab my cart to demo on for the day , grab my products to give out , and set up station . "
good,"I was a seasonal employee at Costco. I was hired last minute for seasonal positions and landed in the maintanence department. I cleaned toilets, swept floors, cleaned breakrooms/ offices, and took out trash. Management was always helpful. This job was very easy and lonely at times. My paychecks were the only thing I enjoyed about this job."
good,This company is the best company I have ever worked for! They knew what they were doing and tried to make sure I was learning all I need to.
good,"I loved this job for the time that I was there, I got great experience as an forklift operator."
good,"I was only there for seasonal help, but I was always busy. Most of the employees were pleasant and fun to work with as everyone works as a team. Dress code was a bit stuffy while working you had to wear collared shirts and often that made it hot and uncomfortable as you are constantly moving"
good,This particular didn't care for management. I have no problems with management but I found they were rude and disrespectful.I did not feel welcomed almost as if temps were just that..
good,It was working there but it was not worth it. The long wait to get the job and then the managers and morning shift for stocker is the worst. The managers are very unorganized and try to finish stuff last minute.
good,"Costco was a great company to work for. Unfortunately, the culture seemed oppressed. Many people displayed a happy face but they were really unhappy with management."
good,Smile until your cheeks hurt for members. Hard work and decent pay. Learned how to carry boxes and be yelled at by members. Most enjoyable part of the day was lunch for some cheap pizza.
good,"Pros: Paid holidays off, overtime on Sundays, part-time qualify for benefits, and you can get promoted really fast, two paid 15 min break, 1 unpaid 30 min lunch, 3 min grace period, 2 suspensions before termination"
good,I was fired because I wouldn't sleep with the manager I was happily married and only wanted to work not have an affair while I work the job was great .
good,"A typical day at work at Costco involves working your position while listen to managers complain and micromanage every aspect of what you do. While having them tell you everything that you can't do, and then you turn around and they themselves are doing it. Which is odd because you would want management to lead by example, but no manager at store 340 does. And don't get me started on the money hungry GM. He'd rather cut everyones hours to help make his bonus bigger than give people much needed hours and make those of us who are working. Do the work of 3 people during a days work."
good,It’s a great place to work! Great pay and great benefits. It’s a place people can make a career out of a advance throughout the system. They have a lot of resources and offer help when needed!
good,I worked there 10 years and moved up but hit a plateau. They offer great benefits and employees stay for many years. I would recommend Costco for cashiers and supervisors.
good,"Costco is a fast paced environment and offer many benefits to their employees."
good,"Arrive at site 1 hour prior to shift start.  Visual inspection done by assistant manager to ensure your uniform was correct.  Incorrect, go home, no pay.  If correct then check assignment list to see what you would be promoting.  Take note of assigned lunch break.  Set up table in assigned area, then pick up items required for assignment.  Help other demonstrators if necessary.  Begin completing promotion & shift forms."
good,"Good place to work."
good,While working at Costco Distribution Center it was a very up beat and productive place to work with lost of benefits and a great team to work along-side of.
good,The company really serves and puts the customer first. Costco has a variety of departments and you are pretty much trained to do almost everything also they are very diverse have all kinds of different people working.
good,It was a very easy clean environment and I learn a lot about operating different machine and people there were really friendly and helpful with everyone
good,"Great company to work for with good benefits and hourly pay. "
good,I had a good time working for Costco they expect there employees to be the best in customer service and fast paced work I enjoyed it I would work there again
good,"I retired from Costco and enjoyed my time as an employee.  I was treated with respect, earned a great salary and enjoyed working with the customers.  It was a great career."
good,Management was great.  Warehouse was kept so neat and clean. Casual attire.  Everyone that I came in contact with was always helpful and knowledgeable.
good,Un bel emploi qui conviendrait à tous; Beaucoup de possibilités futures.
good,"Good pay, benefits, timely performance reviews and flexible hours. Even as a seasonal employee, you're treated well. Was only there for a short time but would definitely go back."
good,"Fast paced, friendly people, good benefits, good pay, flexible hours,. Overall this is a great place to work with lots of job security and room for advancement."
good,I loved working there just didn’t like how the people like people who were there longer get to do more Nd pick jobs. When there’s actually good and better workers around
good,"Great place to work, competitive wages, nice benefits and room to grow.  I only wish the seasonal work became permanent, would have loved to stay and learn more."
good,Great place to work.  You can learn a lot of new jobs while working there. The hardest part of the job was setting up all the new inventory and learning where everything goes in the store.
good,Costco is a great place to work; the employees are all easy to get along with and the environment is always fun/positive. I recommend taking the job if you are offered one.
good,"servicio al cliente, eran muy atentos todos , el ambiente laboral bastante bueno"
good,"Es un área donde se aprende mucho, hay que ser rápido, creativo, y trabajar en equipo de forma correcta, hay veces que los gerentes presionan sin mucho éxito o sin liderazgo y hay falta de supervisores en cada área de mercaderías, grandes camaradas de trabajo."
good,"Great place to work & grow, meet good people... I’ve enjoyed working at Costco for almost 2 years now, don’t see me leaving anytime soon, An even if you do so, Costco is worldwide so you can move anywhere & still work for Costco."
good,"I really enjoyed working in customer service at Costco Wholesale. It was a great experience and an amazing company to work for, especially for a first job."
good,Good job for fulltime work. If you enjoy customer service work this is the place is the place for you. Fast paced environment. Warehouse work with pallet jacks
good,Everyday is always different with helping the members or working with your coworkers.  There is always a chance to move into different departments and move up the ladder of opportunity.  The company takes very great care of their employees and off the health benefits.
good,Their is a lot of  you scratching my back I will scratch yours . Theirs a lot of family members being hired...................:::::..........................
good,It was good. Nice environmemt and greeat coworkers great hours and career advancement opportunities are always available. Nice working with the public and different food to demonstrate
good,Es una de las mejores empresas para trabajar tanto en la paga como en el ambiente laboral
good,"Costco samples are well loved among members, food safety training is provided- Keeping busy throughout the shift is easy if you love the product your promoting- can seem long and boring if you don't."
good,This has been a quick and efficient process. From the moment I opened an email informing me of job offer until the time I finished filling out my application has not long or frustrating
good,"Excelente lugar para iniciar a trabajar y crecer, el unico pero que pondria son las politicas de imagen de la epoca del caldo."
good,"So I am not going to talk about my former employer. However, I left to find a more rewarding career, one that has life meaning to me, not because the company  has issues."
good,"It's a fast paced stressful job, but I was pregnant at the time and they took amazing care of me. I had a lot of difficulties even though I was in the beginning of my pregnancy, but they accommodated my morning sickness   and pregnancy difficulties and were great all season. It was a fun job, lots of work, lots of standing on my feet."
good,Working at Costco Whole Sale is a very good company to work for. I have been taught to cut meat and had the pleasure of meeting an awesome group of people.
good,costco is a great place to work! the employees are helpful and the customers are nice! never gets boring cause there is always something to keep you busy
good,"Great pay,great benefits , vacation and holiday pay. Very busy place. Must maintain a sense of urgency at all times. Making sure that members are treated with the up most customer service."
good,"There was a lot to learn with this company, they taught me leadership skills and customer service principles that led to me having success in the membership department."
good,"Good shifts, lots of available hours."
good,"A good place to work. Just too many weekend shifts. Very relaxing work environment. A typical day involve organizing merchandise displays, customer service and assisting cashiers."
good,"High volume amount of work, but easy to get through. Management, and co-workers were helpful, respectful, and easy to work with. A great job for a young person."
good,great experience working for a huge corporation like this. I would rate this company a overall high to be apart of. Great customer service experience.
good,learned great customer service skills. fun working environment. great co workers and supervisors. starts off with mostly physical work. rewarding feeling when helping members out
good,Great benefits and salary. Opportunity for advancement if you work hard. Management is tough. I did not like marketing the memberships. Work life balance is hard.
good,"great staff, great company, flexible hours, free membership, busy day that can be stressful at times but the technicians were a supportive team to work with"
good,Always enjoyed going to work. Amazing staff. Great bosses. Always a good work environment. Treated equally. Good hours. Shifts go by quick because you always have something to do.
good,"The business allows a lot of potential for growth, would recommend applying. Good benefits and management listens to you. Here I learned to develop my leadership skills, the directors and I maintained a special relationship. "
good,"Plenty of nice people to work beside. I was a seasonal employee, and in my experience as such there was a high sense of competitiveness between other seasonal employees. Mainly due to the fact that at the end of the season they would only keep 1 or 2 of them."
good,People are very friendly and approachable. good benefits even if you only working part time. i learned a lot especially in the deli department.They make sure all the area is clean and safe.
good,"I would recommend a job at Costco to anyone looking to make a career in retail. There are avenues for promotion and the pay is good. The work can be physically taxing depending on what department you work in, but you also receive good benefits if you work full-time."
good,Part time employees will struggle on getting more hours because of seniority. Aside from the hours the work was fast paced and fun. The hardest part of the job was trying to become full time.
good,Was an enjoyable workplace because they hours were fixed and they worked well with most schedules. Allowed you to get an early start to the day and make the most of it.
good,"Costco is the side of retail everyone wishes they could experience for their first job. The company gives priority to the treatment of its employees and ensures that their needs are met as much as that of the customer. My day to day was spent interacting with members, promoting the executive memberships to potential nonmembers, and in taking feedback for returns."
good,i like working there but dont start on front end you will be pushing carts. you will be paid fairly. they start at 15 an hour. please consider the amount of time.
good,Costco is a fun company to be apart of. The company provides great benefits and is employee and member focused. This made my time at Costco enjoyable.
good,"Great company to work for! Not only are there great benefits, but it is a great working environment. The fast paced environment makes an eight hour shift fly by."
good,"The co-workers here are really incredible. Everyone is so easy to talk to and always willing to help. Especially the supervisors, they do care about you and want you to succeed and they always give insight and tips & tricks so you  can perform better. Unfortunately, the small things throughout the day that are out of your control, can really be demoralizing and just ruin the experience."
good,"I have worked there twice and have applied there again. I enjoy the team they have in place, it's a fun place to work and the customers are and other employees make Costco what it is and why I go back."
good,"Costco Wholesale is a fast-paced, high stress work environment. They promote from within, and as such reward those who are passionate about their work."
good,"I love working at Costco. Great benefits for part time employees, and willing to work with your schedule as Im a college student.  And the pay is great also."
good,"Although I was only there seasonally, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the company and those who worked in it. I was treated like an adult at the 18 and given responsibilities to make myself a better employee for the company."
good,Costco is a very good place to work. Course they take care of you. I would be happy if they take me back. I used to work there as  cake decorator. I love this company. It's very lovely company.
good,I was very happy with my overall work experience there. I had no problems with management they were very understanding of pretty much any and everything that was going on inside of the store.
good,"You can make it an career. For fast advancement must be willing to relocate to a new store location. A lot of full-time positions but it's seniority-based, so it's a low chance for full-time if your dont have years under your belt. This company has the number one best health, dental and vision insurance. They match your 401k. You barely even pay for your prescriptions. They have best work parties. Offer free memberships for close family and or friends."
good,This was a very awesome place to work. Everyone was very outgoing and happy. The work place was a very happy and contagious one were no matter what at every turn there was always a happy face and friendly person.
good,"Requirements were fairly typical for a retail position. Their corporate structure is impeccable and you have direct access to management. Health and retirement benefits were amazing! The starting wage is more than most retailers and raises are given automatically after a year regardless of position. I didn't have the desire to stay in retail, but it is a great company to work for long term!"
good,It's not social hour Costco Wholesale. You go there to work. Great Benefits and retirement fund. Best part relaxed dress code. Great job for students.
good,"I left for health reasons, I love the company. The politics can be annoying sometimes, but it's generally a wonderful company. You have great benefits, guaranteed raises, and it generally low stress."
good,"i was pregnant while working there and was never uncomfortable or overworked. the management is very friendly and social. they have several break rooms and even game systems to help unwind during breaks. the customers are the hardest part of the job, but with enough practice will become easier to handle."
good,Enjoyed coming into work even as a part-time worker. The food court was a cheaper alternative to bringing my own lunch and delicious. Those above you would be happy to help out.
good,They really value you as a person. I love that the provide lunch breaks and also 15 minute breaks. If you are interested in transferring to another location they will do everything in their power to help you.
good,Costco is a wonderful company to work for they have many opportunities for advancement to management.You have to be a self starter and motivated to work hard and do any job the company needs you to fill.
good,"Great company to work for and eventually grow into if you are interested in a retail career. Once you top out on your salary range, Costco provides you with bonuses twice a year."
good,apoyo de la empresa para estudiar y trabajar y a desarrollarte dentro de la empresa.
good,I still recommend people to work at Costco! They really do value their employees and it shows. Everybody I worked with was always very happy to be there.
good,"When I worked at Costco Wholesale, The job was fast-paced and demanding! I enjoyed the motivation to constantly do more and improve myself as an employee! The Staff there was very welcoming and helpful; they left no question unanswered! They paid me fairly and they considered me as more than just an employee but as a person who is looking to succeed at the job they are given."
good,"Costco is one of the best employers I have had. They worked around my college schedule and were considerate of my priorities. On that note, they expect their employees to be focused on the tasks assigned and to execute it well. Everyone at Costco is generally very friendly and it is a positive environment."
good,Costco is a good company I moved out of state is the only reason I left. They are good to you and treat you right. Your always busy and its nice to work there.
good,working with member consumer is exciting all the time. meet different person. management is very understanding. schedules are flexible. people that you work with are very nice and respectful.
good,"This place rocks. I had worked there for just under 2 years and made a lot of good friends. Unfortunately I had to leave because the environment for me (with social anxiety) would leave me feeling very distraught and stressed on holidays, weekends when they were especially busy. There is room for advancement and they pay/benefits are great for retail. The one thing about the company is that advancement is based on seniority not necessarily work ethic/qualifications."
good,great place to work if you have time to commit to working your way up. The starting pay is fairly low but they do eventually pay their people a living wage. very physically demanding.
good,"Loved it here. Worked seasonal and the managers / co workers were great. Time goes by fast, work isn't too difficult ( some heavy lifting ) but it's overall great."
good,it is really fun to work there. all the members are very friendly. you can change shift according to your class time. busy every day. so time passes by easily. bus routes are there too
good,Solid job for those that do not have a specific job or passion.  It can get repetitive but if you dont have a lot of work experience or education you can advance within and its a great paying company that takes care of their employees
good,"Costco is a great first job to have, especially for students attending college. The skills I've picked up on are interpersonal skills, organization, decisiveness and working in a timely matter. The most enjoyable part of the job is the diverse amount of customers that walk through the doors everyday and being able to converse and learn from experiences."
good,"Fast paced, management friendly, coworkers and all employees for most part happy and friendly, positive work environment, enjoyed being around constant energy,activity,movement within the store"
good,"Costco is a great place to work. They offer awesome benefits, reasonable hours, easy going co workers and managers. Your work days keep you busy and productive that the day goes by fast."
good,I loved working here. Once I relocated things got bumpy. I got sick and health was a huge intake . I wish I could continue being apart of the Costco family. It's a great place to really get familiar in different departments.
good,"Would love to be hired on, the managers were willing to help and show you the ropes. It is fast paced but show you willing to work and you will be told that your doing good."
good,free samples and cool stuff. costco is a great company and a fun place to work. i would definetely recomend to anyone who enjoys customer service and cool people.
good,"A typical day of work at Costco starts off with clocking in of course. Then, immediately reporting to the board runner to see where you are needed. The board runner is the position at Costco which delegates where employees need to be placed in the store depending on the volume of members. You then stay in your position while providing great member service until you are relieved by another employee for breaks or the end of your shift. A couple things I learned while working at Costco was a good amount of patience and understanding. Both of these are good traits to have to help defuse any type of stressful situation. I also learned how to multitask in a very fast pace work environment. I would say the workplace culture is standard for this type of employment. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the high volume of members when the store is understaffed. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job was when the members acknowledged on a consistent basis how hard I worked."
good,the work atmosphere is great and the people you work with are always friendly. there is always room for growth in this company and I would recommend it to friends and family.
good,"Enjoyable coworkers- "
good,"A typical day would be to start work hard, then enjoy meeting new people with a very positive work environment.  The management were easy to work with and meet with.  Open door policy left you feeling welcome with any concerns.  The hardest part of the job was leaving.  I needed a full time job, and I worked here while holding a full time second job, so it did not work out for me at that time of my life.  I would gladly go back any time to this vibrant exciting atmosphere."
good,Pay is very competitive and wages are livable. Good work environment. Managers are friendly and value your opinion. I thoroughly enjoyed working there and would have continued if not for other career aspirations.
good,"Good place to work. Open communication format, extensive benefits and compensation, rewards and incentive programs. Availability of training and professional performance development opportunities."
good,I loved my job at Costco. only reason I left was due to the fact that they run off tenure and the tenure employees tried to treat new employees like slave and not as equal. Management would talk to you any way and when you went to complain about them nothing was done. I had a manger tell me while on refunds that I needed to learn Spanish when I asked him to translate.
good,"A nice place to work,family like atmosphere were your taught to learn every thing to stay ahead"
good,"a typical day ..replenishing supplies on shelves.  alot of heavy lifting,  restocking supplies , from clothing to deli to produce,,use of a pallet jack ... i learnt alot about safety in a warehouse environment.. the rules of 1st in 1st out applies to all product,, and how to be responsible for my own department .. the hardest part of my work was the heavy lifting and the most enjoyable part was seeing the end result of all the hard work ,it makes one feel good to see what you can achieve."
good,"It is indeed a good place to work, competitive salary and kind bosses.  They don't give you tough jobs. only those which is under your responsibilities and based on your ability"

good,"Tiene buenos horarios, felxibles por si estás estudiando, pero solo tienes un día de descanso a la semana. Puedes elegir tiempo completo o medio tiempo."
good,The pay is very good for retail and the benefits are excellent. Certain positions offer quite a bit of flexibility with schedules. Costco is closed for most of the major holidays and you get paid for them. Costco offers a fair amount of vacation and sick pay.
good,Costco is a great place to work other than dealing with the judgemental managers or being looked at differently because of your race. There's a plethora of opportunities to move up into the company with great benefits but only if you're kissing up to the store manager or someone higher. I've have my experience with some amazing coworkers and some that made me feel like I did not belong. If there were better people who treated everyone with respect and the same maybe it'll be a better workplace.
good,lo que mas me gusta  de este trabajo es la accesibilidad en los horarios.
good,Fun place to work and definitely had a good crew around me. The managers knew what they were doing and if problems arose they would adjust for it. This is definitely a top notch place to work.

good,You get what u put in. Your efforts pay off in time. It's the kind of company u stick with to see the long term benefits! At first the hours might not be what you're looking for but with patience and time u will be rewarded. Seniority is a priority for Costco managers.
good,Great workplace for anyone with no experience. Consistent raises. Great benefit packages. Every hourly worker is genuinely pleasant. Sunday’s are time and a half.

My manager would do anything in her power to help you whenever you need it! Always oppurtunities for more work in other departments. Hardest part of the job was probably being on your feet all day and scrubbing the floors, as long as you can keep a level head when dealing with exacting customers."

good,"Great place to work if you like fast paced and physical work.  Pay raises every 1,000 or so hours.  Starting out you might only get Part-time and no set schedule."
good,"A typical day at Costco would be talking to the board runner where they would assign you at a work station (front end, folding clothes, domestic, etc) and would work there until relieved to move to somewhere else. I worked as a front end cashier assistant most of the time. It was ok, very fast paced and manager would get on to you for stopping for a second to even stretch, which I found a little annoying. You would help the cashier by putting stuff on the belt, turning boxes barcodes up, boxing/bagging items, and any other task. Most of the cashiers had worked their forever and liked things done very particularly and were rude to seasonal employees. I felt like they did not enjoy their jobs and were rude to members but no one seemed to care. "
good,"If you looking for a good paying job, Costco is great but if you’re looking for a career, well you know the rest. Awesome perks but uncomfortable environment."
good,"Great place to work, fast paced, great co-workers and products you can believe in!  They seem to like hiring college / university students and had very low turnover while I worked there.  Costco is a company unlike much of their competition and it shows in the overall morale of the workplace!"
good,I enjoyed working for Costco. All of the people I worked with were friendly and helpful when I was a new employee. I think the hardest part of the job was retrieving the shopping carts from the parking lot.
good,Company was very good at maintaining safety standards. All necessary tools and safety precautions were provided with regular re-training of new rules and regulations
good,"As an employee of Costco for 16+ years, I started working in the warehouse before transferring to the buying office.   This allowed me to know what happened in the warehouse when buying for the different departments I handled in buying.   It taught me how the warehouse worked (actually opened a new location so there before it was open to public) and then in turn how the whole buying process worked."
good,"I am enjoying working in Costco, managers and colleagues are very nice, but the working time is flexible and salary is pretty reasonable. I love this place."
good,"they have you where ever they want you, you never work the same thing everyday they cn have you pushing carts one day and another day folding clothes.

good,Costco is a very competitive place to work as getting in is very difficult seeing as they usually only hire and promote from within more than they hire from outside the circle. The location of where I was at had many friendly staff and fellow co-workers who were more than willing to train and show me how to do the job properly and correctly.
good,Well structured environment with a strong culture. Repetitive job but if you are looking for employment in a friendly company with good safety protocols then this may be for you.

The culture was relaxed, everyone worked hard but conversation while working was common. Management was great, they stepped in when needed and had good working relationships with their crew.

The most enjoyable part was the conversations with my fellow employees."

good,Costco really offers great benefits. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry members. The most enjoyable part are meeting new people all of the time and becoming close with the people you work with. Management definitely depends on the people that work at your warehouse. Some are by the book and some just do whatever they want.
good,"Costco provides anyone who works there the opportunity to be successful.  If one is willing to work hard enough, the can make well over six figures as the climb the management chain.

good,"I loved my job at Costco as well as all of my co-workers. Management had some great people Sue & Nina and the other girl in office - name began w/a ""P"" awesome trio. Other female management-jealous/spiteful and not nice. Male management pretty great. Brandon, Mark, Seth etc. Too bad they couldn't see through the lies the female management person (K) told upon reviews she knew nothing about. They throw away all returned products for no reason-how wasteful! Why can't it be donated? Pay is great/work is HARD- know what you are getting into if you want to work there. Don't give into a bad review-I did and regret it. I liked my job a lot and let the ignorance of ONE person get to me and I quit. BIG MISTAKE. Well, now I know. Other employees (after the fact) said they got bad reviews as well but they didn't quit like I did. It was a GREAT place to work-it was one bad apple in the bunch that made it a bad experience for me. I also had THE BEST supervisor and crew to work with. Great guys. Miss everyone!"

I enjoy working with all of my co-works I meet someone new everyday there are that many people working there. Every day someone teaches me something new, or helps me improve on something to make it better for myself while I am working. The hardest part of my job is leaving it at the end of every night.

A typical day a work would be is communicating with members of Costco by answering questions they might have on products Costco offers and concerns they have towards it. Also helping the cashiers load and unload the products in and out of the cart and helping Costco maintain a clean environment. Sometimes this can vary because you can be helping out in other departments too which can be beneficial as you gain experience. Management at Costco are there to help anytime it is needed and are there to help excel an employees skills by telling them what improvements they can do and what additional tasks they can perform in order to achieve a certain goal. The employees at Costco are very friendly and are there to help another co - worker when they are in need.

good,"This was a great place to work in, I loved the people I worked with, you always had an open door policy when it came to needing to address something with management, management was always willing to listen, compromise, co workers were easy to get along with, every single day was never the same. Always interesting :)"
good,The job security is great and the benefits are almost unbeatable.  Job advancement is subpar and corporate management lacks a lot knowledge of the retail business.  Hard to make advancements at a certain level and pay raises are very slow.  Typical staff is a hit and miss.  Very hard for the employer to terminate bad employees.  Company lacks any disciplinary guidelines to rid themselves of bad employees who are hurting the Costco brand.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of cashier duties,front end duties,and maintenance. I learned alot at Costco,things such as providing great costumer service and working in a family environment. There management looked after the younger employees making sure that we did the job right and were always working or finding something to do. I would say the hardest part about the job was ringing up all the items for all the people that shop at Costco because it could 50 people in one line on certain days. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the positive attitudes that my coworkers had including myself."
good,"Decent pay, good hours, greet customers,and process transactions."

good,"enjoyed working, good co-workes, management was nice."
good,"The company as a whole is terrific but I cant say that for every store that represents Costco. I worked at a Particular store in GE and while there for a year I have witnessed favoritism, casual relationships on all levels, and discrimination to name a few of the things that changed my perspective of Costco and not in a good way."

good,Organize products in each aisle and provide customer support
good,"Wonderful place to work. Customer service was a must. As a cashier, a positive attitude must be in full effect! Being clean and having a clean and safe place to shop was also a factor. No time to lean or stand around, there was always something that had to be done. Working well with others as a team, also made the job a lot more smooth and easier to do"
good,I worked for this company for almost 20 years. It is flexible and friendly. The pay and benefits are competitive. They are willing to train you and move you around when you need a change.
good,I think if you don’t have a family and are willing to put the time in it’s a great company overall but if you got a family  then money and time is not in your favor
good,"There the work was constantly on your feet, moving about the store and demonstrating products. There were some days that you would have to work in the refrigerated section of the store, and your whole body would be cold all day long."
good,"Pros: Flexible scheduling hours, Slow-paced, some friendly co-workers, easy training, recommended for first-year college students, 15 minute break and 30 minute break for each shift, you can be scheduled as a breaker for a shorter shift, sell food samples to considerate Costco members"
good,"Agree with management, you will do fine.  Be enthusiastic.  Be willing to work the worst schedule and always close, you will get a chance to work better hours the longer you work there. Remember, managers are schooled at ""Costco,"" not necessarily ""management."""
good,Great place to work. Great pay. I had a personally difficult experience but I feel that it would be a great place for anyone. There benefits are great and their pay is exceptional.
good,"Costco is a very good place to work. Typically your coworkers are great people. Direct managers can be great, or not good at all. Advancement is encouraged."
good,"Working for Costco for 21 years was very challenging at times although I have to say I did love it,  I learned a lot about people different personalities different  issues it did actually teach me a lot, I really do and did enjoy people and working with the different personalities. I enjoyed my job whether it was on the floor assisting people,  in the pharmacy , or if it was working at the register  "
good,The job is very physical. Cashiers are supposed to have assistants but don't always get them. They were very good about working with my school schedule.
good,It was a good place to see how to work in an environment like that which is fast paced and always running tight on schedule. Though management made most days difficult.
good,Me encantaba mi puesto de asistente en food court de Costco.
good,Management is great to work with. You meet a lot of good people who work and shop there. Personal skills will dictate how you percive the vast amount of duties and members that you interact daily.
good,"Costco is a great company with wonderful benefits and programs.  However, my current store's management hinders the whole appeal of Costco as a whole with discriminatory and personal bias acts.  Management should be review by corporate on a quarterly basis to ensure they are upholding the high standard Costco expects.  I love the company, but the store's management is unfair in all aspects."
good,Good place to work just don’t get to good in the food court or they will make it hard for you to transfer inside the wharehouse .other than that it was a good group of people and a fairly enjoyable place to be employed
good,The hardest part would be lifting heavy things hourly. Fast pace environment therefore there isn't a second of time to just sit and play around. stay active.
good,"Très belle entreprise,beaucoup de possibilités d`avancement...travailler tous les fins de semaine qui est difficile..."
good,"Most of the time, it isn't the job itself that we don't like. Its the people we work with. people seem to take advantage of their power and forget...."
good,"Amazing place to work fun, productive good mangers friendly staff. The workplace was safe and made a priority also managers were always making sure the work environment was appropriate and safe. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to maintain the work and enjoy the work environment. The hardest part of the job was making all the customers happy."
good,it is an amazing choose of career i got to learn more about prescription glasses. I was responsible to make sure the lenses were cut properly as well to make sure the were install on the frame
good,"Work at Costco is an amazing experience, the pay and benefits are great, management takes some things a little too far, they get wrapped up in their ""authority"". I was with them for 20 years. I enjoyed every minute I was there when they were a scratch bakery, now they are a 95% frozen to bake, bakery."
good,A amazing environment and fun place to work but needs help with management. the over all job is a plus i would check so of the rules and adjust to fit the business and current time.
good,"It was fun to work at Costco, because you always stay busy and your co workers all work as a team. People are very friendly and management is always there when you need them."
good,Great place to work for someone who loves retail. I love the staff and the employees. Its hard to balance a personal life outside of work with the demanding work schedule.
good,early morning start but learned how to put freight away with forklift and also how to merchandise and build focus displays. kinda like working in high school when it comes to employees work ethic. really not a hard part to the job. my most joy was clocking out to go home.
good,"It is a fast pace work place you have to be very flexible with hours and your weekends, you work and solve problems and have to like people because you always work with the public."
good,"Very good job for students and people who are willing to learn about customer service and marketing and want to advance in the company's hierarchy. If you are someone with a strong character and don't like to be told what to do, Costco is not the right place for you. Same as any other jobs, management could be better but also look forward to excel in whatever it is that you do."
good,"Good place poor pay scale"
good,"I started when the season was november until January, i was employed the front end cashier which gave me the responsibility of large orders for shops and company to buy there goods as a member of costco this involved counting stock and providing a good service for the company's policy of production at a fast pace to give a good shopping experience. i was also trained to cash up my own till at the end of each shift and to help as a team to tidy store daily. the lifting was hard work as multi -buys yet satisfied customers was a reward."
good,"Great place to work.  You start with a good wage, regular pay increases and paid federal holidays off.  Good esprit de' corps among employees."
good,"Maintained an open flexible schedule demonstrating products, interfacing with retail customers while promoting vendor quality. I learned quickly that having a team of 32 under you was a balancing act when it came to associated calling in sick or just all around having a bad day. I was able to learn how to deal with problems that seemed to come up out of nowhere as soon as the shift began. The most enjoyable part of my job was selling the product to the public and for them to be amazed at how delicious the said product was. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the emotional turmoil so many employees walked into work with. I am a firm believer that no matter what is going on at home leave it at the door. I learned alot while moving up from demonstrator to supervisor I was able to learn every step of the process of demonstrating product to ordering and stocking the product."
good,"Overall Costco was a great place to work, however when it came to an open door policy management merely turns their cheek and disregards conflict happening in the warehouse."
good,"It was a very comfortable place to work in, the hardest part was dealing with grouchy customers because the food wouldn't be ready."
good,"Faced most challenging tasks here at current job, working on remedy ticketing is my daily driver, Well co-ordination between every team in full life cycle."
good,Fast paced environment dealing with members. Running a cash register helping pack and unpack the baskets. Selling memberships to best suite the members. Attending to members needs pushing carts and helping members with shopping and other needs they may have.
good,"like all retail places costcos hours sucks bottoms and blows flutes!"
good,"Going to work everyday, I knew it would be another adventure with fun people and interesting members."
good,My experience while I was working at Costco was quite challenging and I got to deal with difficult customers.I really enjoyed the days I worked there
good,"My job at Costco has given me lots of opportunity to learn many different positions ,the company posts many job placements that are open during the year for higher positions thruought the warehouse by bidding for positions goes by senority and how many write ups attendance  etc,started out as cart pusher went to asst for front end  now in gas station very good company to work for."
good,loved the people i worked with but management was a pain to work with when dealing with a school schedule
good,"I run the photo lab in Costco, and I enjoy most of my day at work. I love photography so getting to print photos and help others with their photography needs is a big plus."
good,"I would have to work under very high heat weather conditions, and the company was great in providing refreshments. Every co-worker was friendly and easy to speak to. At this job, I was given the opportunity to work under little supervision. The worst part of this job was the weather when it was more than 100 degrees outdoors."
good,My time with Costco has been very enjoyable. Very fast paced and friendly. You learn a lot in a short amount of time as they try to make it easy for everyone to keep moving.
good,Be aware of surroundings! No job security... As a job do what need to be done for you and your family and be on time... make sure you enjoy your job at all times
good,"Working at Costco is great for the benefits, but bad for predictable scheduling. The schedule comes out each week and is unable to be changed. All employees receive full benefits."
good,"The management and staff are very helpful with you learning how to succeed with your day, Customer service is important and fun, showing them were items are and seeing them smile is satisfying,"
good,"Very nice place to work. If you do not have a membership, weather your seasonal or not you get an executive membership. Mangers are very nice and will help if you have any questions."
good,"Prestaciones de ley, seguro social seguro de vida."
good,"I was relatively siloed in the pharmacy, cant speak for front end work though it seems like the overall culture of the managers is friendly and accommodating"
good,I enjoyed working at Costco because they taught me much more than I already knew about customer service. It was a great experience to build on the skills that I had previously acquired.
good,My dept manager sucked very un-professional lied constantly would   Discriminate On all other workers. Had supervisor and manager work together in the manager and I was a closer and would blame me for not knowing how to do certain things. No manager or supervisor ever trained me I learned on my own. Very great company but very poor management.
good,"A typical day is very straightforward. There is nothing difficult about working here. The work can be mastered in a very short time. "
good,"long interveiw process drugs test, back ground check etc , unfortunately I was only temporary so could not see the jobs full potential .. wage was good over time on weekends"
good,It was a great place to work very customer friendly . The other employees were great overall great place to work and also shop. I worked more on the holiday schedule
good,Great company with good Benifits annual pay raises growth opportunities fast paced hard working high expectations some micromanagement vibes good overall
good,"Costco is a great company with great health benefits, 401k, etc... Takes quite a while to move from part-time to full-time with all benefits and additional compensations."
good,"Overall Costco is a great career place as it comes with benefits for both part and full time employees. They also have a great incentives  for long term employees. "
good,This specific warehouse is very busy and sometimes the people can be childish but the job itself isn’t bad and the benefits are great. Just wish we made a little more than the minimum wage.
good,"I worked there for about four years and I cant say it was easy all the time. I started off working nights, 5:45-10:45. I then became morning opener witch starts 6am-230pm. Work place was always fast, employers where great helped each other when needed. Managment was always changing,  supervisors where always changing as well and that's where it was difficult for us employees. Overall it was a great warehouse to work in and for."
good,A lot of favoritism with certain people you have to kiss butt to move up just do your job and stay out the way and out of people business so you don’t get caught up in gossip
good,"En lo particular Costco es una gran empresa que se preocupa por mantener a todo su personal capacitado y con planes de entrenamiento en todas las áreas de la operación, tanto en bodegas como en cedis."
good,The benefits were really great management seems a little confusing and organized. No real training unless you need to drive a forklift. Advancement was easy for the people they liked. Would not recommend a job for anyone over 30.
good,"Costco takes care of its employees. Many different avenues you can be apart of. You do have to interact with members who can be difficult sometimes. Management in the PNW is stagnant, would need to relocate to advance ranks in the warehouse. Corporate offices are great to be a part of. Lots of busy work, but way less member interaction when part of the Buying Team."
good,"Learned Quick, your on a hustle when its closing time need to stock everything what it needs. Lifting 50lbs+ helping your co-workers to finish the job."
good,"Super productive but very high stress.  Work wasn’t hard and did have fun with coworkers. High number of managers & supervisors. The most enjoyable part of working there was being able to have fun with my coworkers and interact with customers. Hardest part was how stressful the job was. What I learned was to be quick, confident and being able to work under pressure!"
good,"From day one, the employees and management teams welcomed me and took time to train me."
good,Overall a very well run company.  Great benefits and compensation for retail.  Schedule isn’t always good for a healthy work life balance but that’s to be expected in retail.
good,Costco is a very challenging place to work. You have to be in good physical shape for the work. Once you pass probation there is lots of room to advance.
good,I Loved my boss and co-worker. Had fun with customers & had great conversations. Had manageable hrs and was very close to home. Lunch was never a issue.
good,I love the job I do but the hours required are difficult with a family.  Being a salary manager can mean you are required to work 6 days a week (get paid only 45 hours)  or work a 10 hour day and only get a 30min break.
good,After Jim Sinegal stepped down the culture changed as well as the business model.   Mission statement # 1 is to take care of the member and we stopped doing that very thing.
good,"Great place to work"
good,Costco is an amazing company to work for and has great benefits. Job can be very stressful because of the amount of work and pace. Management is all over the place because of how large the bussiness is and communication is always lacking.
good,I appreciate Costco for the opportunity but it did not work out. I did a lot here and got paid bare minimum and theres no budge in career advancement.
good,"I worked there for 15 years. It was a great company to work for. Although the hours were inconsistent, and included nights and weekends, the time off given was awesome!"
good,Una cultura laboral muy positiva que transmite mucha energía hacia todos sus colaboradores.
good,The work ethic that I've learned from this job was amazing. Really set me up to success in the long term. professional management which only would lead to professional outcome on the first line of client interaction. I find that to be key to a successful business.
good,"I loved working here, but there is no room for advancement. Everyone makes the same money, even if you're bad at your job. And, you can't work more than 28 hours."
good,"Working at Costco was incredibily fast pace with a constant amount of customers coming and going, but because of that you wont be idle or bored at work."
good,working for the company of Costco is amazing but the management to make the environment succeed has to match the company and it doesn't.  the work hours is inconsistent and you do not have an outside life.
good,"The hours they gave you were sufficient for a part time job, the department was pretty slow compared to other parts of the store, they gave us a premium for working on the peninsula."
good,pay rate is very good. its  very fast paced company. managers can be something else sometimes but good benefits and job parties. great supermarket job.
good,"That's as simple as that, they respect timeliness and willingness to earn your pay. It does not go unnoticed what you do in a normal work day/week and you are counseled about performance often so you stay on the right track."
good,"I worked in the deli, and that was the most stressful job I have ever had. I usually got stuck making the rotisserie chickens, and that was awful. Then on top of that, I had to close a lot. Closing routines took forever to complete and no one was willing to help. I usually got out 1-2 hours after my shift was supposed to be over. I tried several times to transfer to a different department with no luck."
good,"the management was very stressful to deal with, and they constantly were moving me around from department to department. The pay was great but the advancement wasn't. I was not allowed to become full time."
good,tengo mucho cariño y respetoa esta empresa ya que fue la primera que me dio la oportunidad de laborar sin contar con experiencia en ella aprendi muchas cosas y me dio muchos cursos
good,Costco wholesales tends to provides their members with quality good service at the lowest affordable rates. we take good care of our members and employees.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture, everything is very upbeat and positive, they pay well, and raises are based off of the amount of hours you work, and benefits are even provided for part time employees."
good,Had to stand constantly; greeting customers and meeting new people was a plus; good pay; good food to demonstrate: got to select hours to work; the manager was terrific to work for.
good,I was able to communicate with all customers to explain products and demonstrate it. It was a easy job just getting product prepare to explain to the customers how to warm up each food. The hardest part was trying to get work hours because other employees that were there for 13 yrs had the best work hours and the new employees had to take the worst hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving others and meeting interesting customers.
good,I enjoyed working at Costco. It was fast paced and you were always busy. Nice people to work with and very helpful .They were also fair in how they treated their staff.
good,"good place to work, many opportunities to advance and move around in the company. "
good,"Développe mon sens du service à la clientèle."
good,The day depends on the individual so i can only speak for myself.  I enjoy doing what i do cause i take pride in my work and ignore all the gossip and politics that take place in a workplace.
good,You're on your feet for majority of your day on concrete.It is a very physical demanding job but the pay and the benefits are among the best in retail.
good,"I worked seasonally in the food court and I enjoyed my coworkers the most. They start you the same pay rate no matter where you start. The work/life balance is attainable once you've been there for years but most people who work there do not leave, so this make advancing more difficult. I know a girl who's worked there 15 years in the food court and has extreme back pain from bending to make pizzas, just know this isn't easy work and you get what you put in. Great company but be a hard worker or you won't get anywhere, which is a good way to live, but be careful and take care of yourself as well."
good,"Great company to work for. Very proactive instead of typical reactive retail mindset. Great pay and benefits. Warehouse, casual setting. Closed daily for lunch and closed Sundays."
good,"This is a GREAT place to work. The job security is good, pay is great and benefits are amazing. The supervisors and managers though were almost never on the same page. They would blame the people more than they would blame the system. Which in turn caused employee morale to decrease because we never felt like we were doing a good job."
good,"I had an awesome time working there, hope to go back next year again.Everyone is helpful and respectful, never had any issues with any other employees."
good,"This company has the best benefits of any company, hands down. They teach you how to be the best in your department while providing excellent customer service to the members."
good,love working there lots of good people and managers. room for people to advance and grow the company. there is a very good health care program and retirement funds
good,"Typical day at work is helping cashiers out or pushing carts and cleaning the parking lot. Usually after that they have you stock or clean up the aisles of merchandise. I learned how to move fast and efficiently. A lot of managers, sometimes they do not communicate with each other. Very nice co-workers. Everyone gets along with one another. Hardest part of job is to learn everything without a lot of training, once you learn it's not too bad. Most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers. All are really friendly."
good,"Great company to work for, co-workers are on the same page and lots of room for growth and advancement. Typical work day was tiring and hard but rewarding."
good,"They treat their employees very well, pay is great and benefits are wonderful. The staff is great and they really care about you as a person."
good,"Typical day at work answering phone calls filing and pretesting patients you have to be a great multi- tasker"
good,"The company is good and the work pays well for the responsibility. Much of the management is incompetent however and positions rely much of the time on who one is related to rather than acumen. In addition, it is difficult to focus on individual employee needs as the culture is in flux and the employee is now circumvented in lieu of sales/production."
good,its fast pace short breaks and productive environment members are sometimes friendly co workers are interactive and some of the managers are really nice
good,I enjoyed working for Costco.  I worked whatever hours were assigned to me day or night.  I was on time and did productive work.  I stocked shelves loaded and unloaded boxes of items on shelves and made sure it was neat.  I had no problems with whatever was assigned to me
good,"Customer Service is what I do and I loved being at Costco because I love working around people and helping people when they need help. My coworkers where really nice, management was ok."
good,"great benefits with health, eye, dentist at an 80/20 splite, and good rate of pay, flexible schedule, good opportunity to move up."
good,"Costco was and is an extraordinary place to work for the compensation package is grade A its hard work but good work "
good,"very fast paced environment, make sure you are always on time, and always follow the rules. great starting pay no matter where you start in the company and great benefits also and if you're there long enough bonuses!"
good,"Worked as a cashier. I helped very many people everyday, Being polite and respectful is the key factor when dealing with a large amount of people. I was also apart of pirouetting the Capital One Mastercard. That included talking to over 100 people a day about what product was and how it could work for them, I and a few of my co-workers has to learn everything about it and work together to ensure are customers understood what it was."
good,"I absolutely loved this job had it not been for the Bakery manager. He was constantly rude, and talked down to all his employees. The other store managers did not seem to care about this concern, even though the turn around rate in the bakery is absolutely absurd. We were unable to finish training the majority of employees before they would quit."
good,"Typical Day Clock in see where where I was going to be ..Front Door Greeter or Exit to audit members purchases receipt. Or front end being Cashiers assistant. Gladly went to various departments that needed assistant.My shifts varied which was awesome to me. Willing to do whatever it takes to get jobs completed in a timley manner..Making sure  while editing receipts at door my members children were given their favorite smiley faces on their hands..or receipt..to the children this was MAJOR IMPORTANT.an to parents as well.Learning from management more knowledge on perfecting my skillsin Member Service an to Costco as a whole.My co workers were good to work with, they were like a family.trying to sooth an upset member,or child having a melt down. Over all my most enjoyable was knowing that when I walked out at the end of the day I had delivered my very best no matter where I was assigned to work.It,s the part your are and have made a winning contribution to yourself and to your company."
good,"comfortable, easy,  near home, I would return if asked. I would like to have worked in the pharmacy. The work hours were fair."
good,Costco is a great place to work through the in and outs of the company. Great environment filled with people of the same mind set as myself which is to work and work hard.
good,Costco brought out the best in people they allowed you to show your potential.
good,"Worked at Front end, was productive and well paid though very demanding physically due to all the lifting and long hours."
good,"Not a bad place to work, if you a young person wanting to move up it would be a great job"
good,"Busy"
good,Gotta be energetic. Fast pace environment. Co-Workers are friendly.
good,Great Benefits and Pay Scale. Co-workers are very friendly and make you part of the family right alway.
good,"A typical day at work changed everyday, I would either be working outside collecting shopping carts from the parking lot, or inside helping fellow co-workers or customers."
good,"Costco is a great company that always seems to be in the black. I learned a great deal from the 6 yrs that I was employed there. I was able to work in several different departments including: cashier, customer service, sales, merchandising, and some marketing. I thoroughly enjoyed working in the team enviornment that was presented and still keep in touch with co-workers and supervisors to this day. Job advancement was very difficult as Costco usually promotes strictly within house. It was difficult to balance school and work while I was employed there."
good,"As far as Management goes, be ready to do and work whatever it takes to get the job done. Great teamwork,everyone works long and hard."
good,"Always busy, counting members coming through door, maintaining proper tempratures in all coolers and fridges, counting dvds etc. handing out coupons"
good,It was a nice work enviorment and very productive enviorment and the employees and management are very helpful and it is like a family everyone looks out for each other.
good,A large wholesale company with great growth within the company.Great pay and great benefits.
good,"Costco as a company is by far the best Retailer I've worked for. The only issue I had was with the hiring manager. At the time that I worked their they only haired the female workers, but none of the male workers. I'm sure other Costco's are different though."
good,"Awesome place to work just not enough hours to be able to pay rent, bills, and  everyday household needs, on top of that groceries and providing for a pet too"
good,"Being an employee you are automatically a free member of any Costco. "
good,No sabía que hacer para seguir con ellos por que hacía mi trabajo bien y rápido y ayudaba al compañero a hacer el suyo ya que el era más lento y yo lo hacía encantado y creía que eso lo verían .también me  encargaba de las flores que son delicadas
good,"It was great experience working in this organisation."
good,I liked working there but it got hard sometimes when the customers get frustrated. the staff and workers are very helpfull and friendly. but the shifts was kind of scaterd and random
good,Costco was a good job but management wasn’t so good so I quite but I had a fun time working there coworkers are nice hardest part about the job was just getting up. Most enjoyable part about the job was just interacting with everyone typical day would be just stocking and make sure everything was in order from dates
good,"Costco is a very nice place to work in. I was working at the CIO level, they were all approachable, nice."
good,I am so excited  to work in Costco i hope I have a fun time working there and help my family pay rent and help them to go on vacation together and have a fun time
good,"Great opportunity if you are willing and ambitious. Nice benefits and wages."
good,"Great job for those with no drive and or ambition to make a difference in their work place. Fast paced at times , overtime is voluntary but helps get to top wages faster . wage based on hours of service not quality of work or productivity."
good,"I worked the seasonal position and learned a lot. I enjoyed working the front end, the bakery, deli, and clothing department. Costco supervisors are always will to help and answer questions. All seasonal employees are required to do jobs like gas station, cart pushing, and maintaining cleanliness around store. You can expect to be very busy at all times."
good,"Walk in and set up bakery for the day...."
good,En general es un gran empresa muy buena paga y un ambiente de trabajo estable
good,"The specific warehouse I worked for in Redwood City was pretty cutthroat. But if you kept your head down and just worked your shift the days went by pretty quick. Lots of politics and gossip that was difficult to avoid from time to time. Supervisors would talk down on a lot of the basic workers."
good,"Great place to work, they pay is very good. I worked as a deli associate, which also includes the rotisserie area. Prepare cold ready to eat foods. They pay and benefits make it all worth it."
good,Great place to work if you don't mind working nights and weekends. I wanted to move up in the company but didn't want to work nights and weekends but that is what management was doing also so it only made sense to move on.
good,enjoyed working at costco. 5+ years of service. applying for other positions i was overlooked by newer employees with less experience and less education.
good,Very nice place to work.  They are flexible and treat you like family. I had to have a surgery and they were great to work with.  It's nice to have benefits as a part time worker but the weekend work really got old.
good,"Great place to work. Great insurance, pay, hours. Need to work on favoritism and hiring too many relative but overall I recommend people to work here all the time."
good,"Every person is a pair of hands at Costco. even if you are assigned to a specific department you will be cross trained to work in other departments which is always a nice switch up. the long timers are typically miserable they just stick around for the benefits, bonuses, seniority, and pay. I mean if you can over look all the unhappy people you have to work with in the warehouse its a great job."
good,You need to be ready to work very hard and have unregular shifts. Other than that it is a fun and high paced place. You are always expected to be moving or doing something and the managers tend to take out their bad days on the rest of the staff.
good,Hard to work here if you want to chill and relax. Management makes it even worse. Favorites will always have a better time than you if you get on their bad side.
good,"Job Culture and environment is highly appreciated. it is productive and fun workplace, there is always good team work, and staff are very happy to help each other."
good,"Despite only being 21, I've worked with a fair amount of companies to clearly see Costco rises above others. The things I like about Costco far out way the things I don't like. Good pay, benefits, customer service experience, organized company, helpful superiors, and awesome products (plus they are open to school/busy personal schedules). However it's fast paced, commitment & responsibility necessary, clientele can be obnoxious, and not always the best training procedures."
good,"Holidays are stressful, depends on your department. Work isn't too challenging but can be repetitive. Easy to Advance or change departments. Raises are every 700 or 800 hours."
good,The company allows you to complete tasks as you deem best.  I enjoyed their flexibility.  It allowed for a great deal of creativity with problem solving. Management is hit or miss.  The do as I say not as I do management is common.
good,"Costco it's a great job to work if you like teamwork, making lots of friends and have variety of departements to work :) At Costco, the managers are very friendly and help you whenever you need, and they have great leadership"
good,I really enjoyed my time at Costco! Even though i was seasonal i was still getting good hours and pay! Sundays were my favorite due to the fact they pay you more! Over all i would definitely recommend to everyone!
good,"Front End is a repetitive task based position. The physical toll on the body (especially back) from performing the same actions at a rapid pace for 6-8 hours per day for long periods of time is unforeseen. The supervisors tell you exactly what to do all of the time, and after a while you realize that working in this department as a cashier or assistant does not require you to use your own brain at all. Working in this department gets extremely stale and painful. "
good,"My day at Costco,   Lets see, I get to work and am immediately told to clean the Lobby (where people eat the food and hang out )  Then, I clean then kitchen.  After that I haul trash.  If I have time I prepare the dough to rise.   Maybe I'll wash dishes after that.   I work as fast as I can and I show up on time.   As far as training, Costco did not invest much time in me.  Promises were made, but no actions taken."
good,"I got hired at CostCo and gave it my all. I picked up extra shifts, came in on my days off, stayed, late, come in early, learned multiple departments, etc. I was hired in the summer time and worked outside a lot. CostCo has a full staff of about 70% attractive young women. So you can guess who the male supervisors would stay inside(the females), and who would stay outside. (me) I can remember several times when the heat index hit between 107-111 degrees outside and ""everyone does 30 minute rotations"" to make sure no one has a possible heat stroke and for some reason they always forgot about me being outside...for an hour and half. But the girls? 15 minutes tops and they were back inside. Those three times I was left outside my clothes were drenched and we had a minute break where I changed my clothes on said occasions. Those times the stalls were being used, so I had to wait to change. I was 1 minute late on two of those three occasions, and was let go because of ""Multiple tardies from lunch"" which is true, but I did so to have non sweat drenched clothes."
good,"The pay is great, there are good benefits that come with it. But management can be very pushy & not understanding most of the time. You are able to transfer to other stores or other departments if you'd like a change. The Stores are very busy so be prepared to work hard."
good,"Costco was a very great place to work. The company has great benefits and great staff. Also, they treat you very well. There is plent room for growth and opportunities"
good,good for college students or anyone looking for part time. the job itself is very physical and fast paced. many different departments to move around to if you aren't happy in your department
good,Costco was an amazing place to work. The management is super friendly and accepting. Costco pays great wages and always gives room to improve. The job is busy and always full of something to do. I would defiantly recommend working there.
good,The company is a good company to work for. The hardest part of the job I had was communication between managers and hourly employees. Pay was good and time off was appropriate.
good,"I was a cashier working evenings, Very busy place, The hardest part of working at Costco was lifting merchandise,  And standing on feet all day, Management was good and gave timely breaks and lunches. Trying to please customers"
good,"It was great having your schedule 2 weeks ahead. Management was open if you needed to change your schedule. Hardest part of the job was being called to do a job you hadn't been trained on - and this only happened when lines got long and they needed help, but there was no time to train you how to do it. They just kind of put you there and you figure it out. There's a certain way they want carts unloaded so Cashier can scan quickly. Some Cashiers would help and tell you how to do this faster. It was hard to re-pack the cart for the customer without something being squashed."
good,"I would recommend working at Costco if you love fast pace jobs. "
good,This job was a good opportunity for me as it was my first job and it allowed to gain customer services. I liked all my co workers in the food court department. I thought the pay was good because i was only a student and didn't have to pay for much
good,"Working with Costco allowed me to balance my school schedule, while also paying my way through college. My managers and supervisors were all fun, great, and relatable. The workload is not very demanding but can easily get fast paced and long."
good,This is a busy place to work but they have good benefits and a very reasonable salary. It's easy to make friends with your fellow coworkers here and the management team knows how to run a warehouse quite well.
good,overall a good place to work however if you are higher up not so good if you have a family . the job takes over your life if you allow it to . excellent job if you have good senior management but have a culture of throwing you under to make themselves look less foolish so be prepared to be willing to stick up for yourself and your staff or they will take you down if you are week
good,Great company to work for. Expect to work though. No reason to be lallygagging around.  Come in do your job and go home.  And have a great feeling while doing it
good,"A fun place to work, have to be willing to help in all areas of the warehouse.  All start as part time and with good work ethic and good attendance will get more hours.  Company has very good benefits and bonuses."
good,I had a good time working there made a lot of money but the position was seasonal so now I'm looking for work again I learned about different cuts of meat wrapping the meat  grade And also how to make ground beef
good,"Doing various tasks such as bagging and boxing groceries in carts, cashier duties, customer services, various cleaning and maintenance tasks, and working outside pushing carts. The other employees are fantastic, everyone is very welcoming and the management is very accommodating to students. The best part of the job is the staff that I get to work with."
good,"Great place to work in terms of pay and benefits, but opportunities for advancement are limited to management preferences, not by experience. "
good,Buena empresa sólo que salgo muy tarde y trabajo fines de semana regularmente salgo alas 11 pm
good,A lot of foot traffic but not too many apparel purchases at the time.  I worked for a private company as a contractor for a trade show selling various styles of Travel wear Outfits.  No place for customers' to try on the clothing and were not allowed to take it to the restroom to try; it was very complicating for the customer to decide.
good,"The best part of the job, is the members.  I've met so many great people by working for Costco.  My co-workers are like family as well, its a great company to work for."
good,They pay extra for Sunday work.  Front end is hard if you have problems with your hands like I did but there are other department where the stress on your hands is not so bad.
good,"Great Company to work for, but management can be the cancer for the work place. There aren't much room to improve or move up in older warehouse, maybe new ones."
good,I was only a seasonal employee and was told that there was a possibility for at least one of the seasonal workers would receive a full time job at the end of the seasonal period. We weren't told who was going to receive the position till the end of December/beginning of January. Great pay and it was fast past.
good,Didn't learn much about Costco and how the company operates internally but it is an awesome place to be employed. Many positions to advance to and areas to grow knowledge.
good,"As an independent inside sales/ lead generator for Leaf Guard of North Alabama I was required to maintain a respectful presence in a kiosk on a daily basis inside Costco of Huntsville, Al. I used my superior product knowledge of Englert Leaf Guard products to help answer any questions asked by members and to help promote visits, estimates and the possible sale of custom downspouts and gutters for homes and businesses. In my opinion Costco Stores as a whole are very well maintained, managed and run. I noticed the managers of several other chains coming through and monitoring the way Costco's front end was managed. Their polite and expedient way of helping customers enjoy their shopping experience was inspiring and our company was held to the same high standards of practice."
good,i like working with others and returning things to there places helping to the stuff people buy in the cart and check if they need any help taking them to there cars
good,"Good company to work for, good pay, and good hours. Nice coworkers, happy customers, fair priced products and goods. Lots of parking and a big employee lounge."
good,Never a slow moment at this Costco. Job duties around the store and training in many departments made the assistant position ideal for me. The other employees were serious and a majority had positive attitudes about their jobs. This was refreshing and made going to work more enjoyable. Only complaint would be the supervisors were often unorganized. This was a minor issue and was due to unclear direction from the upper management. Overall a great job with superb pay and benefits.
good,"Usually very busy on the weekends and slow during the winter. Never did the same job, always moving and keeping busy. All the coworkers made you feel like family."
good,Work is not overwhelming there was always enough people to help out if needed. Management was always eager to help out and assist in anyway. Awesome locations.
good,"I Learned a collection of skills such as:"
good,"I worked for Costco for almost 10 years the staff is great very professional with great pay clean warehouse. "
good,"great company with great benefits and fairness in pay. SUnday you get time an a half when you work. Very organized, free memberships, low cost for medical insurance, CEO makes reasonable salary. Closed oin holidays with pay unlike many other stores like Sams club, Only downfall its hard to get in with company and only hired on from a seasonal positon if they need you."
good,As a parking lot attendant I learned a lot about the and how hard it is to work in. A typical day at work is a light way of putting it because you never know how difficult the next day could be. Its you against mother nature. My favorite part of the job is being able to enjoy the summer time and talk with the members.
good,"Great place to work, good environment with great benefits and pay. I tried to transfer closer to home but could not, commute become too much of a factor, regret leaving"
good,"I have been working at Costco for almost two year and it has been very tough.  I have heard that the company is good to work for, but for the first few years one will work hard to earn status."
good,Everyday at work is a different experience. It is a very high pace job. You will have to learn to deal with thousands of people every day. The most enjoyable part about working here is working with great co-workers.
good,It a good place to work great benefits the are always opportunities to move up. Even as a part time employee I still get full benefits medical and dental the same as full time employee
good,"Good employer with above average wage, decent career outlook. Good growth within the next couple of decades, and continuing business success as its membership grows."
good,"costco was a great place to be with friendly staff and members, i am happy for my time there although i was seasonal i appreciated the time i did work for the company and would be happy to come back when ever the need arose"
good,I would start the day by finding out the area I'm working in and I would get rid of the empty boxes on the pallets and block down the items then go on break then come back and give another stocker a break and then after we close put up the stock that the drivers put out .Management is good they always help out and coworkers are friendly and helpful the hardest part is when we are shorthanded and busy.
good,Fast paced environment offering a vast amount of opportunities to experience different department duties and possible growth within the company
good,"Typical day at work Is wrapping pallets and banding pallets.I learned how to use forklift and electric pallet jack,hardest part was sometimes finding work when things slowed down,I would say management was very strict about your breaks and the time you took for lunch. Coworkers are easy to get along with and easy to work with."
good,"A day at work was getting our cash registers ready make sure we had enough boxes to pack the members items. and running on items either for the correct price or to put a cold item back, We made sure we went out of the way to make the members happy. Costco was my second job and I learned all my cashiering experience, customer service, bakery, food court. Working 11 years there we went through a few managers and I learned as long as you do what your supposed to do for the most part you can be on good terms with them but sad to say I have come across bad management and you just hate to see the morale of the company go down. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude members some of them have become violent and that's something I have really learned to handle. and all the lifting but we just considered it our gym time."
good,"I loved working at Costco, it was a great Company to work for. I was only a seasonal employee but I wish I was hired permanently. Its a fast paced job which kept you on your toes, my co workers were awesome and I became friends with all of them. Management was awesome and well organized. The hardest part of the job was the high demands and the expectations, but I learned that it was those things that made the company great. The most enjoyable part was keeping busy and working with a great group of people."
good,"A typical work days consisted of  preparing your food demo for the day. We stand for 6 hours with 1 30 minute and 1 fifteen minute break each shift."
good,Every time I am invited back to work for Costco selling items at a roadshow I am always quick to accept as its a job I enjoy due to the Costco work style.
good,The managers and employees were wonderful.  It was a positive and fun work environment.  Members were pleasant to work with and their was always work to be done.  There was not very much down time.
good,"Costco is one of the leading companies in the world and their Mission statement to treat their employees as the best, normally succeeds.  With every company, poor managers do exist, but Costco does do its best to weed out management that is found lacking."
good,Perfect job opportunity for anyone looking for a fantastic permanent part-time position with flexible hours.  Costco has great opportunities for employing students as well!!
good,"Costco was amazing. The company is great and they really love their employees and customers. My co-workers were awesome. the managers were really nice and helpful but there was a slight lack of communication between them. The hardest part of the job was the physical part, i was lifting anywhere from 5 lbs to 50 lbs up over my head to stock it. But the most enjoyable part was the satisfaction after i was done."
good,"It was very high-pace working required a lot of physical activity, but  it wasn't a problem for me. I liked to deal with customers, co-workers. Only one thing was really bothering me when some of our  managers sent me to do works not connected with customer service at all, such as weeding and sweeping outside. By the way, I wasn't warned about any possibility of these duties-activities during hiring process. The most enjoyable part of the job was marketing when I was convincing Costco's members to switch they membership cards to new more beneficial for them. Because of this I improved significantly my customer service skill."
good,"busy and demanding, traffick sucks, great company to work for. co-workers are great to get along with. Meet lots individuals of different personalities, back ground and culture."
good,The fact that I was able to interact with customers was made the job more exiting.
good,"Really loved this job,after i moved up from clean up guy to the morning wrapper,only problem is that you get the feeling that its never good enough,every review there is never any kudos or atta boys .It also seemed that the upper management were not all on the same page,fighting amongest themselves to one up each other,but as far as the hourly workers amongst us it was a family atmosphere and i enjoyed working and talking with all i worked with."
good,"Fast pace fun environment working directly with members."
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Good pay and benefits with friendly staff and management. I would just like to find a newer and better career in field other than retail. Like I said, Costco is nice but I do not want to work in retail."
good,"Worked in a pro-warehouse environment,good pay,good references.Worked with many different cultures and ages under pressure.forklift and EPJ licence was obtained.Loved working with the management team and all the workers."
good,costco wholesales is a great company to work for they have unlimited steps for someone that wants a career in retail to clime. They treat there employee good and because of their great benefits they have many loyal employees.
good,seasonal employment; great place to work once hired permanently
good,"I Assisted members at the cash register, prepared the food, and ensured a clean safe work environment. I learned the importance of having great customer service and how to manage my time by always working with a sense of urgency. Management was a very reliable source if I ever needed help with an issue. The management in my department seemed to be under a lot of stress frequently. My coworkers were one of the perks of working here. They were all kind and there was strong team work that helped our jobs go smoothly. The hardest part of my job was the strenuous labor that it required. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the opportunity to grow as an employee to obtain the part time position of a supervisor. It gave me a lot of experience with the public and how to respond to stressful situations."
good,Help Members with returns on products. Sign new members up to the benefits of the company such as the executive program and American Express credit card
good,"Costco is like no other place, they pay you more than others company are willing to pay, the benefits and compensation are great."
good,"Costco is a great company. the benifeits are truely amazing back in the 90s the company was on a foward momentum expansion plan and unfortunatly in rapid expansion the bar for leadership ability is often overlooked or under valued because of the timelines. Education is a valuable tool but i think in the education system leadership ,common sence, and diversity are skills that need to be improved upon still overall Costco a great company"
good,"Fast pace environment that will keep you busy from start to finish. As an alternate vault clerk after training was able to reconcile daily transactions to balance the receipts. Management was good, but quick to make a decision that may affect a persons employment with the company. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting the customers and noticing they will come back to you each time they visited."
good,"I enjoyed working at Costco. In my short time there I had many chances to learn many different areas of the warehouse work. I loved being closely involved with customers. Helping customers carry heavy items to the car, exchanging customer purchases, and constant verbal communication."
good,"At the location that I worked at, I met VARIOUS people that were amazing individuals with a lot of heart. We became a family. There was not a person in that building I did not love. Obviously there were maybe a couple people I didn't gel with, but I had the ability to move from place to place so I didn't have to be around those people unless I needed to. It was a very fast paced environment and sometimes I feel like the management were slightly disorganized and a little bit on an ego trip. For the most part though, the good definitely outweighed the bad."
good,Prepare to constantly be moving back and forth to accommidate the needs of the customer. Flexible hours with school or other work schedules if needed. Different departments you can work at and easy to move around.
good,Has Good pay good benefits and a place with many opportunity. Has flexible hours. They try to help employees as much as they can to improve workplace environment
good,Your #1 job is always customer service and they do a great job of focusing on that. Culture is great and co workers are fun and easy to get along with
good,"Overall good employer with great benefits and positive environment. "
good,my time there i made good connections with my co workers making the whole experience a pleasant one. the management was quick to teach me what i needed to know and made sure my stay was enjoyable.
good,"Good place to start and gain experience in an office environment. Potential to lead to positions inside or outside the company. Develop administrative and clerical skills, data entry, numerical reconciliation skills."
good,"Very great company to work for, a lot of benefits like 401k plans, health insurance, availability in buying company stock. Also very fast work environment, constantly on your feet."
good,"In the photo lab, members can be very rude when their orders are wrong and you did nothing wrong and it's actually their fault and they don't understand. It takes a lot of energy sometimes having to explain every step to their order and what went wrong without hinting at that it was their fault and it not back firing."
good,"Real good company, good salary and good benefits, with a lot of coworkers so you will have opportunities to grow with the right skills and to make friends"
good,You may get the opportunity to work in different positions at Costco. This allows you to expand your connection by meeting new managers and learn from other departments.
good,"Costco taught me many things, not just work related, but also life decisions and always supported me. They are well driven and like to work at a fast pace to knock out our task for the day."
good,"Great company "
good,"A typical day at work would be serving customers on cash, packing the shopping carts with merchandise, returning merchandise not purchased to proper location, assisting costumers in finding merchandise, greeting incoming and outgoing customers at the door, and checking receipts.  It is a very fast pace job that requires high energy.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers and the most enjoyable part is dealing with happy/pleasant customers."
good,"I worked here during a summer break for college. They pay well, and I know management varies store to store. It's hard to get time off, especially as a new employee with no accumulated PTO. Minimum hours part-time are 24 hrs a week. It's a great place to make money if you're working towards saving up but in my experience, my entire life was Costco for a summer. Coworkers were nice, everybody is pretty happy to be there. Its a well paying job for retail."
good,Muy buen lugar de trabajo y con disponibilidad de horario si eres estudiante y quieres trabajar a la ves.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, muy buena capacitaciones"
good,I enjoyed working at Costco. loved the fast pace work and there was always something to do to make time fly by. the people there were so nice except for a few. overall Costco isn't a bad place to work
good,"Working a short time with Costco was not an experience I would've expected. The Pharmacy Manager showed complete favoritism and doesn't really have managerial experience. For a slow pharmacy 3 full time technicians isn't needed. In 1 week they expect you to learn, know and do everything the job requires even if you haven't work with that system before. I felt more like a well paid cashier then a National Board Certified Pharmacy Technician."
good,Fun team but slow progress in roles and not adaptable with work/life balance with kids. They only do full days not half days so had to take whole day off to watch 1 hr performance at my daughters school
good,It is easy to dive into Costco culture and very much accepted by the managers and other employees who love working at Costco. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with how busy my department is but the work pays off and time goes by quickly.
good,"Decent hours with good pay, especially with seniority. Incredible benefits, good work environment, except when it comes to some promotions. Management is usually very good, but some warehouses have spotty managers and inconsistent schedules and expectations."
good,"I throughly enjoy working at Costco, although it can be challenging at times and has tested me in new ways (dealing with irate customers) I have most definitely grown and learned much from my time thus far with Costco. They’re flexibility and benefits have also been greatly beneficial and appreciated."
good,"Good pay, great benefirs, fun atmosphere. Meet and work with a fun group of people. BBQ's for employees every six months. Fast paced but stillayed back"
good,Loved the fast paced and collaborative work that was done with my coworkers. Built team bondings and built a higher and more creative way of thinking to solve problems or in work situations.
good,Normally you start out at 15 $ and the more hours you work the more you will move up in pay. I believe it’s every 1100 hours you get a pay raise. The benefits are great and the company is always busy !
good,"I had a great time leading retail with Costco, it as all very high pace and we always showed are best to give customer service, learning so much about the store and how it runs and applying everything you Learn to your job"
good,"it was really nice, treated employee nicely. Liked how they treated pay. They increased the minimum wage while working and i kept my regularly timed raises."
good,"I loved the people I worked with, and the job itself was really easy, I just had to sell TV's. The only issue I had was that the person in charge of the paperwork for my extended allowances of tardy and absences due to my health issues, didn't give me the entire set to finish filling out, so I got taken off schedule for a month cause I got sick and was unable to provide them with a doctors note, even though I had a set of discharge papers to show as proof. After that month long wait, I called them and asked what they were doing. They told me they had made a decision not to keep me because I hadn't filled out all the forms blah blah but wouldn't be able to do anything about the fact that I  wasn't presented all of that in the first place. It would have allowed me to stay employed. Mistakes like that should never happen within HR. Someone else's mistake got me fired, so I hope that person started doing better, paying more attention to things like that."
good,"Great company to work  for, would recommend.  Especially to those without a degree.  If you work hard, adhere to the company standards and show results you will advance.  I worked for the company for nearly 20 years and still have a large 401K to show for it.  I left because of a another job opportunity."
good,I enjoyed my time at Costco Wholesale. I was a teenager at the time and wanted a job with more tips which is why I left. The benefits were awesome. I'd work there again.
good,"I enjoyed working at Costco.  "
good,Great place to work at with great pay and also nice pay due to being in the bay area however management can be a problem when favoring certain employees
good,"good place to work. great benefits."
good,My co-workers made my experience there exceptional. Yes there were issues with management as with any other place but overall I enjoyed working there.
good,"I enjoyed my time there as a young employee, however I wanted to try new things with better pay; which is why I stopped working this company. However, I would recommend overall."
good,Es un ambiente laboral bastante agradable y buen compañerismo
good,"My only problem is that a lot of people that work there, including managers, act like they are still in high school.  They have to have drama and talk behind peoples' backs.  People can't just be nice and not have to stir up trouble."
good,"Costco has a great technology environment. It has advanced infrastructure without the cutthroat politics that you see in other organizations."
good,"Constantly having to take initiative and work at a fast-paced. Practically being understaffed means that more is expected, but with the starting pay higher than most other places, it is understandable."
good,"Great pay, great benefits but poor work/life balance. Some Managers are just promoted based on years of service and not by abilities/merit. Overall a good place to work."
good,"It was a great place to work for a seasonal position. After the holiday season of that year, my contract ended. Great peoples and good work atmosphere."
good,"Loved working there, co-workers were great. Advancement was awkward and the politics were confusing. Had to leave to find a full-time job in order to provide for my family."
good,"A Typical Day at Work -- You come in clocked in and report to the board runner. I'm a cashier stated but my role can varies everyday I come in. My position is where the business needs me to be for productive operation. One day I could be on the register just ringing. The next day I could be floating on the floor where they need me to be. Its fun and exciting at the same time. I like to float around and be able to help and assist members of the things they need."
good,Great place work but the Pay is low. They don’t convert temp to permanent. If you are full time employee you are all set . Good culture. Cafeteria is best .
good,"It was a great company, but I feel that the opportunities for advancement were small. Management had flaws but was good for the most part. I really enjoyed the fast pace environment and the people I worked with. It was a good environment and I learn to be and awesome customer service specialist."
good,"always busy, time flies when working there . You do however get very close to all the staff, everyone is ver welcoming and nice (except the members) . I enjoy working fast pace."
good,"The Costco food court is a very fast paced work environment, you are constantly moving and busy.  However it was a fun and friendly work place.  My manager, supervisors and c-workers were all great to work with.  The hardest part was disgruntle members due to changing menu items.  Members did not take well to the changes and took it out on the food court employees even though we have nothing to do with said changes.  Good Benefits even for part time workers.  Would have preferred 5- 8hour shifts instead of working 6 days a week. (2- 8 hours, 4 6-hour)."
good,"Customer Service"
good,"Although it was a temporary seasonal job, working at Costco was an exciting experience that taught me quite about about retail. There were six of us hired and all would be assigned a different task to perform every day except me. I was allowed to just do it all. And I did. I never stopped moving from one task to another. When our temporary job ended, my manager informed me that he wishes he had hired six of me because I was the best employee he had ever had."
good,Costco is a great place for those looking for a company that will grow with you and give you numerous opportunities to advance up the ladder. The pay is beyond fair and the way they do pay raises is great. The benefits are some if the best (and cheapest) I have had. Overall great place to work
good,"Checking in with manager on the sales floor. Setting up display for the day. Writing out sales goals. Rehearse sales pitch for customers. Check inventory of products to make sure you have enough for customers all day. "
good,"I like working there, it's just the management can be more understandable and flexible. But over all I like working there. I think has a great benefit package as well as stock."
good,"Excellent culture, management and employee base. Exhausting work day and moderate physical demand. If you are a student, (in my experience) they will try to put you into a department that corresponds to what you are studying."
good,"Working at Costco for the morning merchandise shift has been pleasant. Time goes by quickly when you start between 4 and 5 a.m. The current set of management has stalled with the development of employees who want to continue to climb their well constructed company ladder and frustrations are beginning to show. The other shifts and departments are flourishing with warehouses consternating opening and being constructed. Overall, Costco is one of the better companies out there."
good,I have had a great time working for Costco. I have had multiple managers in the time I’ve been here and everyone is different and has a different way of managing. I get along great with all of them. It can get stressful before opening trying to get the store ready but it’s a great job to have
good,The job itself was wonderful. I enjoyed the pay raises. The only thing that bothered me was when it came time to make a report or file a claim. They never listened to both parties. Thy favored whomever came to them first. Instead of taking into account the person making the reports and the history of said person. (ie. how many complaints the person has made. How many issues the employee seems to have with everyone. All the time. How confrontational the employee is.)
good,Ambiente de trabajo bueno y jefes poco excesibles.
good,"A company that still has not mature. Always looking to innovate, all by keeping its core values. Promotes within and offers internal managerial development programs."
good,I got full benefits as a part time employee while going to college - I only left since I received a degree and got a desk job which fit my major. All college kids should apply to costco
good,Empresa con grandes beneficios y muchas oportunidades de aprender
good,As soon as you punch in it is fast paced. I rush to do breaks or lunches in different departments. I don't like the hours that I work they are always late because the store opens at 10:00.
good,"Es una muy buena empresa para iniciar a trabajar ya que te ayudan a madurar y fortalecer tus habilidades, con un ambiente laboral agradable y buenas prestaciones, lo único complicado es un ascenso ya que hay gente de muchos años con más experiencia ."
good,"Good place to work. Very fast paced which makes the day go by quick. Can be like any place you work at, a little clicky. Does take time to make it to full time."
good,The job is well manger.  I have been working with the company as a supervisor for 17 years. Working overseeing the store as a supervisor making sure the customer is been taken care of. The employee has open door policy
good,"Costco is a great organization to work for. Great colleagues, decent hours. Problem is - it takes a long time advance within the organization............................................................................"
good,Costco gave me a family of friends I'll have for a lifetime. My management was a bit cut throat but there was a few that took their time to actually teach and allow me to grow with the company.
good,"Great place to work and fast pace working environment."
good,"Every day was a new experience at Costco, and I was constantly learning. Management is always available to teach new skills. Costco is flexible with school hours as well. Everyone is happy to be there, and I enjoyed working there."
good,"aprendi a realizar stocks en pastelería , a organizar una pastelería multinacional , a llevar a cabo una limpieza impoluta de una cocina industrial, a llevar a cabo los alimentos para su posterior venta."
good,"Costco’s benefits are amazing, they really take care of the employee. They offer time and a half on Sundays, but limit over time on those days. Overall a great place to work at cause you can advance and make up to 3 figures a year in a management position."
good,"Great company to work for during these tough economic times.  Great benefits, competitive atmosphere.  Management is hit or miss.  Favoritism can be an issue"
good,"Loved the people I worked with "
good,"A very well organized, structured place to work. Keeps you on your toes and keeps you striving to do your best. Hustling is very important. Being quick yet efficient with assigned tasks. Giving quality member service is most important."
good,It was a good job... But they needed to be fair to the employee in the warehouse. No overtime for the drivers unless the warehouse employees could get it too.
good,I thought I wanted to retire so I took a pay off havent worked in 4 yrs want to get back in the work force. I cant go back with the same salary at costco I would have to start all over again as a new hire I dont want to do that.My course ran out with them rather work some where else. A typical day at costco went to work at 4am I stocked the sales area made decisions were every thing is displayed and stocked it.When the store opened I was a salesperson in electronics and jewelry. The hardest part of my job was stocking the the area
good,"I worked here while going through college, and it paid better than any other college-level unskilled job. I don't intend on working retail forever, but it was a great starting job."
good,"Very busy and high stress environment. Not good for family life , they compensate well and have full medical/ dental benefits for all employees including part time."
good,Decu de n'avoir presque travaillé pour le poste dont j'étais engagé.  Au lieu de travailler au service on m'envoyait toujours au marchandisage.
good,"I loved working for Costco. The environment and work pace was very manageable and made me look forward to going to work everyday. The management understood whenever you needed time off or needed a sick day. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the fast paced workflow, but in time I got used to that."
good,I probably should have stuck it out. It was just my pharmacy manager. He ended up getting in trouble with the board. Other than him and some salty techs the company was great.
good,Had a blast working the 5:30 - 11:30 shift due to school. It was fun working with your own age group. Fast and always on our toes especially closing time and it was time to stock.
good,appart les heures qui ne convient pas avec le peu dheure quand tu a une famille a faire vivre   tres bon
good,"There are many different jobs working front end including assisting customers, packing, cashier assistant, putting items away, stocking, etc."
good,This job gives you so many opportunities and let's you advance in other departments and they give great benefits. You can advance quicker at Costco then any other job.
good,"I love my job at Costco.  I really love the people at the Marysville location.  They are all like family to me.  I do not care for the evening hours and working weekends.  I am not used to that type of schedule.  I am used to 6:30am to 2:30pm Monday through Friday work."
good,"Fast paced environment. Very busy, especially checkout area. Am merchandising fast paced to get merchandise set up and on the floor. Costant on the go enviroment."
good,Was a great experience for me gave me many professional work skills and behaviour which i carry with me to every job. That is if you are a self motivating personality you get out what you put in.
good,The work environment is very friendly and productive at Costco. One of the best companies to work for. Management was open and professional. Hardest part of the job is lifting heavy objects and keeping up with some of the fast pace periods.
good,Am very impressed with managersnfir effortinf to learn signs to communicate with me. They even got a videophone to communicate with Dead employees. Very accomplished.
good,"Excellent place to work filled with excellent people and many great benefits  401k offered, health benefits, membership, paid days off and sick time offered."
good,Worked many areas in Costco including Corp office during 14 years love the culture ...if you quit and come back it needs to be with in 1 -2 years to leave where you left off in pay. But once you bonus out you always keep your bonus. Costco has a family feel that is forever with you. work had and the doors open for you .
good,"The job is easy for the 2nd and 3rd shifters, The 1st shift is were all the action and pace is kept. But I love my area, then they moved me to a area that needed two people run in it. Then they added on another isle, it got very overwhelming. Overall working there is fun, but you need more people in some areas!"
good,"The work environment creates the kind of product lined diversity and variance, that makes it easy to sell organic products. Management asks you to rise to challenge of their top of line performance. The hardest part is keeping up the food samples, that were in high demand by the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of seeing the customers eating their food samples as an iconic representation of the American Way."
good,"Every employee seemed to have a problem with at least one manager, Im not sure if this is a social behavior issue or a training issue. everything else about Costco is near perfect, especially the stock options they give you."
good,i used to work here as a seasonal in oct 2016 to jan 2017. ther is a lot of drama and bull some of the managers were ok but there was one in particular i hated. the co workers were awesome but the members sometimes sucked. the members can be rude and act like they are better then everyone. i only noticed this recurring pattern with the executive members. the place is packed on sundays its hard to maneuver around. the stress is nuts. the hardest part would be front end. which is what i was. i did enjoy the co workers and the freebies.
good,"Although I was only seasonal, I was challenged in my work and when I got my paychecks and also with the way the company treated us in general made the workplace feel very rewarding."
good,Being a sample person is a fun yet interesting experience. we get paid well and its a simple job yet high maintenance.mainly common sense. one thing i hate most are the customers. they dont see you as a person just someone who gives food. its the hunger games out there. also we dont get any discounts from costco since we are a different company. a whole shift is 6 hours. unless its a special 8 hours.
good,I really liked working at Costco Corona. Management was great and employees are productive. So sorry it was just a seasonal position but I would work there again any time.
good,"Collect my sales sheet "
good,"Costco promotes within first, then looks outward.  Great benefits.  "
good,"Typical day 5 to 10"
good,"Costco Wholesale is a great place to work! It is retail so it can be very stressful at times but the coworkers and bosses make it more of a family. The work schedule can be pretty inconsistent at times. If you show that you are a hardworking, dependable, and approachable individual, you will go very far in this company. It gave me such great experience with customer service. I learned how to deal in high-stress situations. The pay is not bad, and the insurance is great. Overall, great place to work!"
good,"enjoyed the stocking with this company, everyone was professional and courteous. Because of personal reason had to ask for leave of absence"
good,"Costco is a great place to work, but only if you're willing to be trapped in their corporate scheme. You must start as a part-time employee, and you must ""work your way up"" to make any real money. Although the starting wage is particularly high for an entry-level position, 24/hr a week and a refusal to work around other job schedules is nearly impossible to live off of. If you're willing to endure a couple good years of this, it might actually pay off. Raise scales have you making $40,000/yr at something as easy as being a cashier after about 10 years. I don't have the time to wait for this. But, the benefits are amazing even for a part-time employee. Good company, good vision, probably more for a young person in school or a retiree."
good,"I learned how to process checks while on the cash register. I worked in the food court when staff was short. I worked in the meat department for at least two month  those duties was labeling and wrapping meat. Also was greeter, an taking count of the members who entered the warehouse. I also worked as a cashier assistant, packing and unpacking carts."
good,I have been at Costco now for nearly 9 years I went in on part time hoping that would change and I would get full time but it's not happening and because I have a mortgage to pay and 2 kids to fed got to look elsewhere
good,"Costco has a lot of good things going for them.  They strike a great balance of being able to pay their employees a good wage and give them appropriate time off they're still able to make enough money to continue to grow.  I think this place is ideal for any student trying to balance life, school, and work.  By the time one graduates, they will have put in enough hours to be making a good wage.  A big bonus though is the people. Whether it's co-workers, supervisors, or our members, more often than not, people are in a pleasant mood."
good,"The people were friendly and nice, the management was good,the job was hard but we enjoyed doing it, the team was great there.I started my company so i had to quit my job."
good,"Great environment to work in. Friendly people, never a dull moment. Always busy, time goes by fast. Employees are friendly, managers are helpful. Parking is terrible."
good,"It was a very good first experience in Call centre but what I liked is the similarity with the administrative job. Day at work was very busy, no time to answer private calls; co-workers were very friendly; job itself very demanding in terms of patience and accuracy."
good,"You won't find a better paying retail job around, positions start well above minimum wage (depending on what state you live in) and steadily rise based on hours worked from there. Management is usually willing to work around your schedule if you have any conflicts with school or life."
good,Due to the fact that I was seasonal and tried to stay on I had a unpleasant experience when they only kept people who had family or friends already working there. I felt they were unfair especially since some of the people they kept had made big mistakes and had warning given to them.
good,It is a very fast paced job. It requires a lot of customer service and a lot of persistence. You have to be quick on your toes to get things done.
good,Working at Costco will always have you on your feet and make you feel like you're part of a great team.  Your co-workers make work great and when you see your members happy it makes your day.  I've learned a lot from the company and have improved my soft skills.
good,"Its a great place to work. There is collaborative work culture, inclusive of different work styles, yet ample of opportunity for independent work. Its moderate paced which is nice, not too fast neither slow, gives the right balance."
good,"A typical day would state at 4am and last to 230pm. In that day we would receive about 15 truck that would have to be unload, count, entered into inventory and place in storage till needed. I would also over see return authoriztions for items that are damaged to  be returned to the vender."
good,I enjoyed working there due to the great management and employees. The whole atmosphere was on communication and having fun while interacting with customers to inform them of products available at Costco
good,"Great leading company, high potential pay over 10 years. "
good,"Great benefits and opportunity for advancement. Long hours and hard physical work. Great place to stay in shape physically and mentally. Family oriented environment, flexible and understanding."
good,Moving up in this store is basically a joke. Unless you have a great managing staff. If you want to stay there for more 8 years you will be making good money bagging groceries.
good,Costco is a great company to work for their wages and benefits are competitive. You learn how a warehouse operates and how each departments record and calculate costs. The hardest part of the job is completing all tasks by the end of the day. Warehouses have high demands of volume of production and some of the times being only person. The best part of the job was being able to be crossed trained in different departments if you want to.
good,Super busy during the season but all the craziness is lots of fun. It feels like working with a family more than just coworkers. Everyone helps each other. Took me awhile to understand the process of breaks vs lunches.
good,Customer service was Costco's #1 task. loved how they treated members and took care of their every needs. the managers were very good about trying to make sure all workers are taken care of. Everyone was very friendly and easily approachable.
good,Working at Costco is all about multitasking. The seniors are very helpful and if one is willing they can learn and rise quickly.
good,"Great benefits, hours were long and tiring. Both, physically and mentally. The pay makes you stay though."
good,I enjoy meeting new people that come shopping at costco and i love my coworkers .Costco has taught me checking out members in a fast pace and also how to pack the buggies and few other skills that has helped me .
good,"Aunque muchas veces los socios eran algo desagradables se trata de entender en que posición te encuentras."
good,"Thought the early hours are rough somedays it is good honest work. It is retail work so the busy times of the year always get to people and the managers. Costco is a great company with great benefits, but the turn over rate is one of the lowest in any company. That translates to coworkers who have gotten on with the company, and then become complacent, only happy with what they have. The search for excellence only comes from a select few workers and management. It is difficult to climb the ladder, but as is with any retail job it is a good place to work while in college or searching for a better job."
good,"Costco Wholesale is already known for its great culture and personable atmosphere. They provide excellent benefits, excellent wok/life balance, everyone is really friendly, and Costco really goes out of their way to make sure, as an employee, you're happy"
good,"No matter what you do, prioritize helping others to being selfish and thinking of only yourself. "
good,"An average day at work for me begins at 4:15 or 5:15 am when I gather a shopping cart and a flat bed to store my trash as I stock, and then I get right to it. The whole focus of my position is detail and speed, meaning that more important than getting every bit of product stocked is ensuring that every item is facing handsomely forward, flush with the its pallet and with its identicals, that every pallet is perfectly in line with all the others in an aisle, that every sign is correct and centered, that every product has a display if it needs one, and finally that we finish everything completely by 10 o'clock when the doors open for members to shop. From this job, I've come away with an extreme level of urgency, as well as an attention to detail that I scarce could comprehend prior. I contribute this largely to the firm but encouraging management staff that has so clearly outlined the scope of my duties and to what degree they should be performed. As for my co-workers, I'd say that level of quality is very hit-and-miss. Most of them hate their jobs because they are required to work so hard, but most of them even still aren't even working nearly as hard as I do in the first place and take every chance to complain about how management is terrible because...they tell them to do their jobs the right way...and that apparently irritates them. I could definitely do without that negativity, but they stay for the wages, not a fun work experience. That being said, pairing a functional personal life with a functional work life is astoundingly difficult because I expend extreme quantities"
good,I enjoyed working at Costco because it was very interactive.  I am a people person and enjoy helping others with anything they need.
good,"Great place to work however if you work in fl advancement is impossible everyone wants to be here, you can get by on 52000 a year with decent working condtions but really never get ahead due to the cost of living and inflation that exists today"
good,"My time with Costco, however short and stressful, was excellent. I was made to feel important by management, and my voice never went unheard or ignored."
good,"En día típico, desde mi llegada  a la Empresa, con las pilas bien puestas para ver que me tocaba promocionar ese día, pues diariamente cambiaba el producto. y ver rápidamente los insumos que iba a necesitar, la cantidad, el tamaño, todo el material necesario, pues llegado determinado momento se cerraba y no podías ir a surtirte. o sea que era ver más allá de lo necesario."
good,Costco was a high paced environment requiring you to be on your feet constantly moving your entire shift. I got to interact with a myriad of different customers.
good,"I have learned to work under stress while helping customers find what they need. Also, I have learned leadership skills with merchandising with a team, helping delegate duties to get done for deadlines that need to be made."
good,Costco Mail-order pharmacy is a chance to interact with patients and physicians across the country with new and challenging scenarios presenting themselves on a daily basis. Managers mean well but are often bound by corporate regulations which can sap some of the efficiency present within my branch. Some co-workers are not at the same level as others but everyone is very nice and easy to work with. The best part of the job is satisfying a customer and having them take the time to write or call a manager in order to tell them about your hard work which means you really made a difference and satisfied their needs.
good,"Administration Clerk- In charge of customer service calls and making sure the Costco Way is still instilled in all of its employees. Other requirements was Acknowledging every one of our customers in an Ethical way. Receiving and transmitting phone calls and messages."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of meticulously folding clothes. It was very good job security as they need staff to keep the clothes looking neat and tidy. The employees were mostly young college students and some middle aged adults. Management had a variety of styles some good, some bad. The hardest part of the job was avoiding boredom. I most enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"Went in  in the am and stocked out new items made signs for items, cleaned and neatly organized aisles."
good,Costco was a really nice place to work. I was in charged on my shift to cook and prepare rotisserie chickens. I kept these rotisserie chicken fresh and always out for our members. I also work the front counter with helping to load members merchandise into the shopping carts.
good,My job is customer service.  I am good at it and enjoy what i do. The department that i am in has no real room for growth for me.
good,"Costco takes very good care of its employees. They pay well, and have amazing benefits, The hours are good, and they work with your schedule."
good,"Great Company. Great Benefits. However, it can be difficult to move up in the company, depending on the quality of your management."
good,Simple part time work. They expect you to work your entire shift and find work to do if nothing presents it self right away. The managers communicate well and make their expectations known. Good evaluations lead to promotion rather quickly.
good,Met some of my best friends working here. This company gives you all the opportunities in the world to advance.
good,"Great place to work, great values, a clean environment."
good,Costco was one of the first jobs that i got excited to go to work everyday. My fellow co-workers were all very fun people and for the most part hardworking. I loved producing food and making the members happy. As well as the fast paced environment.
good,This company was great to work for payed the employees well and respected them and the work they do
good,Great employer provided you are willing to work many years as a part time employee before full time opportunities may come up.
good,A typical day at work would be preparing the tills for the store opening. Working in the vault is my primary job. Processing the cash and checks from the day before and preparing them for depositing into the bank. I prepare loans through out the day and keep the safe balanced ensuring complete accuracy. I have learned how to be detailed and ensure accuracy. I have learned how to multitask effectively. The management is great. They are always very helpful and respectful. My co-workers have been great to work with. The hardest part of my job is making sure there are no errors. When working in the vault you have to be completely paying attention to what you are doing. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with.
good,"I was an employee for 10 years. Good pay, but hard to advance if you dont have a college degree."
good,getting paid you start off at 11 and top out at 20 something an hour and time in a half on sundays
good,typical day consists of stocking approximately 15-20 pallets of merchandise.
good,Very understanding staff. The training was done well and soon enough I felt like a staple team member. They acknowledge employee's hard work and they strive for a better team and back that up with incentives as well as coaching.
good,"Working fast paced and around forklifts constantly. Must be able to lift 10-75 lbs.We start at 4:00  and The aim is to be done by 10:00 with all the product to look neat, clean and straight. Along with all your cardboard and shrink rap in the recycling bailers. Also have experience as a tire technician."
good,Coworker stand out about this company everyone is willing to help. But the management makes it tough because they want 100% but don’t really train and make it understaffed.
good,"Good wage and good people, but it can be a bit stressful. Managers can be strict but fair. Wage is a decent wage as well. It's a great place to start building experience and advance."
good,Good place to work..... Good pay.... good benefits.... good management..... Good hours.... good co workers....pay raise and benefits are adjusted on hours worked
good,I enjoyed my time (Seasonal) working at Costco. They care about their members and their workers. They follow the law. They also want it to be a good place to work.
good,"This company is a great job for those starting out or wanting a career in retail. The company however is very serious about hard work and it is important to get the work completed as quick and safely as possible. As long as you are safe and productive the job despite how tough it can sometimes be, the job can be rewarding and an great experience for your future career."
good,"Very flexible with work schedule and time off request.many opportunity to move up or transfer to other warehouse's in state or out of state.great medical benefits, 401K, profit sharing. great people that you get to work with."
good,Shifts were often upwards of 8 hours but in a good environment. Employees were allowed to listen to music as they worked and management often went out of their way to help complete the work as well as reward the employees for their time.
good,"Come into work sign in using my membership card, go into the break room and hang my coat and bag up in my locker then head out to the floor and find out what till I was on by a manager and who I was taking off the till. When I go on the till at the start of the my shift I have to check the till has the correct change as the person before left it and it is all there. Then start serving. I have my break half way through my shift and then just do the same process after my break. I really enjoyed working there as I interacted with customers every day and got to learn new things within the job, as I was only a Christmas temp I left on Christmas eve."
good,"Good company to work for. Pays fairly, adheres to high industry standards, ability to apply to switch departments and/ or location if desired. Fast paced work environment but rewarding experience."
good,Great benefits and career opportunities from warehouse to corporate. The grind for seniority and work hours for raises is the only downside. Average of 5 to 6 years to top out and when hired you’re bottom of the totem pole. However continuing to stick with this company on the rise is a great idea. As long as you’re willing to deal with being on the bottom for a while.
good,"Everyday was a different day. In my 2 departments a day would consist of paperwork, dealing with merchandise, talking with members about memberships, scheduling apps etc. The pay and benefits were amazing, as well as most of my team felt like family. The hardest part of my job I would say was working so much, more hours than scheduled taking time away from my family."
good,You have to work your way through but top rate part time even is very good. Much has changed afls far as how long the steps take but put in your time and it's a great company
good,"Me hubiera gustado quedarme más tiempo, pero en otra área."
good,I had a very good 14 years at Costco and would recommend the job to someone with lots of energy and ambition. They take very good care of their employees.
good,"They were alright, lots of traveling (which I loved) but overall great experience because of the people I was surrounded by and had the pleasure of working with."
good,"Room for growth, good benefits, good co workers, room to learn new things and able to transfer jobs to other states. I enjoy working the flexible hours"
good,"Hard working person and willing to learn more,responsible and respectful.wiling to work overtime if necessary,always on time,well clean and organized person."
good,"They worked well with my school schedule and personal life. It's a great job if you are not afraid to put in some hard work and be on your toes all day. At Costco you must provided friendly & professional customer service, greet and direct members, and keep the store show time ready."
good,"Tienen muy buenas prestaciones y cotizan lo correcto en tu seguro social, son una empresa responsable y de confianza con un buen ambiente laboral"
good,"First of all, I like to say working at Costco was one of my greatest work experience and very enjoyable. A typical day would be usually very busy and fast-paced, I'd need to get the customer's attention immediately to introduce the product that I was demonstrating. An example like a food item... the quality, taste, ingredients, value and nutritional values. My manager was the greatest which helped with everything about the job. I love the culture of the workplace because everyone work together when they need it to work together and helping each other. Duh hardest thing I believe was when somebody went on break and didn't come back on time when I was a breaker. The most enjoyable was helping the people to decide on the product that was something they may be looking for or actually helping them find something they were looking for I love to talk to people and I am a friendly person so it was fun for me."
good,"I liked working at Costco, there was always really good communication and structure so learning a new position was never difficult and you always had support from management."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of arriving to work at 2am and leaving by 11-1pm. My work duties consisted of making sure isles are all fully"
good,"Fun atmosphere, rewarding work, lots of room for growth and great pay. Management can be a bit erratic at times but great coworker and culture.  Would go back in a heartbeat!"
good,Preparing food and displaying them . Friendly employees and wonderful customers. Cleaned work area.  Worked seasonal and hoping to stay permanently one day .
good,This is a fun and busy work environment. The staff are for the most part dedicated to the store and its members. Only draw back is when the company changes its performance review and pay structure for the associates. It is unfair the way they decide to effect some and not all.
good,"Very busy at times.Enjoy working with people and customers."
good,"All around it was a good job. You got yearly raises, usually $.50 or so. Good benefits and paid time off, vacation, and sick pay after 90 days. The management was here and there depending on the department you were in. They worked well around school schedules and were pretty good about allowing time off."
good,"At Costco Wholesale, I learned a lot from different types of cultures to different types of social groups. Many people come through Costco a day and they are all special in their own ways, I loved working there because of the interaction with all the customers from different social incomes and jobs. I learned how to be unbiased and keep a smile no matter what because in life stuff happens for a reason."
good,I loved working here wish I was still there. The company is very hard on you once you get hired from the temporary service. Pay is good the benefits are better .
good,fast fun and friendly work environment. good pay and benefits. you need to be pretty physically fit to work for Costco- standing on your feet and walking for 8 hours
good,Fun fast paced place to work. Very generous with the hours and benefits. Friendly employees tho is a stressful environment especially with the diverse customers.
good,Great pay and benefits but can be over competitive to move up and some outer department managers were inept. Overall good experience with upper management and high customer service standards.
good,"working at costco was like working with my second family. lots of fun, fast paced environment with lots of things to do. excellent benefits and sick/paid time off provided."
good,"The benefits, the pay, the hours, the speed of the job, all worth it! The hardest part of this job is being on your feet all day but management and benefits make the job worth it"
good,"Its one of the best employers in the state, WLB is great, benefits are great and you do see a lot of people here that have worked for a long time (employee retention is high).  However when you get to mid-management level, we are not competitive salary-wise with other companies. If they want to keep us, they do need to start looking into this more.  We have a great crop of people that work at Costco that are passionate about the members and the company, it's a hard pill to swallow when you look out just so you are properly compensated."
good,But i felt discrimination sometimes overall loved it i worked hard did everythig they asked i just dont understand but im i was seasonal a day at work is like running on a tredmill stayed busy work place is the best loved my co workers love the enviorment i just think i did nit fit in will i go back yes in a heartbeat i highly recommend
good,Everything about this place is great but the scheduling and seniority.Great people and easy work but working 2-1030 is usually the hours for new hires
good,"Great culture and peers, job however is very demanding and fast paced. Opportunity for advancement is present. Management is good and tries to be as understanding as possible."
good,"Because Costco is based on membership fees in order to shop there, a lot of members feel like they are always right, despite many people telling them differently.  There is a huge sense of entitlement.  I would recommend working here, 100%, just make sure you don't take the job home with you."
good,This is great place to work. It had great compensation and benefits. Management was okay. Work life balance wasn't the best. They did offer PTO and sick days.
good,I loved working at Costco. It taught me to be a fast passed worker and how to be a leader. I also learned a lot of responsibility and how to be a good worker.
good,Don't build relationships and stay to urself... the warehouse suck do to many people not respecting the 5 core values of Costco.. But the Deposit are amazing U work and people are around are like family
good,"Costco offered me a 20-30 hour work week as a part time member. The general hours were 3-11:30 and concluded of a variety of tasks during the day when store hours were open. And stocking once store hours were closed."
good,"A typical day involves assisting Members at the Front End.  Answering any questions Members have.  Assisting the cashiers at the registers.  Working in Photo lab.  Learned all of the duties of a Photo Lab associate including photo development, ink cartridge filling, video transfer orders and passport photo production.  Workplace environment is fast paced.  Hardest part of the job are the physical demands.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the appreciation of so many of the Members for the assistance given to them."
good,"working at Costco was very good company to work for but i moved to wales for my personal reasons otherwise i still would be working for them , excellent comapny to work for realy look after there staff  as well as memmers"
good,They offer the best benefits and pay scale for retail. They promote within so if you want to move up you can. Managers work unpaid ot so unless you're a senior manager it is really difficult. As an employee you can move around between departments and learn as much as you can. Overall they offer tons of opportunity for those who work hard.
good,Costco Wholesale is a great place for growth and opportunity. They like to promote from within and are extremely dedicated to preparing subordinates for their next career goals.
good,The job was rather simple and not too demanding in the sense of you have a specific job here is how you do it so get it done fast and correctly but safely
good,"Costco can be a good place to work because"
good,I loved working at Costco and there is endless possibilities to advance. You can always apply for different jobs around the warehouse and they give you the opportunity to succeed when you work hard. Aren’t as flexible with time off amd hours when you first start. Seniority gets the best hours and first pick on vacation days.
good,"the job was laid back and friendly, the customers were a nightmare and very entitled. I worked in the call center not directly within costco, but when we had to call out to a costco location the staff was friendly as well. pay is great, gave overtime, costco paid for great desks and computers and the environment was nice and everyone was kind."
good,"es buena empresa en donde el trabajo es seguro, pero baja el trabajo y perdemos."
good,"The company expects you to work hard and maintain productivity. I recommend to keep yourself busy or at least pretend to during the slow days. Ask the supervisor or manager questions of things you’re unsure of. The company is there to help you but you need commitment to keep you there. The company is great. If one department is not working for you or got old, you can request to move."
good,"it was very fast pace and sometimes stressful "
good,Costco is a fun environment to work at with a lot of great people. They are very flexible with schedules and are very supportive of there employees. They offer a lot of great opportunities for growth
good,There were great people and very clean! the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help people locate their items. The hardest part was also the customer
good,Great company for college students needing jobs and for those who would like to be managers. Costco offers great benefits and they really appreciate your hardwork.
good,"It was an amazing place to work, where effort is noticed and willingness to complete tasks is valued. The group became a second family  and I loved spending my time there, both on and off the clock. I will gladly work for the company again."
good,Standing long periods of time always running around always busy. Cleaning packing stock and group effort and there is always team work communication is key
good,Work was always busy inside of costco. I worked for AT&T and sold DTV inside of the the costco Retailer. It was a tough position but challenged me in a good way.
good,i worked in the bakery so i was icing cakes all day. i learned better ways to ice cakes. seeing the smiles on the customers faces when you gave them the cake was the best part.
good,"Great pay and benefits, hard to move up unless you have been there for awhile. Coworkers are very friendly and helpful. You can learn to cross train if you’d like as well."
good,"Excelentes prestaciones, la cultura es muy buena.."
good,"Great Store! Great products, Great food, fast paced, & challenging. Discounts at Verizon Kiosk, Hard work retrieving steel carts but also a fun workout!"
good,"J’ai adoré le temps travailler chez Costco."
good,Probably the best job you can get outside of a career. Guaranteed raises about ever six to seven months Very fast paced and most of managers don't know how to talk to people or communicate effectively. Work in one of the fresh departments if given a chance.
good,enjoyed working there Miami Lakes Costco. Fellow co workers very nice and helpful if you work hard will get hours very hard to be full timer try and learn to do every department.
good,This was one of the best jobs I've ever had. The coworkers and supervisors are very welcoming and patient with new hires. The pay is about 2-3 dollars above the general area as far as minimum wage goes too. The hours aren't too bad and you can easily request to change your availability to the administration. You also get to do a lot of different things unless you apply for a specific department.
good,"Good pay"
good,It's a decent place to work the pay is good and the benefits are great it's just that the hours bounced up and down alot there's not a set amount of hours per week
good,Management always scheduled you appropriately and work was not too difficult. Coworkers were friendly and the benefits were nice. Never asked to do what we couldn't
good,Loved working at Costco.  The employees were all happy to he there and showed it.  It's a lot of labor but it's worth it knowing it gets you somewhere in time.  The benefits are great once you are full time.  7 years at full time you can make almost $30 an hour so it's a good job.  It's just almost impossible to get into honestly.  I worked my butt off during seasonal and they weren't hiring any positions after and by the time they do so many other people busted their butts and go in everyday waving at them and know people that it's very unlikely to stay on even if your about the best fit
good,"Great customer service provided to all memebers, can do attitude."
good,"It is a mad house during all holidays. Customers can get very mean because they pay for their membership to shop there, so there is a sense of entitlement from customers."
good,"fast paced environment, good benefits but limited opportunities to advance. the best part of the job is being able to learn new things every day and working with healthcare professionals."
good,"I really like working there , that is why I am looking to come to Sams it is like and ran like Costco an Excellent place to work and provide for your self without struggling in life."
good,Bon avancement de carrière chez coscto avec de bons avantages sociaux !
good,"Costco was an excellent place to work.  I was constantly busy, which made the time go by fast.  It is a team environment where people pitch in to help each other out in different departments as needed.  The hardest part of the job is actually getting hired on after the season.  The most enjoyable part was the friendly atmosphere."
good,This is very friend and family culture. It is a Great place to work. It eventually Really pays off once you top out and start getting bonuses. Great growth opportunities.
good,"I was lucky enough to send in my application right as a vacancy opened up, but knowing someone is absolutely your best bet, but not impossible otherwise. "
good,"This was a great place to work with plenty of advancement if you were able to just show up and do your job. I was seasonal, and so I was not offered a position but would have liked to have become employed with them. Enjoyed the work environment."
good,Costco is a busy place where employees are always busy. As an employee I learned to adapt with a lot of change and difficult co workers. Overall we are family at Costco which is awesome but also can be the hardest part of the job. I enjoy that I am always working hard.
good,"A typical day at work consists of ensuring that the guests are treated with the satisfaction of the items they are buying, and answering any questions they may have. I've learned from management that we need to stay humble and make sure we do our duties in a good manner when we are there. The most enjoyable part of the job was to converse with the guests about items that I do help when I'm at the register and make conversations with the guest about how their visit is and what we could improve as a company and as a team."
good,"This was a seasonal/temporary position. Could have turned permanent for me, with the exception I was tardy. They have a short window of time allowed to punch in for shift. Must be very punctual. Other than that I truly enjoyed working for Costco. They are very good to their employees"
good,Moving forward is better. Costco has a very special to serve their people. Costco also have the best whole sale product for the public to enjoy it. Good company to work with your college Schedule.
good,Great place to work but scheduling is based on their needs. Great opportunity for advancement. Overall great place to learn and start a career from scratch.
good,"it was ok, feet just hurts and folding clothes is an annoying job. I hated being a girl and pushing carts, becuase i had to do it in the rain and snow, and I thought that it was a little ridiculous to make a female to that kind of work."
good,"I was hired/rehired 5 times, full-time, part-time, seasonal.  My focus (pun) was strictly in the One Hour Photo area."
good,"Costco treats employees extremely well with regard to pay and benefits.  In return, it asks a lot of its employees.  Training is abundant as Costco tries hard to minimize turnover."
good,"Costco is a great place to work. If you put in the time you can eventually advance into a supervisory role."
good,Treated with fairness and excellent benefit package. Costco really tries to advance employees from within. Always try to keep a competitive wage nationwide.
good,"Costco is a great place to work.  The only drawback is there is not much opportunity for advancement.  They pay well, have good benefits and it is a fun work environment."
good,"The culture is competitive and a lot of the people that work there are not friendly to new employees. However ,the pay and benefits outweigh that. They are extremely willing to work with school schedules, which is refreshing."
good,The job was very straightforward. The management was very pleasant but sometimes the leads were forgetful or less involved than needed for a newer employee. The more troubling things were the distribution of products because sometimes the customers would surround you in numbers or were unsatisfied.
good,"The only thing I will complain about is that there were some employees that were clearly incapable or just plain useless that the management knew about but never did anything to fix, not to mention the constant reminders from all the rest of us. Other than that, I loved working at Costco and I would recommend it."
good,"The place is constantly buzzing, so you'll never be bored and the pay is great, especially for a job that is not that hard. There is not really a downside to the job, Costco really adapts to what you need and want of a workplace."
good,I really enjoyed being part of a Natioanl Corporation with an above average work culture with tins of job security. Management in the Optical Department lacks the ability to progress into modern times as far Equality.
good,"At Costco we pride in giving members Executive Member service. A very fast pace environment, always moving. Everyone there has a smile on their face and always willing to help you with anything you may need.  Management was not the best while I was an employee, we went through 4 General Managers. The hardest job is Refund Clerk because you are giving money and have to be very careful with the process of the refund. I liked being a Vault Clerk, that was the most enjoyable position for me."
good,Costco pay was great. Raises are based upon the amount of your hours you put in. Benefits are great. Everyone walks in the door part time but you are typically given more hours. Hours are flexible.
good,nice place to work but managers lack training. promotions come from within so there is a lot of favoritism and nepotism where I worked. Hard to lose job once youre  hired though
good,"Overall for retail Costco Wholesale is a great place to work! Friendly staff, managers and employees are respectful. Very hospitable to newcomers and they take great care of their employees and members!"
good,"I had a great time meeting people and got along well with my co-workers. The managers were amazing and easy to talk to and the whole experience was fast paced but manageable. My job was only seasonal however, I do not believe I ever had a bad day at work."
good,"Hands down, the best company I have ever worked for. The salary was not bad, the benefits were incredible, the stock options and 401k was amazing. I wish I did not have to leave this great company. Unfortunately, some young and stupid mistakes lead to my release at Costco."
good,"I loved working for Costco. I learned a lot from Costco, and they groomed me to be detailed in my work environment. If your in college they are more then willing to work around your school schedule. You are fully trained in hazmat, environment awareness. The company fully trains their employees. As well as recertified annually. "
good,"I enjoyed my career with Costco and look forward to providing my management skill, style and attributes with a new company. Costco was an employer where prior knowledge and experience was appreciated and then groomed to the standard that the company set for productivity, member service, employee respect and profitability."
good,its a great start and can be a carrier if you put your mind to it. it was a good inviorment with toxic management a lot of family members working together and a lo of''quit po quo' or i scracht your bag  you screacht mine'
good,"Awesome company to work for! I truly love working here, and would highly recommend for anyone looking for a job. Although you start part time, you can easily pick up hours when needed, and always get above 28+ hours. I am part time and get about 34-36 hours a week."
good,"I worked part-time (min. 25 hours) at Costco as a night merchandiser. The work was not that exciting, but the pay and culture made up for that. As a night merchandiser I worked in the clothes/shoes/accessories department."
good,Costco has excellent working hours that adjust to your necessities and work Whit my team members was pretty good
good,Amazing company to work for. I have been with this company for over 10 years and it has made it possible for me to be able to learn many different skills and sides of the business.
good,"come to pharmacy with lots of Rx to count and dispense. Because of the volume of the prescriptions and long work hours some times, it is bit stressful and frustrating"
good,"A typical day at work was steady business with low stress. I learned much more leadership skills and abilities that would greatly help in a warehouse environment such as auditing the warehouse, pallet condensing, pallet jack operation, as well as proper merchandise presentation."
good,"As long as the member is happy were happy. "
good,"Empresa altamente competitiva "
good,"Had a great time there, good pay and benefits, fairly relaxed atmosphere, this company was very sensitive to what keeps an employee's loyalty, loved the staff and customers."
good,productive and rewarding place to work. the job offers many opportunities for advancement. i like how the company hires from within. this creates a lot of competition in the company.
good,"A typical day at work for me at Costco Wholesale was a full daily itinerary prior to the store's opening of finding and stocking new items, assembling displays for new or high priced items that were received, and ending with handling money as a cashier once the warehouse had opened. I learned much about the company during my four years working there. I learned the ins and outs of how to use a company database, how to order/regulate inventory, how to work independently and train new hires, as well as expanding my skill set with even more customer service experience. "
good,The company culture was great to be a part of during my time with them. During the Christmas rush there were always things to be done but management and team members made it so that the time flew by.
good,I’m very family orientated I’m straight I’m great policy great rules great membership on my will also say that if you do work with them they do give you a membership to his wealthy the company so you get discounts on gas food equipment there and stuff too as well when you do get great benefits as in a bonus every six months after your first year and then that’s about it
good,"Started Management with this company, as Price Club, and then Costco.  Some days long hours but fun, with a great team of people. nothing hard about this job, just be there and get your work done."
good,"Costco has always been a leader in merchandizing and the wholesale industry. In their pharmacies Costco provides exceptional customer service, fair pricing, and generous benefits to its employees.  Work place is active and steady but nor very stressful. Staffing is adequate. Would recommend a career with Costco without hesitation."
good,Typical day at work is essentially very fast paced.  There are high expectations because the company values their reputation.  The employees are paid better wages and offered benefits that not many other companies offer.
good,The best part about working at Costco is the health care benefits as well the people you work with. The salary is higher then most retail jobs however its hard to justify it based on the housing market in Toronto. However most of us stay at Costco because of our co-workers but management can be a pain sometimes.
good,long hard working i enjoyed this field of work the  time I was there. there was always something to do at the job. I was always on my feet moving around with was good for me because I was never bored here.
good,Worked in the Tire Center installing tires and also being a cashier and assisting members with selection of tires and car batteries. I learned how to use a lot of different systems.
good,Tough But fast enviroment and very enjoyable. Hardest Part of the job was makign sure prductivity was perfect but we had a great handle on it. Most enjoyable part was interacting with the Customers
good,"cool people"
good,"Great teamwork and excellent management, its really a nice place to work"
good,"Costco is a great company to work for. They take care of their employees and the members. I learned  most of my business knowledge from Costco. I was able to send both daughters to college and buy a house and a condo, I enjoyed woking for Costco all 18 years."
good,"Costco is an excellent place to be employed. The pay is comparatively higher than other jobs of the same type. The benefits are very good. The issue I have are with upper level management. They become stagnant and lazy. They are less inclined to mentor and educate middle management, so they can gain proper experience and knowledge. It's a great company and I'm not going to hate on it."
good,Costco was a great learning experience for me. I started as a cart pusher and worked my way into the building.I became a part-time meat cutter where I helped stock and load the machines.
good,"Costco cares about their employees, provides great benefits, vacation time, bonuses, holidays off, etc. The want their workers to enjoy their jobs which help with employee retention.  They also want employees to also have time with their families as well."
good,"Love working the public and the members ask for your assists."
good,"Its boring if you dont want to progress"
good,I learned to always be productive and to never be just sitting around waiting for something to do. For every 2 hours worked I would recieve a break and after 2 breaks lunch.
good,"En Costco se requiere mucha paciencia para el trato con el socio, tolerancia a la frustracion, el objetivo y los principios de esta empresa van encaminados hacia la excelencia laboral y servicio al cliente, me gusto y aprendi a conocer otras areas de la bodega, llegue a ser gerente del departamento de optica, y el manejo del departamento fue muy bueno y me agrado la parte administrativa, pero se volvio muy absorbente el trabajo por la falta de cobertura y el horario que no es fijo."
good,"This fast-pace job requires you to be on your feet for up to 8 hours a day. If you want to move up quickly, show initiative. It has great benefits for family for a great price. Also, it's a great place to work as a student since th work with school schedule really well."
good,The environment here is very stressful but it pays off. You work hard and long enough management will notice and try to give you different responsibilities to see if you are ready to be promoted to another level.
good,The management does a great job with scheduling for employees that juggle work and school or just two jobs.  It isn't a high stressed retail job either except for the holidays.
good,"Always on time, customer oriented, safe, strategic thinker, trustworthy, fast paced worker, personality, team player, inventory counting, multi tasker8"
good,Es un muy buen lugar para trabajar rodeado de personas de tu edad y con muchas prestaciones y capacitación siempre.
good,I love working with people and while at this position I had the opportunity to see people literally from all over the world. People would come in to shop and sample the foods. It was a busy place to work and great conversation all day long.
good,Costco is a great place for anyone to work. Their pay structure is presented very clear and your pay is advanced based on the time you commit to the company. It is a fun environment and is always moving at a fast pace
good,Worked as a start up for Costco in transition from American express. The start of it was a little bumpy but it has now been 1 year and things are going well.
good,"Great Place to work but really easy to get fired. If placed in and other position in the warehouse, you will do great an love it but the deli is really dangerous due to all the rules and regulations with ready to eat food."
good,I enjoyed working for Costco because I think there is a lot of opportunity for advancement. I also liked the family atmosphere that they create for the employees.
good,"Es una empresa muy buena basada principalmente en sus colaboradores, que son los que brindan el servicio y así la empresa es preferida entre otras del mismo ramo, ademas de un ambiente de trabajo sano, entre sus diversos niveles de jerarquiza,."
good,"Costco is an exciting, fast paced and very diverse environment.  Assisting members is challenging and extremely rewarding.  Every employee is regarded as a member of ""a winning team""!  I love yhe environment."
good,"Everyday was pleasant. Bakery, and meat department were the fast paced work place. I enjoyed both my times in both departments. You learn a lot of different skills as far as leadership qualities. Management was excellent in the warehouse I worked at in those departments. I learned leadership, speed and being independent, Also learning how to operate different machinery, The hardest part of the job was pleasing Warehouse managers. The amount of work you put in, was never enough, But the department managers were always behind the employees back, as far as their Supervisors. They never turned on their employees to save their own and I can honestly say I respected them a lot more. My most enjoyable part of the job was my colleagues. They were my foundation of wanting to become a better worker and to never give up. Due to the fact they never gave up on each other. We had a bond that I can I say was one of the strongest in our warehouse. Always encouraged each other to push ourselves when times were tough, and gave physical and emotional support and for that I thank them for the person I came today,"
good,I think CDS is a great place to work in. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be more outgoing and who wants to balance school with work. I have fun working for them and i think it has made me a great sales advisor.
good,"I was seasonal, so I wasn't able to experience a lot of things. However, the management seemed like friendly people, and the job was not hard (morning merchandiser). However, you work mostly by yourself, so not a lot of time to socialize."
good,"great position steady wage increase, kind employers/coworkers respectful busy environment, amazing lunch options, don't forget about the samples!!!!!!!+$4 /hour sunday holidays x2 pay and a half"
good,"This was a great place to work (even on a seasonal basis), but you have to have open availability for them to take you seriously. They say that they work around a students schedule and encourage people to continue their education, but that wasn't my experience."
good,i enjoyed work while i was there i left because of other job opportunity's i enjoyed my coworkers and management was good complaints being that the expected workload/share of workload between employees is not well balanced.
good,"Since being employed with Costco, I have been trained and have experience as a packer, cashier, memberships, as well as programs. I respect the management in the company as they listen to all the employee's concerns and resolve any situation in a timely and satisfactory manner. The culture is very friendly, fast paced and extremely busy. I feel the hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting of items that are over 5-10 pounds. I enjoy dealing with my coworkers and especially enjoy speaking with members on a daily basis. I have developed many friendships of my coworkers as well as members since beginning at Costco."
good,"Working with this company allowed me to travel, set my own hours, pick and choose my sales leads. I quite enjoy working with costumers in helping them through the entire process of interior decorating."
good,"A typical day at work included helping cashiers, packing shopping, watching over the jewellery counter and designer handbags. "
good,"COSTCO is a box store supplier that has been well developed to supplying shopping products in bulk, at an affordable price. They take good care of their employees and members. We do have to travel to continue shopping there, but it is always worth the journey. Their Kirkland brand products are of high quality and competitive in price."
good,Supervised a group of 20+ individuals and monitoring sales based on the manufacturing product that each sales associate was demonstrating in order to improve the manufacturing product sales. I enjoyed meeting so many different cultures of ppl that enjoyed so many different foods around the country that Costco Wholesale has since they sell many imported foods. I learned more about different foods as well and as supervisor kept productions sales for the company within the top 5 Regionally for three years in a row.
good,Costco is a great place to work. Great benefits and advancement opportunities to move up in the company. Great work enviorment with a great Management staff.
good,Until i had my accident in costco i thoroughly enjoyed my job i did a variety of roles there including being a cashier and member services
good,"Working at Costco is very fast paced, energetic, and enjoyable. Most work is done independently or with few others. Work is supervised intermittently. Hours are very flexible and management is approachable, though with the large amount of employees, they often lose track of who is who."
good,"Day is very structured"
good,"would change tires in the shop and some nights I would stock products. My management was some of the best that Costco has to offer, as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job would have to be balancing large tires, I enjoyed getting my hands dirty"
good,"I always enjoy working at a public place,I also love to help customer. I leaned how to help different people in order to help them with their problem.I have a good experience for manage patient records and files. I enjoy team work.I think there is no hard part for the job if we work as a team.when we make our customers happy is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I just didn't have enough help and support to make job run smooth. But overall it was a great experience,  people was friendly and kind."
good,"Un dia típico de trabajo dentro de la empresa se define como un reto, un poco cansado pero a pesar de ello te enseñan a manejar las situaciones que se puedan ocasionar y a salir adelante utilizando las herramientas propias."
good,Great company to work with.  Excellent pays and benefits.  Many opportunities to relocate to other locations.  Most customers are very pleasant and friendly.
good,"Great place to work, Good pay, you are never bored there is always something to be done. Management and co-workers are great. you get a good amount of breaks for the hours you work and the team work is very good!"
good,i enjoyed working at costco. was there for almost 10 years. I pays really well compared to any other retail store. I worked in the bakery and it is the most demanding department in the warehouse. the most overtime if your ok with that. great people to work with. i worked at a union building so its hard to move up in the company since it goes by seniority.
good,"Excelente clima laboral y muy buenas presentaciones."
good,"Most times I'd be on the floor doing my daily tidy up. Or giving all my attention to members who needed assistance. "
good,"First and foremost Costco is an excellent company. It is an extremely fast paced environment. Your co-workers are truly more like family, everyone is very close. The company itself offers many incentives such as great health benefits, yearly bonuses and promotional opportunities. I learned a wealth of knowledge in customer service and deescalating issues. I also learned how to run a high volume department, as well as manage and supervise many employees. The hardest part of the job is not the fast pace that you naturally grow into that because of the nature of the business. The hardest part is learning to work in such a large warehouse with so many different personalities. The most enjoyable part is the gratification you get when a customer/ member is satisfied with your work. Costco is really about helping everyday people."
good,"difícil compaginar familia trabajo, gerente general muy difícil de tratar. excelente clima laboral."
good,"I love my job.  I look forward to seeing most of the people I work with every morning.  We work hard but have a lot of fun.  I have been working there for almost 16 years, but as time goes on, sometimes changes are made, and when you are use to many years of the same thing, sometimes change is a little harder to take."
good,"Great company , Room for growth, great pay and care for employees."
good,Overall it was a great job.  Great co-workers.  It was a building block in my life!  I really enjoyed the people at the job!  I wish to find a job like this again!
good,"The Experience was great! Got along with everyone and work well as a team to ensure the customers received the best service! "
good,"Esta empresa es muy buena ya que cuida mucho a su capital de trabajo, impulsa mucho el crecimiento interno y el ambiente es muy sano y divertido. "
good,I first started at Costco in the food court well I would cook food in a timely matter and work the cash register. Later I would become a bagger and then cashier. I really enjoyed working with fellow employees and interacting with customers. The hardest part was having to work at a high pace. After that I would work in the tire shop selling and mounting proper tires for vehicles.
good,"I really do have more that good to say about Costco. Great pay, great benefits and for the most part a joy to work for. I will say that it is VERY difficult to get promoted in my location. I believe this is to do with the fact that no one ever leaves the company. One other issue, Costco was once a promote from within company and a company that would promote based on experience and tenure. I have seen may cases where this is no longer true."
good,Costco was a great company to work for. The staff was easy going and was more family oriented. The pay was good and the benefits were good as well
good,I have worked for Costco optical lab for 3 years now and I love it. You learn so much and they pay very well.  Very good company .
good,"estar en cajas es un área muy padre pero con gran responsabilidad ya que manejas dinero en efectivo y puedes tener faltantes en caja o bien billetes falsos."
good,Costco's typical day at work consisted of me helping customers with their grocery and also carrying loads of grocery. The management was very kind and my co-workers were very welcoming.
good,"My only concern is the relationship between supervisors and management in the way that they treat there employees. The are excellent with members, however there is a definite need in mending relationships with staff."
good,"Enjoyed working at Costco.  Very friendly and productive atmosphere.  A team work environment and exceptional benefits. "
good,"I enjoyed this job a lot, staff was easy to get along with and Management really broke down how and what they expected. When i started at the warehouse it wasn't too popular but as time past more and more people would come in, because of this i learned how to function better in stressful situations. Fast and effectively."
good,"Los días trabajando en costco eran geniales ya que se respiraba un ambiente juvenil, me hubiese gustado trabajar en otras áreas"
good,"Costco is a great place to work, but the part time hours make it hard to reach your raise requirements.  I enjoyed helping members choose the right cut of meat for their needs.  I didn't enjoy the toll the job took on my body, however i did get into shape rather quickly.  My immediate supervisor didn't respect his employees very well, and that made the job difficult, but my fellow employees picked up the slack with training."
good,"Advice to Management"
good,It's a great company and the management is very interested in its personnel. They will work with you with any scheduling problems and the management is great.
good,This company has a great incentive program. Medical benefits are very good. Always room for growth. Its a union based company. Most employees buy/shop from within the company. Over all great company.
good,"You work hard at Costco, there is no sitting or chatting with co-workers. The member/customer is #1 and you give the members full attention and do anything in your power to please them. Costco pays well and has excellent insurance benefits. The company takes good care of their employees."

good,I do enjoy working with this company. I like co-worker and supervisor. I enjoy working with custmers. Like talking with the different people.
good,"They enjoy placing you in different areas of the store/warehouse, but you better be prepared to work. I've been placed on pushing carts for over four hours straight, but I lost weight doing so. They pay time and a half on Sundays, super bonus. Plus, it looks good on a resume."
good,When working at Costco as a deli clerk every time I come to work I felt good vides about this place plus everyone was respectful and polite. The management of this company was under control and well organize. I learn a lot from great people skills to food inventory.My co-workers was fantastic to me and customers never had a altercation with them and on are lunch breaks we will always make jokes of each others This store is really big and this lady was asking what section is this item located at. Remind I'm a deli clerk it took me a while to get familiar with the store then I got the familiar with the and locating were items are at. I love coming in early and checking the food inventory preparing the food for display and also keeping the customers satisfied.
good,"A typical day working for Costco would be for me to check with the shift supervisor to see where I would be placed & working for the day. I was mostly on the front end where I would help everyone that got in my line with placing there groceries on the belt to be scanned then I help them load there groceries neatly on the basket, when the line got slow, I would clean my area/ register, once clean if the line was still slow I would help anyone else that needed help. This job really didn't have to many hard parts, other then helping with groceries and cleaning, my duties weren't bad, I worked construction so this job was chill. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping everyone."
good,"Working with friendly customers and coworkers, while working with the products was very relieving and helped make a fulfilling day."
good,when working at Costco only worked as a seasonal and loved it a typical day of work we would just get down and do what we where told and complete it
good,"A typical work day for a T1 Ecomm agent is to come in sign into all programs and start taking calls. Help members with their problems, help them navigate through the site and place orders, help track packages."
good,"really enjoyed working for Costco , I enjoyed working fast with my hands to see a result. The managers as well as fellow employees treated me very well, with respect. everyone there helps each other out. managers will do jobs there subordinates do to get the job done and help out"
good,While working at Costco i aquired a fantasticset of time managment skills. I love working in a fast paced enviroment and being on a deadline is what I exceed at. I am a fantastic people person and I am also a great physical worker.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, and busy. There is always work to be done, even when all members have been taken care of. I have learned and obtained multitasking skills that can be used and applied in many daily tasks. The management genuinely care about the employees and always take care of the employees, as well as the members. "
good,Very much enjoyed working with my colleagues.  Costco is a great company and I was honored to work for them for almost 15 years.
good,"A typical day is to sign in and find out were you are going to be at starting time. As the day progresses you may go from cahier to boxer outside cart fetcher."
good,"cumpleaños celebra "
good,"Great Company.  Local Management needs improvements. Unless you're paying me for a review, this is the most you're going to get from me."
good,"well I love working with people,iam a people person.i got to try different things every day,so for me it was fun because everyday I didn't know what I was going to do everyday."
good,A typical day I would help out prepare all the food items that are needed for the day. I would also maintain the inventory that was needed and kept up with putting it away and making sure the department had what was needed on a daily basis. The hardest part was sanitation and closing up the department. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers. I had great management and co-workers
good,"fun, and great people to work with. management is great. "
good,"Entrada a las 5 a.m. Revisión del área y planificación de las tareas a ejecutar, asignación de las mismas al personal, revisión de productos críticos y faltantes y reportarlo, después, revisar productos nuevos recibidos, analizar y asignar la mejor posición para exhibir, revision del area de trabajo del gerente de la bodega, asignación de pendientes pendientes de mejora, revisión de tareas realizadas ´por el personal a cargo y corrección de errores, revisión de ventas por categorías contra año anterior, revisar resultados yy tomar desiciones, etc."
good,loved working for Costco but had terrible experience with the managment.
good,little opportunity to transfer because it's a good company-no turnover
good,making fresh produce in morning and checking ovens and prover
good,Had a wonderful time there working with a great team of employees and managers.
good,"I learned lots of things in Costco, how to manage lots of customers at onetime. all the members are from different countries and we enjoy talking to each other. the job is not difficult at all."
good,"Costco was a very fun experience, I meet a lot of new people, and many of the managers were satisfied with my work performance in the time period I worked there."
good,Learned many skills and departments. Ability to advance within the company. Great atmosphere and friendly people.
good,"i really liked working at Costco, i learned a lot of new skills and i appreciated the advice some of my coworkers gave on helping to maintain stable stamina since the work place was always busy with costumers ordering or picking up orders."
good,Costo is a family business good for seasonal job specially in the winters.
good,Costco offers employees great benefits as well as a secure work environment. They also offer fair pay. A typical day at work I am at the membership counter signing up members for our Executive and American Express memberships. My co-workers are great and very friendly and team players. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with our members and helping them understand our membership programs.
good,"A typical day at work would be going into a section of the store and stocking the shelves with food or other merchandise. I stay in that one area, with other people including managers and fork lift drivers. It can be stressful because sometimes there is a lot to do in a small time frame and only a couple of people for the amount of work you have to do but we manage to finish on time-all the time. At the end of the shift we clean up and open the store."
good,i would go back in a heartbeat. the employees where nice and treat you life family from day one. the customers all feel entitled to something but you get use to that after a couple days.
good,"i really like this place it had a great work culture,but my day went like this i would,come in and make sure that i had my reflective vest on so that peple cold see me in the lot.i would then go grab my rope that i used to pull the carts and i would work my way  around the parking lot making sure there was no bins to full..sometimes if we got to busy in the store i would come in and help that weather it b running the cas resigster or boxing thing or getting things of the floor for people,but i was a big team player what ever it took i did"
good,yworking at this company would be a learning experience. Learn from our co workers and our customers  Most enjoyable is seeing the customers happy and smiling especially when they have been helped
good,Excellent company to work for. The company believe in giving it's customers the best quality service and products. COSTCO truly support it's employees and have great benefits.
good,"Signed up new customers for club membership. Explained all terms and conditions of the club membership for understanding."
good,"My typical day was doing the same thing everyday. clocking in at 8:30 am and punching out at 5:30 pm , cleaning up our station and making sure we had our supplies on hand before we open, checking the items out the whole day , I gave great customer services and felt like we where family and I'm still friends with them today !"
good,"Me agradan las empresas que como costco, motiven a su personal, y los hagan sentir que son importantes, pues tenias muchas actividades para los empleados, como el empleado del mes, juntas bimestrales, desayunos para los niños de los empleados, buenas prestaciones, entre otros."
good,"A typical day at work was gathering carts for 2 hours, after gathering carts I would have to assist the cashier with unloading and loading the carts and if needed assist the customer's with loading their cars up with the merchandise. I would have to also put merchandise away to the proper place and restock merchandise to were it was presentable, after closing my duties were to report to the back of the warehouse and assist in cleaning up and restocking."
good,This is a fast paced working environment that requires a self motivated goal setter to take the lead and develop the business.
good,"Management would change alot over the months. The hardest part of the job was dealing with large items and having to lift them from the cart and check underneath them to make sure there isn't small items under. I enjoyed the holiday parties, the people I worked with went to my college with me. I learned how to deal with wholesale, how the membership system works. "
good,"Excellent to their employees, and members service. Good overall management. Good people to work with. My work day consist in doing the competetive shopping on gas prices early in the morning. Then on arrival to the Gas Station making sure that every pump is operational and ready for opening time. After that I have to do the paper work every morning and making sure all paer work of the previous night is in order. I've learned the importance of safety within the gas station on handeling each equipment with care and the importance of gas vapors not being released into the atmaosphere. I have a superb supervisor and co-workers. Thje hardest part of my job is trying to help every member when it's busy with alot of cars. The enjoyble part of the job is giving every member a pleasent time at the gas station. "
good,"A typical day would be taking orders from members to be delivered to their business. Handling orders and customer service issues. Making sure that the trucks had every thing they needed on them when they left. Dealing with driver issues while they were on the road. Making sure the orders were ready for the night crew to pick them for each business the next day. Then I would have to plan the route for the drivers deciding what driver took what route, and making sure the right orders got on the right truck. The hardest part was keeping everyone doing what they were suppose to sometimes, But the best part was when it all ran like clockwork."
good,"Hardest part is all the bending and lifting heavy weight. Learned responsibility, how to work hard and well with others."
good,Would work all day at a fast pace and at the end of the day you would actually get feed back from your managers. The leadership would sometimes spring for food for the workers.
good,Costco was great to work for. They truly do take care of their employees and I can tell they try their hardest in trying to maintain employee/Manager confidentiality. I Learned a lot about dealing with Members/Customers.
good,"although this job was over 10 years ago, I enjoyed working there..."
good,"Lots of work, but it was worth every minute. Learn to work with different type of people. Had good communications with my co-workers."
good,Good job Good benefits good job society. Work is work gotta do what you need to do.
good,Fast pace Buisness
good,Amazing CEO that operates all Costco's with integrity. The store had a great set of people working there. Company I will continue to support and shop at.
good,Responded to customer needs and requests.Handled cash and credit card transactions.Attained SKU Numbers and maintained warehouse inventory.Trained New Employees.Maintained and handled food in accordance to Health Code. Met new people.
good,"Being very productive through out the day, management is easy to get a long with. Co-workers are fun to deal with with an exception of a few lazy ones."
good,"I offer current and new members information on the programs and services available to members and the advantages of these programs and services. I work both at the membership counter and I approach members at the cash both using my own initiative and when called upon by the cashiers. The best part of my job is the interaction between myself and the members. I am a ""people person"" by nature and I have fun and enjoy talking to people and explaining what membership in Costco has to offer. I appreciate the feedback from fellow employees, management and the members. Sometimes members do not appreciate the scope of my job and what it entails but most are considerate, understand and want to learn about their membership and how it can be enhanced."
good,The workplace was very good. The supervisors are very understanding and able to give approperiate jobs to the right person to be finished at a set time.
good,"its a good company to work for its hard to get in. the bad side is no matter how hard you work the people who have know people who are higher up get them in the door even though they don't do the hard work,"
good,Great part time work if you're looking for some great experience and a great time. Starting wage is $15/hr and is $19 on sundays. Management is really outgoing for it's employees with the open door policy.
good,Costco is a great place to work. They foster a team.family oriented environment where supervisors and managers are always accessible and there are lots of opportunities for advancement within the whole company not just the call center
good,"Very good company with great benefits, culture and compensation. They promote from within the company. Great way to try different jobs and departments."
good,"While working at Costco it I learned more about the company and the people and it became apparent that Costco takes care of their employees with solid benefits, open communication, and a welcoming environment."
good,Although I didn't work there long I would suggest working there to anyone looking for a job. I currently have several applications in to them. I was only a seasonal employee.
good,"Working at Costco is not extremely over fulfilling, but is definitely something people decide to do until retirement because of the fair wages and benefits. Management is typically trained well and customers are treated very well."
good,Costco is an amazing place to work unless you work at the McKinney location. Floor manager was jealous of my hard work and ethics. Customers would always give praise for my customer service skills.
good,it was a very organized work environment and was run very well. I got to really understand and learn how to work efficiently in such a high speed environment. The managers were very nice in telling you when you were doing something wrong and how you could fix it. The hardest part of the job would have been having to always have a smile on your face even when a customer is rude or is not treating you well. That being said the most enjoyable part would be when a customer comes through and is so nice and enthusiastic and appreciative of what you do for them.
good,Everyone was super nice and helpful and one BIG TEAM.  You work hard but they make sure you get your breaks.  They train you in different areas. I liked moving around because if I was in bakery for 4 hours and go on break and went to Customer Service it made time fly.
good,"Most days are not too bad, the pay is excellent with great benefits. Management is decent and willing to listen to feedback and adapt. Major holidays Costco is closed although days around holidays are hard to get off."
good,"Costco is a very friendly, fun work environment. I was lucky enough to be apart of the grand opening in the Evansville area. The pay was great, they offered great health, vision, and dental insurance."
good,"This is a company that I would recommend to almost anyone that is looking for a job for a hourly job, to working in the corporate world. This company has great benefits and always put its workers first."
good,one of the best places to work. You clock in and do your job and everyone respects and treats each other equally. You work hard and reap the benefits.
good,"loved it, great place to work. pay is above average and you can't beat the benefits, health/dental/vision, 401k, paid vacation. everyone i worked with was very friendly"
good,"Good company to work for but, they judge too much on perception. Great pay and benefits. A good chance to advance if you relocate or willing to work weird schedule"
good,"The place is a very well ran establishment, and the benefits and pay are next to none. The atmosphere of the work environment is relaxed for the most part and can be full filling."
good,"They treat employees well, it’s difficult to leave! Some times there’s a lack of leadership, but there are checks and balances. You get raises per hours worked, not depending on your review, the benefits and 401k match is great, there is room to grow! Hours suck a bit, it’s seniority based and many people have been there 25+ years so new employees are typically closers working 5-10, 6-11 shifts. It’s overall a great place to work."
good,Costco was a really good company and I am so glad I had the opportunity to do volunteer work there.If possible I would not mind working there in the near future.
good,It was a few different managers on the floor coordinating together. I really didn't stay too long working there to see if there was any room for advancement because it seemed like there wasn't. The job was very easy yet tedious as far as my position. But the pay was great at the time and still is. Only thing is you get paid bi-weekly.
good,"I started at Costco because my father had worked there for over 20 years and they had always been good to our family. I knew the culture inside and out. Working there was just as good. They provide incredible support and benefits to their employees, even part-time. They are focused on growth within the company and constantly give employees opportunities to learn new departments and skills. It is NOT an easy job or an easy place to work. You will run, sweat, and probably cry over the stress and intensity. I did. But it's a job focused on customer service, employee satisfaction, and doing overall good. I felt that there. I recommend Costco to all seasonal workers, college kids, and those looking for a place to form a career."
good,Great starting pay and raises are earned pretty quickly if you work a lot of hours. Great benefits. opportunities for advancement as well as learning opportunities (such as switching departments)
good,"Compensated well for what is done, some departments are more of a step child. They let you move around and help where you can for more experience. Hard to advance unless you know people. Very fast paced in San Diego, total change of pace when I came to Duncanville. Awesome group of people in San Diego, more of a family. Duncanville way smaller, and less people. All in all great place to work if you can get on. Wish I could go back at times."
good,"Good place to work, most of management started on lower positions and worked up.The only issue is that since managers often start within they tend to be more idealized towards the company then other employers."
good,"I did three seasonal temp jobs at Costco back in 2010/2011 for the holidays and one summer temp job twice in Vista and once in Carlsbad. I loved the Vista Costco better because the people were more genuine and in Carlsbad the supervisor was a snob. I did have fun working there, but I did grow tired being on my feet all day."
good,"Fast paced environment with lots of room for advancement and mobility. enjoyed my time there, and they will keep you busy the entire day. Management was great and reasonable with expectations."
good,Very great place to work with great friendly upbeat staff. Very fast paced with friendly members. Great pay and benefits. 7 major payed holiday days off a year
good,"It's a good job, just our management was very favoritism type. Worked in 3 different positions there, but wS never offered advancement because of the favoritism experienced towards other employees."
good,"Great health insurance, vision and dental. Costco cares about their  employees. Very professional and no-nonsense culture. It was awesome for me! My type of job"
good,"I worked in the refrigerator warehouse. We received, inventoried, check and shipped out produce, meats and all of Costco's cold and frozen goods. It was a good job with excellent benefits and good management. They provide you with all of the cold weather gear you would ever need, and provide you with paid training. I even attended school while I was there and they worked with my school schedule. Very nice people to work for."
good,"A typical day at Costco revolves around a great amount of customer service. At the membership department, you usually spend your day creating memberships for new members and processing returns. I have learned to work efficiently while working here."
good,"Benefits are life changing for part time. After you meet the requirments, The hardest part of the job is waiting for full time opprotunity. The management makes sure you get breaks every 2 hours."
good,"Like most customer service jobs, the customers were the most difficult part of the job. The management team was very supportive and willing to work around school schedules. It is a very fast paced environment on the front end and if slow, you were usually sent to clean or help stock. Overall, one of my favorite jobs."
good,"Typical day starts with clocking in and constant things to do:"
good,"I really liked my experience at Costco, everyone was friendly and the time went by so fast because it was always super busy! There's a lot of benefits when working at Costco, 10/10 would recommend"
good,"Ive learned over the years. you put in hard work. you dont always get fair treatment,but always stay true to yourself. and continue working hard for yourself and family. Most of jobs have always come natural. I enjoyed the work. Ive learned lots of new skills along the way."
good,The benefits outweigh all the negatives. And the automatic pay raises create a fair environment. Theres too many managers/supervisors so sometimes it gets stressful but it’s a wonderful company.
good,Costco is a great company to work for. They take really good care of their employees. Member service is a big part of running the business. If you aren't able to deal with a constant flow of people then the job is not for you.
good,"The job itself is easy work on the mind, a little hard on the body as you are expected to be fast-paced and lift heavy items."
good,I’m excited to be apart of the Costco team. The hours I work are ideal they offer 401 stock options pto/sick time vacation medical dental vision a 2% cash back every year on the Costco Card. This job is great
good,I enjoyed work at Costco for the Holiday Season. The associates where friendly and helpful. Management was excellent when came to working around my fulltime job schedule. The customers were friendly and patient when I first started working.
good,"First you have to know that Costco is not a merit based company in some ways for front line roles pay starts good just above $15 right now.  Everyone gets it and your raises come when you work enough hours.   90 days of no insurance, approved time off or guarantee of having a job.  After that you accrue time off but most stores do not approve any unpaid time off and your expected to work the schedule offered.  Very senior people are always first in getting days off or picking schedule.  Its still a great place to work and has a fun culture."
good,"It was a fun and reliable place to work. They had a great training program and really took care of their employees. The pay was good, the shifts were good. I have no complaints about this place of work."
good,"If you are a honest and hardworking person this Costco will be a great job for you. If you are looking for a job where you don't have to do much and have a lot of time to slack off this might now be the job for you. They treat their employees well. It can be hard to get a job with them initially, but once you are hired you will quickly feel like a part of the Costco family."
good,Great job fast paced in raw pack off. I only left job due to a move. Was new plant so had some bumps a alot of overtime. They cooked for us alot. Free costco membership.
good,"Costco has great benefits and excellent scheduling flexibility for student employees. Expect to work hard. There is never any dead time at Costco.  As an employee, you should always be moving or doing something productive. The hardest part of the job is tending to a large number of customers."
good,Love working for the company. I feel blessed with all the opportunities available to me. Management needs to be more consistent. Some managers care about Costco’s morale and others are just there for the check and it shows
good,"Son jornadas de 10 horas, se descansa 2 dias a la semana"
good,I worked the mornings and everyone else was extremely helpful when I first started. Eventually I was able to use that knowledge and help those who started working there after me.
good,Tiene la mejor estructuración laboral para sus empleados
good,Amazing place to work with great pay and benefits! Highly recommend.  Lots of opportunities for growth and continuing education/professional development. Flexible schedule!
good,"Loved working for Costco, never really had a chance to work up to full-time. If I had the chance to get even close to 40 hours a week I would have stayed for the long term."
good,"Pretty standard retail work environment, driven by sales and providing exceptional member service. There are plenty of opportunities for learning new fields and areas of the warehouse. Can be hard to obtain full-time due percentage of current full-time employees."
good,"I love working there it was a very nice experience, you learn a lot about customer service, and I can definitely say that any its a privilege to work there"
good,"Even though micromanagement and lack of communication has a heavy hold at Costco, there are lots of great people who work here and the company genuinely cares about its employees. I am looking forward to many years with Costco."
good,I enjoyed my time at Costco and would love to go back in the future. The management treated us well. The co-workers were good and social. I enjoyed helping my customers. You never get bored because there is always work.
good,"Management was mostly accommodating. The job was always different so workplace boredom was rare. If another opportunity didn't come up, I would've stayed longer."
good,"People are really supportive. If I am talking about culture, they all belong in a diverse culture. They always ready to take part in a different activity."
good,"Enjoyable place to work with an understanding management staff. Costco offers a desirable salary as well as a great benefits package, and there is ample opportunity for advancement."
good,I really enjoyed the job at costco.i just wish they would give more hours.and abilities for faster or openings for advancement and extra checks sooner
good,"I enjoyed a lot working here, I lived the best years of my short life here, just a very great company. I learned a lot here at Costco from driving Forklift/ Pallet Jack, Machine Operator, Palletizer, Lead and there paperwork. the workplace culture is awesome . the most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere, I had some awesome co workers here at Costco."
good,Costco  was a place anybody would love to work I feel like the hours could be better the paid is great always keep yöu on your toes and yöu have a chance to grow
good,"A typical day consisted of planning out what items need re-stocking as well as what items need to be on the main displays depending on that day's samples. I learned that if you can not remain calm yet keep a sense of urgency under pressure, your chances of success are small. Being quick on your feet as well as your mind is the major key to being a good worker. Management do well in guiding you and even better are the co-workers in whatever area because of their experience can help in your efficiency around the warehouse. The most enjoyable yet difficult part of the job was stocking while members are zooming in and out of the narrow walkways between the refrigerators because of how exhilarating it felt."
good,"The job had great pay. I had to deal with people on a daily basis. The fun part of the job was greeting people. If we did not run out of boxes it would be an easy shift. The culture was very friendly. I liked my job, but there were certain coworkers that I clashed with from time to time. I did not like being sent outside all day. I would be outside and I felt like I was going to pass out. Everything else in the job seemed easy. The hardest part of the job was going outside. Some men slacked off while the women would work twice as hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers and their children. Also, the building of close friendships and bonds with my coworkers."
good,J'aime travailler au cotsco parce que cela me permet de comprendre à quel pont j'adore donner un bon service.
good,Good place to work. If I would not have had to move out of state I would probably still be working there today. I liked the people and the managers. Their lunch hours are strict. That's my only complaint.
good,"Costco was honestly a great place to work. I regret moving on to another job as it was honestly the most fun job I’ve ever had! There are so many different things to do, there is never a boring day."
good,"overall, everyone from the customers to the other workers were all very welcoming and open. It barely felt like work as I would be talking to customers and talking to my fellow workers who made the experience not even feel like work. I learned a lot in how to deal with customers and what works best when trying to help customers find what they are in need of. The hardest part about it was probably just being on my feet for so long, but thats every job isn't it? Having the smell of coffee surrounding me was a very big comfort for sure and made the hours just slip away."
good,"Una empresa muy buena, con política de puertas abiertas. "
good,Costco is an excellent employer that offers benefits and pay that are second to none.  They have created a work environment  that is inviting to new hires and the veteran employees.
good,"Good part time job for a college student, working cart return crew was quite easy while working inside assisting cashiers was considerable more difficult, especially when the store was at its busiest."
good,"Costco is a great place to work. The expectations are clear, training is provided for most departments (excluding those that require a license). Opportunity to progress your career is overflowing if you're willing to relocate, it can be difficult to be promoted past a supervisory role within the same warehouse. Costco's benefits are unmatched by many places, particularly within the retail industry. The problem, however, with benefits such as paid time off (I had three weeks vacation and over a week of sick/personal leave) was that I had to use vacation time for a day off on the weekend and from November through the beginning of January vacation requests were largely blacked out at my warehouse."
good,Great job but only hire seasonal when they need more permanent jobs. They let go of my entire class. Why give us a test if were only seasonal. Never applying there again.
good,Trabajar en Costco siempre fue agradable porque el area administrativa esta muy preparada.
good,overall a great company to work for. many people there are great and the work environment is always relaxed and fun. Some days are busier than others and job security there is really great.
good,"I've learned much from Costco, and if I weren't trying to go for my dream job, I would most likely make Costco a career. The benefits are unbelievable. I'm only part time, but I pay significantly less than my previous job. Also, Costco is very ethical in every aspect of the company."
good,This is honestly one of the best places to work. Your raises always come depending on how fast you earned them. It's fast-paced and as long as you stay focused on the job your day is go by like butter
good,Fast paced environment with all employees working together to give the customer the best shopping experience they can get anywhere. The collaborative effort to help each other was high and I enjoyed my time there.
good,Great company to work for they take very good care of their employees great benefits port management very hard to get promoted if you don't know someone above
good,"Costco pays very well, but can also over work you at times. It is expected of management not to use their sick time sometimes, but they need to realize that life happens... and you have to call in sick sometimes."
good,"Highly professional, efficient and well-trained technicians.  Well-balanced between prescription volume and ensuring safe/accurate dispensing of medications and addressing customer questions/concerns"
good,"I love working there. It has wonderful fun people to work with. The manager crew are very helpful and understanding. The hours are either pretty standard for retail 10 AM to 6 PM or 2/4AM to 10:30. The  company does like to promote from within but it is pretty competitive. The only thing that bothers me is there are not incentive raises, they are hour based"
good,"My typical workday was busy, fast paced, and fun! Management was very fair and understanding of my school schedule and helped me balance that with work."
good,"Costco is always in the running as one of the best places to work. Having had experience working at Costco, I can confirm this is accurate."
good,"- making sure new hot items are placed in proper category"
good,Working at costco was a good experience. It has great benefits and competitive pay. The workers there are always willing to help out and ensure your doing your job right.
good,The entire culture was very friendly from customers to coworkers to management. The hardest part would be pushing for customers to sign up with the current warehouse promotions. Other then that it was a very easy job for all the benefits. You do have to work hard to keep your job if you are hired as a seasonal employee.
good,if you enjoy working hard in a fast paced environment this is the place for you. It is easier to get a job a seasonal and work hard enough that they call you back.
good,This a good and fair company to work for. Good Benefits are offered to all employees. It's hard work very fast pass paced. There are opertunities for advancement.
good,learned to greatly improve my customer service skills and how to handle produce. The management there were kind and helpful. If i did not know how to do something the right way I did not feel scared to ask.
good,"As a college student, this is probably the best place to get started at. Full time or part time they work with your schedule and the pay was great starting out.  After your probation period, you get to get your benefits kicked in (membership, health insurance, dental, vision) all are covered via Costco Whole Sale.  "
good,"Great staff, reliable hours.. schedule was all over the place though. Hard to plan ahead of time. No consistency in schedule. Looking for 8- 4:30pm....."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, hard work, depending on what department you are working, but they make sure you get breaks, and lunches. Usually worked 4-6 hours a day."
good,"There's always something to do, very fast paced. Good salary, great benefits. Raises based on hours worked, accruals on personal time and vacation based on hours worked."
good,"During the slow periods after Christmas, job security is risky and its slower time for income for the corporation due to consumers recovering from holidays so its possible to get laid off or even worse fired for the smallest of things."
good,"A day would consist of talking to customers, bagging their groceries and pushing carts. Very fun place to work, helpful employees and great management."
good,A good employer that values their employees. Opportunities for advancement and several options of benefit plans. Advancement is fair and based on seniority.
good,"Working as a Costco member was an amazing experience! I worked with different age groups so I learned a lot of detailed knowledge about how to sell, how to engage myself with the customers, it was a lot of fun working at this environment!"
good,"Was long and also pretty tiring, always having what you want around the corner. I like running and sweeping and carrying heavy boxes. I would like to not be a leader, but a hard-working upbeat person and friend."
good,If you were a motivated single person who just wanted to live at the bottom it felt just fine. I could stock my area and go home once the job was finished. If you wanted to work past your shift you had to just check with leads and you were good to go. or they just sent you home.
good,Love working at  Costco!  Prices are very competitive for our members which keeps them coming into the store and referring their friends and family.  I feel valued at Costco by the upper management and have a strong sense of job security.
good,Es un ambiente activo de trabajo constante. Es un muy buen patrono.
good,"Costco is with out a doubt the best retailer to work for as an entry level employee. The culture and nature of the business far outdo anything Walmart has to offer. I have had many mentors at Costco that continue to teach me new things not only about the culture of Costco, but also the culture of the retail market. Management is somewhat poorly trained in my opinion. The hardest part of the job is the retail hours and balancing a social life outside of working every weekend. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay and benefits."
good,"I love working in the Costco Pharmacy because it is much less stressful than when I worked at Walgreens. I love my coworkers and we get along quite well and work together to complete daily tasks. My manager is the best manager one could ask for, as long as you do what is expected of you."
good,"Adopted the skill of assisting with mount/demount of summer and winter tires within weeks time, engaged with Costco members in relation to vehicle/tire questions."
good,Enjoyed working for this  company was a great learning experience and to make it to being a senior and lead employee in my department gave me more confidence to go further up the chain to become a manager.
good,"great job but m managers can be unprofessional, I worked there for 5 years looking to go back. I have been applying for a New York location. it was one of the best jobs I had"
good,"Environnement agréable , motivant et très compétitif"
good,"While not the most flashy job, being a CRM database specialist helped me gain better skills working in a membership database. Plus mornings in the mailroom were always busy so after that, the day slows down, which is good relief after a hectic morning."
good,"Great Job"
good,Fun place to be very busy lots of experience to be had in multiple different areas for a career at Costco. I enjoyed my time there but went to serve in the Coast Guard.
good,"Good pay/benefits, room for advancement, relocation options, fast paced work environment, once in a while you get a nasty customer but thats with any customer service job"
good,Great opportunities and if you are young good to teach you a few things and even open your eyes to management possibilities. Great daily interaction with members.
good,"its a great place to work, with a lot of different jobs that you can be trained in. The only real downside is that you will most likely be hired on as part-time and will have to work your way up."
good,"Very strict and fair and many of the bad batch get a pink slip, so do not fool around working for this company. I have work for this company if it weren't for my son being born, i had to switch job because of the cost of living in the silicon valley is screamingly ridiculous"
good,"Really nice people to work with and a pleasant work atmosphere. Working conditions are fast paced, but manageable and keeps you on your toes. Also safety toe foot wear reimbursement."
good,"Great environment but can tend to get very boring. on the slow days when there are not a lot of people in the store, it got pretty slow and there's not much for employees to do with down time"
good,"They have competitive compensation and once hired there are opportunities for advancement. Seniority is important at costco, which can be a good thing and a bad thing."
good,"Costco is a great company to work for. They take care of their employees and make sure your are ok both in and outside of work. Staff is always great to be around, but don't let the collard shirts and smiles fool you. Every employee is a hard working, sweat busting bunch that goes over and beyond for customer service."
good,Really enjoyed working there. Sadly it was a seasonal position and I was not able to catch on as a full time permanent employee. My only complaint is how hard to set up an interview was as I had to call several times to get a manager.
good,I highly recommend working at Costco meat factory. I was fortunate enough to work with some amazing people. They really make you feel like family and take good care you.
good,"I want to continue with this Company soon after Summer."
good,Costco is a fast pace work environment that teaches you all aspects about the operations of a business. The management structure is a strong teared system with great support. Costco typically has a great team culture with a lot of advancement opportunities.
good,"Costco is a fantastic place to work, it's something new everyday and I always love meeting new people that shop there. Employees are always amazing to work with."
good,"Costco Wholesale is a great place to work. The pay is above average and the benefits are superb. However, the people that shop there act entitled and can be very rude at times. The work environment can be very stressful."
good,"Very occupied company always something to do."
good,When I was taking breaks I had my lunch bag and there was tv sometimes movies were showing but if nothing good on tv I had YouTube on my phone and saw some videos while eating and was always having fun returning to work
good,"Very friendly and working on making  the system better, eg. online chat, very secure. "
good,"Overall Costco has amazing people working there! Most are hard workers who do their job and seem to enjoy themselves. The company itself offers a lot of benefits and really tries to take care of its employees. It is a great place to work.  Not all department managers are the easiest to work with and that can make your day challenging, but the company is set up in a way that encourages you to be able to speak to those who are higher up to ensure you can work efficiently."
good,"Since it was just through the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Everyone wanted to remain on full-time, but only a couple would be chosen. So everyone backstabbed to try to make themselves look better than anyone else. When they should just be focusing on doing their own work well."
good,"·Printing photos, assisting customers with photo kiosk, offering great service to customers by making sure the customer walks away happy and their service"
good,"There's many advantages to working at Costco - free lunches here and there, many training modules to take advantage of, tons of experience to gain from working here."
good,"Es una buena empresa que se preocupa por su gente, no escatima en nada, hay buena relacion de los altos mandos con los subordinados."
good,Its a great place to work and has great career opportunities! They people who work at Costco are like a family. They treat you right and will gladly show you the ropes.
good,"I enjoyed working in all the positions I had working for Costco. I just was disappointed by how the management staff operated. Outside of that my co-workers were fantastic! The benefits were perfect and I really enjoyed my role of jack of all trades at that place. I liked having the reputation of being the fasted and most productive merchandiser there along with operating the forklift. I would definitely work there  again, even if the management was still subpar."
good,"Costco gave me alot of customer experiences and helped me with differents experiences."
good,"I had a good experience and would like the opportunity to work for them again.  I liked the diversity, stability and overall the people, especially the customers."
good,"I really enjoy working at costco,I wish I did not have to relocate,because it was a pleasure serving customers and getting to know them.If it was not the distance were I leave now,I will have love to work at Costco for part_ time."
good,"Lots of jobs within Costco. Great benefits and pay. Managers could use some help, a lot of favoritism along with them but overall the company pays good and has great benefits."
good,"Buena empresa, salario justo y prestaciones buenas. La administración no era satisfactoria."
good,It was a tiring job since you had to jog around a lot. When you are new you would get stuck with closing shifts which weren't always the best. The pay was good but management wasn't that good.
good,"Trabajo constante, aprendizaje en todos los dias; muy buena organización."
good,"Costco is a wonderful place to work. They give you many opportunities to move and advance in the company. Whether you are some one that is just looking for something quickly, and more than likely, end up staying for a while,or someone looking to move up and create a lifelong career, Costco is a great place to work"
good,"I am good and let my grading do my speaking"
good,Costco Wholesale allowed me to develop a passion for helping customers and enjoying my overall work experience by letting myself grow in the workplace.
good,I would recommend this job to anyone trying to earn a salary without a degree. The environment was friendly the hours weren't stressful and the pay was great
good,"They have an open door policy"
good,"Been with the company for 12 years, learn a lot from them. I have no complaints. Friends/coworkers become family type of environment.  The managers are usually understanding and the work around your school schedule which is a plus. Hardest part of the day way getting up in the morning at 4am to go to work."
good,"Excellent place to work as a student."
good,"Seasonal employee for the holiday season. Tasks include cleaning, customer service, cart retrieving, stocking and other general grocery work. Regular employees were temporarily moved into supervisor positions for the holiday season, and were disorganized and not knowledgeable at times, but overall were adequate. It is a company that takes care of employees, but can be competitive at times. Not a lot of freedom to do work, under constant supervision for a specific task, but the position is busy enough to where that doesn't matter. During a busy day, there was illness at work which inhibited an employee from working, but they were told they needed to stay and work."
good,"I enjoyed working for Costco, great benefits and decent hours with a good pay rate for retail. It's often busy and can be stressful at times, but that's retail. Great benefits."
good,"Productive workplace with many opportunities once given the chance to be a regular full time employee.  It was very busy fast - paced, physically demanding.  The part I liked most was dealing with the members and employees."
good,Good benefits and nice place to work. I enjoy this company because of the strong leadership and good business model that it employs. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
good,"Costco was a great place to work, it was very productive awesome coworkers enjoy working with people with positive attitude ... The management was awesome good leader ship."
good,"Great atmosphere to work and great pay.  Great opportunity for young employees to move up, but new employees who are over 50 are not given the opportunity to move up in the company."
good,The bakery department was a great place to work in. The employees were very well knowledgeable. I learned a lot in the little time I worked there. I wasn't experienced in baking at all. They showed how to assemble baking sheets and set oven temperatures. The hardest part of my department was having to have task completed by a certain time. The very most enjoyable part of Costco was the environment.
good,Being an 19 year old when I started it was a great Job. It allowed me to work part time and pay for my education. I also received great health benefits and paid sick/vacation time. You definitely receive benefits at Costco as a part time employee that you will not find at part time jobs for other retail locations. The pay is well and you receive a raise after a certain amount of hours worked. Most employees have been there for many years and love their jobs.
good,"Costco really cares about their employees and it shows.  Great experience.  Hours were great, training was solid,and they genuinely appreciate your work."
good,"Costco is a great company with great benefits. My only criticism is the people who have been there for years are very aware that management cannot do much to them in the disciplinary sense...so they tend to take advantage of this. This self entitlement attitude puts a far more work load on people who are new as well as added stress. and even though mgmnt is aware of this issue, there is nothing done to correct it. But if you can deal with this, i highly recommend working at costco."
good,Costco is a very fast paced environment and involves early morning shifts. What might have been a plan for the beginning of the morning can sometimes change two or maybe three times throughout that morning. This means that you need to be adaptable and have the ability to take these changes in stride.
good,"I enjoyed my time there. A lot of the people I worked with were fresh out of high school which brought on drama here and there. But if you focus on your job, it will be worth it. It's a great company that allows you to work up to different positions. You get to choose a different department to work in once you pass probation."
good,"Great job but very long work hours as a manager and worklife balance was tough for me. Lots of opportunities to advance and move up, requires a lot of hard work and dedication."
good,"I have always liked the structure of Costco because it truly represents a great culture that values its employees. This in turn, helps promote friendly behavior among members and other employees."
good,"nice place to work, enjoyed my time there and would like to be hired on full time,  you work hard but it is worth it good place to work"
good,"This is an easy job for the pay. Management communication could be a little better so that there is not as much stress among the employees. You can meet a lot of cool, hard working individuals. A lot of upper management started as assistants and have little to no schooling. Very hard to get fired, especially after 2 years."
good,"Look, this is by far as good as it gets for retail, and your pay and benefits are hard to match. However, it's still retail, and you don't want to be doing this forever."
good,Work culture is very nice and job security.  Company policy is very good and they give equal respect to contractor also as employee. FTE benefit are very good.
good,"It was extremely fast passed and as a seasonal employee it's extremely competitive and cut-throat, but even non-seasonal employees weren't really secure in their positions until about 2 years. Beyond seasonal even part-time employees get full benefits but some such as vacation are pro-rated based on avg hours worked and the pay is great, at this time starting at 13 per hour for any position and automatic raises based on hours worked. In NE Fl that is extremely good for most people and well above minimum wage. Company policy stated exactly hour many 15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunches you're supposed to receive, but it was typical to miss breaks and only get lunches as you must clock out for lunch. Overall, it's a decent place to work, if you can handle the high-stress fast pace and minimal breaks"
good,"Typical day on carts is never the same. Could be steady one day or hour, and then uncontrollably busy the next. Must always be ready for any situation"
good,"Learned a lot about the company and tons of room for growth. Flexible and department managers are cool."
good,Costco really helped me learn what the competitive job market is. Working for Costco will give you a leg up and will help prepare you for your future careers.
good,"The job was simple tasks, but it was hard work. I worked the front end as a cashiers assistant and also as a night time freezer stocker. It was very busy and I had to work quickly. At night the boxes to stock were heavy. I enjoyed it though."
good,"It was a challenge for me because it was my first job but as soon as I started working there, all the employees there were telling and helping me what to do and they were approachable and greeted me with smiles on their face."
good,good benefits and pay. management are always there to help. lots of opportunities to go up. hard to find a company nowadays that will give you good work atmosphere
good,It is a good environment to work in and working with others is great. The people are nice and they are willing to help you. When I was there is was fun.
good,"Great work environment if you like constantly moving. You worked hard and got paid pretty well for it. If you did work on Sunday you got paid overtime for it, couple managers were not ideal."
good,"It is a good company but it is based on seniority so it would be hard  to move up or get full time there if you just got hired, it only benefits if you would like this job to be your career but if it is just temporary say good-bye to your weekends and your evenings."
good,"I was part of a team that that restocked the store in the morning before the store opened. Very fast paced, but reasonable for the store we worked for. Management is very knowledgeable, patient, but firm. A good place to work."
good,I worked during the holiday season and it was a bit out of control. Management was good and respectful. The hardest part was the sporadic scheduling but I liked working there over all.
good,great place to work. the work culture is great and everyone works together as a team. managers are willing to work with school schedule. very fast paced but overall a nice company to work for.
good,it is a very good company to work for and every day was different. The co workers are very nice and the engagement was nice as well. Everyone their had to go at a fast pace but i was only seasonal at Costco.
good,Loved working there had a lot of options when it came to movement and you learn to work as a team. The benefits are great and so is the pay. Hard work is valued when working at Costco.

good,"This is a hard working, fast paced environment but the medical benefits they give are really awesome. The pay is great for not having an education. Not having weekends off for months at a time unless you request it is a bummer. Vacation is blocked off from Thanksgiving to Christmas, no leaving town for the holidays."
good,I had two jobs started as a Maintenance cleaning building making sure aspects of the building clean. I also worked with security. Than I moved to Accounting position where we scanned for items not paid or invoices than I moved to a Vault Clerk. I like the job again always striving to make sure all was done always completing my tasks in a timely manner.

Very physical - bend, stretch, turn, stand, walk, run.  This is the most difficult part of the job.  Easiest part is being attentive and caring for customers."
good,"Es una gran empresa con un buen sueldo factible a las horas que trabajas, excelente ambiente laboral y muy comprensibles a las necesidades del empleado"
good,"Costco's core culture as a whole is amazing and I recommend it as a place of employment for anyone! Warehouse 638, however, has lost sight of what it means to work at Costco. New management has alienated the employees and members to a degree that is no longer tolerable and is in need of a SERIOUS redirect and reminder of why Costco began in the first place. The spirit of Jim Sinegal has been lost and needs to be found again."
good,Ambiente laboral equilibrado y con ua cultura que promueve valores humanos que pocos empleadores en México hacen. Siempre sales a tu hora

good,"Once clocked in, you check in with the duty manager to find out where you are needed. For the most part, all management is helpful and do their job, but some need to have some training to learn new techniques. After 90 days probation is up, you are able to move around to different departments and cross train in different areas to learn other areas. The hardest part of the job is when you get a rude member, but if they get to be too bad, you can get a manager or supervisor to help with the situation."

I got along with my Supervisor and my co- workers. My supervisor was approachable in dealing with our issues at our department and address our issues immediately.It was my pleasure to work in the meat department.

good,"A typical day working at Costco especially at my location, is very fast-paced and a lot of physical work. I've learned to work well under pressure as well as learning how to work in a very diverse environment. The hardest part of the job would have to be able to deal with large amounts of people.

good,"Excellent company to work for but it was only part-time, I was looking for full-time work. Staff and customers are great. Always clean and tidy. Friendly managers."
good,Great job! Customers sometimes feel entitled here. Management always wants you to stay and do more hours. The co-workers are relaxed usually. Can take a toll after standing on your feet for so many hours. No discounts.
good,"Costco lives up to its reputation as a company that takes care of its employees. They are very flexible when emergency situations occur. They allow for advancement in many departments at all of their locations, so you don't have to worry about relocating because they will most likely have a warehouse close to anywhere you may move. They have great training programs and have great employee benefits."

good,Costco is one of the top companies in the US to work for.  Be prepared for fast-paced action and a higher level of customer appreciation.  The level of professionalism is refreshing but comes at the cost of over politicalization.
good,"If you a hard worker its a great place to work"
good,"ndeed is on the ascendant: lots of growth, lots of cool new projects, tons of interesting work and opportunity."

good,Costco is a great company to work for. There are few companies that can come close to what they have to offer in benefits and job advancement. But if you plan on having a family beware it is very difficult to balance the two if you're in management.

good,"a typical day at work is always busy. "
good,costco is a place for people that want to work retail for a long time. it provides a great environment with customer satisfaction as the number one goal.
good,This was a very fast-paced work environment. You were always moving and you always had a place to be with something to do. The management was very helpful in getting you acquainted with the everyday work that would be taking place but they also gave you the freedom to schedule your workday out once you had a certain level of familiarity with your job. They constantly pushed you to make sure as much product was stocked as possibly but they also knew what was capable of normal human being in one workday.
good,Typically dealt with members assisting their purchases and ensuring they had a great shopping experience to encourage them to return for more purchases.
good,I loved working for Costco Call Center. I was hired on as seasonal help. I was treated the same as everyone else. I would love to work for Costco again.

good,"un dia tipico : buen ambiente con los compañeros"
good,"Students, parents, return to work, retirees, first job, part-time or seasonal work seekers - this can be a great place to start."
good,"A typical day at Costco consists of meetings, conversations with peers about the current projects, current situations with the production processes, and other non-job-related conversations. People like what they do, management is very flexible and accommodating and we are all a very good team, in general."
good,"I worked in the deli at night. The only reason I left was because I worked with raw chickens all day. Even the manager told me it was a gross job. I skewed raw chickens put them in the oven, took them out and put them in packages to sell. I also rotated the chickens that were out of date to sell, we put in the back. it was great management and I loved the place. I just couldn't deal with skewing and dealing with chickens all day, if i would have been offered a different job within the company I would have stayed."
good,"My shifts would mainly consist of the same tasks; whether it would be cashier duties or being the floater (person assigned to help the cashier in taking the customers orders). Cashier duties were pretty basic; cash handling and taking the customers orders correctly. As for a floater, my duties consisted of helping to shorten the wait time of the customers, by taking their orders and preparing/handling their food orders. Of course I became familiar with the food prep equipment and assuring they were being cleaned in the right manner for safety purposes."
good,"Costco Wholesale was a great place to be employed at.  I was employed for 14 years, at 2 different warehouses, under different managers. I worked my tail off, the pay for the work was very good, and the benefits were exceptional!  I loved the CEO at the time, Jim Sinegal, for his vision of not only solid business ethics, but also how he did everything in his power to take care of the employee.  When business owners realize that some of the very people on the bottom of the corporate chain are the reason they are in business, and successful, and they appreciate their efforts, the employee works that much harder at their job."
good,"I learned a culture of the employees depends on the style of its leaders, hard work has the benefits for many doors to open. My co-workers are a select few that depend on me to create a team environment. My day is busy with little downtime, what downtime I have I use to see weak points in our processes."
good,Costco was a great company to work for and was willing to work with my school schedule. A typical day would include the entire team changing into their bibs in the locker room followed by our start of shift stretch. We would then proceed to go the the manager on duty who would assign us a block in which we would be working in.
good,The best of everything! A true pleasure to work for this company. They treat you haw you would like to be treated. The best benefits I have ever had.
good,"Every day at Costco is busy!  Having run the Front End and the Membership Desk, each day brings a new challenge, a new demand, and a new reason to love what we do!"
good,"Pay and structure is similar to the military with promotions based on time of employment, and in the position. Willing to work around schedules for school or military service, and great pay and benefits."
good,great company great bennifits and I love my schedule because it leaves me to do what ever I want for the rest of the day but if your not a hard worker Costco is not the job for you
good,"Used customer experience knowledge to expand customer relationships through consultative sales."
good,"This job starts at 4 a.m. and begins with stocking of products all over the store, as well as cleaning and moving items around to better represent the store. I learned how to work independently and at a fast pace in order to have all the necessities done before the store opened every day. "
good,"Working for Costco was very beneficial. On a day to day basis workers there all strive to provide more than customer service, they provide member service! Meaning since people pay to have a membership there, they deserve twice the amount of care."
good,"TYpical day at work is very fast paced and very fun, the people who work their are super friendly fun people and the customers are great also."
good,"best job I ever had by far, loved this job want to be hired again,people were great to work for and with,managment were very through and efficent"
good,Typical day at work is interacting with the members. what I learned from there was to be on time to work and be nice to the members. The co-workers are fun people to be around and very productive. The hardest thing about the job is being outside in the sun when pushing carts. The most enjoyable part of the job is lunch breaks.
good,"I would arrive at work at 5 am, my manager would give me a plan I would stock all items in my given section and insert new items as they arrived using a pallet jack. Once the store opened I would either stay on the floor building displays for new items, or if a truck was late I would stock once it arrived. Otherwise I would pack groceries into carts, or sometimes push carts in the lot."
good,"A typical day at work was business and fun at the same time.  There was really not a whole lot of stress.  The team was very positive and helpful.  "
good,"I was able to advance quickly in this company because they recognize and reward talent. I have been with Costco for nearly 6 years now and I have enjoyed job security, advancement and the ability to learn through experiences and interactions with employees and members alike every day. The management style is hierarchical, and to move up the chain you must understand and embrace the culture that we strive to preserve. Employee turnover is extremely low and a rarity given this is essentially retail. The most difficult aspect of the job is getting around to other departments when you are hungry to learn so much at once. As a near 6 year employee I find myself learning new things each day and will continue through my progression with this company, and I enjoy that. The most enjoyable part of the job is the experience you gain through a wide a wide variety of outlets. You are exposed to the ""corporate"" side (budgeting, strategy analysis) as well as the day to day operations (employee staffing, inventory). I am a trained professional in that I have a bachelors degree and a minor however, I know my training with this firm coupled with my strong business background has made me a force to be reckoned with in the business community."
good,"Typical day consisted of:"
good,"Un día tipico era la atencion a cliente y revisión del material en orden en el piso de venta, capacitar a nuevos jovenes que se incorporan al ambito laboral en el aréa."

good,"- Job requires organization and attention to detail"
good,"As I was only there for the Christmas period I did enjoy my time there, I just wish I got took on."
good,Assisting with cashiers with customer purchases. Bring carts up front for customer use. Maintain a courteous customer service environment. My management and co-workers work well together to meet the needs of the business. The hardest part of my job is being unable to meet the needs of our customers. I enjoy getting to interact with a variety of people every day and hearing their different stories.
good,"I was not a fit for the company but i really enjoyed working there. Daily work was mainly cashiering would have liked to learn everything in a shorter amount of time so i  could be more useful to co-workers. most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the co-workers,"
good,"Costco was a great company all around. it gave me an opportunity to grow very fast. I was motivated to learn every department in the building because I was never to bored or ignorant to try something new. Challenging new things was my competition and I was great at it. With the assistance of management and the support of a great staff, I became Supervisor with in two years. I had over twenty-five employees to look over which kept me busy at all times and about 3 departments to look after. My experience with Costco definitely taught me a lot."
good,"Fast pace environment, fun and friendly co-workers. I stock shelves, help customers with finding a product. This position is seasonal and ends on January 20 2013. I like shopping here and customers and staff are friendly. I wish the job was a permanent position."
good,Customer Service Demonstration prepare samples for customer. Customer can sample a product before purchase. It's a great job to increase customer service skills.
good,"A typical day at work consist of entering the vault, alarm the vault, count the safe deposit, register fund and make sure the totals add up and balance to the daily total fund. I am in charge of processing all of the money, checks and rebate check drops sent from the various departments in the warehouse. I issue money increases and money change to all departments in addition to answer phone calls. At the end of the day I ensure that all the money, checks, rebates, jewelry and other valuables stored in the vault are accounted for and safely lucked up. I have constant interaction with management and supervisors since they are the only staff allowed to approach and enter the vault to acquire change, loans, credit cards, etc. Our team work oriented culture makes the environment a place where people can count on each other for help and support. When someone is in need of help, people compromise to help; we often have pot luck fundraisers for families at work going through harsh times such as family loss, cancer etc.The most enjoyable part of my job is to help customers make their experience at Costco a great experience because I always get a great satisfaction knowing that I tried my best to help someone. I enjoy being a team player because it makes the environment more enjoyable and productive for everyone."
good,"Costco is the ideal wholesale company to work for.  Employees are treated well, and management makes great efforts to help find balance.  "

good,"En general la estructura de la empresa facilita mucho el trabajo. La mayor experiencia que me dejo Costco fue que aprendi a negociar con proveedores de talla Internacional y a comprar y manejar inventarios con grandes voluumenes."
good,"Provided customer service, loaded carts and assisted in lifting heavy items to customer vehicles. This role enhanced my public relations, problem solving and customer service skills."
good,The hardest part of the job is the flexible schedule and the retail hours which require many nights and weekends.
good,"Costco is a great company to work for. I was hired as per diem, hoping to move up to part-time as soon as the position is posted."
good,typical day I would arrive and load/unload customers carts/cars until close when I would then stock. I worked seasonal so I was let go after the holidays.
good,"stock freezer cooler and deli area,stock produce"
good,"I first started at Costco when I was 17 and really had no idea what I was in for. They hired me as a seasonal, part-time cart pusher who was probably undersized for the job. Since then I've been promoted twice to separate positions and am currently in electronic sales, which is exactly where I wanted to be. Over my time there, there has been some minor issues with management being overbearing, but overall I have no major complaints. One of the things I enjoy about working in electronics was that, relative to other electronic retailers, we were always rather unbiased with no agenda. A typical day is relaxed and relatively stress-free. For a retailer, I can't imagine a better company to work for."
good,"Costco Wholesale at Foster City is a great place to work if you enjoy fun coworkers, helping others, teamwork, job security, and the option of working in different departments. The coworkers at Costco are very enjoyable because they are very easy going people who are easy to talk to and they still work hard. At Costco, you help others everyday by asking customers what their needs are and you, the worker, fulfilling them. Job security is very good after your first 90 days. For your first 90 days you must show that you will be a beneficial cog in the machine that is Costco. After those first 90 days, you just need to be a competent employee because turnover is very rare. Teamwork is necessary because you must always have communication with your coworkers and supervisors in order for a job to get done efficiently. Diversity of tasks can change if you want a change of scenery in Costco. There are many different departments inside Costco so if you want a change of scenery it is easy to do. The hardest part of the job is the long hours you will receive over the weekend and the fact that days can seem long because of the tasks being tedious. The other part of the job that can be disliked is the fact that when you are given tasks, there is no free thinking or problem solving. There is just one way to do it and you must do it that way. Overall Costco is a good place to work because everyone, from managers to coworkers, treat you well and Costco pays you well for your efforts."
good,It was a good learning experience to work at Cost-Co. I still stay in contact with the management of Cost-Co.
good,"Withing the company i learned many things, many different positions. A typical day at work would always be productive,you'll always learn something new. As a floor assistant every section was your section. whether you knew it or was new at it. Management crew were very professional. Always very punctual the way they ran the warehouse, And i worked with great individuals as co-workers,supportive,nice and very helpful. Best part of the job was customer service and meeting new members/new people/new faces. The interaction."
good,I have worked at Costco for almost 4 years now and i have never worked for a better company in my life. They take great care of thier employees.
good,It was a great job to have doing seasonal. Customer was friendly and nice.
good,Receiving all freight with in the warehouse as soon as you enter. Counting and labeling all products. Clamping products to size onto palets. Sending products to destinated location within the warehouse. Shipped to assigned truck. Friendly helping co-workers. Hardest part of job was picking certain items. Most enjoyable part was working along with everyone.
good,"i got employe of the month during the time that i was working for the company...i learn how wrap products and diferent metods of cakes decorations. I recibe a lot congrats from my managers, crew employes and other stores manager, the hardest part of my job is my lenguage, but i love to learn and try my best."

good,"The store felt like a giant family, even for temporary workers."
good,fun environment to work in . room to step up the latter > great pay > good people< room for adancment quickly
good,"I am proud to say I work for Costco, a fortune 500 company. Throughout my tenure at Costco I have built strong relationships with the members, learned how to work quickly and efficiently, and how to make the member happy. I strive to have a smile on my face and treat others how I want to be treated."
good,Costco gave me alot of customer service experience. Throughout my shift I was constantly approached with customer concerns. I was taught to memorize the stores layout and that was the hardest part of the job. I really enjoyed working with the customers and saying things that left them with a smile.
good,"Great company who takes care of its employees. Awsome benefits package medical, dental insurance vacation 401k."
good,i was demonstrated products to customers and assisted them to locate items. i learn maintained customer relations due to providing superior service.
good,Probably the highest paid retail job on the market. It's a fast paced retail job. Most of the people are fun to work with.
good,"Great face paced work. Learned alot about sales and marketing and how the company was ran. Management was friendly and strict at the same time. Co-workers worked hard and the jobs got done. No hard part about the job except a heavy load of members with many questions at one time and no hold button. Very enjoyable store to work for on a Monday, but really bad on Sunday."
good,"loved going to work every day, you get to learn alot of new things."
good,"Great company to work for, very fast paced, customer focused. Customer satisfaction is number one."
good,Is my home away from my home . I love what I do and I enjoy working with my Costco family everyday is a learning day and working with Costco gave me back time to spend with my family on Thanksgiving and Christmas 🎄 day off work;  that I cherish along with my husband and my son. Very great full and recommend to anyone looking for a good job
good,"Working at Costco requires high energy, meeting customer needs first, focus on what is required, having strong visual-spatial abilities and being a team player."
good,"Working for Costco Wholesale was a great experience; however, you learn on the job so there is not much training. Employee diversity. Benefits were outstanding. Sunday's are time-and-a-half so that was always a plus. The most difficult part of the job was complying with work requirement because different managers or supervisors would have different expectation as far as work performance."
good,"I love being with people helping them to make there shopping experience a good one do they would continue to bring their business to our store and not the other across town , and building relationships within the store to have a strong store family"
good,"Excellent pay"
good,"Seasonal employees are treated just as well as regular employees while we're there. Plenty of encouragement from management, and everyone is friendly and helpful. Will definitely return next holiday season."
good,De los mejores trabajos en cuestión de salario y tiempo
good,For the time I worked as a equipment operator in meat department location #285 sumner I enjoyed the fast pace work environment. As a part time employee there was always overtime opportunity. So most the time I would get close to the same hours as a full-timer.
good,A nice place to work with good people.  Very good hours to work and the environment is safe and productive.   managers seemed to care about their people and help them as needed.  It was a Clean place to work and training was provided.   Worker safety important.
good,"I loved working at costco, because I met wonderful workers as well as experience the joy of providing our customers with excellent customer service. In costco you will always feel safe so it is a perfect work environment."
good,"I previously worked at Costco and would work there again. Great benefits, hours, and steadiness. Promote a healthy work environment and really feel they care about you. I had a surgery that created complications so I was in the hospital for a week, Costco family sent me flowers and a card and it touched me, meant a lot."
good,"One on one customer service really helps you grow more socially. "
good,The only thing about working there is that if you land a seasonal job whether it be your first year there are your second year there there's no guarantee of a permanent position.
good,I'm happy and respected at Costco. I have employers who care about my well being and the benefits program is an added bonus. I have gained a lot of different skills and abilities while working here that makes me applicable for other opportunities. I am currently looking for more hours though as I am only part time with them and it is difficult to obtain full time.
good,"Arrive at work, review notes for any moves or new items for the day, grab necessary items to complete my work for the day."
good,"You will come into work and hit the ground running.  Costco is all about member service, and making the experience great.  You will be expected to work hard, fast and be neat and organized.  I n return, they will give you every opportunity to move up and succeed."
good,Great benefits and pay but needs more opportunities for advancement. Sometimes can take years to move up without transferring warehouses. Seniority is many times chosen over experience and skill level.
good,"Happy working with all the co- worker, fun and enjoyed the time at work also i love my customers."
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, se refuerza el compañerismo y respeto entre los colaboradores."
good,"Costco was a very fun place to work. When working in the area I applied for, I had a blast. Being called to work on the front end could prove to be somewhat frustrating, only because I enjoyed working in the Tire Center so much. The management was excellent and the culture was ideal."
good,awesome place to work for  and great people to work with.Had good time learning new things from such an experienced and passionate staff.Happy and fun work environment.
good,Awesome place to work with people who care about you! Supportive of your goals. They give you feedback on how you work and ways to improve yourself. Definitely recommend
good,"Great company to work for enjoyed being apart of the Costco family and meeting different customers, learn a lot working in didferent departments. Enjoyed helping members as well in talking with them to encourage them to co e back"
good,El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno con los compañeros a veces un poco estresante por tantos socios pero un muy buen lugar para trabajar.
good,"Costco Wholesale is a great company, with a competitive selection process. The company prides itself on top customer service, and ensuring that every member is satisfied."
good,"It was fun pay is good employees are great"
good,"Great Managers that cares about employees. Outstanding benefits even for part-timers. The work was fast paste, but I loved it. Co-worker was always will to help when needed. Excellent upper management that really cares."
good,Overall great place to work the managers are great.My coworkers were amazing and i enjoyed my time at costco.Pay increase is based on hours. Only bad is u start at parttime and its hard to get a full time position.
good,"Costco is a great place to work, great benefits, great pay. Which is why everyone who works there works there forever. The only problem is with dealing with rude customers and bipolar coworkers."
good,Great place to work for. Starting pay is more than the average retail-employee pay. Benefits are a plus. A great deal of opportunity in different departments that require minimal requirements.
good,"Costco is a good compony to work for! Coworkers are nice and supportive of each other, managers are always there to make sure the production goes well and dont hasitate to help out when it's needed."
good,Great place to work for. Accommodating. I have nothing bad to say of where I currently work. I don't believe in bad mouthing any place. Every job has it's pros and cons. It's all what we decide to do with those.
good,"I love to work for a Company like Costco. It's  a fast paced work environment; but believe me, you are gonna love this place. There are a lot of people from different cultures, it's nice to know them. Really. Also, Costco Wholesale pays very well. "
good,"Haven't been there for many years, but overall a very good company to work for.  You have a job for life if you work hard and lots of room for advancement.  Even thought it doesn't always happen, they try very had to be fair."
good,I love the environment and how productive it is along with a fun staff and friendly customers. i learned that you have to be fast and able to keep up with the spend during transactions.
good,"Costco was a great place to work , we had  a great manager that cared about the employees and the job at hand. I personally  was surrounded by a group of employees that really cared how the warehouse and people were running it . I enjoyed the honesty and professional way everything was handled. Wish i was employed."
good,Amazing company to work for. Amazing management all around. Great benefits. Employees/Coworkers all loved working at Costco. The managers/supervisors is what made working there enjoyable. They took care of their employees and knew how to be friendly. They take the work seriously but it did not mean they were breathing down your neck. Everyone respected each other.
good,"I love working with the public. Each day is something different and new. You are always meeting new people, so the conversations are always fresh. I also love sharing to families about my products."
good,"The day is never the same, and the time goes quickly with the fast paced environment. Great possibilities to move up, or change departments. Most employees are friendly and easy to work with."
good,awesome place to work! Awesome staff and management.  one big family. management is very understanding when it comes to calling in or requesting time off.
good,"Costco is great, but because of how fast paced it is, your learning curve is difficult. If you can't keep up with a super fast work environment, then don't apply."
good,"Overall it's a great place to work. The pay is among the greatest in the industry with great benefits. "
good,"Outstanding company. Great benefits, health coverage, 401k....  the list goes on and on. I would love to have an opportunity to work for this company again. I retired early."
good,"Working seasonally at Costco was a wonderful experience, the company truly values their employees, and when seasonal emplayment became available the year after, they contacted me to see if I would like to return!"
good,"Busy, fast-paced environment.  Ability to advance is available if you want it.  Have to have flexibility with your schedule.  Retail world calls for working nights and weekends."
good,"I loved working at Costco. It is a great company to work for with great benefits. My co-workers were great people, and yes that includes management. Even better that the co-workers, were the members that you get to know and connect with on a daily basis."
good,"I loved working here. Flexible schedule, great pay and bonuses. Very helpful manager and coworkers. If I ever get a chance to go back to work there I would."
good,Costco believes in promoting from within. They do require new employees to start at the bottom and work your way up. This usually doesn't take long if you know and understand what you're doing. They require an open schedule and you will be required to work nights and weekends. They do have great benefits and overall a great company to work for!
good,Working at Costco for seven years has been a fantastic experience.  The staff and team there have really become like family and my particular warehouse was very conscientious of working with the employees to help them with goals in the workplace and out.  The wages are competitive and it's a safe environment.  I would definitely encourage people to work there.
good,"This job was very fun, the benefits are insane, and the pay is nice. Not a hard job at all, the only reason i quit was because supervisor, and some of the managers were not very nice or fun to work around, wish it had not been that way because i loved the job."
good,"I enjoyed my job to the most of its possibilities and worked very hard everyday. The staff were amazing and so helpful and manager's actually cared. I was very young when I was employedoing here and as a result of that, I was treated like a child and bullied by coworkers which lead to my slowly yet quick release of responsibilities at Costco in which I regret with a passion  "
good,Working at Costco made me feel like my efforts were finally being recognized and compensated for appropriately. Management is very kind and understanding as well and the work schedule allows you more time at home.
good,"manejo de montacargas, cursos, capacitacion y buen ambiente de trabajo con los compañeros"
good,Good career move. Benefits and great pay. I'm not exactly sure what more to write. Steady hours but flexible.  Recommended to and for working aged individuals.
good,Pay is decent and raises are based off hours worked. Benefits are great. Many coworkers say that working for costco gets you trapped working there after some time because stepping down for lower pay elsewhere is not ideal. Costco takes care of their employees.
good,"Costco is a wonderful company to work for. The fleet is mostly newer Volvo’s and they are maintained very well."
good,"Very good job for people who love a fast paced workplace and can handle well under pressure, I learned how to keep calm when dealing with frustrated costumers. Management was great, workplace can be like a family culture, hardest part of the job is stressful situations, the most enjoyable is the satisfaction of getting a good job done."
good,"When I worked at Costco, it was not uncommon to see fellow employees that had worked there for decades. I knew one cashier who was a 15 year veteran making over $60k a year. As a cashier. "
good,Good place to work. Good benefits and pay. 401k I am not going into anymore detail. dog boy girl no yes hi low go come sit stay like join sew plant rain snow
good,"Fast paced environment. Most of the positions in the warehouse are hard physical work. You are just a cog in a wheel and sometimes you feel like a number, but if you work hard you will stand out and Costco promotes from within."
good,There’s a lot of opportunities to move up in the company if you decide to stay. They give you great benefits help you achieve your academic dreams with the schedule
good,"It's retail. You come in, do your job, and punch out. The problem is management bends over backwards for their members to the point of insanity. Refunds for month old veggies, a rug soaked by a burst pipe in your basement, plants from years ago. They claim only the member can shop, tell their cashiers to enforce it, then let the customer break the rules anyway. My manager kept an employee that lied constantly to get people in trouble, but fired another over an honest mistake. There was no consistency. Costco takes care if its employees, but if management is rotten it's hard to stay."
good,Would definitely work at Costco again if given the opportunity. I was there 8 1/2 years and was able to meet all sorts of people and created good friendships.
good,"Fast paced environment, very long work days. Very hard and busy during the seasonal period. Great pay and benefits. On a typically slow day, you can keep yourself busy by cleaning or restocking if you are a cashier or assistant. If you are in clothing, you are to fold clothes quickly and neatly- staying at a table for no longer than 15 minutes. Domestics- you have to block down aisles and clean/ organize/ fold the merchandise. It is recommended to stretch because being on your feet can be very tiring for your legs."
good,Just be prepared everyday. Manual labor because you are lifting. Not for everybody. I happen to love what I do why I been doing it so long. Plenty opportunity to get annual raises and chance for advancement.
good,"c'est très difficile d'avoir seulement une journée de conger. L'employer doit travailler tout les jeudi, vendredi, samedi, dimanche sans exception"
good,"Hands down the best place i've ever worked. Great people, very respectable management and great benefits. I did stock, so the lifting and pulling were a bit hard/heavy, but it kept me on my toes, plus i got stronger lol! Its hard to get in, but it is worth it!"
good,Best job security and benefits of any job with little experience needed.  Family oriented.  If you stay with the company for over a year you will 100% get a raise at some point.  Paid time off even for part time employees
good,"Honestly miss working with this company, had to move halfway across the country so I couldn't stay but they do have transfer options, unfortunately mine was denied. Overall a great place to work. Great benefits and people, probably due to being paid fairly. Hope my next job is at least half as good."
good,"Learned great member service, staff and management are amazing."
good,"Overall, this is a great job for anyone looking to make a decent amount of money. Also there is no need for higher education as to why you see a lot of employees sticking around for a long time. My only complaint is that there is lack of advancement in higher positions and the competition between employees is high. Personally, i had other plans of going to college but not a bad job in the meantime!"
good,"Most customers do not see the behind the scenes production at Costco. I remember how surprised I was to learn all it took to run a warehouse that size let alone the marketing and corporate programs outside the warehouse. "
good,"Working for Costco was great, I had to quit due to being a new mother and my boy's got really sick. So I had to do what was best for my family I do miss it but could not due it today my back is so bad."
good,"If you don't know by now, Costco is a very fast paced work environment and mostly everyone has a membership or knows someone with one. Just like any retail job, members can be VERY demanding and entitled. Most especially when they are required to pay an annual membership fee. I've worked in 3 different stores in my 12 years. I'd say my best experience would have to be when I worked for Costco in Jacksonville, FL. Members and staff are much more friendlier in the East Coast. Where as in Northern California, especially in the Bay Area, where members seem to be rude and demanding as I last stated. "
good,Costco is a great company to work for. They try to go above and beyond for their employees. Starting pay is higher than most jobs. A lot of the employees are fun to work with. I would definitely suggest working at Costco to everyone.
good,"Great Company to work for. "
good,"The new minimum pay for an employee at Costco is $15/hr, and there are many opportunities to advance your position and/or paycheck in any warehouse. They treat their workers well with great benefits, 401K plan, and a free executive membership, and in return, Costco's turnover rate is one of the lowest in the country."
good,"Overall, Costco is a great place to work.  Sometimes there will be a manager that makes your life a bit miserable, but as long as you do what is expected and you’re flexible you will have a great career with Costco."
good,"Very good management and team atmosphere when working with Costco Wholesale, enjoyed my time spent working there a lot. Flexible schedule and good benefits"
good,week days don't seem bad and then Saturday and Sunday hit. Weekends are extremely packed. I had an amazing time meeting all of my co-workers as well as most of the management except a select few simply because of previous conflict.
good,Costco really is the best job you can have in retail. They start you off with good pay and give you lots of incentive to stay with there company. They offered great benefits and was a fun place to work.
good,"The 12 years I worked there, I can only say they helped me a lot in life and has been the best company I have worked for or heard of so far. The follow rules and the law very closely.  You will always get your breaks, and be asked to work overtime."
good,Costco wholesale is an amazing place to work at. however management is not understanding at all. continuously tells students to put school first but they are never considerate of your school schedule
good,"son accesibles en muchos aspectos por ejemplo en horarios, si tienes una emergencia"
good,It was a good job they believe in living wage and also pay time a half on sundays.  It was a competitive job to get there were many people applying and they expect you to work hard to keep it.
good,Costco is a fast paced environment where your day goes by quickly. There are lots of different jobs to learn and excel at. Employees are friendly and there are lots of long term employees.
good,"Love the company and what they stand for. Typical day was always cutting meat. It was a great skill I learned. Management was fair and easy to work next to. Hardest part of the day was the cleaning since you have to be so thorough, but its part of the job. Most enjoyable part was my co-workers."
good,Costco is an amazing company in the retail sector. They pay and treat their employees right which in turn makes the employee want to work hard and do a great job.
good,I had always wanted to work here. I hear the benefits are great and that you can definitely move up if you work hard. Its true! Good place to make a career of and retire from.
good,"Costco was an amazing business to work with, the staff and atmosphere were conducive to a productive work force. Costco provided many little perks to their employees."
good,"I still wish that I remained at Costco. I worked there for 8 years then  took a job with a larger corporation because I thought it was a better career move.  I still wish at times that I stayed.  I spent 16 years the next company and loathed it after 7 or so years due to the fear of being laid off, or being replaced.  I developed work OCD and worked any and every shift to maintain my great track record.  Even with that after 16 yrs I was fired right before I did early retirement.  As of 03/2019 over 80 employees are out of work in one department and well over 4,000. employees throughout are out of work.  All this is to say that Costco has low turn over rate and after 30 yrs you can still find some of the original team still working and thriving."
good,"One of my first Warehouse jobs. I powerwashed and quality control. Distribution, power jack, and filling orders. It was a hard working job but I found it to be very interesting."
good,"Management was wonderful, part time workers get a minimum of 24 hours a week with benefits. Work environment is stressful, yet worth the pay. Highly recommended."
good,"Management plays favorites, but the benefits and pay cannot be beaten for a retail job."
good,"For a part time job this is fantastic. Keeps you busy, and your expected to work hard. Managers are kind, but will expect you to put in effort. Benifits are fantastic. Management is good at working around your schedule."
good,"It was a great job. very fast paced and nice and busy. Not much down time which was nice. Management was nice and helpful when you needed it, hardest part of the job was bring in carts from parking lot."
good,"They are great about working with school schedules, and try to be fair with time off. Mostly everyone there is happy to be working at Costco and plan on staying there for a long time."
good,"Overall Costco is a fantastic place for a college student to start out working. Costco pays good and has great benefits, I graduated recently and am excited to put what I have learned to use at a new job and be able to have weekends off and move further up in a company."
good,"I was hired for seasonal and honestly loved the bakery. Fast paced made the days go by quickly, and physical activity built up endurance"
good,fast paced work environment with a chance to learn a large amount of new skills. Great diversity among employees and the benefits attracts many people along with the higher starting wage.
good,"My seasonal job only lasted a couple of weeks, but I would gladly have worked for them for the rest of my career.  They openly offer benefits and stock options to all of their employees, and make the general atmosphere friendly and inviting."
good,"I was only a seasonal employee. Pay aside, they have amazing benefit including, but not limited to: Health, Vision, Stock Options, and more. If I could stay I would, however, with such a low turnover rate, I was not able to be kept on at the moment. Don't get me wrong, you will do some work. In Major Sales, I worked mostly with major appliances, TVs, computers, jewelry, and other electronics. I also helped in various other task such as loading furniture for members, helping members find items not in my department, help a cashier during busy hours, tidy up aisles that is outside my department and more. On an average day I ended up walking around 8 miles, but it varies from around 6-12 depending on the day. Management seemed indecisive at times which can cause for confusion down the ladder, but overall nice people to work with. In fact, all of my coworkers that I had a chance to talk to where nice and seemed to really like their job. Overall, I would recommend at least going in seasonally to see what it is like working there, as it has change my look on what a job means. I enjoyed working there and will hope to get rehired down the line."
good,Promotions and opportunities are there if you work hard and apply for them.  Take advantage of different departments so you can learn new skills.  There are transfer opportunities if you relocate or need to move.
good,"A very busy and upbeat workplace. A typical day would be checking for anything that requires immediate attention. I have learned to multi task, and handle extreme stressful stituations."
good,"You getting paid $13 a hour just to push baskets, that a good enough reason to work for Costco most jobs in Houston have you working to death for just 10-11 a hour. The culture here is good and enjoyable and all the workers seem to love there job make the vibe and energy here good."
good,Truly loved working here. Such a great company no matter what stage of life you are in! Offers lots of support and health benefits. There are many opportunities to move up or around the store as well.
good,"The days starts off with checking previous days sales, hour usage, hour dollars used, D&D and comparing to plan.  I have learned how to manage a small business within a business.  Management is professional and have many years of expeirence.  The culture at Costco is outstanding and has great integrity.  The hardest part of the job is being used a laborer but being able to manage the business.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the finished product and taking care of our customers."
good,The work environment was very fast paced but everyone was willing to help and share their knowledge to help everyone grow. It was also a great way to use communication skills and learn to be an active member of a team.
good,Great workplace culture and life balance. Would retain more employees by raising salaries. Great opportunities to change departments and learn other technologies. Costco takes care of its own. Great Corporate Culture; the members and the employees are always first.
good,"Costco has a professional environment and dedicated to making customers happy. They focus on the employees with great pay, benefits, and flexibility. Over all I would reccomend to anyone looking for a wonderful stable job with opportunity to advance."
good,"I enjoyed working for Costco. 10/10 Would Highly Recommend. It was a friendly and productive work environment. My department grew close, we were like a family at one point."
good,"A typical day at Costco is pretty straight forward. The manager would usually prepare a rough idea of what needs to be completed for that day and the staff would work off of that. "
good,Costco is a good company to work in. I have work in every department. The benefits is great and the pay is fair. There's a lot of opportunities. And management is great
good,The best company to work for in my work experience management was the only downfall. Not allowing advancement because of dependable work ethic. I was told several times that the quality of work would take a hit if I was moved to another job title.
good,"I loved working there! people were inviting, kind, and hard-working. Everyone pushed you to be better than yourself and I only wish there were job positions once my seasonal was up."
good,Good atmosphere most of the time. Fast paced and ability to learn how to cooperate with one another. The hardest part of the job was being able to transfer to other areas due to elections based on seniority. Being i had less seniority than most that applied for different positions i was denied time and time again. overall managed pretty well. The best part i enjoyed most was working out of the ware house and in a area with just the Food Court coworkers. I felt like i was able to enjoy the fresh are per say more than most that worked at Costco.
good,"Loved every minute working there, and regret ever leaving and going to Target. Miss working with a great group of people. Advancement was slow though, that's what prompted me to leave."
good,"Costco was a great place to work. There were many challenges as well as opportunities for employees to get a chance to exceed their skills as employees."
good,"it was a great experience working for costco, there is always something new to learn and always opportunities to grow in you career its a fast place environment yo, managers are very helpful and some customers too."
good,"Fun and exciting place to work and see and meet different customers everyday, does get stressful and face paced at times but that makes the time there go by fast. Knowing electric pallet jacks is a plus and a good memory or where everything is at and the deals going on."
good,"fun "
good,Loved the job and it was fast paced and fun to work with others. Management seemed nice and fair and it made the environment even better.  You always had to make sure that you did your part as well
good,i enjoyed working at costco mainly because everyone was nice and helpful (coworker wise) I learned a lot a would have loved to try to work another department but i was only seasonally helping.
good,Great place to work for any age. Costco takes care of there employees very well. The job culture is very fast an upbeat and the hours our consistent and flexible.
good,"Working at Costco Wholesale I learned to be fast-paced, communicative in a stressful environment, and eager to help my members and my coworkers. A kind manner is rewarding and goes a really long way. If give my all to my members, Costco gives their all to me. A wonderful company."
good,"Costco knows how to keep their employees happy. There's no typical day at work because every day is different depending on how many members come in to buy. Management differs for every Costco, that's some might be better than others. Otherwise, a great place to work."
good,"Costco is honestly the best retail company in the world u could work for. They take very good care of their employees and members. The pay is great, benefits are great and they have alot of good programs for their employees to register for that can get them huge deals on cars, trips, and a host of other things. I wish I could change some of the things I did while at Costco. I'm wiser now and I've learned from my mistakes. And I have paid for my mistakes."
good,"Great company to work for with great benefits for even part timers. However, many stores are unionized and require seniority to work the ranks. So if you can hang in there you'll make it to the top, but as far as quick promotions go, its not going to happen."
good,Its a good job to work for. Good benefits. Management needs to give employees better respect. This job is good if your working fulltime. They have a good stock program.
good,"Always try to get scheduled on Sundays, its time and a half, always. Breaks are always on time, but you have to keep track of your own breaks to make sure you get them in time."
good,"I loved my experience with Costco. Its one of the best companies to work for. My coworkers are great but as far as management, they get a thumbs down."
good,"Great coworkers and partners.  Also great customers. Work place culture fast pace and fun.  Hardest part of job not enough work at current position.  I also worked customer service, Cashier, promoting American express cards."
good,Prepare to put in your all every day. Worth it. Management treat team with respect and dignity. The benefits and wages are above industry averages and Costco expects dedicated and hard-working employees.
good,"Costco is very serious about taking care of its membership and its employees. Their benefits are great, and the atmosphere is intense and completely focused on the membership."
good,"It is an amazing job, great pay, and great employees as well as members. With this job you always knew you would have a job. Pay raises happen quiet often based on hours that you have worked. I’d recommend this job to anyone."
good,Really easy going had lots of fun with working there. Plently of room for advancement good pay and a great benefits package. Would recommend working here to anyone
good,Buena empresa se preocupa por el bien del trabajador.
good,great place to work. everyone got along and wanted to make the workplace better for everyone else. many opportunities to advance yourself. excellent leadership and guidance.
good,"There is always new shipments/orders coming in or being sent out, always something to do. Management is very friendly and the coworkers are very helpful. Lots of moving parts and coordination happening at once."
good,"the work was pretty easy. I set up demonstration table and go to my designated area and offer samples to customers throughout the store, I learned a lot about the products I demonstrated and how to promote sales for those products. The management team was very well trained and knowledgeable about the company and very helpful with any tasks that we may have needed help with. The job itself was pretty laid back and I didn't really have any complaints."
good,It is a good company to work for with the pay tap out you can receive an all-around benefits they will definitely overwork you if they are understaffed Costco likes to hire from within so it is hard to get a job in there and if you get hired as seasonal along with the other 40 people most likely they’re only going to pick three of youI was with the company for three years and I opened up a new store location when it was time to relocate to another state there was nothing available
good,Thoroughly enjoyable with a good bunch of team members and work environment. Very flexible hours and satisfying work. The lovely team members made it very easy to settle in.
good,"I loved working at costco personally"
good,"Costco is a good place to work, good environment, great benefits. The hours to work are very flexible for students and peoples who wants to have time for other things"
good,"I was very happy working at Costco. Plenty of room for advancement and great overall environment with many employee perks."
good,"Great place to work, good co workers, managers who actually care about you. Amazing benefits after 90 days. Extremely fast paced, dealing with the members can be stressful especially on weekends. It's overwhelming at first, but after a couple months you get used to the work pace and multi tasking. Training is a ""throw you into the fire"" type of training. There is no standing around at any time. Even if it's slow you are expected to sweep, clean registers, organize nearby products etc. The mangers and supervisors are ALWAYS watching which really impressed me. They don't miss anything. Not the best place to work if you're looking for a punch in, punch out job. You need to hustle or they will let you go."
good,Plenty of hours and a chance to hire on full time.  Able to experience several departments and get an idea of where in the store you would fit best in a full time position.
good,Gran experiencia laboral. Para ser el primer empleo te llevas un gran aprendizaje
good,Il a beaucoup de pression pour rien et un peu trop de gérent vs le nombre d`employer
good,"This is a work environment where you are surrounded by good people. There is a sense of respect and belief among the people you work with to provide members with the best Costco experience possible. The most enjoyable part is assuring every member receives the product or service that solves their problem, worth their money, and is delivered with amazing customer service."
good,"Costco Wholesale is a very friendly work environment that is fast-paced but very much easy-going with friendly and understanding management.  Day to day operations included aiding members with finding items, handling transactions and providing excellent member services to provide the best experience for everyone at Costco.  The hardest part of Costco is the fast paced environment and standing for long periods of time. The best part of the job is the interactions with members and other employees.  I learned a lot about customer service skills and management of a large facility."
good,Trabajé 5 años en Costco mientras fui estudiante de universidad y nunca tuve un problema en el que mi trabajo interfiriera con mis estudios
good,"Working at Costco was fun and very energtic, It was always fast past even on our slow days. Everyday Costco would be hard working employees pushing carts, talking to the members on the floor looking for items or cashiering. Also Keeping our store clean and professional for our members to enjoy their experience. Having the opportunity to work in different areas of the store, having management help you reach personal goals and help you understand the way Costco works. Hard part of the job was getting everything ready before we opened our store. Having to clean the store and stock all our product to make sure our members can find what they need. I loved the job due to the fact I got to interact with members who loved shopping at Costco and learning abotu why they preferred us than other companys."
good,"It was fun working there, the people were great, customer complaints got old after a while.  you will be challenged to prove yourself every now and then, so you have to be ready for that, but for the most part just show up on time and do your job well and it'll be a fun place to work"
good,"i love working here, people are nice and helpful and management works with you when you need help.You have to consistently be helping and looking around to see what needs to be done."
good,Great place to work. Benefits are great and are offered as long as you work 24 hrs per week. First real job taught me a lot about time value and being a professional.
good,I liked working at costco the job was good. i feel the only con of the job is its a very cold environment due to it being the meat warehouse. so i wouldnt recommend working there if you don't like working in the cold or standing in one place for a long period of time.
good,"its an amazing company, i don't want to leave but i need something more stable, and consistent. its managers and supervisors really strive to help you and make you feel comfortable."
good,I had great experiences while working for Costco. Customer service  is second d yo none the managers u understand their job task. And the possibilities for advancement are endless.
good,"I loved working at Costco, such a great experience for me because costco was actually my first job. With great benefits and more for growth. Also a mixed culture of employees and members."
good,"Though I only worked here briefly as a seasonal employee, I would recommend it to anyone with a strong work ethic."
good,Worked at Costco for five years and enjoyed it.  I was a department of one and loved my position.  Management was very good and store hours were short on the weekends.
good,"I love my coworkers, everyone is so nice! Lots of new faces constantly when they hire seasonals so you get to meet a lot of people. Once you get to know them and have fun, every shift is actually enjoyable. Otherwise the job is very repetitive and can become boring very fast. If you want stability and good benefits, definitely recommned working here. Very flexible for students they only give you 15 hours a week distributed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. However sometimes they give little to no hours during the first 2 and sometimes 3 months of the year when business slows down. Lack of communication between managers and supervisors can be annoying and everyone has a diferent answer. When asking for time off, or if you have any questions make sure you ask more than one person to have a better idea. However it's nice that you don't have to respond to only one supervisor/manager, you can pretty much pick and choose once you get to know them. Most of them are really nice anyway. If you work in a department with lots of employees, like the front end, it's easy to switch shifts and get time off. Easy to move within deprtments too, just look for the postings in the lunch room and apply as soon as you see it. Both timeliness and seniority are taken into account. "
good,"Excelente empresa, magnifico ambiente, desarrollan a jovenes y es una gran empresa para hacer carrera"
good,"I loved working with customers, I enjoyed working with a wonderful team. I had to leave because of school but loved going to work. I learned being patient and as helpful with customers as possible. I was generally very great with customers."
good,"During my employment at Costco Wholesale, I found that my coworkers were very dependable and easy to get along with. The management team was always willing and able to assist in tasks that required more than one person. They were also generally friendly, and if one were to put in 110% every day, the individual would be rewarded accordingly. Overall this was quite a lovely work experience, and I honestly would not mind working for this company again in the future."
good,"I personally enjoy working at Costco, as I have found to be very employee-oriented. They work with you as much as they can and you're welcome to voice your concerns. The benefits and discounts that you receive are also impressive, especially compared to other companies. The atmosphere amongst co-workers is also pleasant and even fun. I definitely would recommend it to someone who was seeking a job."
good,It is a very up-beat place too work and mostly all co-workers are really nice to work with. Costco is a vary team dependability environment that rely on each other to make it positive through the day.
good,"I was a part of their college student retention program. I worked around 40 hrs per week on all my school breaks. The work was fast paced, the managers were friendly, and the pay was also good. If you are a full time employee there are definite career paths as well as good benefits."
good,I loved working here. Thought I would work at Costco for the rest of my working career. I was happy to go there every single day. Unfortunately I broke my leg really bad I spent a lot of time out and we parted ways.

good,"Empresa que tiene en cuenta a las personas"
good,A typical day at work was get in the building see where i was stationed to stock for the day and get to what i needed to do. I learned how to be as efficient as possible while also putting out a great quality of work. The managers made things easy and were easy to talk to and ask questions about things. The culture of the place was really eager and get things done. The hardest part of the job was lifting things the rest was easy to handle. The most enjoyable part was the sense of accomplishment that you feel after putting in a days work.
good,"very good place to work at. definitely would recommend to anyone.  great hours to anyone who wants to work there, they are very flexible with time. also very considerate for workers who have school."
good,Très bel environnement de travail. Très bon avantages sociaux. Excellents salaires.
good,"Costco is all about the company culture.  They work to ensure you are not only successful  in your current position, but also want to make sure you are growing and advancing in your career."
good,"Great place to work,  some employees don't realize how good they have it, they tend to whine over very small issues. To many associates take advantage of FMLA."
good,"first off, as my first job, i was paid very well just to push carts, which from the start was a great thing. second the managers were great, fun to work with, strict when they had to be but not rude. really great with customers and they cared about their employees. got the hours i wanted, they worked with school schedule and paid a time and a half on sundays which was awesome. "
good,I love working at Costco! The pay (especially for a college student) is incredible. This company offers a College Student Retention Program (CSRP) which is beneficial for students looking for guaranteed hours on their breaks. I hope to continue working for them after I graduate.
good,Give us your opinion about a typical day at work what you learned management workplace culture the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the
good,It paid well for the amount of work. Nothing was too bad or labor intensive. The employees were all friendly and management was approachable. It was busy only a few hours a day.
good,Overall it was a good experience and work culture. I liked my co-workers and some managers. Its a fun and a competitive environment. I would still be there
good,Managers are very nice people and professional co-workers are like any other work place good people and bad people but overall the company is worth working for because of the opportunities competitive wages and benefits.
good,"A typical day included making deli dishes, and I learned to be fast and neat. Management kept me busy and was reasonable. Workplace culture was somewhat exclusive, but some coworkers were really fun. The hardest part of the job was finishing all cleaning on time at the end of the night. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers."
good,"Management and fellow employees make the time working go much smoother.  The starting wage is fantastic, and employees get a free membership upon hiring."
good,"Pay tops out around $55,000 until you get into management. I would recommend this job for anyone who is has a secondary income. Seniority is king so the longer you have worked there the more you can get away with."
good,"Costco is great place to work and it is very interactive. getting your work done while conversing with the awesome guests. There all members, so you learn them by name basis"
good,"If your work hard and do not suck its a great place to work!!! Bust your butt and kill some boards, pull some carts and help members with a smile is all you need to make it at COSTCO!!"
good,Loved working there. As with any job there are positives and negatives. Scheduling was a little unorganized. People are a pleasure to work with and customers were great as well.
good,Great workplace environment. Friendly managers and supervisors who are always ready to help you learn and excel in your position. A great company to work with.
good,"Al iniciar un día de trabajo es igual al de los demás días, tener todo listo para la apertura de la bodega, aprendiendo también de todo un poco desde atención al socio, hasta la limpieza de tu área de trabajo, con el apoyo desde mi jefe directo hasta del gerente de bodega."
good,"Great employer. No degree necessary, good pay and benefits. Closed on holidays, which is great for being able to hang out with family. Fast paced, always something to do."
good,"it was very fast past and very competitive but very beneficial as far as pay and health benefits. They also have pay time off and stock options also life insurance ,very good place to work."
good,"Operate standing electric forklift to move pallets of merchandise and equipment throughout the warehouse.  Transfer merchandise from receiving are to shelves for storage, or to sales floor.  Communicate with management to determine product placement."
good,"If you're willing to actually work, you're going to like the job. The only people who didn't do well that I saw just didn't want to do anything resembling physical labor."
good,"weather you want to start working here or start a career here... its an amazing place overall... lots and lots of benefits, we get holiday dinners or a food truck every now and then.... its super fast paced its a lot of work... but with the right people on your team it can be super easy and fun! in the long run this is the place you want to retire from! we are that great of a company that it lets about any freaking idiot become manager... and thats why we can end up with  terrible management"
good,I would recommend to a friend. Pay is great as well as the hours. If you are determined there is room for advancement in many departments. This a great job for college students or newly graduated high school students.
good,"A typical day at consist of me helping members/ customers with whatever they need assistance with. Everyday I learn how to deal with different personalities and attitudes at work, whether if its from co workers or customers.  The hardest part of my day is not being able to help my customers get what they came for and the enjoyable part is watching them leave with a smile on their face."
good,excellent place to work. friendly co workers and management staff. good benefits and wages. paid vacation after 1 year. job security. fun place to go too. able to shop
good,"Its a very fun and entertaining workplace. Everyone's polite and speaks to one another. Its a relaxing and drama free working enviornment. I've learned how to make cardboard bales in my time of being there. There is no hard part about the job, but it is very enjoyable and management are very nice and understanding."
good,"Costco has a good work environment and afforded great job security and benefits. As a student, it is a fantastic place to work. I found however that long-term corporate system was not something that I was excited about pursuing."
good,Costco has a wide variety of jobs that offer great benefits and pension over time. Feels like you're part of a big team. Lots of good people to work with.
good,"I work in at the front end and what i do is greet members and put there items back into the cart. I also push carts when needs, stock at night and if they need any help and sometimes help gas. "
good,great company to work for. i really have no complaints about the company. they take care of their employees. they pay them very well but do expect a lot in return.
good,"I just started here, I’m happy so far, love the diversity, our products are amazing, staff very friendly and helpful and you can see the ones who won’t make it far.  You must be willing to be flexible and do different things but that makes the job exciting and days move fast. You can learn a lot but the best is the customers and helping them! 99% are super nice and faithful customers so it’s job security to treat them like they matter. So many different things to still learn!"
good,es una empresa donde todo es posible hasta donde te lo propongas
good,"Costco wholesale is a fast and quick to workplace "
good,"I am part-time so, I only work 25-30 hours a week. I have learned a lot working for this company. Benefits are awesome! Management is pretty great, they work with you. The hardest part of the job for me is the hours. Because I am a mother of 2 and you don't have a set schedule every week (retail hours).Don't get me wrong they are good hours. The member service and people you get to meet and work with are just fun. All and all Costco is a great company to work for."
good,Costco is a big retail store and offers a lot services. I personally liked working in the tire center because I didn't have to interact with people as much. Downside is it's back breaking work. You have to lift 50+ wheels all day. And it's constant lifting and jerking wheels on and off cars.
good,"Great place to start working when you are a college student looking to make some money for books, supplies, etc. The staff is easy to get along with, but I find it hard to grow and make a career out of it. The managers are good people, and they have years of experience working in the warehouse. I love working the morning shifts because I get the rest of the day to myself to go to school, but the early shifts require a fast work ethic because there are multiple tasks that need to be completed before the warehouse opens for business; I would say that setting up my department is the hardest part of my job because I am the only employee in the room for two hours."
good,"A fast pace job. I learned to work as a team with others. Management  "
good,"Realmente una experiencia buena , ya que fui muy valorado."
good,"I start as teller in meat department whit the minimum salary but more time you work  pay keep grown and you get more experience ,place to grown in the retail business as new positions or full time as i end up doing stock and training  to be supervisor night crew ."
good,"In short, Costco Wholesale is the best place to work for someone with backbone and a good work ethic. For those who need a reason to work other than benefits and good pay, go somewhere else. They will swiftly find you are not worth their time or money."
good,Great compensation but you do have to work hard. Advancement is  possible but in not necessarily based on merit or skill but rather you have to associate yourself with the right people.
good,Costco is a very good place to work most of the people there have been unemployed for over 20 years some people 2nd 3rd Generation working there personally I'm not a retail type of person but for somebody looking for that type of work excellent place
good,"Fun place to work, great benefits. Treat employees very well. Very good at training employees to the standards that they would like. Very flexible with work and life balances."
good,costco is a great company to get on with. They have many amazing benefits to both full and part time employees. Excellent health care coverage and pension plans. I enjoy working here and am happy I have staid.
good,With this company you can really advance you need to give up a lot but if a retail career is what you are looking for this is the company for you. If you want a good paying job top in the industry.
good,I had a great time working seasonal great co workers excellent staff always helping people and the have a great  variety of different positions you can start from
good,You will get a good workout from working here. It's very competitive when you're working seasonal positions but it's still very fun! For the most part it's team-work.
good,"Excellent pay, positive atmosphere. Plently of room for advancement. Excellent employee benefits including, 401k, pension. full health benefits, paid vacation and sick time."

good,"Great to work for, pleasant staff, and great pay. All managers in my experience were friendly and willing to help when needed. All staff members handled every situation appropriately and was willing to train someone with no experience."
good,never sit and never depend on any one here but your self. Hard work and dedication is what they want. other than that its a good place for people who are going to school
good,"Costco is a great company to work for, it has good benefits and them starting wage is better compared to other companies. Paid holidays are included! Workplace is fun and there are opportunities to grow. The most enjoyable part of the job is creating a friendship with members and making them feel welcomed every time he/she come shop at Costco."
good,"It's an OK career if you can handle the customers and can navigate the warehouse politics. Compensation is very generous for a no-skill job. I left because I wanted something a little more stimulating, but It's good for college students or people who don't have any other skills."
good,"The starting pay is low, but within five years you are topped out at a great living wage along with biannual bonuses. There is always room for advancement."
good,Costco is a great company to work for with great benefits and compensation. They take care of their employees which is also part of their mission statement.
good,"Servicio al cliente en punto de venta retail, facturación, quejas y sugerencias, tramites de tarjetas de crédito, devolución de mercancia."
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, coordinación y buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,My sampling of Costco was very narrow as I only worked one department and only for the seasonal period. But my time there was very rewarding and I recommend Costco for anyone looking for a stable position with great benefits.
good,Costco employment by far exceeded all standards I was use to in working for a large retail employer. The pay was very nice and mostly everyone they hire had great work ethics. My only downfall with Costco employment was that I was judge for my seasonal work at the end of the season by a supervisor that had hardly work with me. She would open the food court and I would close it. I worked really Hard allot harder I believe then allot of the seasonal workers yet i was not kept. The person with the power to decide in hiring full-time employment out of the seasonal workers and gave the ranking on each individual was someone who had never worked a shift with me. I was doing allot of side work in other departments for the people above her in the chain of command yet when final week comes i get put in ranking towards the bottom. I guess I should have learned who to really please first at the Vista Costco store. Great job overall tho wish they would have kept me.
good,"Can be slow during the week, but the weekends are very busy which makes it fun. All the employees become friends so it's like a little family that you work with. Always opportunities to change your position or your job level. Hard to gain full time status."
good,"Assisting members with their needs, as well as, ensuring guaranteed satisfaction. I learned how to thrive under pressure with the help of my team and management. Costco has a very family-oriented culture and is an excited atmosphere to work in."
good,"Meeting NEW members and keeping relationships with regulars"
good,"Worked at Costco on and off during my years of university, they always made sure I completed my minimum hour requirements while helping me balance school life and work life. Never felt pressured or like I was being an annoyance when putting school first."
good,"My experience at Costco was very good. I thought the people I worked with were very friendly and helpful in every aspect, I found the benefits to be some of the best I've ever seen, I think Costco is a great company that anyone would like to work for."
good,"Overall, Costco is a great place to work, because they pay their employees well and also offer employees working part time and full time great benefits."
good,"Usually, the store is busy so you have to good in multitasking and good with time management. Management is so cooperative and highly dedicated and helpful."
good,"good training"
good,"Costco is  a veryprogressive company, one which present numerous opportunities for individual advancements within  the organization with the right guidance."
good,"A typical day at Costco Wholesale is full of fun yet sometimes challenging tasks. I've learned to work around obstacles during high traffic hours of the store, with team members that share the same drive for customer service as I do. Management is great and always keeping us busy trying to help us accomplish goals set for our advancement within the store as well as the company. Costco's focus on hiring hard working men and women with great character make for a awesome work environment. The most demanding part of the job is maintaining a high quality customer experience with each and every member no matter how high store the store traffic may become. Although I would have to say that seeing people get what they came for and leave genuinely thankful for the help and service you provided makes it all worthwhile."
good,"Be prepared to work, easy to make friends and managers are easily approachable and helpful. Room for growth in a number of different positions, great benefits."
good,There was never a dull moment at Costco. There was always something you should be doing so the days never dragged on. Also The management was amazing.
good,"Great company, good culture, job security, for someone with no degree or significant job skills, this is a good place to start with if you can get an opportunity to interview"
good,"Great people, they love new workers, the work pay was perfect and the manager was Supper nice, no one would get mad, even if you messed up badly you would get let off with a small warning. the people who work enough get promoted and you get a raise ever few hundred days worked. the only thing I dislike is the night shift, because you work a full 8 hours from midnight till morning (Graveyard shift) and after that they ask you to stay sometimes for an extra hour or two."
good,"Working as an order picker, teaches you time management and tests your endurance. Costco gives great benefits to their employees."
good,"Everyone is friendly and fun to work with, i learned that management likes you to always be moving its a fast paced work place. Your shifts go by very fast."
good,Extremely fast paced workplace especially around the busier times of the year. The company does really care about their employees and there are many options for movement around a singular warehouse or among the company as a whole.
good,"Learned excellent customer service "
good,Very busy and hectic at times. Working here I gained new skills and worked on various tasks with in the warehouse. Co workers were great and friendly.

good,"durante estos cuatro años en los que forme parte de esta empresa, me dieron la oportunidad de crecer tanto personal como laboral, aprendí sobre el trato de las personas, formaron a una persona mas paciente, mas entregada a su trabajo, así como la oportunidad de realizar mi carrera."
good,"early mornings for stockers are easy to get used to, the workers and management are helpful and fair. good hard work was always recognized and praised. fast paced work means that as you are rarely working in the vicinity of others it is hard to get to know others on a personal level."
good,"I got this job because I was newly married, attending school full time, needed a job with good benefits, and needed a job with above average pay. Costco definitely provided my wife and I with everything we needed for that time in my life. Now that stage of my life is over and I know I am worth more than just being a stocker until they decide to promote me, so it is time to move on."
good,Days at work can be very busy or very slow. My manager is awesome and my coworker in my department all get along. It's like we are a family. Only thing is that schedule changes alot.
good,"Ensuring each and every customer leaves satisfied. I also Counsel, develop and train all employees of my department and lastly I assist anywhere else the business needs."
good,Nice place to get experience with till and customers. Good management and team. Many opportunities to meet nice people.
good,A great enviroment to work with. Always a busy place but challenging. Learned other works from other departments. Able to practice and enhance my customer service.

good,"I started working at Costco a couple weeks after I graduated high school. I started pushing carts and I did that for about 2 years but learned how to cashier and how to merchandise as well. A typical day is quite busy. On a weekend there would be well over 2,500 members coming in through the store. I have learned how to provide the best customer service in the industry by putting our members first. My managers have been nothing but supportive of my career with Costco and the pursuit of my studies. They know I'm going to give it my all when I get into work and working with my school schedule is going to keep me motivated. The hardest part of my job would be picking orders on the weekends when I still have to assist members and meet my deadlines. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting close with my coworkers and becoming close with them."
good,Excellent company to work with but you have to handle the stress that comes with everyday tasks especially when working within the pharmacy. above average pay when compared with other companies

good,"I like Costco Wholesale. It is a fine environment with quality employees."
good,"My typical day varies. I am currently a cashier, but with my experience my job duties vary. I help in various departments when the business needs are required. The management and staff are exceptional and knowledgeable. They treat their employees with courtesy and respect. The hardest part of my job is not spending enough time with family and friends, and not living up to my full potential. The most enjoyable part of working for Costco is the relationships I have built over the past 16 years."

good,"I loved working at Costco, the pay was great, the benefits were excellent. I liked the variety of working in different departments"
good,Great job. Didn't enjoy working the night shift because I was at school at the time. Managers were great and fully equipped with the knowledge and tools to do their job and help the employees.
good,"This job was a great first job in my opinion. The only problem I had was with the hours, I found myself having too much overtime for being a seasonal worker, especially on holidays."
good,"I enjoyed working for Costco the past 25 years i advanced in management real fast. I left because i tried a career in Music, it did not work out."

good,The hours are not enough for me. and they pay less money than your effort. But in general it is a good company because you learn a lot.
good,"Diverse job duties, expect something different everyday. Friendly co workers and helpful managers who enjoy their jobs and treat their employees with respect. The heavy lifting was the hardest part of the job but the environment was rewarding."
good,A typical day at work was to get my cart and stock it with items that I would need that day. I would stock enough where I don't have to go back and get more items. What I learned at this job was to project my voice and learned how to demonstrate the products in ways the customers can understand and would like to purchase the product. The manager that would be on staff was great. They always had a lovely and positive attitude to everyone and about everything. My co-workers were enjoyable they taught me a lot and if I need assistance on anything I knew I could ask them to help me. I enjoy taking challenges but at the time the hardest part of this job was understanding how to explain the products the way the customer could understand and would like to purchase but I did start to understand how to. I enjoyed talking to people the most at this job.
good,"Every day was always filled with new encounters and made me feel important in my job. Management was always supportive with anything going on from work to family. "

good,All employees clocked in for their shift.  Checked in with management for any meeting updates.  Fast pace environment and constantly busy.  So employees worked hard.  I've learned how employees should be treated with respect.  If there were any issues they were addressed by management immediately.  The environment with other employees was fun and worked well as a team in all departments of the warehouse.  The hardest part of the job was keeping conversation with our members to a minimum.  Most employees were on a first name basis with the members.  The most enjoyable moments are the members of Costco.  They showed a sense a pride being a member of Costco.  It was very satisfying knowing I was a part of a company that practiced great ethics.  We were offered great benefits and great hours.  It was a great experience.
good,"Awesome place to work,great people and great environment."
good,I was a baker. The management is great and it is a great place to work at. Everyone is treating with respect. The hardest thing was getting more hours.

good,"Costco is a very fast paced work environment. There is always something to do and you are never standing still. If you weren't a cashier assistant, you were a cashier, or helping to clean the bathroom, or helping out at the seafood roadshow, or just making sure the warehouse remained in an orderly manner. I learned that sometimes you have to be really flexible because you could be called on to do something you do not necessarily want to do, but you do it because it helps out the team. "
good,"This was one of the best job I had based on people I worked with and management. this jobs offered frequent raises and 401k. it was a pleasure working with my co-workers. I also enjoyed the membership that came with employment. The work days were short, and there was a lot of cleaning involved at the end of each shift.I worked as a cashier.

good,"Costco Wholesale is a great place to work with awesome benefits and great staff! Everyone always seems upbeat and enjoying what they do.

good,From the President to the person welcoming you at the door. This company holds a high regard for it's members and employee's.
good,"A typical day consists mostly of a lot of manual labor, whether it's lifting 100lb boxes of meat or 5lb boxes of cheese, it's a lot of lifting. None of which bothers me one bit. I learned how to operate a clamp/ forklift, how to audit and use the AS400 computer system to check myself against, how to properly load a semi-trailer to specification, scan, take inventory, customer support, and much, much more."

good,I am the Night Shift Supervisor. I maintain procedure and protocol among my associates. I am also a forklift operator. I receive and manage stock and live product for the warehouse.
good,"Seeing as I worked in the shipping department, my typical work day was simply loading Coscto trailers all day. The main expectancy of the shipping department was, at least at the time I worked there, to load at least one trailer per hour. The management was quite friendly and very understanding of various situations. The coworkers were kind of competitive. The hardest part of the job for me was trying to get around seniority because I had a family situation that I was trying to get an earlier shift but they were already a full shift. The most enjoyable part was the, for me, the competitive nature of the shipping department."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, crecimiento laboral, buen sueldo, pero muchas horas de trabajo."

good,"Costco was a great company to work for, they compensate their employees well, while providing excellent benefits for every employee from the janitorial staff to general manager. The management at my location could have been more efficient and needed to improve communication between different departments. Despite those drawbacks the management staff was excellent and very accommodating. Overall, Costco was an excellent company to work for."
good,"a typical day at work was to get my section ready for store opening, then maintaining it until home time when the next shift starts."
good,"Enjoyed many different experiences each time I worked in different areas.  In Marketing- went to store -met with rest of Marketers.  Left to go either to the office to call prospective companies or went to onsight at company of that day.  Talked to prospects as they came into our designated area, about Costco and it's benefits.  At end of day or designated time-packed up our literature and new memberships and went back to store.  Once there, we fed information into computer and created their membership cards.  That day or the next-depending on time-we took the membership cards back to the company and thanked them for their consideration and or membership."

good,I loved marketing and the membership dept. This company really does take care of you.
good,"Clock in, head to receiving depot and coordinate with our supervisor for assignments and tasks. I frequently used forklifts and electric pallet jacks to organize and overstock the receiving depot and warehouse. I learned many aspects of database management and brushed up on Microsoft Excell. The most difficult part was definately the rigorous restocking of merchandise. I really enjoyed my relationships with my coworkers there was a solidarity in our department."

good,"I loved working for Costco and was very sad to leave this place of work. It was a job that made you strive to be your best and you always had to work your hinder off. They have great benefits and great pay, but you definitely work hard for it all. The biggest downfall was constant weekend hours, but it was worth it."
good,"I found that Costco Wholesale, as a whole, is an amazing employer. Benefits and compensation were exceptional. Work and life help sources were provided. Being a store that provides for family and businesses, the employer was very family-oriented."
good,i was a long time member before working there. my goal was to get to costco in my eyes was is the top in entry level. yet the cosco family feel you get from working there is hands down the best workplace ever. i got layed off in 2010 yet every time i go back to visit my old store in concord they welcome me with open arms just like a family. costco is like a 2ed home to me and if i had the chance i would go back with know questions asked. i have a plt of pride in the comp.

good,"Really nice company for work the managers very nice and the co worker too."
good,I loved working here and wished I could have stayed on as a full time employee but unfortunately I was only a seasonal worker and was laid off after three months. I do not hold it against the company but there is a possibility you will lose your job after the 90 probationary period.
good,"I love my work! The days are usually busy and hectic but management always finds time to appreciate your hard work and make good assessment of one's skills. The environment is very friendly and energetic and the friends you make are amazing. Although the rewards and benefits are amazing you have to work hard for them, it's not a job that suits everybody due to it's demanding nature. You must be professional and focused throughout the whole shift but it's not impossible."
good,"- I learned how to be quick and efficient with handling customer's items gently"
good,"i learn to alway to take pride at your job when i work there"
good,Fun and busy place to work. If you like being on your feet and moving then this is the place for you. Good pay and opportunity to work up in the company as well as nice hard working people.

good,Costco is fast pace business. We all work as a team. I finally found a job were I am excited to wake up and go. We are one big happy family. Starting pay right now is $15/hr. You have plenty room to grow. Basically everybody starts off part time must be available to work weekends.

good,"Costco was definitely a great employer and it's principles and the way the company treats it's employees are second to none. The only downfall is some of the managers who don't follow the same methodologies as the company itself. You always run into bad apples but when it's a manager who can change your whole day, it gets rough sometimes. Favouritism was the biggest issue at the Richmond Hill location."
good,Es una empresa que apoya a los jóvenes que están estudiando con sus horarios de 4 hrs diarias. El ambiente laboral es muy bueno y hay muchas oportunidades para crecer en la empresa
good,Es entretenido y se te hace rápido el paso del tiempo ya que muchos de los compañeros de verdad hacen equipo

The workplace culture is very committed and the most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with. Time goes by fast working fast and busy throughout the day."
good,"if you can learn on the job this is the place. Fast paced doesn't begin to describe this environment but it's interesting how they are still able to please the Customer at the end of the day. Training is on the job, be prepared to ask lots of questions and get them answered.  Supervisors are not afraid to help you if your willing to learn, and they are very positive."
good,Costco Wholesale is a great company and they will go through a huge amount of people to select a small group they would like to keep as full-time to part-time employees.

good,"Buenas prestaciones, horarios de medio tiempo muy flexibles, te dan el apoyo necesario para laborar, sin duda lo recomiendo."
good,"Great corporation, that really takes care of their employees. Also their vendors and they expect integrity. Store is set up in a lot of departments. Bakery, food court, cashier, tire shop etc. Therefore management is extensive body-wise, and authority can be misused"
good,"Costco me dio mucho que aprender sobre todo en su sistema para sacar reportes de pasillos, letreros, inventarios, etc."
good,"This is a great job with a great working environment. "
good,"I worked here for less than 90 days sadly :( , I applided for the deil and they have a very tight schedual. You only have two's off and work full time even if your not full time. Overall the pay was really good, along with the benefits , and the good people you get to meet, but if your looking for a job and social life then this isnt the job for you because you work long hours and get the worst days off."

good,"Costco is a great company to work for! They have great benefits and awesome bonuses. However, it is hard to advance being seniority always trumps new hires."
good,"Member service ensuring the member leaves happy. Enthusiastic personality, the team reflects off management. If the management is involved and eager, the employees will be responsive."
good,"Separating just two months shy of a three year anniversary/ bonus ..nothing but bittersweet. Per usual most warehouse/ distribution facilities you have to start out doing most of the grunt work, wrapping pallets by hand or with a handy poke device to assist you. Pakketize by hand sometimes, even picking up a light spill every once in a while. But it gets better, you get certified on an EPJ(electric pallet jack). Then Fork truck, with that come additional knowledge to make life easier on the job."
good,"Was attending school while working for costco and they worked very well with my schedule. Unfortunately I left due to being denied vacation time to see my sick grandfather because they said I had no vacation. Turned out have almost 70 hours vacation,cause  that's what they paid me out for. So some management was a little confused. Also, the best store manager left shortly after I did, and the place went downhill."
good,Costco paid good and expected a lot from there employees  I loved working there but I had an opportunity to inherit my childhood home and land and decided to make a life change..
good,"Is a fun, venture like very fast paced environment company. always closely coaching teaching and mentoring employees in order to  assure  the best shopping experience possible for our members."
good,"Management make up the rules as they see fit,to suit their own ends.No matter what happens and who is wrong, Management will never take the fall for being wrong.Too busy sucking up to senior management visits.Not a surprise to find that the CEO has not even made the top 5 Great CEO s to work for(sorry he hasn't even made the top 40)."
good,"My working days in COSTCO, made me to look into Supply Chain business modules. Later in year 2016, I decided to do MBA in Supply Chain and Hospital Administration."

good,"I enjoyed showing up to Costco knowing what the day had in store for me.  Either restocking ""dog wall"" or soda isle, but also being on the floor for 4 hours before closing and stocking duties took place. I really enjoyed interacting with the members"
good,"Costco is a progressive Stock owned company that is vested in its employees, members, vendors and stock holders. It holds a highly conscientious approach to resolving issues of conflict and will always seek out the high path to take and will go to bat for you if you are in need of assistance.  The benefits are excellent with a very aggressive pay structure and health , dental and medical and vision benefits,; this company is excellent.  Paid time off is great as well."
good,"Although my position was temporary, I would recommend working for Costco. A friend always recommended me to work there and I'm glad I did. All coworkers and supervisors are super friendly and helpful. The work environment is really cold but nothing a jacket can help."
good,"Costco is a fast-paced environment in every department I've worked. It's honest, hard work and the perks and benefits are generous. Management is wonderful, training and meetings are paid, raises are automatic with set goal hours, the company only promotes from within. There are so many great reasons to stay with the company from day one. It would take at least half an hour to explain them all. Many employees I worked with were with the company for over 20 years. Work for Costco. It's the best job I've ever had."
good,"long standing periods, always communicating, always willingly to help or receive help from coworkers."
good,It was a fun job and a great place to learn about retail. Gave me a great customer experience. The hardest part of the job was the long work hours but most of the time it went by really fast.
good,In costco is a company for people who like to be with a lot of people to attend the partners to be friendly and be proactive during your working hours.
good,Concord Costco is the 2nd busiest Costco in the world. It made the day go by really quick. You have to be quick learning and a hard worker because it is constant work.
good,"When I joined the Costco team I was aware it would be for a short time only as my husband and I were planning to relocate. I had just resigned from my previous job with the Williamson County Government after 15 great years and was looking for something that would transfer easily to Tucson, Az . The supervisors there helped me apply for a job transfer and supported me but none were available."
good,great environment and great company it feels good that i was appreciated by a company.  I would give it a 5 out of 5. The work culture is open and supportive.
good,"Member-focused, service oriented positions based on high efficiency and quantity driven performance. Typical days are balanced between multiple tasks as needed, largely supported by supervisory personnel and teamwork minded co-workers."
good,I love working here because of the one on one I have with each member. I get to have a relationship with each member which they really appreciate. It’s because of the employees that the experience at Costco is memorable.
good,I enjoyed working there and wish the contract would not end though alternating schedules in same week was abit hard on my body to deal with all in all they do care
good,Was a great placed to work. You got all major holidays off and also got paid time and a half on Sundays. You rarely got full time but the minimum wage there is so high it really wasn't the big of a deal. Defiantly would recommend.
good,For the most part they care about you. No where can beat the benefits they give to even  part timers. After 6 years you can make 24/h stocking shelf's.
good,In my time at Costco i was able to build upon foundational skilled already acquired and fine tune and establish even more skills. With opportunities given frequently (in my case) I was able to explore different departments and gain a wide variety of skills I hadn’t had or might not have gotten the chance to acquire.
good,I liked working at Costco. I wouldn't have quit but had some health issues with my daughter that required more time than I had available.The seniority policy is very hard. At least at my location there are employees that have been there over 15-20 years so even after 2 years I still had no seniority and was always stuck with closing shifts and only part time shifts. I still enjoyed working here but that was rough on my kids and family.
good,friendly co workers. happy members. good pay with benefits. management is good at the location where I work. They help you when needed and are very flexible with anything you need help with. helping members is very exciting for me.
good,"Excelente!! Colaboro con mis compañeros de trabajo, cumplo con los requisitos de la compañía.  Uso mis zapatos steal toe. Soy puntual a la hora de llegada. Cumplo con las normas de la compañía."
good,"great place to work"
good,High energy work environment.  Cross training mandatory.  Plenty of on going training. Great managers at my location. Very no non sence and strict with people who try and get away with not being where they are supposed to be or coming in late.
good,"I am one of those employees that is all over the place. My might be on the front end packing carts one day and outside the next. Overall, my time has been good while working at Costco."
good,"I was a seasonal employee for three years"
good,"To be able to work at Costco is a privilege. I am so grateful to be able to get accepted into Costco working at a pharmacist. I was able to take my time on how to verify prescriptions, counseling patients, and not have to worry about the number. Costco value each and every customer and just don't treat as a number"
good,"Costco is a wonderful employer. In general, the company is well managed. I loved working here. For a large corporation I found them to be well-organized. I worked on a variety of projects and learned more about the retail industry than I ever thought I could. It is an employee friendly corporation. I had more fun as a contractor at Costco, in part due to the variety of work, than with any other contract I've had in the past 10 years. They allow you to be creative."
good,"I worked in their pharmacy. Costco got me through my Masters degree and by the time I graduated, they were paying me more than the jobs I was being offered for my Masters in social work. Great benefits. Great people. Black out travel dates prohibit employees to take time off during Thanksgiving and Christmas. If you get a job at Costco then keep it."
good,"I enjoy the members and employees and I've built some memorable friendships, as a 20 year employee I will be at 5 weeks paid vacation and $4000.00 bonuses twice a year April and September. Insurance pays 90% much better than most insurance "
good,Very dynamic workplace with a lot of departments to choose from. Different tasks to execute everyday. Various events organized by the company making it a fun environment
good,The co-workers are great. From the warehouse manager all the way to cart collectors. Everyone is working toward the same goal and everyone helps everyone else.
good,It’s a great place to work to gain experience and know what type of worker you are. The fast pace and always being on your feet really shows how you can handle other jobs and situations.
good,Costco Wholesale is an excellent place to work. I am very proud to be part of the Costco family. I have been employed with the company since 2007 and I it’s been a challenging but rewarding experience.
good,"Extremely easy to get hired and extremely difficult to get fired. Women do get treated differently in some circumstances, in their favor. Some managers catered to the hard workers, but let the less favorable ones fly under the radar."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at Costco wholesale and would highly recommend it to anyone looking. You work hard but the days go by fast and you have fun! The management was friendly and helpful and so were the other workers.
good,Trabajar para esta empresa es algo sumamente grandioso es una compañía que te ayuda a aprender mucho en él área de trabajo
good,Great atmosphere. Great customers friendly staff and you stay busy your whole shift .the managers let you know when you have done a good job and plenty of opportunity for advancements
good,"Costco is very hard work physically, but the employees are great, will help you willingly, and the merchandise changes weekly.  Management is very helpful and encouraging."
good,Costco Wholesale is a great company with great benefits. They are very driven in following company policies. There is always a sense of urgency and a need to get things done by everyone.A motivational place to work at.
good,"Es un lugar perfecto para trabajar por ambiente laboral, horarios, turnos, salario e incluso por situación del centro de trabajo."
good,I worked there 25 years and may return after caring for family members last couple years. Its extremely fast-paced. Costco pays more and they expect MORE. Working with people can always bring stress. Not a place for lazy people!! Employees become family and loyalty is strong. Excellent benefits and take care of their own...and members.
good,"Nice place to work.Fast pace. Some people that worked there have been there for years.The managers were nice, and the crew was helpful, stick with your partner like glue learn the ropes.With a brake every 2 hours for 15min and lunch is only a half hour it was easy going."
good,a typical day was coming in at 6 am pepping all food items that needed to be made for the days sales before and after shift all deli  counters floors and food prep ares are sanitized for next shift
good,"I loved working at Costco because they pay was good. There is good chance of job advancement and you also get benefits if you're part time. I had health insurance, vision, and dental. I also had a 401k which helped me out when I needed the money after I quit my job. The management is also very reliable. If I had any kind of problem they were always there to help me."
good,"Great management and leadership, great staff that are willing to teach and work with you, and lots of room to grow. Costco has different shifts for your lifestyle and has great benefits and wages."
good,I like working here and will continue as long as they will have me. The atmosphere is typical for a retail store. The people working there are nice and always say hi.
good,As I was only part time. it was a great job to have for the mean time. Wishing I had an opportunity to get a full time position but it is very competitive for when full time positions open.
good,Here At The Optical Lab It's Not A Bad Place At All Managers And Supervisors Are Mostly Friendly. We Try Our Best To Work As A Team To Meet Lab Goals.
good,"Working at Costco was an amazing experience. There was non stop work, and the management crew was great. They played the rock radio station during the morning merchandise."
good,"I have been working for Costco since May 15, 2014. Since then it has been an excellent place to work and gain many different skills, which include verbal communication, customer service, teamwork, becoming a leader when working with a team, and working for the benefit of the company rather than for myself. It has a great working environment with a great culture. Costco consists of people who enter the workplace with a positive attitude and are strongly willing to work together as a team. Most importantly, the staff is extremely supportive, which is what helped me become more reliable. Furthermore, the supportiveness has encouraged me to contribute to different areas of the organization to make myself more reliable for the organization. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with an unhappy customer. However, this was most challenging when I first started working for Costco. As I progressed throughout my employment, I became more confident and comfortable dealing with unhappy customers as I constantly developed effective communication skills. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy and knowing the managers are satisfied with my work. This encourages me to continue working as hard as I can to benefit the organization."
good,It was a seasonal position. It was ok pay and work. I love to work again when I need a part time job.  I like the company policy is based on work hours not by manager because it is fair for everyone. I love Costco as a customer and worker. Great company and treat employee fairly.
good,Holiday seasonal job.  Fit my student schedule.  Hours were very flexible.  Overtime on Sunday was great.  Relazed but fast paced.  Supervisors were professional.
good,"You see, I am working here because I as a nineteen year old human in a capitalist country, in college have the incredible and obscene desire for money"
good,"Business knowledge"
good,"They take great care of employees with great benefits, great 401k, vacation pay, and great overall pay. The advancement opportunities are always there and available if you really want them."
good,"Tal vez llegue a ser algo estresante el tratar con mucha gente, pero al final, el ambiente es muy divertido, todos los empleados son muy unidos y la empresa te ayuda mucho si eres estudiante. Lo mejor es que cada día aprendes algo nuevo porque muchas veces te mandan de apoyo a otras áreas."
good,"A typical day at work was packing carts for the cashiers, folding clothes and restocking left over items to shelves."
good,"nice place to work , nice employees nice environment."
good,"CDS always provide good services and ideas on how to be creative with the products that costco sale. Costco has a very friendly enviroment for coworkers, you meet new people and make friends."
good,A good place to work and the pay scale was even better. The best day was at the start of the shift. The hardest was working during inventory. When you become a Costco veteran you are in a class of your own  25 year club.
good,"Es una empresa muy selectiva y su método de contratación es excelente , muchas oportunidades para crecer y buen ambiente laboral."
good,Costco hires great people to work with. The bakery is a very physical job. Fast paced environment but also fun when working with great people . I would love to work there again.
good,Costco was great working with my schedule while I was attending college. I always felt like I was working on a team and there was always help available when I had questions or needed anything.
good,"Well rounded environment, good people, good hours, fair pay. Everyone works hard and is very helpful. Staff is kind and respectful, the warehouse is clean and orderly."
good,"I would like to work for this company again. There are chances of advancing with this company, and very welcoming management and associates. Very fast paced, and make sure to get comfortable shoes. You’re on your feet a lot."
good,"I have worked as an Ecommerce agent for Costco for a while now. I love it. The pay raisrs are based off if time worked. You get a raise for every 1,040 hours worked. So your raised are baded off of how much time invested and not how far ypu can stick your nose of your supervisors rear end. All employees are treated equally. They hire internally so you will nwver be supervised by someone just coming in who knows less than you. Never feel degraded. Open door policy. Leniant on time off. The culture is very fun and 21st century. Not too conservative. Professional but not boring. The insurance is the best. You get a free membership as an employee and you can add 3 friends/ family members to the account. There are so many positions that it's eady to move up in the company. Members are so much happier than members who usually shop with othet retailers. There us jyst sometjing about Costco members. They are just good people all around. The only xomplaint I have no is that my department got our hour cut temporarilt anf the nitice was not soon enough. So all of us agents are not gettimg many hours. The cool thing is that I am so confident in this company that I will not leave them. I know they will take care of me and there will be a fair amount of overtime to catch up. Also, lastlu overtime is anything over 8 hours paid on a day. So if you work a 10 hour day subtract your 30 minute lunch and you have 8 hours regular pay and 1.5 hours overtime. Thus us still true even if you only work 14 hours in 1 week. It's truly the best company to work for. Best retirement as well. I recommend and"
good,"Very productive. I learned new things each day on the job, positive workplace, employees are very helpful. The most enjoyable part for me was being able to help wherever was needed."
good,"A typical day at Costco would always be busy. i learned time management skills, as well as communicating my ideas with a team. Management was great! I loved my supervisors and coworkers. The workplace was often crowded, but very well kept and functioning. The hardest part of the job was definitely breaking out of my shell and communicating with strangers. The most enjoyable part of the job was absolutely the people!"
good,"Working seasonally for Costco was a great experience and I wish I could've stayed longer. They kept me the entire season and paid very well. Staff and management was wonderful, great workplace environment. They only keep a select few seasonals, so it was treated as a competition, though they said that seasonals are the first ones they call when new positions open up in the spring. Many employees including managers said they started as seasonals and were called back later."
good,Worked with a great group of guys. Great all around job.Everyday was a challenge to open store on time with no pallets on the floor. 99% of the time we accomplished our goal made time go buy super fast.
good,"Costco is a great place to work as long as you are willing to work as hard as you can. There is no slacking or standing around, the moto is ""if you have time to lean, you have time to clean. As long as you work hard, it's worth it."
good,"Costco's motto is if you pay your workers well, they'll work well. Working at Costco as a seasonal employee was very nice because I was learning something new each day in different departments. Nice friendly staff and with the management being helpful and understanding it was nice to work there."
good,"Worked there almost 20 years, great money, great people. "
good,"The work environment within Costco can be fast-paced, but it is never an overwhelming sensation of not being able to perform one's job duties. Everyone that I worked with was quite friendly and always kept a positive attitude. Management was respectful and did not have unrealistic expectations of what needed to be done. Overall, if I am offered a permanent position at Costco I would seriously consider it."
good,"Its very easy and fun. People there are amazing and nice. Managers were always helpful and friendly. Not alot of bad things to say except the hours i was given, mostly mornings till mid day or evening to late nights never a normal day."
good,"Working at Costco is stressful and fast-paced, but fulfilling. You get a paid 15 minute break every two hours, and an unpaid 30 minute lunch every four hours for shifts 5 hours or longer."
good,"Costco was my third job and probably the best one. Everyone is extremely nice, you're like a big family their. Members are kind and appreciate the work we do."
good,"Hands down the best retail company to work for. Great HR, base pay, advancement oppurtunities. If you are a hard worker this place will keep you."
good,I only worked there for a short period of time as I was a seasonal employee but it was a great job to have. Unfortunately hours were cut and we could not be kept on but there is the potential for a call back. The management team is wonderful. Overall a great job.
good,"Costco is a very busy work place, but management and employees work together well when it comes to getting the job done and all the goals met. I have learned how to take care of customers and train new employees which is what I most enjoyed."
good,Great company. Stocks have been through the roof with no end in sight to this constant stream of water that has been tapped into. The Costco culture has pushed through from the workers to the corporate level the hard working and quick paced culture has thrived through the years.
good,"Costco is a great place to work. Great management, good pay, great benefits and great people to work with. I started out as morning merch. Great hours! Typically starting at 5am and getting off by 10am or even 1pm."
good,"An excellent place to work, with a focus on employee satisfaction and member satisfaction. It has very strict policies, and high expectations for their employees, which in my opinion could be improved upon in different ways, but over all the management, work, and benefits was a very good experience. Management was uplifting, and fairly understanding, unless you crossed with a core policy, the work is rewarding thanks to the pay, and the benefits are some of the best I've seen."
good,"A paragraph is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose."
good,"Great place to work once you get hired. The only hard thing about working there is being on your feet. Employees are kind, and management is very empathetic if problems arise. The company hires from within so it's somewhere you can stay and make an actual living. Costco takes great care of it's employees!"
good,Working at Costco has helped me grow as an individual and develop so many working skills that will help me in my future and personal life. The employees and management are very helpful as well.
good,"Lots of room to grow, great people to work with. Great benefits & bonus given to you every 6 months after being there for 5 years. Great place to get your foot in the door."
good,"Costco is a rarity in today's workplace culture, in that they actually care about their employees. Costco staff work hard, but are rewarded appropriately, and longevity is also rewarded. It's clear with the low turnover that Costco knows how to treat it's people."
good,"Es una buena empresa en general para trabajar, son turnos de 4 horas y las prestaciones son muy buenas, lo unico malo es que no hay tanto crecimiento laboral, a demas de tipicos problemas de favoritismos y un ambiente optimo en algunas de sus áreas."
good,Costco Wholesale Ringwood has a very supportive working environment in which the wellbeing of employees is nurtured. Management are very supportive and show care towards employees.
good,"Bloomstar gave me the opportunity to work long hours and gain the knowledge necessary to move forward in the merchandising industry."
good,"Costco is the BEST company I have ever worked for!! The pay and benefits are amazing, they care about work/life balance, and training is always very thorough!  Alot of employees have been there 20 years or longer which is a great indicator of just how terrific this company is to work for! The downside to this, however, is that it can take a long time to get promoted because the employees hardly ever leave!! The only reason I no longer work there is because my family was moving out of state and I was not able to transfer...the store where I was moving to didn't have any openings because no one ever leaves!!"
good,I enjoy conversing with coworkers during breaks. Daily conversation with coworkers include back and forth banter on sports. My workday starts at 7:00 with clocking in and then collecting cardboard throughout the building before opening. I enjoy the fast paced atmosphere. The hardest part of my job is having my daily pre opening tasks done before opening.
good,"this review is based on a job held eleven years ago.  As stated in the review summary. It is a very good place to work.  They do take care of you in all areas of concern.  Since I left the pay and benefits have gone up with regular floor workers making over forty thousand a year. Management is in the sixty thousand and up with substantial stock options.  It  is hard on the body walking and standing on concrete all day and carpel tunnel is and issue with some people ,"
good,"You work your butt off in the mornings. The compensation is fair and the benefits are fantastic. I was told when hired the keys to success at Costco are show up reliably, show up on time and work hard while you are there. It is fast paced and the your day flies by, very good company to work for if you aren't averse to rigorous manual labor."
good,Awesome place to work good pay good benefits good place to work good work atmosphere always competitive love the people I worked with on daily basis  best place to work
good,Great place to work with a friendly staff and great amount of hours. Always willing to help you when you need the support from your coworkers. Management improves your ability to work if you give them the leeway to learn.
good,"impeccable benefits."
good,"Working at costco was once of the safes places i worked at. They care abut the employees. A lot of lifting, and speed walking is done to keep the store running but your team will always be there to help. Managers were very aware of their team, constantly checking up on them. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the fast paced enviorment."
good,"The workplace at Costco was very positive and encouraging, and taught a lot about how to multi-task and problem solve on a daily basis. Management staff was very helpful and encouraging to every employee."
good,"daily wok at Costco consist of preparatory front end work, cash registers set up etc."
good,"Costco is an excellent company to work for, during my time of employment I was pregnant and my pregnancy was labeled as high risk. Costco took that into consideration and was very understanding when health issues interfered with my ability to work efficiently."
good,"I work as an optical assistant. "
good,Hard work but very rewarding.  A very diverse company with amazing employee relations.  Costco offers opportunities for advancement and training in all areas.
good,"The management were friendly and they take care of their employees. My coworkers were always welcoming to myself and to members! It was a quick paced job, but it helped the days go by faster!"
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"It was a great place to work and Grow .  You can learn from alot of different people ,Management made sure you understand your work and what you do.  Coastco is a place you can pick you so many skills ."
good,I'm very new to the Food Court but have learned quickly and now I am amazed at how much work happens behind the scenes. I have a new respect for the food service industry!
good,"Great time at Costco. Very fast paced. If you can’t keep up, your out. Job description is straight forward. You check out customers as fast as you can. Little customer service"
good,Costco was great place to work and if you chose to you could make it a career the pay was great the benefits were great and so was the management at the time.
good,"I was part of the morning stocking team, came in and stocked the electronics department. After opening i would assist customers with questions or concerns, i was usuall home by 2PM every day."
good,"Great pay, good people. The hardes thing is the customers who can be junk. But keep your head high and do your job. And you'll be fine. This is a career job."
good,"Good job, good hours, good benefits. I enjoyed working early in the morining and getting off early to have the rest of the day to my self. Makes it easy when I am setting up appointments or classes for school."
good,Très bonne entreprise avec bonne culture et bons salaires et avantages.
good,Such a great company to work for! Lots of room to grow depending on the location you are in. Also great benefits from the company for part-timers and full-time.
good,"As someone who has worked for one of the many departments inside of a Costco warehouse, I can confidently say that, I don't regret a day I worked there."
good,Costco is an organization and has a great timing in the result of their jobs. They surround the new employees well. Not just in their debut but in their way to become independent.
good,"Costco day-to-day activities are extremely team-based. You need to be able to communicate effectively and efficiently with coworkers and management. The management team is caring and listens to any concerns. Customers can either be nice or extremely rude. Sometimes you feel belittled by customers when they're upset about something completely out of your control. Otherwise, the customers are chatty and uplifting."
good,Satification ratings always at the top of the scale. Best health benefits in the business that never changed even in the recession.  401K progam with company match. They take care of their employees who take care of their members. Low turn-over rate for retail.
good,Great company to work for. Excellent benefits and pay. Oportunity to grow fast and trasfer to other locations around the states and some other countries.
good,"Greeting members and running everything in the day to day operations."
good,Costco is a very good environment to work around it's a very fast paced everybody's very friendly helpful around their managers help you out a lot we work as a team
good,Amazing leadership that is full of challenges and people. I think that work is stay and consistent. The best part is being able to take on new clients.
good,"great place if the company had a faster track to becoming a manager I would have stayed, but I had a young family at the time and I had a true passion for more."
good,relaxed and work friendly. worked here part time while going to school. great starting pay and flexible schedule. we also got annual bonuses every year.
good,"Management aucun mot à dire. Politique porte ouverte ( peux parler au supérieur n importe quand et pour n importe quoi sans gêne ) "
good,Every Costco depends on the warehouse.  The general manager will set the tone for the entire store and if the handbook/code is followed.  If it is not based on Costco's precepts of business it is best to get out while you can and seek another warehouse.
good,Great place to work! Always busy. Great managers. Friendly co workers. Team work. Diverse team. Diverse members. Great benefits. Stock options. 401K option.
good,"I loved working at Costco for the friendly environment, proper treatment of its employees, great pay and benefits. The only trouble for me was that I had a hard time obtaining enough hours to make ends meet, so I had to move on to another job. If I could get full time hours at Costco I would never have left. It can be strenuous work at times but I like that."
good,"My typical day start at 10:30am 4 or 3 time a week. I get my cart ready with food and things needed for cooking or serving to public. I do a lot of talking about the positivity of this product to get them to by it. Everyday is rewarding to see how we make people feel good being at the store, helping them find items, love the little one say Thank You. I can be fast pace when doing Breaking other staff servers for lunch or breaks. I Really love doing what I do, so I hope I can do the same in a position at your facility. I'm a people person love to talk."
good,"The work life at costco can be crazy,fast, and slow depending on the days and time of day or year. Costco is a place that you have to be willing to give up your time to grow and advance with the company. A normal work day for me would be collecting carts for the first four hours of my shift. the last four hours i was inside stocking or operating a forklift getting things organized for the workers in the morning."
good,"I worked outside with the carts and it was very calm and relaxed. We had supervisors but they rarely came outside to tell us what to do. When they did they just gave us our game plan to get the carts back to a higher capacity under the canopy. Other than that, we were well taken care of."
good,"Great working experience, pay and benefits.  They employ a great group of people to work in their stores.  All basic entry level positions are straight forward and simple for most individuals to handle."
good,"Working here is ultimately hard work, but its rewarding. If you like helping people and enjoy a fast paced environment then its the place for you. Management is nice and professional and there is a three month period in which you prove yourself in order to keep the job, ensuring that your coworkers are hard and good workers."
good,"Here I learned how to be committed about work. I was able to sharp my work pace and customer service. I really enjoyed my time there. It was a great 1st job,"
good,"From the moment you clocked in for work. There was always something to do in the warehouse. Days worked fast and time was on your side."
good,"It was a hard job, but i worked with amazing people. And it taught me a lot. Its manual labor, and a typical day tarts at 2 AM and goes till 10 AM its tiring but the managers are amazing and really push you to do your best for a great company."
good,"Employees at Costco are paid a living wage ($13/hour to start) and full-timers and some part-timers are provided with cheap, quality medical insurance.  (There are two levels of part time; 25+ hours/week is given medical, dental, and 401k benefits; 14-19 hours/week is not benefit-eligible.)  The management structure is a little hierarchical, but my immediate supervisors have always been excellent managers.  They work with me so I work with them - - but that's probably key anywhere.  Raises are given per so many hours - like every 1000 hours worked, you go up another step.  So if you're doing 40 hours/week, you get that raise twice as fast as if you're doing 20 hours/week.  I am part time with benefits and stay under 30 hours/week, which I prefer."
good,fast paced learned a lot in my short time there. my manger was great willing to help nice workplace .hardest part trying to remember everything. i loved working outside
good,Love this company. That aren't off pay wasn't great not to mention the great people you work with I love Costco even have friends and family a Costco card
good,"The only reason I left is due to a car accident not being able to handle the concrete floor any longer. "
good,"I worked as a Night Merchandiser for 3.5 years working 4am-10:30am and it was a fantastic job. Overall, the job was pretty easy as long as you set a pace and were able to stock efficiently. The coworkers were great to work with. Management is very understanding and they are willing to work with you as long as you do your job. This is an entry level position and Costco only performs internal hires, so you are able to advance; it just depends on whether or not there is an opening. If you are slow or not completing your job without assistance you will receive counseling from your manager and if you still don't improve you can be let go or moved to a different department. The hours can be rough and your sleep schedule will be affected. I was a student while working here and my manager was great about working with my school schedule. The company was ""strict"" with OT, but if there was a lot of work to be done management would have you come in early or stay late. When I worked there after 3 months you were eligible for benefits and after a year you earned vacation and paid sick days."
good,I really enjoyed working here for the past 12 years. I started at the call center then worked as an inventory control specialist and worked my way up. I left because I relocated.
good,I loved my job at Costco and wish I would have never had to quit. It was an amazing work environment with amazing benefits. Everyone was so kind and so caring.
good,"Costco is all about working from the ground up. A person who starts off in the front-end could easily climb the ranks as they accumulate knowledge from different departments. The more you know, the better candidate you become to advance. Always be ready and open to new opportunities. You can also find long-lasting friendships and work relationships. The hardest part of the job is standing for hours at a time. Wear comfortable shoes always, your back will thank you later."
good,Would like to return to Costco and make a career if hired back. Very busy and love customer service. Worked in the food service area. Got along well with employees.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers who tell you how much they enjoy seeing you when they come in and helping them. Would have loved to work on the register line or in the clothing area. This was a temp job and I knew that from the start.
good,I enjoyed going to work and being around my co-workers. The work is fast paced on busy days but still have the chance to relax when its slow and catch a breath.
good,"A typical day at work included working on the front-end, stocking shelves, and working with cash in the vault. I enjoyed working with management, and the overall culture was good. They had an incredible benefits package which was very helpful for the staff."
good,Worked here for over 25 years. Love the people.  Love the job. Ive learned so much as an employee at costco. The benifits and rewards are well worth the hours put in
good,"I really enjoyed working at Costco, but unfortunately I was seasonal and had to be let go at the end of the season. I hope to get hired back on permanently. I was getting paid $13/hour and would get a min of 24 hours a week. Working here has by far been the best job experience I've had."
good,Everyone is very Professional and friendly. It is like a big family and they are so open to all opinions. I highly suggest this job to everyone who wants a job who cares about your personal idea.
good,As long as your doing your job its a perfect place. some member can really get on your nerves but that's part and parcel. The pay scale is a little scary at first and it difficult to get in full-time but as long as your committed and apply yourself it will be ok.
good,"Overall experience was great. I will defenitely work there again. There's always something to do, so it is always a fast paced enviroment, specially on holidays."
good,"My store was one of the busiest in Washington, so at times it was quite stressful. with that being said management is fantastic and there are lots of places to move up, you just need to be willing to work hard to get there."
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Many departments to work in, and great benefits. There is also an excellent salary and room for growth coupled with experience."
good,"Costco is a wonderful place to work! My first job was here, the company taught me everything I know today. Knowing you can provide and take care of your people is a great feeling and that's what Costco did for me!"
good,"I enjoy working here, the pay is good and the management are friendly. The benefits are amazing and covers almost everything I need and working here does get me a free membership. The turnover right is low as well."
good,"Overall, Costco is a wonderful place to work at. Employees are paid a fair wage, the benefits are great, and the potential to move up in the company is always there."
good,The company is great especially if you are a student or young adult. The flexibility of the job was an added bonus so I was able to work seasonal/part time during my school year and was bumped to full time during summer when I was off and could make extra money. They mostly promote within the company so you can start off as entry level and move up the ranks if you're a hard-working and dedicated employee. You get a free membership and can add two family members or friends to your account as well.
good,"I'll never leave, been with company for 12 years since I was in high school. Pay is outstanding and benefits are top line. I think its a good place to work. Most people never leave the company once hired."
good,"Every work day was different, lots of problem solving, positive work environment, encouraging management staff, great benefits and lots of opportunities."
good,It is always busy and you meet a lot of regulars but as long as your able to multitask and work at a quick pace you are guaranteed to keep 40+ hours. As long as you make it obvious to your management that you actually do work you wont be looked at as a loose end.
good,Costco Is a great place to work. This is mostly due to features like high pay and amazing benefits that are included for all positions. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a company with tons of opportunity.
good,"Handling sales transactions, which may include operating cash registers or working on the floor, making sure the department was well in tacked. Along with greeting every customer with enthusiasm and energy. Being knowledgeable about the benefits and uses of each product"
good,"I loved working at Costco. I did not want to leave there but it was hard after a while working to jobs. Costco was a great place to work, I would recommend it to everyone"
good,"It was fun and the customers were so nice,  i learned a lot about the retail business.  The management were fun and fair. The culture was fun and exciting.  The job was easy, they once called me to work in the kitchen and that's something that took a little time to learn.  They kept the kitchen spotless!  I really enjoyed all the employees I worked with."
good,"Learned a lot about business and what goes into running a business. The culture of Costco is awesome. I love working in a small department, not sure I would enjoy working anywhere sees though."
good,Great job! Flexible work schedule off every federal holiday close early on weekends. Very easy to work with management. Easy to do job. Weekends keep you busy.
good,Its a great a company to work for. But the Costco i was working at only had 4 positions available Hired among 60 seasonal employees were competing for the opening.
good,"Based on the different departments, Costco in most of them is a fast and busy work. Some departments are really easy other ones are busy. The pay rate at entry level is the same to everyone no matter the department that you start.  "
good,Too many benefits and positive attributes to remember at this point. it is a very open ended job you can start as a cashier and end up as a board member also the retirement plans seemed awesome. easy work as long as you can deal with customers.
good,"Costco is easily the best retail, or basic job (meaning only high school education) out there period.  Great benefits, great starting pay, yearly raises.  You are paid time and a half every weekend. So if you make $11 mon-fri,  you make $16.50 sat and or sunday. Enough said."
good,"I loved working at Costco Wholesale, I was only a Temp, but i learned so much at the company within less than 6 months. "
good,"Very good job to have if you are dedicated, willing to relocated, a team player, and able to work in a fast paced environment. Also make sure you are patient."
good,"Très bon environnement de travail les employés sont tellement gentils , salaires compétitifs , très bons avantages sociaux . Si vous n’aimez pas le service à la clientèle , le stress et travailler selon des horaires très variables ( jours,soirs , fins de semaines et journées fériées) ce n’est pas un emploi pour vous , sinon c’est parfait , beaucoup d’apprentissage , et c’est un emploi qui vous fera grandir tout au long de votre carrière ."
good,"This job was the best job I have ever worked. Sometimes the managers could be too intense, but overall would help you learn what you'd need to do to keep your job intact."
good,The atmosphere and coworkers are fantastic.  The management is superb and the managers/supervisors listen to what you say.  Coworkers are friendly and respectful.
good,"-fast-pace, hardly ever a down time"
good,I've worked at Costco for neary three years. I've had my ups and downs but for the most part I enjoy my time at Costco. Great benefits and a great company to work for.
good,The employees are all friendly and have energy to work. Fast paced which is good in a retail store. The hours are great and worked with your school hours
good,"Great place to work, great people to work with. Plan to join the team again. This is a career move, had to leave due to my divorce. Everything is better and the divorce is final so I can get back and join the team again."
good,"Bakery is very busy which I like, I learned everything I could in the minimal time I was there. The management is approachable, available, and dedicated to their job. The staff is friendly and helpful. This was the best job, by far, that I have ever held."
good,"No complaints, good place to start and grow a career. management is helpful, the work is interesting and growth is tremendous. "
good,"Costco is a great place to work, with helpful supervisors and managers. They are very helpful when it comes to students, and pay very well for a job that does not require a degree."
good,"They pay very well for the industry. Benefits are easily the highest in the industry..some locations are union."
good,"Get in at 6:00 and then help customers till the store closes. Then each employee would get assigned an store lane, that must be restocked and straighten to appeal to the customers. Once your done your lane you would go help someone else."
good,"Fast paced, and at times stressful keeping up with the volume of customers.  Managers were helpful and coworkers were great to work with. Overall, a good place to work."
good,The eight years I was there I loved the members friendly and fun environment once in a while you had rude people but that everywhere. The one thing I didn't like was the Managers there was based on favoritism and the male managers always sexually harassed the female young employees.
good,"Costco is a wonderful place to work. Luckily, everyone at my warehouse was kind and understanding for the most part. I would highly recommend this job to anyone looking for good benefits and pay. They never overwork you and they take care of their employees."
good,"Costco is a great company to work at especially if you are a student, it has flexible hours and good salary."
good,Costco offers many great benefits to working there it was fun and fast paced. Great work culture and people always room for advancement. Most the employees have been there along time they work with you school schedule and your home life. Very understanding people.
good,"The work Environment is very friendly. For people that like to work is good place. I was part time and i had all the benefits, health, dental and vision."
good,My time spent at costco introduced me to some of the best friends I have today and being able to work with them everyday under very good management made my day to day shifts go by quickly. I felt as I was treated very well by all my coworkers and even the members that came there to shop.
good,"This is a good place to work if you are not pursuing a career that requires you to go to a university. The hours are cut throat and that will get in the way of everything. If you don’t go to school and are looking to make money and survive then this is perfect since it comes with a ton of benefits. For students, the benefits don’t matter. For example I go to the U of M and health insurance is already paid through my tuition so the Costco health insurance isn’t useful for me but it will for someone else."
good,"On my reviews I always got good ratings, I liked my job there. I left because of the fact that I wanted to move quickly to California. Transfer can be long didn't want to wait but I now realize I should have waited because have not been hired even with recommendation from my former Manager and from a good friend and co-worker who is now a AVP of good for Kirkland signature. I was a good worker always finished my work in time and always looked for things to do. Helped others when they needed help. I was always striving to do good in all aspects of the job."
good,"Anyone looking for a career in the retail world, or just a part time job to make some extra cash, Costco is a phenomenal place to work. You are paid 1.5 on Sundays, get vacation and sick time based on hours worked during the year, and raises are based on hours worked. My location does a GREAT job with accommodating college students. In my three years working for the company, I have seen many people advance quickly. Some becoming a supervisor in a year's time."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs to date. The work could be fast-paced and stressful at times, but that's just retail for you. The people are awesome and the pay was pretty good, especially starting out!"

good,"I learned how to be responsible."
good,"A typical day at work is fast pace, efficiency is a must. With it being a wholesale you we have members of all sorts coming to buy for business, their own personal use or even recreational and having happy members is a high expectancy at Costco, for employees. We need members satisfied and we do anything to make their visit easy and memorable so that they come back because they pay for our service. Enjoyable part of the job is that what ever department you work in that all employees are helpful to one another. Also from time to time the warehouse gives back to all employees for good work performance and excelling in sales. Hardest part of the job is to prepare for when ROM come to the buildings to make sure we are maintain and trying to excel in Costco standards."
good,"Very good job with many chances for promotion and you can always relocate with the company. Theres also many different job titles there that if you dont like your current job, you can always apply for a different department"
good,"Great warehouse to work for every one is super helpful, great opportunities although there may be a lot of rushes you get used to it! You can keep on growing in that company if your hungry to grow ."
good,Company cares about employees. How to advance within the company is very clearly laid out. Hires internally before externally. Great company culture. Would have continued with this company if it was not for school conflicting with ability to do so.
good,"Excellent company.  Look after the staff just hours are unsuitable for family life.     Great bunch of people  great.benefits such as,life insurance.   Bonuses and optical vouchers towards your glasses.  Americans do know,how to treat threr staff"
good,"Definitely the place you want to work at all your life. It is a place if you want to move up in the company fast and has great benefits. After your 3 months with Costco you receive 3 free Costco cards for you and your family, they never have to pay again."
good,"Gran aprendizaje en el ramo del retail,buen ambiente de trabajo,buenas prestaciones,capacitación constante,enfoque y enseñanza del servicio al socio."

I love it. being busy is what I enjoy and helping the customers find their items or go get what they forgot while they are checking out.
good,Typical day at work would consist of seeing what is left to finish for the night as closer. Cooking chickens and making sure doesnt run out and cleaning deli department. Very flexible work environment with great coworkers and managers.
good,Nothing but good things to say about Costco. I am still a member and enjoyed my time there. The only reason I left was lack of opportunity in my degree field locally.
good,This is a very competitive job. Everyone is trying to advanced themselves to a higher position. the job itself it enjoyable once you get used to it. the people you work with look out for you and try to help when able to.
good,It's a fun job. Somewhere u can grow nd have a career. Great benefits. Awesome management. Nd very helpful employees. We take our members very serious and always try to give them the best service.
good,There is a running joke that once you get hired on you will be there for life. It is nearly impossible to get fired and there are plenty of job opportunities and transfers throughout warehouses.
good,"great place to work!!! great pay, and great people. I loved the benefits and if I did not have to leave due to personal issues I would have loved to manage"
good,"There are many departments to work in. The opportunity to move up in ranks is great. Costco promotes within, giving employees a sense of pride in their work. The people who work for Costco wholesale are usually there for the long haul."
good,"I only worked at costco as a seasonal employee and I loved every minute of it, the pay was amazing and even more so on Sundays. "
good,"I loved working at Costco, it was fun and you are always busy. I worked in most of the departments to pick up hours. Pay is determined on hours worked. Management was not pleasant."
good,"Costco was a great employer, and I would suggest them to anyone. Flexibility for working hours is a must. Even the training was excellent and there was always someone to help."

good,"Costco is an amazing company to work for that loves to promote from within. Average employee gets 35 hours a week and is easily able to pick up hours if needed. Every department is ran completely different with their own unique management style. Fun work place, everyone knows everyone so it is easy to make friends and work well with others. Hardest part of the job would be having to deal with higher authority because every manager, supervisor or ancillary has their own rules, vision and direction. most enjoyable part is working for a company that takes care of their employees through BBQ's, providing fresh produce to encourage healthy eating, work events and other things of that matter."
good,"Morning stocker was fast pace and time flew bye. I learned pride in merchandising and right items in the right place at the right time. We were very team based, and depended on one another. Hardest part was doing everything we needed to do in the amount of time we had. Most enjoyable was being able to look back at the work we produced at making it picture ready."
good,I worked part time at Costco and loved everything about it. Especially the overtime pay every Sunday! Co workers were awesome too... only did inventory once a year and they feed you!

good,"awesome benefits..good work life balance &many more"
good,"Un buen lugar para trabajar"
good,"Great work environment, however inexperienced assistant general management led to poor overall shop morale. Which is really a training system flaw, 3 assistant general managers rotate department responsibilities to learn the entire store; however they are pretty much given trial by fire and no preparation before rotation."
good,"great place to work, great pay, management benefits. goleta location is overall the best work place. GREAT hours everyone works together, if you see an opening i highly recomend giving it a shot at applying, you will not regret it."

good,"Great co workers, excellent benefits."
good,Best department to work in at my warehouse. Manager is hard working and very respectful. Can't say the same for other departments. A lot of supervisors and managers are rude.
good,I loved working here and it was a real shame that it was only for the season. I would come back in a heart beat! Everyone there was very nice to me and helped me learn what I needed to. Customers were very nice as well.

The management understands that life happens sometimes and they're there to help you through it if needed.  "
good,Costco Wholesale was extremely welcoming as a new employee. Shift schedules are posted long in advance and my supervisors are understanding and approachable. I feel very lucky to have had the privilege to work alongside so many kind and friendly people.
good,Teams go the extra mile to take of the customers. The employment procedures are great for students and family alike. The compensation package for long term employees is very good.
good,"The company was a wonderful place to work. They provided more than adequate training, compensation, benefits, and paid time off. The culture was always positive."
good,Learned a lot in running and operating a wholesale warehouse.  Great People and opportunities.  Management can be a little better.
good,"When you arrive you must check in with a supervisor to be told what your task will be, when told you keep yourself busy never just lounge around. Usually you will always be stopped by a guest always give them your time and attention. The way everything was setup always ran smoothly with the company, it was a very fast paced environment. They always liked things clean and in place and if you say something out of place ALWAYS put it back. My coworkers were beyond friendly and very helpful."

good,the work experience that i acquire or learn from my previous job makes me more stronger person. I'm ready to a new experience to tackle and place to work.
good,"Making sure there's enough chicken to go around. Plenty of responsibilities on time and staying on task with what needs to be done. Very diverse environment which is nice to see, always taking care of the employees no matter what. Open door policy which is very beneficial. Hardest part of the job, is sometimes the lack of communication which in return can mess up someones routine through the night and slow them down on tasks that have already been planned for. I do however love all my members and making sure all questions are answered whether I know them or not, I'll be sure to find the answer. Getting to know new people as well as the friendly employees I know and care about now."

good,"A typical day at work looked like talking to customers, answering questions and collecting shopping carts. I learned how to stay focused, spacial reasoning, and time management. The workplace was not my favorite because I felt disposable. They have so many employees. That was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable was that they were good to their employees. I just didnt feel useful with the specific responsibilities that I was given."

good,"Highly desirable seasonal position with good wages and awesome work environment. This position requires you to be relatively fit and occasionally lift items in excess of 50 pounds. This company rarely hires outside of the holiday season due to low employee turn over. Once you are in the door, you are in competition with other seasonal employees for the one or two positions that open up after the holiday season."

Management were strict but understandable and pleasant. The hardest part of the job mostly was standing or short periods where there was nothing to be done as time seemed to move quite slow. Enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the diverse members of Costco
good,"Costco has the best benefits in the retails. The working environment is friendly. Coworkers are nice, and management team has open door policy."
good,If i wasn't seasonal then I would be full time but it was the best job i could have ever worked. Even the part time employees get some benefits. Every staff member is extremely nice. Even the Supervisors are extremely pleasant to work for.

I was a hard worker as I believe their records will show. I learn various position. Such as cashiering, stocking, customer relations, security, light maintenance, inventory and tried my best to do the best job that I was capable of. I lost 40 pds the first two months that I work there, which was fine with me as you do a lot of walking.  If I was younger, I wouldn't mind working for them again."
good,"I learned a lot here. There was always work to do, good teamwork. There were several opportunities to learn new things to do around the warehouse, and to move up. They took care of you especially if you did a good job."

good,"A typical day at work at Costco Wholesale over a 20 year period consisted of customer service, greeting customers, assisting members at the Membership Counter, Cashier, Front End Supervisor, and Inventory Auditor. During the years at Costco I worked very closely with managers and supervisors of different departments who assisted me whenever needed. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers from management to cashiers, and door greeters. During my time working with Costco I did not find it hard at all, I enjoyed working with the company. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the opportunity to work my way up the within the company allowing me to learn new things."
good,"a fantastic place to work! never any drama, and when any arises, it is quickly dealt with and handled VERY well. Pay is outstanding, and hours are consistent. Because you have to have a membership to shop there, members are much ore friendly than those at a convenience store pharmacy."
good,"Beaucoup d'opportunité d'avancement, équipe dynamique"
good,"Es una empresa en la cual se inculca la cultura del trabajo tanto de manera motivacional como de forma directiva."
good,Costco Wholesale is a company where the member is truly the center of all decisions and the company ensures this by treating their employees very well.  Working at a high traffic location has taught me how to keep a level head in times of panic as well as the opportunity to learn multiple different job areas.
good,"Answering phone calls sounds easy, but its different when you're taking in complaints, or trying to help an upset customer out. Although the customers can sometimes be difficult to deal with, the people surrounding you make the job well worth it."

good,"Awesome company to work for."
good,I very much enjoyed my time working at Costco.  The environment is mostly positive and productive.  As with any company there are issue but over all a great place to work.
good,"This is a great company to work for when you are 18, but if you are older it's harder to work for the company. They promote based on seniority so if you are older and have management experience it doesn't matter because they will promote everyone that is more senior than you first so it can be a little frustrating."
good,i would be taking passport picture and then print them there picture and refill your ink and send out there vhs to dvd to yes videos
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday. There is never any confusion as to what you were going to be doing that day because management planned the tasks prior to the shift start. My coworkers were cold and rude at first, but once I had been there a while they warmed up to me. The hardest part of the job was when I was assigned to wrap pallets and unload by hand. The most enjoyable part of my job was that the raises were based off of clocked hours not performance. One thing i really did not like was the favoritism. One employee in particular never did any work, talked all shift, and spent 30 plus minutes in the bathroom after every shift and he never received any disciplinary action because of his relation to the manager."
good,"Great workplace, takes good care of employees.Treats you as family. Wont find a better place to work. Co-workers all driven to same results."

good,"Working for Costco has been great, fun work environments, great pay and benefits. Great opportunities to grow within the company."
good,"Drove forklift putting away product everyday"
good,Great for what it is. The company is fantastic and there are a lot of benefits. Pay is higher than any other place where you'd do the same thing. The management at my location was spotty. The best way to move up is to start at a brand new store. When you work at an established store you have to build seniority which can take years.
good,I loved working for Costco! I would go back in a heart beat. The only reason I left such a great job is because I couldn't land a full time position. Costco goes by seniority and I was very new to the company. Plans to go back may be in my future if the right opportunity arises.

good,"a typical day at work just consist in receiving merchandise and unloading the truck, making sure that all the items were displayed at the right place and at the right time, making sure that customers were taken care of. This job helped me to become more independent, also it made me develop my leadership skills since i had to train new employee, also i made me discover my real potential since i had some challenges everyday. the management team was really good but sometimes, i had some arguments with managers just in order to improve our job. co-workers were great because we worked as a team and everyone was always wiling to help. helping customers everyday and making sure that they got what they looked for was my biggest satisfaction and the most enjoyable part of my job"
good,Fun people to work with. great work ethics and great atmosphere.
good,Work with the forklift loading and unloading trucks .. oranicing pallets and merchandise ..
good,"Constant learning of new departments. Our managers all know us by name and that means a lot because it makes us feel important."
good,"I clock in and then get straight to work. I normally work outside nowadays doing cart crew. When I am inside my typical duty is assisting for the cashier. I get boxes, box the groceries, clean my area, and help all the members unload their carts. Sometimes I cashier....this is where I ring up the items, answer any questions and hand them their receipt. Sometimes I am assigned different areas of the store because they need extra help. "
good,"checar entrada"
good,"Awesome company to work with! I love working for Costco! Meet and  greet club members, inform them about the product I am demonstrating and encourage sales. Give away free samples and coupons to interested parties."

good,"Yo entre a costco sin experiencia alguna en area de atencion a clientes, afortunadamente los compañeros que tenia ya tenian experiencia por lo tanto aprendi mucho de ellos podiendo ser yo quien ahora pudiera enseñar a otros, Los dias mas dificiles era cuando la bodega estaba llena ya que la cantidad de empleados no era suficiente para tanta clientela entonces se nos solicitaba estar no solo en nuestros puestos si no en otras areas y la verdad era muy cansado ya que uno no paraba hasta terminar su turno si no es que te pedian un poco mas de tiempo, lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es que costco es una familia y como tal eres parte de ella."
good,"A typical day at work is busy and involves a lot of customer interaction. It definitely teaches you how to work in a dynamic environment with ever changing customer needs. The management seems to be efficient coming in with great experience."
good,"At Costco you are guaranteed breaks and lunches. Any workday lasting under 5 hours you get a paid 15 minute break. Any workday over 5 hours you get a lunch and a paid 15 minute break. Any workday over 7 hours you get a lunch and two 15 minute breaks. Part-time employees are awarded benefits after their 90-day probationary period.

good,"- Worked in the food court where I would prepare and serve food to the customers.  I would also operate the cash register and help clean everything in preparation for the following day."
good,"I enjoy working at Costco, I have met amazing people there and I have nothing bad to say about the company. They care about their employees and treat everyone with respect. Management is very sweet and although some employees can be a little temperamental, the never seize in showing me how sweet they are. I have learned a lot about team work here which I would have to say goes along with the most exciting and enjoyable part of my job which is meeting new people as well as working with the great people I constantly have the privilege of being around. Although, as every great thing has its nicks, I would have to say that sometimes people come in with different attitudes and mindsets and tend to offset the environment just a little so breaking past that point even though it is seldom the times it must be done, it still creates a bit of tension every now and again. However, other than that I love Costco as a company and the people I  am pleased to work with."
good,"Costco is a great place to work. The pay is good, the benefits are great and you get to meet many different people. The everyday tasks are reasonable. The only gripe would be with the management. Most of the time it seems like they don't know what they're doing and seems like they're guessing with how to run the company."
good,"Un dia tipico en Costco es normal, ya que siempre esta lleno de clientes y trabajas con mucha presion y armonia."
good,Working at Costco was very fun. It was only seasonal but I learned many different skills. My co-workers were all very nice and super helpful.
good,"I enjoyed working for Costco, not only was there always a new task to be completed I got to experience different departments throughout the store. Primarily being Front End Assistant I helped my cashier with whatever they might need, from searching for a product at a customer's request, to returning a mistakenly grabbed item. I also got to work in the bakery and food court preparing and serving great quality food to customers. I also was allowed to work as a cart pusher and a Stocker, overall giving me a wide experience throughout the store."
good,I enjoyed working for Costco Wholesale. They treat their employees like family and make sure that all the tools are provided to get the job done.
good,It was a really good Job!!  Good advancement and fast paced.  what I like most was the pace and you never got board with the work.  I feel that they treated you fairly

good,"A typical day while working at Costco Wholesale would be to make sure everything was in stock, answer phones, maintain machinery, customer service, print photos, develop photos, being able to multitask, and cashier duties. The hardest part of my job was trying to make sure none of the machines went down or malfunctioned. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the faces on my customers with their finished product. Management was very understanding during the duration of my training period at Costco. I loved being challenged! I received employee of the month, I received gas technician training, photo technician, and photo engineering certificates while there. The absolute best part was pushing myself to do more and be the best I could be for Costco Wholesale and its customers!"
good,This is an excellent company to begin a career for any young person looking for a stable job that will work around a school schedule and promotes from within.
good,A typical day at work is fairly easy but stressful. You have to learn to how to multi-task when dealing with members and each transactions. The co-workers there are friendly and makes the day goes by easier. They try to reveal some of the stress away from the workplace. The hardest part of the job is to deal with angry/grumpy members. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the members come out with a smile.
good,"I enjoy working at Costco and do not have any intentions of leaving this position.  They provide a clean and friendly work environment, have a wonderful benefit package, and the hours I work enable me to work a much needed second job."
good,"Hard working woman, always willing to take on new things, not afraid to get dirty, quick on my feet, learn very quick, have positive attitude. My typical day at work is to make sure all my goals are done on time, help out or assist any co-workers or managers. I love seeing happy faces and making people smile."
good,"A typical day at work at COSTCO consists of multiple projects/duties being distributed and delegated to various employees of different departments. It is a warehouse environment so there is a lot of distraction and commotion that you have to get through. Clear communication with your supervisors/managers and co-workers is essential to succeed in this workplace. Managers are very strict and results driven, they set and expect a very high level of performance from their employees. Co-workers for the most part are helpful and fun to work with, however there is a sense of disconnect you may experience from some of the more seasoned/experienced employees. The hardest part of the job is making people happy…because they invoke the 'above and beyond' attitude, it often feels as if it's impossible to please supervisors/managers fully. The best part of the job is the great pay scale and benefits package. Working on a Sunday will bank you time and a half, and you get a free membership for being employed there."
good,"I worked all day long, barely had the chance to see my children. I worked in multiple departments and learned everything I could. I left to find a job so that I can spend more time with my children."

good,Awesome company to work for.  Great opportunities and awesome people to work with.

They give cross training time to time for employees to be able to experience and learn in different departments. The managers are nice and approachable. Everybody gets along and very friendly with each other.
good,"costco call center is an awesome place to work. "
good,Working as a front end assistant allowed me to gain skills in performing as a fast and efficient employee while providing courteous customer service. The front end assistant and cashier work together in maintaining the flow of the customer lines and retail accuracy. I learned to use good posture and proper ergonomic positioning when lifting and transferring heavy merchandise. The hardest part of the job was staying on your feet for many hours. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and working with staff members that share the same hardworking and goal-oriented mindset.
good,"you work hard"
good,Culture  has an attitude of gratitude. You work hard and treated well by everyone.
good,"Love working at Costco. Management needs to improve, but overall great company to work for, with great benefits."
good,"Most of the people around you enjoy their job. Costco provides quite a bit of job security as long as you pass your probation period with a great record.  The top off pay is not so great unless you reach a high position such as manager or greater.  One bad thing about Costco is that they tend to advance people based on seniority as opposed to strictly skill based.  For some people this may be great, but if you are trying to quickly work your way to the top and are confident you can do so at many companies, this may not be your best bet.  Overall I give it an excellent rating because the company really does seem to take care of you."
good,"No real complaints here. Great place to work, high paced enviroment, with excellent pay and benefits. Good opportunities to move up within the company, assuming you are able to come to work everyday giving it 100%."
good,I enjoyed going to work there at Costco. Management was helpful and tried to make every employee and team member (customer) happy. The knowledge employees have about the company and the system Costco runs is why the company is so successful. The training process is good. Most co-workers were great. Of course your going to run into certain employees that you have to learn to deal with. I enjoyed the free BBQ they would have. I enjoyed the Christmas party they do every year. I enjoyed the fun enviornment there in St. George Costco.
good,Customer Service Representative
good,"Loved my time here even though it was only seasonal. The only company I have worked for where a vast majority actually enjoyed working there. Great Mgmt, great culture, great values, great pay."
good,.A very fast enviroment time goes by quickly. I worked in alot of different departments and gained more work experience. The managers are very repectable and try to work with the employees.Coworkers are very professional. Hardest part of job is trying to keep all your members happy which I did very well. Working with the public I love to be in large crowds and surrounded by people.
good,"I love working in Costco, but the problem is my Days Off i like weekends off"
good,"Costco is a nice place to work, I worked a seasonal position.I worked in the Bakery."
good,"It was one of my best experiences, very fun place to work, tough, hardworking individuals."
good,A typical day for me was checking the company's goals and looking at how close/far we were from them.
good,"Typical day at work is 5 to 8 hours long with frequent and flexible breaks. I learned how to work in teams, motivate coworkers and be a driver of a team. Management was very opened to schedule changes due to my full time school schedule. I can not recall a hard part of the job. Costco is well organized company smoothly ran teams and positive attitude and encouraged communication made it enjoyable to work. Working with different personalities made me learn more about myself and grow in as a professional and individual."
good,"Most shifts are 5 hours, which is great, the job is physically demanding and very good for weight loss. The hardest part, is the running to the back of the warehouse because the customer is waiting for you. One great aspect is the $4 an hour premium for working on Sundays. The co-workers are helpful and informative and management are always available"
good,"Good Company, good benefits. Working with the public was the best part of the job."
good,"Coscto was a good job. I was a merchandizer, so I put things on the shelves. It fun. I only worked with a few people at a time but i liked it like that. My coworkers were mostly nice and the managers were cool.. I wish I didnt loose this job."
good,Coming to work in a reliable transportion clean an dressed professional ready to work with a friendly attitude .
good,"Les journées au Costco sont très chargées. Il y a des clients tout le temps, donc on travaille sous pression constamment. Selon l'achalandage, on peut changer de tâches en cours de journées. Travail quand même difficile physiquement, mais certaines mesure de sécurité sont prises en compte. Après la fermeture du magasin, on fait des travaux plus léger de rangement. Avantages: le salaire est très bon (déposer directement) et on à la carte de membre gratuitement. On a plusieurs formations de sécurité et d'efficacité. On nous met la pression pour promouvoir les services de l'entreprise. Les règlements strictes de l'établissement rend parfois les clients désagréables, mais on garde le sourire et on règle le problème."
good,Great Benefits and steady hours in merchandising department but starting lean hour in front-end so a shift in labor to compensate.
good,there's a lot you can learn from working at a place like this. it was a great learning experience.
good,Empresa ejemplar para iniciación y por supuesto desarrollo a largo plazo. La dirección general está principalmente enfocada en el recurso humano así como en la competitividad del negocio. Mejora continua así como preocupación principal en la atención y servicio a clientes.
good,Enjoyed the environment and the customers. The managers were a little lazy and did not help as much as you think. I would work their again if there was a different managing team.
good,"Costco is a great place to work with tons of employee benefits. Free Executive membership when you work more than 90 days that comes with a 2% refund once a year. Great medical, vision, and dental benefits with 401k. You can get free glasses with current prescription (up to $150 total) from the optical department at work with your benefit package. You are guarenteed raises once you have reached different numbers of hours worked for the company. It is a great place to work but you are on your own a lot and have to ask lots of questions."

good,It is a great place to work with amazing benefits. You get raises every six months if you are full time. I've really enjoyed my time at Costco and highly recommend working for them. It took me a few times of applying to get an interview so don't get discouraged.

good,Flexible hours and decent pay helped me get through school. I worked there as a stocker having many responsibilities and was trusted to carry out different tasks
good,great place to work - easy training - lots of opportunity - easy distance to travel to work - lots of diversity - various assignments - the hardest part of the job was when times were slow and the fact that not everyone had an opportunity to have weekends off. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with other staff.
good,"My typical day at work was stocking and straightening the pallets for customer satisfaction. I learned quite a bit from my co-workers and managers. For one, how to correct pushcarts when they needed people outside. My managers are really cool about what we do. Would allow listening to music when stocking in the morning which is a plus.

The trainings and information they give you about your job and how the company is doing as a whole is fantastic. There are some management issues but who doesnt have that.

There are tons of opportunities to grow and move up.

good,"I work on the front end, so my shifts vary day by day. Overall, the work environment is great. My boss, supervisors, and co-workers are all great people. The starting pay is really good, and accumulates over time the longer you work there. As for my personal experience, I recently finished my Master's Degree, and both before and throughout that time, everyone at my work place has been very supportive and encouraging. Unlike other retail jobs, Costco values their employees whether they have worked there for years or if they are there for the short term while seeking a higher learning degree. When they say they value their employees, they actually mean that. I can't say that about other retail jobs. Costco truly stands out above the rest when it comes to taking care of their employees."
good,Costco is one of the best employers around. I don’t think there is a bad job in that place. The people you work with become a team and truly a family. They have great benefits and strive to take care of their employees.
good,"Note: everyone starts in a part time position and can work their way up from there. No medical benefits or time off until you pass your 90 day probation period! The members can be aggravating and the job itself can be very physically demanding and stressful, but your coworkers and most managers definitely make it worth it. Sunday’s always include time and a half so try to pick up Sunday shifts! Lots of room for personal growth and opportunities for advancement!"
good,In the company employees and mangers seem to be more aware of what they're doing. The company has many opportunities to be promoted or to move to another department if wanted. All that is required is a little motivation and initiative.
good,I worked part time in the tire installation center. Most of my day was spent reparing old tires and installing new tires. The hardest part of the job involved installing low profile tires due to it being stiff. The culture was very fun and close knit.
good,Just be able to work with all personalities and get along with everyone and you should be fine.  Do your best and produce great work.  Costco has a great benefits package and has raises after so many hours working. It is advised to work as much as possible to get quicker raises.

Management is very good with making sure the growth of the employees are tend to and I made sure of it as well."

Each employee is treated like a true asset. My department (bakery) was small and you could tell that they were a close knit group of people, but they still welcomed me and showed me little tricks to make every day tasks more  efficient and simple. Overall a WONDERFUL place to work!!"
good,"Helpful and friendly employees in every department.  Every employee willing to help each other and be a team.  "
good,"for a work place that only required a high school diploma or ged, they paid well, gave full time benefits for part time employees and moving up was incredibly easy. I started as a cart pusher and within six months i was a forklift driver."
good,I enjoyed my employment with Costco. Wish I still worked for them. Sucks I had to relocate on a short notice. There are many positions you can choose to do for work.  The company is always trying to promote its workers if the employee has the desire to change position or take on a more responsible role such as supervisisupervisor or management.
good,"Great place to work, in the two years that i have been there i have learned a lot and advanced in the company with little to no trouble. Great management and benefits."
good,Love working at Costco great people and everyone takes pride in their work. Very demanding and fast paced and must have a great personality to work here.
good,"I was hired during the holiday season around October or November. Being that I was a seasonal employee they had me move around a lot of different areas of the store. I have restaurant experience so I was placed in the bakery for a couple of weeks, I was also physically able to move quickly and lift heavier items so I would corral the carts outside and return merchandise back to the floor."
good,"When you walk in the door you see people names badges say they have been working there for years, there is a reason. There are so many benefits to working for Costco, and they help you however they can."
good,People usually start in a seasonal role but working hard can get you a spot permanently. Active and physically demanding job. Great people to work with at the stores.
good,"During my time at Costco Wholesale I gave out food samples. while demonstrating  nutrition and pricing  information. The work culture involves worker morale and customer satisfaction. A typical day at work is fast paced since crowds of people approach our demo tables everyday. There is lots of responsibility following WHIMIS and  Health and food regulations when new to the job. Management is very organized with our work schedules."
good,"Costco is a great company to work for ,the only reason I left was to purchase my own health club ,and  become a personal trainer which had always been a dream of mine"
good,Very good company to work for as they like to get people in and out as fast and courteous as possible. Somedays close early on the employee side to cut down on costs.
good,I learned to work in small groups and interact with a lot of customers. Time would fly by because of the heavy work load. I specially appreciated the overtime pay on weekends.
good,I cannot express enough how much I am happy to work for his company were all employees are treated fairly and they pay one of the highest salaries in the industry.

good,costco is very good place to work and very beneficial with pay roll and insurance. i will reapply since my job was only seasonal. glad to know the basics
good,"The day starts when they slide that big door up.  As the members slipped through our counter was always first on their list.  Helping them with uploading their photos, picking up photos or just giving technical advice to accomplish what they need.  We were very lucky in our department as our managers were always there to assist.  Yet they felt comfortable to leave us alone to run things.  Proper training in equipment and and services is the key to this.  The staff I worked with was great,  we had laughs but when it came down to working it was a team effort that made the days seem easy even when it was extremely busy.  Probably the hardest part of the job was mechanical failure of the equipment and trying to get product to our members as fast as possible.  I was a problem solver and loved finding the issue and fixing it.  I learned my vendors by their first name so when ordering supplies could learn how the rest of the world was doing and putting orders for our lab.  The best part of my job was one on one with the members and the people I worked with."
good,"Overall, it was a great place to work. I worked there part time until another full time job opened up for me. I got along well with the management, and I enjoyed interacting with the members. However, the fastest way to advance in the company is by moving from store to store. This was not something that I was willing to do. I'm also not the biggest fan of working retail hours, but that's just me, not a reflection of the job itself. I left on good terms and have recommended others to apply there."
good,I enjoyed the two years being there and I really feel that I learned many things by being there only such a short period of time. You can really explore all the available positions and decide for yourself where do you want to stay.
good,Is an excellent company to work for. if hired on as seasonal must be willing to work a little harder to keep position full time. works with schedule and could possibly help with school in the long run.
good,"Clean and helpful environment, I have learn many position as I move to other department. Management has a open door policy if there any issue. The hardest part is starting as part time."
good,"I bettered on customer service skills and learned to work fast paced."
good,"There is a lot of hard work in this fast paced environment. I worked seasonal so it was busier then their ""off"" season so I can only tell you that Thanksgiving until after the New Year is crazy busy."
good,"At Costco, everyone has a can-do attitude.  The customer (member) comes first. Members expect exceptional service and get it. As an assistant cashier, I support the cashier, provide backup support when the team member goes on break or is called away to handle something else, offload purchases and repack them and find / or return items to stock.  We are expected to move quickly and do everything possible to avoid delaying the customer.  I am expected to be positive, helpful, and enthusiastic about the shopping experience."
good,Costco has been great to me and my family. It is a challenging environment that hold it's employees to very high standards. Costco has prepared me to move on an seek new challenges.
good,"I loved working at Costco, warehouse was always busy so you never had much time to twiddle your thumbs. I enjoyed how they promoted their employees sharing responsibilities and helping each other. Hard work, but the environment is great."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Costco and loved learning how different warehouses operate within the same scope of procedures."
good,"While working at Costco, I was given the right amount of training that was needed. The supervisor was always present when they were needed. Although it was a past paced work place I never felt rushed."
good,Costco culture creates a family like environment. Close knit co-workers makes for an productive work day. I also believe fully in our Costco Code Of Conduct and hold it as standard expectation of all who work here
good,It's a great job with great benefits and hourly pay however you really have to have good people  Skills. Advancement is up to the employee supervisory and management staff are competent
good,"working for Costco for 6 years was definitely a good investment."
good,I'd recommend anyone to work at Costco. One of the fairest companies to work for - entry level positions are treated with very high importance from all levels of management and they have a great open door policy where the managers actually listen to everyone. All in all great place to work
good,"Working for Costco was one of the best jobs I have had.  There is no typical day at Costco as it changes continuously"
good,If you liked a fast paced environment this would be a good job for you. It also helps to be flexible you my have to work in different departments in the store.
good,My experience was great!  I worked here while going to college and got myself into their HQ my senior year of college.  Management and my team were extremely supportive.  Seems only thing that needs work is pay...you have a better chance of coming from outside the company to get a big pay bump than you do internally.
good,"Costco Wholesale is by far the best working experience in a retail environment you could possibly land. I would highly recommend this job to anyone. If you are a stocker it does involve a lot of heavy lifting, twisting, bending and it is very fast paced, but your coworkers and managers will always make sure you succeed and will help where necessary."
good,"Varied duties - keeps everything refreshing."
good,"A typical day at Costco is pretty easygoing, come in and clock in, and get to work, coworkers were helpful and the atmosphere is enjoyable. I learned customer etiquette and just being able to talk to people in general is a plus. The culture of the workplace is ideal for productivity. Due to the number of goods Costco sales and distributes from different locations in the world, it is a key role in good production and friendly customer service. The hardest part about this job is that there isn't a hard part to the job which isn't really an area of focus for me when I go into a work place, the only hard part about a job is when you get laid off, voluntary resignation, or have to relocate due to life. That is what is hard for me going into a job. However, the most enjoyable part to me is human interaction, and adding ideas to increase productivity or help the company grow as a whole."
good,This is by far the best job I've ever had. I am reapplying in September. The only reason I left was because I moved 1500 miles away. I have had the best experience
good,Great place to work good play great benifit. lots of different places to train in. friendly coworkers. great slection of products. with lots of organic stuff
good,"Very good with their employees, and the environment is great to work in. Moving from a fast food joint into costco really helped me be able to find my potential as an employee."
good,"Overall this was a wonderful temporary position. All team members were great to work with, management was very ran the warehouse in a fluent manner regardless of how busy (christmas season) is was."
good,C'est un tres bel et agreable endroit ou travailler
good,"Great place to work and i highly recommend. Good benefits, salaries, and friendly employees. However it can get quite busy and stressful when customers are unpleasant to deal with"
good,"Some of the best people I've ever worked with.  They become like a family.  Learned a lot about customer service, salesmanship, and working in a team.  The fast pace can be hard but is also invigorating.  Lots of opportunities and advancement is quick if your motivated."
good,Fast paced job makes the day go by quickly. Mostly nice fun people to work with. can be stressful with the fast pace and dealing with memebers. Pay is excellent for retail and company has a set of rules to protect employees
good,"It paid tremendously well, the only shame I had was that I was on parking lot duty. But honestly, I  would go back and put sunscreen on and keep running until I was breaking down via tears in pain. That job paid hilariously too well. It was honestly amazing, the people and the staff were nice to me, I didn't feel anger or malice. I just enjoyed their company and they did to me as well."
good,Typically given your loads first thing and then were allowed to go about your day and finish the day without interruption from management of dispatch.

good,This company was great to work for. I would recommend them to anyone. There's much room for growth as long as you're willing to put in the work. The base pay is one of the highest out there. Even part timers get the same benefits as full time employees. They have all Holiday's off and work with other job and school schedules.
good,"Productive, and inviting work environment. Always on your feet working. Busy yet productive with the constant flow of members. The workplace culture is friendly and professional.

good,"It's really fast paced no matter what day it is, but you learn a lot depending which position, they will test you and record you strengths and weaknesses. It's really competitive. But hours is inconsistent, they gave me all 2 months full time when I asked part time, because I was a full time student."
good,"I honestly can't complain about anything. There were really awful coworkers who would straight up bully you like you're in elementary school. There was some favoritism with management that was very obvious, but other than that it was a great experience! I sadly only was there for a seasonal position, but I hope to go back."
good,"la empresa es muy accesible en horarios y atención a clientes, el ambiente es muy agradable el área que a mi me agrado demasiado fue el área de cajas conversabas mas con el cliente pero tenias mucha responsabilidad, aprendi a manejar dinero, a incluso socializar mas con la gente y la responsabilidad mas a fondo"

good,Costco is a fast-paced environment that requires full time on your feet for most positions. Pay is amazing with no degree required. Everyone starts out part time but has the opportunity for advancement based on achievements. They are consistent with their disciplinary actions and praise for accomplishments.

There are many departments that one can train in and their training programs for some of the technical departments rivals the best in the nation.

good,"Overall a very good place to work it has a pretty good staff of supervisors.  They will, however, make sure every person is constantly busy and never standing around.  They are notorious for watching you from the moment you arrive until you leave which is somewhat of a downfall on their part.  I personally don't feel all of that  is necessary from a management standpoint.  "
good,- A typical day at work would be starting early in the morning at 5am and just getting straight to work with restocking the particular section that has been assigned
good,"I have been employed for many years at Costco. I have worked in several departments. My experience here has been life changing.  I make a decent living, have great benefits and love my Costco family. Thank you Costco, for making my life better, happier and stable."
good,I was a seasonal employee for the holidays and was kept on.  I have worked at several retail stores and none have been this great.  The management is very good and ready to help you when needed.  Of course the co-workers are awesome too.  Jobs are fast paced but when working time flies by.
good,Fast paced work pace with amazing coworkers and management. Many opportunities to move up in the company and frequent raises. Hardest part of the job would be the endless lines due to holidays or simply because Costco is amazing.
good,"Awesome company, worked here for almost two years but had to quit due to moving out of state and couldn't transfer due to no costco's being there in the location. Great benefits, you advance super fast if you are a hard worker and have the ambition."
good,"Great place to work with great benefits."
good,A typical day at Costco would always be assisting customers and meeting their needs. There was always something to do so I was never bored with the job. The hardest part was being on your feet all day and the extremely hectic busy weekends. The most enjoyable part was the friendly management and coworkers.
good,"Great place to work with opportunity to move around and up the chain. Good pay, raises consistently, friendly environment. It is not like working in any grocery store its is way better."
good,Super easy job. All you have to really do if follow the rules and not be lazy and youre good to go. Youre expected to have excellent customer service and be quick

good,"I did not expect to become employed by Costco at first, I was there buying Go-Pro, but I started talking to one of the Assistant Warehouse Managers and she asked if I was interested in working their. When I was hired, I found out that Costco is a family oriented working place, and everyone was always kind and respectful to one another. I thoroughly enjoyed being employed their, and I was hired as a permanent worker after showing my dedication during my seasonal employment."

good,"If you're a hard worker its easy to work your way up, co-workers genuinely want to help you get ahead and be your friend. managers and supervisors are your friends. members can be stingy but that's the world of customer service. Good pay, Good benefits and good company is what you'll get working here. it's never boring."

good,"This job is probably the best paid job at start with extremely flexible days and hours - perfect for students or people with second job, or with lots of family duties. In addition: great benefits (hard to match with anything else at entry level job)."
good,I love Costco. Great people. Great pay. Very flexible. Management was awesome. You are pushed to push upgraded memberships but the benefits of an upgraded membership does sell it by themselves. Breaks run pretty efficiently. Costco employs buyers that make sure that what is being sold in the warehouse is of quality and they also have a phenomenal return policy so they have great reasons not only to shop with them but also work for them.
good,The workers there where really friendly and they made you feel like a family they had good starting pay and the management was really nice and flexible the customer where nice and easy to work with i enjoyed this job a lot
good,"Great place to work and management is always willing to work with you. People who you work with are always friendly and outgoing, plus you get a free membership for working here."
good,"Great company to work for, excel better than other companies expectations..I was able to communicate with all customers to explain products and demonstrate it. It was a easy job just getting product prepare to explain to the customers how to warm up each food. The hardest part was trying to get work hours because other employees that were there for 13 yrs had the best work hours and the new employees had to take the worst hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving others and meeting interesting customers."
good,"La empresa se preocupa por los socios y también por los empleados, otorgan excelentes prestaciones y oportunidad de crecimiento"
good,"amazing place to work if your interested in customer service, Great fellow employees and great leadership. benefits are to notch. good work place culture"

good,I loved Costco and my time there. I still recommend it to anyone that asks. It was fast paced but exciting. The benefits and compensation cannot be topped by any other business in the industry; in my opinion.
good,customers were awesome. clean workplace very fast paced. staff very friendly and helpful. willing to work around my other work schedule which was a huge help
good,"I've held a position as a front end assistant at Costco for close to 4 years. I was brought in as a seasonal worker but was kept on in their CSRP program that they offer to students. This program allowed me to choose the dates I wanted to work while I was in school, and work when I wanted during semester breaks. The environment is very fast-paced and shifts seem to fly by as a result. Tasks can include packing member orders, cashier, buggy pushing, returning items to their proper shelving, clothes folding, and general cleanup duties."
good,Great benefits.  Sometimes hard to get full time hours but overall a great job.  Many options of areas to work in and are willing to work with you if you move.

good,"I had a nice time at Costco, the other workers where kind and helpful. The manager was great and was there if we needed them. It did not worry me if there was a lot of customers because others would come and help out."
good,"Shifts starts at 4:30 in the morning. Immediately decide what needs to be stocked. A typical day is stocking 20 pallets minimum. I learned how to merchandise and how to get products to sell faster. I learned how to manage my time accordingly. I learned how to communicate clearly with management and members. The workplace culture is very welcoming, friendly, and there is a willingness to help others. The hardest part of the job was managing time accordingly in order to finish before the store opens. The most enjoyable part of the job was looking back on all the hard work I accomplished that day."
good,En general es una excelente empresa para laborar. El aprendizaje es continuo al igual que la capacitación además de excelentes prestaciones sin dejar a un lado el gran ambiente y equipo de trabajo.
good,Employees and employers are friendly with one another and make working at Costco enjoyable. The atmosphere is fun and makes time go by fast. Management is very flexible with employees and their concerns that they have.

Aprendí a mejorar los procesos en Mercadotecnia y mercancía de piso de venta. La dirección es muy accesible y con políticas de puertas abiertas de forma integral. "
good,"My short time at Costco I enjoyed very much, between the people who worked there and the work I actually did, it was always fun. The other workers are always willing to help you if you don't understand a part of your job, and right away I didn't feel out of place there I felt like a part of the family on day one."
good,"Love working for Costco. They take care of their employees and you be come more than coworkers but family members! Pay is good, full benefits even as a part time employee, paid holidays, vacation and sick pay."

good,I have worked at Costco since I was 18 years old and they have treated me so well! They strive to make you want to stay with the company as a career and there is always room to make advances within job titles within the warehouse.
good,I have worked there for 3 years and it has been a blast. The company culture there is phenomenal and I will be looking for companies with a similar culture to Costco's from now on.
good,"When you came on shift you checked with the supervisor to see if there were any immediate items to be made if not you proceeded to read the board and make anything needed.  The hardest part of the job was working in the cold and standing on cement.  The best part of the job was the staff we all had fun.  I learned a lot about watching the shelves and learning to make decisions that would be approved by management without having to contact anyone.  I learned how to be diverse,  one minute you were making pizzas the next you had to jump to another table and make ceasar salads because you just ran out or had to run take chickens out of the oven because there were too many for one person and there was a line up.  It was great fast paced time went by quickly."
good,Es una muy buena empresa y reconocidad internacionalmente
good,"I would still work there had I not got hurt on the job. it was very fast paces. working in the vault was very mental as i priocessed up to a million dollars a day and needed precise accuracy. Refund cashier had its challenges as at the time we had a store pilicy of return cash, and the cutiomer then had to shop and buy again. they were already upset that the item was defective. it was important to remain positive."
good,"Costco has great values, job culture, management and opportunities for advancement. They really take care of their own here. The pay is pretty good, time and a half every Sunday and if you work there long enough you can make a pretty great hourly wage. Tons of opportunity for advancement as well. The sky is the limit. Great matching 401k and other benefits."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working for Costco is the social and constant environment I work in, coworkers are open and accepting of new hires. A typical day at work consists of assisting cashiers, retrieving desired items for members, and flexibly moving to and from departments when needed, such as night stocking. The management is tentative which makes working for Costco relieving due to the amount of members we must serve at a time. The hardest part of the job would be the consistency throughout the day to attend the needs of members, some days you're required to do a lot of moving in my department leaving some strain on the body. Costco has taught me how to demonstrate excellent customer service and how to work under stressful conditions while keeping your cool and enjoying your day."

I love the management and enjoy their support in every day activities at work."
good,"Costco Wholesale is an incredible company with a great staff, both entry level and upper level employees. The work environment is often fun and fast-paced, with delightful shoppers. The benefits of the company are better than most I have worked for and it feels like the ""top dogs"" truly care about their employees."
good,"I loved working at Costco. People, work, and benefits were well worth it. The only thing I didn't like was the random scheduling. and lower wage to start, also the lack of work area I had to do projects."
good,Everything about the place was great while I worked there. The other employees were helpful and kind. The only bad thing about the job was that I was a seasonal employee and only worked during the busiest time of the year. It is a great job though!

good,"Within the Costco warehouse, all the employees are extremely friendly. Everyone looks out for one another, which is fantastic since it is still a retail environment."
good,It gets real busy especially during the holidays. I worked in the food court and mostly expedited in the pick-up line. I learned to work with my peers and also learn to work independent. The managers were very professional and really helpful when I asked questions. It was exciting to learn how to make the variety of foods such as pizza or chicken bakes.
good,"Very great job security. And great pay. It's a very great place to use a vast amount of skills you may have, or get to learn from working here."
good,"During the Holidays, Costco always hires seasonal employees and I was one of those hires for the 2014 holiday season.  This was a part-time job that was early mornings and would always allow me to work an extra three hours a day to meet the regular forty hour work week.  If it wasn't for my decision to go back to school, Costco is a great company with many opportunities to grow within."
good,"its a great place to work great people and great product and great environment it just needs to be easier to get on there  management is good and you learn soo much in a short time ,, its not cut out for everyone the hardest part is making sure u did everything upon closing"

good,"The people I worked with and the atmosphere was productive and enjoyable.

good,"A typical work day for me and Costco consist of multi-tasking. I am always pulled from one department to another. I am skillfully cross trained to help wherever I am needed. Saturday is our busiest day of the week. I first start off supervising the front end of the Warehouse, then work my way to being more hands on. Costco is a great, family oriented environment. Working at Costco, I have learned how to adapt to change at any given moment. Change in my department, change in my schedule, as well as my change in managers. It has elevated me and pushed me to higher heights. The hardest part about working in ANY retail job is maintaining balance. You must learn how to time everything to get everything done in a timely manner. Having people who are behind you 100 percent is what makes it all easy and well worth it"
good,I would have to say that Costco was my very best job experience. its one place I regret leaving and really hope to find my way back there some day. I learned a great deal about stocking as well as maintaining a wonderful environment for members to shop in.
good,Ive been an employee of Costco Wholesale for almost four years now. My overall experience working at Costco has been nothing but pleasant.
good,A typical day working for Costco comp. is quit quick and very much a very fast past job. I most definitely learned a lot on more bakery things and storage.My managers and co workers were great to work with and are all helpful in any inquiries I would have.
good,"A typical day would include handling cash, packing buggies and upgrading memberships, I learned about merchandising and various new promotions. Management was always helpful in assisting with customers needs and expectations, my co-workers were always fun and very positive people to work with. The hardest part of the job was the fact that there was no room for advancement, the most enjoyable part of the job was the smiling faces of my wonderful customers and coworkers."

good,"Lo mas difícil ha sido la distancia, la empresa esta muy lejos de mi domicilio."

good,"-Great working atmosphere."
good,Working in the bakery was fun and I learned a lot. My co-workers as well as supervisors were very pleasant.
good,"I wanted to move to IT, but there were not suitable and available positions for my education level."
good,"A lot of hours, great pay and benefits, management is great! and had a lot of fun!"
good,Fast paced work with always extraordinary member service in mind.
good,I loved going to work and knowing I was going to be kept busy.  All the employees are willing to share their knowledge and help you in any way.  The hardest part of it all is you are given a task and are told how to accomplish it but then told you did it wrong and keep getting told it is done in different ways.
good,"Morning Merchandising is a very physically demanding position in the warehouse. It requires 5 hours of heavy lifting and transporting pallets of product. The actual stocking portion of the position is quite enjoyable for the sense of being able to take pride in the amount of work done. "
good,i would clean the bakery and push carts. sometimes i would help out at the customer service desk with returns. It was my first job so i basically learned everything about a job that can be learned from your first job. i loved the people i worked with. the hardest part was going into the big freezers to get food out. it was a very easy job and i got paid very well
good,was a costumer service advertiser for the floor. had to sell product to people coming into the store.
good,"I loved my job, the people I got work with and the members whom we interacted with everyday. I really enjoyed getting to know the regulars and offering my take on what they were purchasing."
good,"A builing that has so many functions as well as some many different jobs, Can never get bored there"
good,This company does a great job of making employees feel valued and enforcing a healthy business model. One in which customers and employees enjoy a positive attitude due to the welcoming nature the management treats its customers and employees.
good,I loved working at Costco for all the right reasons the workers there were all nice and the way it was run was outstanding. I unfortunately wasn't able to stay due to conflict of interest but i have nothing against that company.
good,"My job title at Costco is Merchandiser. A typical day for me is unloading the truck and stocking the merchandise. Each employee is giving a certain section in the warehouse to call their own. Mine is the front section near the checklanes which is our candy and snack area. Besides that my sections are the first two aisles of food which contain cookies and crackers. Also the back wall of food which includes gum and other candy such as M7Ms and skittles. My job is to keep these areas full, while rotating dates to ensure freshness of the product, first in first out. While moving product around the department to keep a feeling of a new and exciting environment. transferring pallets of products that are on sale or advertised to the end-caps of the aisle to ensure visibility. Then helping out in other departments as needed once my department is clean, stocked, and merchandised."
good,I love being a cashier here but barely get to do it because it all goes by seniority. This place is very busy and you have to move quick and even be able to run around the store. Throughout the day I go from sales to pushing carts to cashiering to go backs. You get to try out everything. The people there believe school is very important and work with any school schedule.
good,"Saturday and Sundays are bad but time flies. For the starting pay and the constant raises its well worth the money. Basically its packing members items into boxes, and providing excellent customer service."
good,"Typical day at work consists of being timely, working fast, efficient, and safe. Strong emphasis on member service. Other than that, it is extremely numbers driven. Upgrades, sales, speed, accuracy, keeping track of items/product. An employee who pays attention to detail is an ideal fit for working at Costco. Hardest part of the job is stocking at night but that is also the most enjoyable."
good,"great unity  between all staff positions, nice store awesome benefits"
good,Depends on the Department. Its a happy work enviroment. Costco puts its members and employees first.
good,A typical day varied from day-to-day. Wrapped and rotated bakery goods and assisted customers on orders. I loved learning the bakery equipment and I did learn some. Sometimes I would help with the cake decorating if the staff was low on that day. Management and co-workers worked together as team players. We all helped each other out to get the task done which made it more pleasurable. The only difficult part of the job would be around the holidays when we had to produce more products to push out for the customers but it was a fun and fast-paced challenge. 
good,"Costco Wholesale was my first Job, this Job made me learn how to be responsible, and taught me that if you work hard you can get anywhere in life."
good,"Customer Service is high priority. Management was awesome, co-workers were nice, hardest part of job was cleaning public restrooms, i enjoyed the kind people that i encountered in store."
good,"I began at costco as a cashier and moved into a maintenance position to gain a permanent position, my position allows me a lot of freedom and a lot of work that can be challenging and fun. I work in a very small department and communication within our department is very important, we all get along very well. Our hours vary and can start as early as 5am and go to 11pm."
good,"I think Costco is a great company to work for. It has great salary and benefits. The employees are productive and very courteous to members. Great job for a student in college. Flexible hours and always honor college retention students. The hardest part of the job is the physical aspect such as lifting, moving items around consistently,and fast pace if thats not your ability. Personally i dont mind it at all. The most enjoyable part of the job are the members. Members can really brighten your day. I have definitely learn how to multi-task, manage, and work with a variety of individuals. It's a very great company to be part of."
good,Arrive at work and be prepared to work. Always depend on your self and enjoy it. Really enjoyed working with co-workers and helping out all the different people that walked through the doors.
good,Management is very outgoing easy to get along with. Employee's are happy and eager to work everyday with great benefits and excellent pay as you progress within the company. When needed help finding something that moved someone is always on the walkie helping you find it. Employees are easy to get along side to help in difficult situations that may occur throughout store hours.
good,The best company I've worked for so far! I've never been so motivated to go to work everyday and complete personal goals that I set for myself to advance in the company.
good,I quickly became a food court supervisor.
good,"Sign in on computer, go grab scanners in the back of the warehouse then report to your area with coworkers. The computers print out orders of items other companies need and we go out and pick those items and place the items on wood pallets that we carry around on our electic pallet jacks. When we are done we load the pallets onto the delivery trucks in the back of the warehouse and continue on to the next order that needs to be filled out. You get a 10 minute break then a 30 minute lunch then another 10 minute break throughout the night. When all the work is done we have the choice to sign out and go home or stay and stock new items that come into the receiving."
good,"At Costco, you are treated as a person and given the same attention that our members receive from all of its associates."
good,You will work in all departments as needed regardless of the department your assigned. Team work is essential to work at Costco's and there is plenty of overtime if they are ever short staffed.
good,"Costco is basically a large family. We work together closely as a team to bring superior customer service and quick efficient results to our members. A typical day for me can vary from cashiering, cashier assisting, overseeing the member service counter, helping with returns and exchanges, stocking merchandise or helping in our various departments as needed. I enjoy helping members and meeting/ culturing on going relationships with some of our regular shoppers. Costco employees and management are close-knit. Employees regularly enjoy hanging out after work. Costco has really improved my work ethic, my ability to work with large crowds and work efficiently and quickly while multitasking."
good,Costco is a very good job to work at. You have great pay and good benefits. I would recommend Costco to anyone esp if it's your first job because ppl make careers outta Costco. This wearhouse/store is always busy so be ready to be on your feet for long periods of time. Running through out the store is a normal thing each day and you learn a lot about having respect for the company you work for and the employees and the mgn. It's hard to come by a good job like this one.
good,"Everyday at Costco you learn something new, good and productive. The managment is very focused on achieving the productive goals of the company."
good,Very demanding job. Learned a-lot about portion control and food prep. My co-workers at this particular branch were team-workers. My manager was not afraid to get his hands dirty and I have a-lot of respect for that. Westbury happens to be one of the busiest Costcos. The customers could be very impatient at times and you had to be able to deal with irrate New Yorkers! Laughing with the customers and my co-workers while getting the job done was the most enjoyable part of this job.
good,Managed 40 plus employees and any given moment. Moved up rapidly within the company. Responsible for multiple departments and its employees. Challenging environment and fast paced.
good,I have advanced with the company in a relatively short period of time. If you are a smart and hard worker and are open to new ideas and have the ability to transfer to other warehouses in order to advance with the company this is for you. I was part time for three years waiting for my opportunity to get into a warehouse where there was movement and management positions available. I finally got that opportunity in 2005 and less than two years later I was promoted to a senior management position. I am currently an Assistant General Manager and I can appreciate each position that I have held considering I have gained a wealth of knowledge with each position.
good,"Excellent training, benefits, and work environment. Best wage and benefit package of any retail company. Promote from within 95% so excellent room for advancement and growth within the company, whether at an individual location, regional office, or home office."

good,"Great work atmosphere, attentive management and supervising, break room games and food, caring employees, great pay and benefits (dental, health, eye, 401k, etc.) Typical work day is 8hrs, no overtime allowed, but during seasonal and busy weeks theres always somewhere to pick up hours. You can be trained to work at food court, deli, front end, night merch, or meat department. Company cares about employees and has regular events and recognitions that bring people together. Work is efficient and easy to perform if on task. Flexible hours are available for students."
good,Loved working there just wish they had more full time positions available to be able to apply within company. Was able to move around to different departments and was cross trained.

good,"As a stocker, you'd start your day right away at 4:30am and stock the store before they opened. Worked during the holidays so there were much more objectives to be completed before the store opened. Learned how the retail world worked. Had to accustom to fast paced working environments since the deadline of stocking was at time of opening hours. Hardest part of the job for me was learning the right way of doing things as a stocker since Costco is a very neat, close to perfection of a retail warehouse and that is why they are very successful. Enjoyable part of the job was the sense of urgency you felt to get the job done because everyone was on the same page of getting the job done and everyone worked as a team and that's what made the objective complete every morning."

good,Costco is busy every day all day but because you feel valued as an employee and you know that no other job in retail will give you what Costco gives you the employees work hard.  The hardest part of the job is you have to start as a part time employee which is difficult if you really need the money.  Pretty much you stay part time until a full time position opens up.  I was offered another position elsewhere full time and because I needed the money and hours I left Costco.  I would go back if I could though.

good,"I do a number of things at Costco as a receiving clerk. I coordinate with all departments in the building regarding their hazardous waste.  I key out their damage and destroy products to ensure inventory accuracy. As a receiving clerk I work as a RTC (return to center) I ship out product to our depot distribution center in Livermore.  All products from good, damage, defective, I handle over thousands of dollars worth of products on a daily.  I key out destroyed products, manage hazmat, shipping/receiving, member service, merchandising and stocking.  The most challenging part about my work is probably prioritizing my workload.  When my shift begins there are a number of things that needs attention and sometimes can be overwhelming, but I feel I gain great experience working in high pace environment, staying focus while maintaining accuracy and being efficient.  I think the best part about my job is working with members and my coworkers.  I'm definitely a people person and take pleasure in helping our members. I get along very well with my coworkers, we all work really well together which makes it more enjoyable workplace.  The work culture there is great, although it gets hectic and stressful at times we all manage it very well and get through it together as a team."

good,This was a very simple job that is perfect for the young adult in college. I learned a lot about how a business is run.

I had fun with the customers when the store opened and was given all types of experience in all departments of the store.

good,"i have learned a lot about the food industry "
good,From day one at Costco you are given the tools to complete your job successfully. The management was afraid or harsh about communicating their expectation of you.

good,I enjoyed the team I worked with and all the help that was made available to me. I specifically liked that you were placed where you were needed because I had such a huge opportunity to learn different things and not become bored.

You are very taken care of and Costco really does care about their employees. Ive also never met a ceo with such a kind spirit.

Management can be a fun part of the job if you are properly trained for it. Workplace culture grooms family values within.

Most enjoyable part of the job would be your fellow employees whom you make a life long relationship with from the celebrating birthdays to birth of children to knowing their families on a personal level."

good,"Working at Costco taught me how to provide excellent Customer Service at a Fast and efficient Pace! I would’ve loved to stay, but my time was cut short because It was a seasonal position and they’ve hired too many people. I was only 18 years old and kind of shy when I Started, but looking back at it, I regret not being more outspoken! From my supervisor’s Review I Worked really hard, But I was just too shy."
good,"I loved working for this company. If I could do it all again I wouldn’t have left. Although it is quick paced, the work I broken up and shared. The staff are friendly, and management is supportive"

good,"I worked as a seasonal employee over the winter holiday and it was very fast-paced, but I loved it. Competence and hard work are acknowledged and appreciated and all of my coworkers were friendly. Best job I've ever had."
good,"Very fast paced, no standing around, if you are able to get into this place, do it. hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with front end, once you learn it, it becomes much easier."
good,Great first job... Now they start you at $15/hr and the benefits are amazing. Would recommend people to work for Costco. Great people to work around with met a lot of new people .
good,Getting to work at 2am and getting out at 7am was not the most ideal situation as a work schedule considering the fact that I was taking a summer class at the time. I learned the basics of stocking and got faster the more I worked there. I enjoyed doing my own thing. Working in a fast paced environment made time fly. My coworkers for the most part were great with the exception of one.
good,Costco is a great job but you must have a full availability to really get the job. They want reliable people and good spirited people. It does get stressful sometime but when you get paid higher than most jobs and get benefits as a part time employee you know why.
good,"Excelente empresa para impulsar tu carrera, el ambiente laboral es el mejor y la empresa busca que te sientas a gusto."

good,"Typical day was to get everything organized for the day, prep area for work. make everything is sanitary.  management was excellent and understanding. Hardest part of the job is the amount of food that goes to waste. I made many friends at Costo which made it enjoyable to go to work."
good,"i loved to worked by this great company,but i have a son that requires my night attention and they only offers me a night shift.I will love to have the opportunity to find a job that have morning shifts."
good,"Costco is an enjoyable place to work and the management structure is well-thought out. Every day is fast-paced and exciting, with opportunities for training and versatility (although you sometimes have to seek these out). The benefits of Costco are above and beyond, and the starting pay is always above minimum wage, even for minimum wage tasks. Great place to work!"

The hardest thing were the benchmark numbers sometimes you would just have one bad day and that could throw off your entire week. Overall great company great people great management!"
good,I worked at Costco for a year and loved it. Started out pushing carts and then transferred to the tire department.  It’s a great place to work. Great work environment and easy to move and learn new departments!
good,"Loved working at Costco, my position was seasonal but would like to get a permanent position and grow with the company. A man tried to steal the returns cash register the first day I was there and all of the staff members handled the emergency well, luckily there were off duty cops in line that handled the situation until the uniform police showed up. Seems to be plenty of growth potential with the company if someone wants to grow and advance."
good,"Costco really cares about their employees. It really does feel like family. While my last manager was one of the worst people I have ever met. The rest of the management I ever had there, including regionals, were incredible."

good,"Great coworkers, great management, food at the food court is a nice touch. Always lot of excitement at the store even before we open. Sam Hitt was great to work for. Led by example and was always fair and kind."
good,I loved working there it was such awesome job amazing people all the time. If you work morning shift you start at 430 or 500 finish at 1230 or 1. Morning are always busy now if you work at 230 to 1100 is going be busy Nono stop.
good,"You'll never be bored, the employees there are helpful. For front end assistant, I would say they can have a set a routine for who is going to cover for you once you clocked instead of waiting around trying to figure out who you going to cover for especially when it gets busy and IT GETS BUSY."
good,I came to Costco in 2013 after working at Jewel for 9 years.  My pay started at over $15/hr then 4 years later I'm making over $25/hr. They have almost yearly cost of living raises for all employees usually about $0.75 then there are raises for every 1000 hours worked which is about everu 6 months. Then they have bonuses for employees who have worked 12000 hours which ranges from 1000 to 3500 twice a year deoending on hours worked abd seniority.Their insurance benefits are awesome medications are generally $3 and doctor copays $15. During nursing school they were very accomadating with my work schedule and even after I had children they were very accommodating with my schedule. For students they have something called limited part time so when students are away to college they still have a job when they come back. In the winter months January through March there is something called winter leave where employees can adjust their schedules or take time off for up to 4 weeks without pay and it wouldn't affect their benefits or work status. There is plenty of opportunities to grow if you put forth the effort. My husband went from a stocker to a department manager in less than 5 years. I could go on about how much I love this company.
good,I had no issues at all with the Costco Concierge Service.  The team leads were good and the atmosphere was calm.  I most appreciated their rules on transfering to a supervisor.
good,"Even tho I worked only seasonal, it was a great experience and hours where flexible. Management and staff where on point and very friendly with other staff members as well as the customers."
good,"CostCo is a fast paced environment with honest management.  "

good,"I love Everything about Costco. The people, benefits, flexibility, and just a great place to be at work. Great management, and every person they put me with got along great together. Always helped each other out."
good,"Muy buena cultura empresarial, excelente capacitacion,"
good,"I loved working at Costco! One of my favorite jobs with incredible people. The San Bernadino warehouse, I believe is the best because they care about their employees schedules and work to help you out."
good,"A typical day at Costco would consist of working in a fast paced environment and assisting our members in anyway possible.  From helping members find the right item to keeping the store clean.  Always on your feet and ready to help our members whether it means lifting heavy objects into the back of their cars to even unloading return items.  What I have learned from Costco is the ability to enhance one's customer service skills to the next level.  Becoming independent helped a lot on the job because it taught me to not always have to rely on management and coworkers.  Working here has also advanced my speech.  As for management, they are constantly finding ways to improve productivity and safety.  For example, one of the managers created a useful tool to help workers push a minimum of 10 grocery baskets which also included an emergency brake.  The hardest part of the job would have to be on your toes for such a long period of time.  However, the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to enjoy the company of both your coworkers and work in a friendly environment."
good,Excelente empresa hay crecimiento hay estabilidad laboral
good,Costco offers many benefits to its employees with competitive pay Being a Costco employee is very satisfying and worth all the hours you put in!

good,"Management very caring and helpful in teaching tasks, coworkers are happy to help. Learnt a lot in my department, but managers from other companies were happy to cross-train."
good,If you are looking to supplement your income it is a great part-time job. You receive regular raises based on the number of hours you work. Time-off is generous!
good,"Learned many things that will benefit me in life. I came in write my code, do research if required then I would get weekly code reviews and sync up."
good,I was a seasonal position but I was encouraged to try for a permanent position.  I was primarily placed in positions where my past skill set was utilized

good,excellent place to work at. good pay. good hours. management is good. very fast paced but makes the day go by faster. overall a very good job and I'd highly recommend
good,"the job is good for a entry level position, the starting pay is on average with the industry.  one you get some time under your belt then the pay jumps.  if you can work 40+ hours a week you can average a raise every 6 months.  until you top out in pay, at which point you will receive a bonus every 6 months."
good,Good company and excellent benefits. Staff is very welcoming and helpful. The company also keeps us informed of any changes. The workplace culture is a variety of cultures. Supervisors are very respectful and friendly.
good,my manager and crew members are great with awesome teamwork. Give me a constant time period to work and when they are busy should have to help Front End. That quite hard.

good,"It took about a year or so before I fell in love with the culture within Costco. I worked in both the Depot and the Warehouse. While the Depot has much better hours, the warehouse offered a diversity in every day duties if you like doing a lot of different things to break up your work week. If I didn't leave Costco to follow my dreams, I would defenatly still be there."
good,"Hands down the best job I've ever had. Loved the work, loved the people, loved the opportunities. I was sad to leave but had to for my Bachelor's degrees. Cannot recommend this company enough."
good,"Great place to work, really good pay. Great opportunity to move up or relocate. Good hours sometimes lenient  with schedule. Good supervisor and leads"

good,"Las jornadas laborales eran cortas, aprendí a brindar un buen servicio a los socios."
good,"I only worked at Costco as seasonal but it was a great company to work for and I learned a lot. You clock in with your employee badge everyday and check in with the supervisor on hand and then they assign you to go somewhere that your trained in. You get a 15 minute paid break every 2 hours and an unpaid  30 minute lunch break depending on how long our shift is. It was a good job with an awesome break room for the employees, I am only seasonal so I don't get any benefits but if you do get hired on the benefits are really great and you get paid well. The supervisors and managers are always super nice and willing to answer any questions you ever have. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to talk to different people through out the day and helping them to have a better day and it feels good when they smile or laugh at something you said and when your able to help them. The hardest part is keeping boxes stocked as members use them often but  the supervisors help with that as well so it makes it easier."

good,"Very professional work place/company, typical day at work for the tire center was answering calls and dealing with a customers questions on pricing and size for their vehicle. Stacking tires and organizing stock. Taking in customers vehicles for tire repair, rotation, new set of tires or a re balancing. Making sure their vehicle gets treated with care and respect and paper work is complete. Costco Tire center is where I learned my customer care skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with amazing co workers, because Costco is such a big company they take care of their own and that's why everyone one that works at Costco is always a happy and nice individual."

good,"Got some good skills ., learned how to keep a job for a long time ., wish I would have stayed and topped out but I was so frustrated that I would over exert myself everyday by choice to get my aisles stocked out and faced up ., again it’s a team job and they don’t expect 2 stockers or even 3 sometimes to get the 4-5 aisles done in 5 hours . No way to determine an ELS for what is dropped ., what is going to be dropped , how many boxes need to be condensed and pulled , or how many partials are on each side etc . Now a days i am on the ELS but would have should have could have . There’s a reason why grocery distribution caps out faster and about at the same pay as Costco ., Ling story short ., the distribution is cut-throat . You don’t meet quotas then trucks don’t make it onto the road ."

In one day, I was pulling about 16 carts ( a couple hundred pounds ) and walking about 16 miles with those carts over a 7 hour period. It was exhausting but, I loved it.

good,People were amazing to work with and the shifts were flexible to work. Able to pick up shifts or switch shifts if something out of your hands happened.
good,The only reason I left Costco was so that I could go into a different field. They paid decent (for the job) had excellent benefits even for partners and had great managers.

good,The work environment is fast-paced and interactions with the Costco members/patients are enjoyable. The staff is very friendly and approachable. I've learned a lot during my rotation.
good,A day at work would be helping the cashier put the groceries  back in the cart cleaning up the store and putting items back on the floor. I learned that that when you clock out late  or clock out late on your break you have to sign this book that's in the hr office. Management is really nice to all their employees they treat us really well there. The workplace culture is you'll never be bored they'll always have something for us to do. the most hardest part of the job is lifting heavy objects when doing putting items back on the floor like the flooring and dog food and most definitely the water. the most enjoyable part of my job is the people I get to work with or the people I get to see. I see a lot of people I know.
good,Really good company to work for. Great benefits. They take care of their employers. They work with your schedule when you are in school. They work with you when an emergency has come up.

good,"- Cash handling and product handling"

good,"Like no other This job was the most fast paced environment I have ever encountered. I worked in the membership dept and assisted in all other areas as needed. Great people great benefits, but they went thru managers life crazy."
good,"Costco in my opinion is a great company to work for; mainly because there is never a dull moment when I am working there because there is always something to do at all times. For example, taking unwanted items from customers back where they belong, organizing buggies, helping out produce if needed, collecting all the empty boxes. Secondly, Costco is also a great company to work for knowing that they provide a program from students called the CSRP program which basically allows individuals who are going to school only work weekends, giving them the rest of the week to completely focus on school. Lastly, is Costco provides premium pay on Saturdays and Sundays and provides a lot of benefits and increases the wage as individuals go up the hierarchy."
good,Good I love working with them there pretty good job I recommend anyone to work there.You will learn everything you need to no there with a lot of training on site

good,"The type of work here requires you to be in shape, due to the fact that their products are bulk sizes and heavier than the normal grocery store. They really care about their employees and make an effort to show them that. The advancement options are unlimited. Must have good member service."

Costco always had many friendly customers walking in and out. As an Employee for Costco it was always our job to welcome customers in with a kind smile and warm heart. Management was always very important in every department because constantly employees would work around moving machines on the floor.

The Most Enjoyable experience I had working for Costco is meeting different friendly faces everyday and having the pleasure to exceed excellent Customer Service."

good,"The food court is one of the toughest places to work in the store.  It's generally not a money making section of the store, but very fast paced, with a very limited amount of hours allowed for employees, so typically ran short-staffed; causing high tension, among co-workers, and customers"

good,"A typical day at Costco for me is working with members by answering any questions they might have about promotions, sales, product information, and where merchandise might be placed. I respect privacy laws and maintain customer confidentiality at all times. I work well with my team members and supervisors by using my leadership and communication skills.  The hardest part of my job is working on returns. Working on returns can be difficult and frustrating sometimes because there will be hot chicken on top of clothing or cold cheese or milk sitting out spoiling. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with people and being able to answer their questions and give them assistance when needed."

good,We would show up at 4 am stretch and figure out if any new product for our department was coming in. We would make a list for what was needed for the day. Give the list to the forklift driver have them drop what we needed. We then would stock the product and have everything ready by 9:45 when we opened. After opening I would either cashier or assist or push carts. I was one of the people that fellow employees would come to and ask where a product should go or my opinion on certain ideas. I was trained to drive the forklifts so I would assist in dropping product out of the steel when needed. I enjoy doing my job figuring out what should go where if a certain product fits in the area it is going in.

good,"Enjoyable to work at, all fellow employees were very nice and cordial. I found the work enjoyable and easy to do. I would have enjoyed staying longer but it was only a seasonal position I was hired for. After I was laid off, I went to work somewhere closer to home and enjoyed the job very much. However then my previous employer called to hire me back and I felt guilty about giving notice so soon after being hired and had to I declined. I would have really liked to stay at that seasonal job permanently."
good,Very fast environment. every day is a busy day. the customers always come first and you try to accommodate them at every moment. people are well trained .
good,Lots of room to advance within company.  Friendly people.  Team environment.  Good benefits for employees.  Treats contractors as part of the team.  I really enjoyed working there and would go back.

good,"Costco is an excellent company to work for.  The company treats it's employees very well and has a substantial health benefits plan.  Unfortunately, the company does not pay it's employees what they deserve or according to the cost of living in a particular region.  Also, stock options are only available to upper management."
good,"Treated employees with respect and quick to resolve issues within the work place."
good,It was a great place to work. People where very professional and kept a up beat vibes throughout the work place. I enjoy what’s we did day in and day out to make customers happy and comfortable.
good,i loved working for costco they were very flexible when i started off and were all the way through even with the birth of my son and having difficulties with family at home

good,"A typical day working as a front end assistant was to assist customers by packaging there items in their cart, and also pushing carts outside. The culture is just like any other work place. Some people you will find chemistry with, others you will avoid. Other than that, it's a great company to work for. When it comes to management it's a dice roll, just like any other organization. I saw a lot of employees leave Boca Raton's Costco due to their 2016 warehouse manager."
good,"I love working at Costco. They really do care about their employees, their members, & the quality, cleanliness, & safety of the warehouses & work environment."

The pay sufficed for the work being done and you receive raises by simply working the allotted hours until you reach the minimum hours for a 50 cents raise.

good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was break, every 2 hours  they gave you 15 minutes to relax because you work at such a fast and stressful pace. They care about their employees and you also get a 30 minute lunch. Management is great because they care and they try to push you to your very best and they see how hard each employee works. They also have great benefits."

good,At Costco every one treats you like family. We are one big family. I was nervous my first day working there but the cashiers were all very friendly including the management. They made me feel as if I had been working there for a long time already. If I did something wrong someone was right there to tell me how to fix it. The employees are what make Costco such a great place to work and shop.

The employees were an absolute pleasure to work with and were very helpful along the way, the managers and supervisors were always understanding to not only employees, but also members, and corporate always looked out for us every year.  The hardest part of the job was getting acquainted to new departments and positions, but the most enjoyable part about it was growing into that position and others watching you become a great, flexible employee. I will always love Costco and I am very grateful to them for all that they have done for me."

good,Best retail job available. Loved it. Productive environment and cheap food court for breaks and lunch. Foosball table and big open break room. Wish i could work there again.
good,"Working at Costco was an awesome experience, you get there in the morning and greeted by your co-workers. Everybody seemed to just be cheerful just cause everyone enjoyed working with each other for the most part. Management always made sure that their workers were taken care of and ready for the day. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the customers, making sure that the shelves are stocked and the lines are flowing good. The most enjoyable times during the work day was just working around good people."
good,"Costco is a great company to work for! They take really good care of their employees by offering an excellent benefits package and continuous opportunities for promotions and raises. I found that many of their employees started their career here as seasonal holiday employees. This is how I started there and I am looking forward to possibly receiving a job offer when they start hiring for permanent positions in the spring! Working here is physically demanding, which is an aspect that I really enjoyed to help me to reach my personal fitness goals."

good,"The most enjoyable part of working for Costco were the people. Most people were super friendly but others taught me patience, because although we got really busy there were some people who just couldn't be nice. But other than that, it was the interaction between employee and customer that was enjoyable."

good,"Working at Costco is a very high energy job with a lot of performance in what you are doing.  The day goes by extremely fast and the people you work with and the customers are the best part of the job.  The really hard part was the last day I worked there.  I think that Costco employee's are a little spoiled cause they have 2 break rooms, one upstairs and one down.  They have a big screen TV, many tables, sofas and chairs for their lunches and breaks to enjoy with huge refrigerators to put their lunches.  I have never worked for a company where the employees had so much to enjoy."
good,"I worked seasonally at costco wholesale in waterbury, The staff was very kind to everyone, and everyone seemed to get along. There were very few slackers, and everyone in the community seemed to pitch in. The management also treated everyone with respect, and they communicated well with the staff."

good,Ambiance dynamique où la rapidité et l'efficacité sont de mise!
good,I’ve worked at Costco since February 2015. I started off in a non union warehouse then moved to union and I love it. Costco is an amazing company especially for people right out of high school like I was. There are always opportunities to move up in the company. They typically hire within and have job postings in the break room. You get paid over minimum wage (start at 13.00$) and get time and a half on Sundays (starts at 19.50$). The management are very good people. They always take care of us (employee BBQ’s etc).
good,Check logs for incoming daily products. Organize staff schedule. Complete order and receiving data. Make complete inventory safety checks.Check with each cashier to make sure cash is correct. Fill in with all aspects of costco team members when needed
good,"Would totally recommended working here to anyone, the best managers ive worked with and great pay but they expect only the best from every employee. worth it"
good,"Work starts by putting on a coat and hairnet for health and safety reasons when entering the meat room.  Afterwords I will most likely be informed of what needs to be on shelf and how much.  A good portion of the work is storing such items in a temperature that will help the product keep it's storage life and then bringing it out on display once the items on display are dwindling."
good,"There are several reasons why I believe Costco is a great company to work for. They try their best to have enough staff, always plenty of Technicians and Pharmacists to get all prescriptions filled and to be able to provide excellent customer service."
good,"amazing experience which ia proudly remember that,,i have learn a lot from costco and i will go back for sure because the job security is so imortant to me."
good,The Costco culture is a refreshing place to experience.  The collaboration and sharing of resources for the overall betterment of the company that then impacts the customers is palpable.

good,"It’s fantastic work for this company it was a wonderul experience, I learned a lote things and everybody is nice and friendly. It’s a excellent   job."
good,I got paid to basically work-out doing heavy lifting in the bakery. It was awesome. I wish i never quit. My coworkers were my family. My manager encouraged me to work hard and grow as a person. The warehouse manager ensured we were trained well and knew what was going on in the business. Once a month they would review financials and goals with staff. The ceo shook my hand and thanked me for working at Costco. He shook everyones hand and was so kind and down to earth.
good,"Costco will always be a family oriented company and I received a very good support form all my managers. Well driven and ery well managed. Encourages for being committed, trust and for being loyal."
good,"Fun work environment at Costco.  Younger group of people working there, but there is also a diverse group of people working there which makes it fun.  Low stress."
good,"One of the few companies that creates a good work environment for employees. Great pay, great benefits!"
good,"You really just have to be punctual and be willing to work. I loved working there, it was a great experience, but Costco became my life. There is always work to do there."
